She is effectively responsible for the management of five pension funds with a total value of €3.6bn  according to PensioPlus.“Thanks to PensioPlus for its confidence ” she said. “Together with the board of directors  we will continue to work on strengthening the supplementary pension system in Belgium and professionalising all those involved in the sector.”New VC duoTwo new vice presidents have also been elected: Ellen De Laender and Jan De Smet.De Laender joined the board of PensioPlus in 2019 as a representative of the Euroclear pension fund  a pan-European pension fund with around €320m in assets under management.De Semt is CEO of the pension fund for blue collar workers in the metal industry in Belgium  which with about 270 000 members and an invested capital of about €18bn is one of the largest pension funds in the country.Barbara Deroose  managing director of the Pensio B pension fund  the scheme for the construction sector  has stepped down as vice president of PensioPlus but remains on the board and will continue to participate in the further development of sectoral pension funds  PensioPlus said.Read the digital edition of IPE’s latest magazine,neutral,0.04,0.8,0.16,mixed,0.65,0.12,0.23,True,English,"['Belgian pension fund association', 'new chair', 'Neyt', 'former Belgacom/Proximus pension fund', 'Pensio B pension fund', 'European pension funds directives', 'Two new vice presidents', 'Belgian pension fund association', 'Euroclear pension fund', 'pan-European pension fund', 'employee benefits manager', 'chief executive officer', 'five pension funds', 'supplementary pension system', 'New VC duo', 'blue collar workers', 'largest pension funds', 'sectoral pension funds', 'Jan De Smet', 'last nine years', 'professional advocacy organisation', 'collective €100bn assets', 'Ellen De Laender', 'Engie Management Company', 'Brigitte Bocqué Neyt', 'pension schemes', 'new president', 'De Semt', 'ENGIE Group', 'Philip Neyt', 'independent director', 'first countries', 'Contassur SA', 'Contassur Assistance-Conseil', 'total value', 'metal industry', 'Barbara Deroose', 'managing director', 'digital edition', 'latest magazine', 'electricity sector', 'construction sector', 'management committee', 'pole position', 'permanent representative', 'board meeting', '15 years', 'chair', 'announcement', 'PensioPlus', 'period', 'Institutions', 'Pensions', 'role', 'mandate', 'governance', 'rotation', 'statement', 'contribution', 'lot', 'development', 'Belgium', 'location', 'IORP', 'aim', 'Incoming', 'Tractebel', 'subsidiary', 'companies', 'gas', 'confidence', 'directors', 'CEO', '270,000 members', 'capital', 'country', 'further', 'IPE']",2022-05-14,2022-05-14,ipe.com

4829,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://spacinsider.com/2022/05/13/top-3-spac-targets-discretionary-spending/,Top 3 SPAC Targets - Discretionary Spending,1 day ago,SPACInsider contributors Anthony Sozzi and Sam Beattie this week compiled their three favorite potential SPAC targets among companies gaining a boost from post-pandemic leisure spending. We look at why they are compelling and why each could be a fit for a blank-check merger.Trading in the market has clearly been driven by fear of rates and inflation to start off 2022. But despite recent headlines  there is still appetite for “fun” after having spent the last two years enduring a pandemic.US consumer spending on services jumped up 1.1% in March and 1.2% on goods in March. Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) meanwhile recorded its best quarter on record for direct bookings as it shifts to reclaim commerce from third party sites. But  it’s not like those sites are hurting either.Booking.com itself experienced the best quarter in gross travel bookings in its history to start the year. With the pandemic waning  consumers are launching their delayed travel plans and gorging on apparel and experiences  inflation be damned.There are concerns as to where this all leads  with much of this spending being put on credit cards. But  for now  it represents an opportunity for SPACs. As discussed on a recent episode of the SPACInsider Podcast covering ITHAX’s (NASDAQ:ITHX) pending combination with travel software company Mondee. The travel and leisure sectors are still “buy low” opportunities despite the fact the sectors’ recoveries are already in progress.United Rugby ChampionshipWith people going back to events  why not de-SPAC an entire sport? United Rugby Championship doesn’t quite encompass the entirety of professional rugby  but it is growing in a way that is reminiscent of rising sports like Endeavor (NYSE:EDR) subsidiary UFC by steadily absorbing more leagues and squads.Back in 2020  CVC Capital Partners bought a 28% stake in the business in exchange for a £120 million ($146 million) investment and the league has since expanded from 12 teams in Ireland  Great Britain and Italy to absorb four South African teams as well as the Dubai Lions.There are many more pro rugby teams that could be brought into the fold with additional capital and flexibility from a SPAC deal  but more importantly  a combination could also make for a play for US expansion.CVC Capital was previously a part of the ownership group behind Formula One (F1) racing  but sold it to Liberty Media for $4.4 billion in 2016 as a part of a strategy to Americanize the popular European racing competition. That strategy has paid off  with F1 fixtures now regularly drawing about 1 million viewers on ESPN  culminating in this past weekend’s Miami Grand Prix  which drew 85 000 spectators.Rugby is similarly a rising sport with nearly 1 billion viewers tuning into the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan  a 26% increase from the previous international tournament. So  CVC has made the pivot once before and it may be easier to make the market entry alongside a US listing.Arctos NorthStar (NYSE:ANAC) jumps off the page as a fit for more deeply engraining rugby in the US. It has an attractive IPO structure with about $316 million in trust with units bearing a ¼ warrant and it has until February 2023 to complete a deal.Its team would also be well-aligned with a transaction. It is led by CEO Theo Epstein – a long time MLB general manager – and Chairman David O’Conner  a managing partner at Arctos Sports Partners  a sports-focused private equity firm focused on providing liquidity options to ownership groups.RainFocusBusiness travel is coming back as well  but few of the companies facilitating those trips are fully set up for the new hybrid working environment.Lehi  Utah-based RainFocus is focused on maintaining marketing connections between event attendees and hosts with software tools to maintain high levels of engagement. But  this same platform is applicable for companies running in-person and virtual leisure events as well.Its software was used to hold together wine clubs through tasting series’ that went virtual and expanded to new vendors and influencers. Those same experience organizers hope to maintain that same velocity for in-person events now and have engagement tools and analytics from their pandemic work to help back them up.RainFocus also handles the payments for organizers including taking responsibility for local tax compliance and VAT across international locations. Some teams may already be familiar with the software as RainFocus clients have put it to work on roadshows and private equity bakeoffs.The company has raised $103 million in outside funding up to this point and its $60 million Series C last September was led by KKR with a focus on building out its R&D for expanding the suite. At the time  it already had plenty of velocity in its commercialization with 430% growth in hosted events over the previous 12 months with about 5 million business users and 9 million session engagements across 167 countries.PumaAs discussed before  consumer staples are going to stick around no matter what the economy does. But  what appears to be happening in early 2022 is not simply consumers buying what they need but rather splurging and upgrading the wardrobe and summer plans for the pandemic’s end.And with that  Puma (DE:PUM) may be looking to upgrade its digs as well. While plenty of sportswear and athleisure brands are listed in Europe  their US-listed counterparts tend to be better appreciated by the market. Puma currently trades at about 16x current EBITDA  while fellow Euro footwear peer Adidas (DE:ADS) trades at 11.4x.Meanwhile  their US-listed competitors Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) trade at 21.7x and 25x  respectively. At least some of this is down to company performance  of course  but the dynamics are legitimately different on the Deutsche Boerse as compared to the Nasdaq  which handles 17-times its trading volume  and the NYSE  which hosts 15.1x as much.Puma’s business is increasingly going West already  with sales in the Americas exceeding those in the EMEA region by about 15%. It grew faster to start 2022 on this side of the pond as well  with 44.1% sales growth here in Q1 as compared with 25.5% growth in EMEA and a -17% contraction in the Asia/Pacific region.There could be incentive at Puma to bring more liquidity as well. About 67% of Puma’s shares are currently free-floating  with the remainder made up by a roughly 9.8% stake held by French luxury group Kering (PA:KER) and the rest held by Kering’s own largest shareholder Groupe Artemis.Kering already sold a 5.9% stake in Puma in a private placement in May 2021 and could likely be persuaded to let go of more equity. Puma already trades hotter at 16.6x EBITDA than the wider Kering group at 9.7x  and should it receive a premium valuation and partial cash-out with a SPAC deal  this could be a value play for the company.While not quite shooting to the moon  Italian fashion group Ermenegildo Zegna (NYSE:ZGN) made the move to the US markets via SPAC in December 2021 and has been notably resilient to the current market winds  which tend to blow harder against de-SPACs.

Trust Stamp has reported several significant developments over the past quarter as we delivered growth across the business  from our targeted suite of solutions and intellectual property portfolio to our earnings and client base.This strong financial and operational performance reflects Trust Stamp’s ability to capture diversified market opportunities and grow existing commercial relationships to generate long-term revenue streams. Notably  we expanded upon an existing customer relationship within the government sector while increasing our scope of work with multiple Fortune 500 commercial clients in the financial services sector. Our technology has garnered interest across multiple government use cases in the United States and internationally  addressing pressing concerns around the privacy and security of legacy biometric implementations. Towards this end  Trust Stamp has made a significant investment in expanding our government-facing business development team and are in active discussions with several overseas governments.Story continuesWe continue to innovate through investment in research and development to expand and productize our portfolio of solutions  which has led to five patent issuances and nine new patent application filings in Q1. Trust Stamp’s core technology delivers unparalleled security  utility  and privacy  at a fraction of the cost of traditional biometric solutions  driving commercial growth as we address cross-industry needs for fraud prevention  operational efficiency  and accessibility in digital services.We are notably pleased with the launch and commercial adoption of our next-generation Biometric Multi-Factor Authentication (Biometric MFATM) offering and Identity Orchestration Platform  which transforms secure digital operations across the identity lifecycle with seamless rapid deployment of custom workflows built on our range of innovative AI-powered solutions. The low-code identity package addresses key industry and consumer requirements  including know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations  multi-factor authentication  account recovery  fraud prevention  data protection  and more.Following the launch of our end-to-end Identity Orchestration Platform  FIS  a leading financial services technology provider with over 20 000 clients  announced a partnership to leverage Trust Stamp’s biometric verification and tokenization capabilities in their global KYC solution.

Beyond internal sales initiatives  Trust Stamp is also focused on engaging channel partners with substantial distribution networks  which we believe will enable us to rapidly and cost-effectively scale the business.Trust Stamp’s commitment to innovating secure  privacy-first identity and trust verification solutions  investment in scalable infrastructure  and strengthened presence across a range of market opportunities position us to drive continued positive performance as we execute on our long-term growth strategy with a strong balance sheet  including cash on hand of $5.86 million.Building upon our work to drive market differentiation and shareholder value with a resilient and diversified business over previous years  Trust Stamp has made significant progress on executing key strategic goals in the first quarter of 2022  including uplisting to the Nasdaq Capital Market on January 31  2022. On behalf of the Trust Stamp team  I want to thank our shareholders for your continued support as we execute our mission to accelerate secure global financial and societal inclusion.”Financial Performance OverviewRevenueNet revenue increased by $2.29 million or 430.0%  to $2.82 million for Q1 2022  compared to $532 thousand for Q1 2021. This increase was primarily due to revenue contracts executed by newly acquired and existing customers.Gross ProfitGross profit increased by a notable $1.86 million or 673.9% year-over-year in the first quarter  while gross profit margin improved to 75.4% in Q1 2022  compared to 51.6% for Q1 2021. The improvement was due in part to the Company’s prior investment in research and development  which enabled the utilization of existing technologies with relatively nominal implementation costs for new deployments.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development (R&D) costs decreased by $261 thousand or 34.6% year-over-year in the first quarter. The decrease in R&D expenses in the comparison periods was driven by the Company’s continued efforts to transition software development resources towards expanding internal capabilities and away from external third-party software development.Selling  General  and Administrative ExpensesSelling  general  and administrative (SG&A) expense increased to $3.12 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.33 million for Q1 2021. The increase in SG&A expense during the period ended March 31  2022 was driven by legal and professional services fees  other fees related to the listing of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market  and internal sales commissions.Operating LossOperating loss decreased by $295 thousand to $1.64 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.94 million for Q1 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in operating loss was the growth in net revenue  which outpaced the growth in operating costs by a factor of 5.3. Adjusting for additional non-cash and non-recurring activities results in an even more significant improvement to the operating margin.Net LossNet loss decreased 16.7% or $0.07 per basic and diluted share for Q1 2022 to $1.69M from $2.03 million or $0.11 per basic and diluted share for the same period last year.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of March 31  2022  and December 31  2021  the Company had approximately $5.84 million and $3.48 million of cash  respectively. The increase in cash during the comparative periods was a result of the net positive cash inflow from the combination of financing and operating activities. In Q1 2022  the Company received $1.95 million related to a government contract and $3.32 million from a warrant exercise  as well as $365 thousand in units sold and warrants exercised in connection to the Company's 2022 fundraising efforts in preparation for its Nasdaq listing.Total working capital as of March 31  2022 was $5.63 million  compared to $3.36 million as of December 31  2021.

This decrease can be explained primarily by lower volumes on several products  in particular hand sanitizers  as well as a lower R&D activity over the quarter. The activity however benefited from the first positive effects of the commercial production of Estetrol for Mithra at the Villeneuve-la-Garenne site and which volumes are expected to increase over the rest of 2022 and in 2023  as well as from a strong demand at the sites of Turku in Finland and Aramon.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled €19.9 million  a 20.5% increase compared to 2021 (+18.2% at a constant exchange rate). All the activities have experienced a strong growth in sales with  in particular  a very strong demand on Electronics  Cosmetics and Lubricant Additives. Supply and logistical difficulties were able to be controlled and ultimately had only a small impact on net sales. Several new projects were also launched.OutlookAll the PCAS Group teams  with the support of its majority shareholder Seqens for the financing of its activities and its development  remain fully committed to improving the results in 2022 and a return to positive results in 2023  supported by the ramp-up in Estetrol volumes for Mithra.Story continuesNEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:Shareholders’ meeting  June 9  2022ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

At the same time we have seen new developments affected by the rise of construction costs  however until now we have been able to mitigate this effect through higher rental prices but we might expect economic challenges ahead due to increased inflation  supply chain issues and geopolitical challenges.”Jan Van Geet continued: “The European energy market is severely impacted by the crisis in Ukraine  with unprecedented volatility and very high prices. In order to support our tenants  VGP is working on diversifying available sources of energy supply  through the roll-out of renewables across our parks and exploring the possibility of installing geo thermic heating systems in all our new developments. Furthermore we have also decided to move away from gas sourced heating systems in our new buildings”Story continuesJan Van Geet concluded: “I remain confident that our solid balance sheet  pre-let pipeline and upcoming closings with our JV partner Allianz Real Estate provide us with strong foundations for the future. I want to thank my team for their dedication  whilst our hearts go out to the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people and to all of those affected by the war.”OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS – 4M 2022Lease operationsSigned and renewed rental income of € 20.7 million (+65.6% year-on-year) driven by € 15.3 million of new leases (€ 3.8 million on behalf of the Joint Ventures 1 ) and € 2.0 million of renewals (all on behalf of the Joint Ventures) and € 3.4 million of indexation (€3.2 million on behalf of the Joint Ventures).

Big Cannes Interviews & Packages Sitting down with David and Riz: With Cannes on the horizon…,Afternoon all! It’s been a manic week but fortunately one that can be summarized neatly in several paragraphs  as evidenced below. Read on International Insider crew.Big Cannes Interviews & PackagesSitting down with David and Riz: With Cannes on the horizon  Deadline has been breaking packages here  there and everywhere this week but we still found time to sit down with two of those most prominently involved. On Tuesday  Damon Wise published his interview with Eastern Promises creator Cronenberg to talk Crimes of the Future  his latest Cannes pic. David talked variety  25 years’ worth of Cannes trips and whether his violence in movies can go too far. Not to be missed. Meanwhile  Andreas broke the news of hot Riz feature Hamlet  a modern adaptation of the Shakespeare classic  and spoke at length with the Sound of Metal star about his plans for one of his boldest projects yet. Not content with breaking one Riz pic  Andreas had the exclusive on the other  the Jessie Buckley-starring Fingernails  which landed a day before Hamlet. Deadline also revealed Sony Pictures landing rights to Tom Hanks-starring Here  Susan Sarandon wedding comedy The Fabulous Four  the movie version of Tony-winner Clybourne Park  Liam Neeson’s latest Taken-style action hit and BAFTA winner Jodie Comer’s The End We Start From with Benedict Cumberbatch’s SunnyMarch among producers. Elsewhere  nod to our International Editor-At-Large Baz Bamigboye for breaking Emerald Fennell’s new film and check out this reveal from our very own Mike Fleming Jr on Spinal Tap II — wow. Now breathe once again. Andreas  Diana Lodderhose and Baz will be at Cannes next week bringing you the latest in what is sure to be one of the busiest periods of the year. Stay tuned.Just landed: And in the past few minutes  Andreas has revealed Amazon Prime quietly picking domestic rights to UK boxing movie Prizefighter: The Life Of Jem Belcher featuring Russell Crowe. Turns out the pic has been anything but plain sailing  however. Multiple parties contacted Deadline to tell of payments outstanding for months and there is bad blood between producing and financial partners.Global Indie ShakeupsIn their Element: It might make thoughtful  lowkey drama but Element Pictures was the star of the show in the M&A world this week and the sale of the Conversations With Friends producer to Fremantle kicked off a big week in the independent TV production sector. The hot Ireland-based drama company had been on the block for several weeks  with American Gods producer-distributor Fremantle emerging as the buyer. Known for its tastefully shot  high-end productions  Element will fit nicely into a Fremantle roster including Italy’s Wildside and Lux Vide and the UK’s Dancing Ledge Productions.Banijay goes public: On Tuesday  the news broke that Survivor owner Banijay was being taken public  with Chairman Stéphane Courbit leading the establishment of a new parent company  FL Entertainment. This followed an agreement with SPAC investment group Pegasus Entrepreneurs. So  what does this mean in practice? Well  the France-based company’s shares will be traded on Amsterdam’s Euronext and gives the combined group  which also includes online gambling firm Betclic  an enterprise value of €7.2B ($7.6B)  but Banijay reps are keen to stress it’s business as usual and if anything a chance for more growth. Having acquired Italian scripted producer Grøenlandia Group in March  the company looks well set — operationally and financially — to make more noteworthy international moves.Sparkling drama: Staying in France  Jesse had the scoop on Sparkling — the latest production business to enter the increasingly competitive European production market. Co-production guru Patrick Nebout (Cannes Confidential  Midnight Sun) is leading the Paris-based operation as President and Chief Content Officer  with his long-time production partner Henrik Jansson-Schweizer among those joining him. Notably  Sparkling is a sister company to US-French comic book publisher Humanoids  the firm behind lauded graphic novel universe The Incal. Expect Nebout to exploit the extensive Humanoids back catalogue  while also creating original stories with European partners. “All will be premium projects ” he assured Deadline.Enter The DragonConquering Japan: Also in the indie TV world  Korean media giant CJ ENM and its subsidiary Studio Dragon unveiled plans to conquer Japan through a joint venture with Line Digital Frontier  a Japanese operation affiliated with Naver Webtoon. With 30B Korean won ($23M) being jointly invested in the provisionally titled Studio Dragon Japan  the JV operation has the lofty ambition of becoming the “leading production company” in the key Asian territory. Stayed tuned for more.BAFTA WhoIt’s A Snub: It was BAFTA TV time Sunday and there were surprises galore  along with the unveiling of one of the most lucrative casting annos in British TV  the new Doctor. While dragging on a bit as ever  the ceremony itself saw It’s a Sin fail to pick up awards time after time  as all five nominees were snubbed for the likes of social realist dramas Help and Time. All the talk of the week has been how the show failed to win anything and while some have been keen to point out that the Channel 4/HBO drama won two BAFTA Craft Awards  creator Russell T Davies also lost out in that ceremony the previous week. On a politically-charged night  there were big wins for Jodie Comer  Sean Bean and Succession’s Matthew Macfadyen  while ITV hit new heights  winning several factual gongs and two more than Channel 4. I attended the event and  while there were plenty of wifi and accreditation-related teething problems  along with plenty of confusion about embargos  I can confirm that it is wonderful to be back celebrating British television in all its glory.Doctor Ncuti: Landing in journalists’ inboxes mere hours before the ceremony started was the biggest news story of the week: Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa  who both presented and was up for a BAFTA  is to replace Jodie Whittaker as Doctor Who’s next Time Lord. Despite minor protestations from a small number of die-hard Twitter-based Whovians  the response was a welcoming one. Ncuti is the first Black Doctor and will likely bring a new dynamic to the show: he’s unquestionably cool and draws a readymade fan base from one of Netflix’s biggest youth-skewing hits. All eyes to Russell T Davies now and how he shapes the next series. You never know  he might even land himself a BAFTA.BBC Factual WoesAnd the job goes to… nobody: The biggest job in British non-scripted programing was the talk of the BAFTAs Royal Festival Hall afterparty but the post remains dramatically unfilled. I broke the news this week that all candidates to be the BBC’s next Director of Factual  Arts and Classical Music had been unsuccessful and Chief Content Officer Charlotte Moore is now rethinking the very nature of the role  almost six months after it was advertised. Deadline spoke to several within and outside the corporation who grumbled as to why it had taken Moore so long to make this U-turn. They questioned why she couldn’t have just decided the job  which was expanded to accommodate Patrick Holland last year before he departed to Banijay  was too unwieldy  especially as she is understood to have personally reached out to several of the candidates to ask them to apply in the first place. The wait goes on  with BBC Three Controller Fiona Campbell remaining in interim charge in the meantime.The Essentials🌶️ Here’s a hot one: Alec Baldwin has launched production company Persona Entertainment with veteran actor and producer Anjul Nigam just months after the fatal Rust shooting.

Our technology has garnered interest across multiple government use cases in the United States and internationally  addressing pressing concerns around the privacy and security of legacy biometric implementations. Towards this end  Trust Stamp has made a significant investment in expanding our government-facing business development team and are in active discussions with several overseas governments.We continue to innovate through investment in research and development to expand and productize our portfolio of solutions  which has led to five patent issuances and nine new patent application filings in Q1. Trust Stamp’s core technology delivers unparalleled security  utility  and privacy  at a fraction of the cost of traditional biometric solutions  driving commercial growth as we address cross-industry needs for fraud prevention  operational efficiency  and accessibility in digital services.We are notably pleased with the launch and commercial adoption of our next-generation Biometric Multi-Factor Authentication (Biometric MFATM) offering and Identity Orchestration Platform  which transforms secure digital operations across the identity lifecycle with seamless rapid deployment of custom workflows built on our range of innovative AI-powered solutions.

This increase was primarily due to revenue contracts executed by newly acquired and existing customers.Gross ProfitGross profit increased by a notable $1.86 million or 673.9% year-over-year in the first quarter  while gross profit margin improved to 75.4% in Q1 2022  compared to 51.6% for Q1 2021. The improvement was due in part to the Company’s prior investment in research and development  which enabled the utilization of existing technologies with relatively nominal implementation costs for new deployments.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development (R&D) costs decreased by $261 thousand or 34.6% year-over-year in the first quarter. The decrease in R&D expenses in the comparison periods was driven by the Company’s continued efforts to transition software development resources towards expanding internal capabilities and away from external third-party software development.Selling  General  and Administrative ExpensesSelling  general  and administrative (SG&A) expense increased to $3.12 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.33 million for Q1 2021. The increase in SG&A expense during the period ended March 31  2022 was driven by legal and professional services fees  other fees related to the listing of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market  and internal sales commissions.Operating LossOperating loss decreased by $295 thousand to $1.64 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.94 million for Q1 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in operating loss was the growth in net revenue  which outpaced the growth in operating costs by a factor of 5.3. Adjusting for additional non-cash and non-recurring activities results in an even more significant improvement to the operating margin.Net LossNet loss decreased 16.7% or $0.07 per basic and diluted share for Q1 2022 to $1.69M from $2.03 million or $0.11 per basic and diluted share for the same period last year.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of March 31  2022  and December 31  2021  the Company had approximately $5.84 million and $3.48 million of cash  respectively. The increase in cash during the comparative periods was a result of the net positive cash inflow from the combination of financing and operating activities.

We will continue to closely monitor this fast-evolving situation on the underlying.”In a market statement on LUNA  SIX Swiss said: “Due to the current instability of the terra blockchain and the resulting severe price developments and illiquidity of LUNA  the underlying of the affected products  as well as the inability of the market makers to quote bid-offer spreads for the affected products  the issuer has decided to temporarily suspend trading in the affected products.”In a statement to shareholders  Valour said: “Due to the high volatility and the prevailing uncertainty around the Terra ecosystem  the NGM exchange  has halted trading in Valour Terra (LUNA) ETP.“It is Valour's intention to provide a market  through the market maker  as soon as possible and allowed. We keep a continuous dialogue with the exchange.”Earlier in the week  BlackRock and hedge fund giant Citadel Securities were forced to deny making the trade that led to the depegging.UST is a decentralised stablecoin that mints and burns tokens to stabilise the price in line with the US dollar in a bid to avoid the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies.Terra was co-founded in 2018 by Daniel Shin  one of the founders of South Korean eCommerce platform TicketMonster  and Do Kwon  a former Microsoft and Apple software engineer. The coin also offers financial tools applications and NFT solutions.After the coin depegged  Kwon made a last-ditch attempt to restore UST to its alignment with the US dollar by increasing the rate of luna minted per day in a bid to boost the price.Related articles,neutral,0.02,0.92,0.06,negative,0.01,0.05,0.94,True,English,"['21Shares', 'Valour', 'VanEck', 'terra', 'ETPs', 'hedge fund giant Citadel Securities', 'South Korean eCommerce platform', 'resulting severe price developments', 'The 21Shares Terra ETP', 'Apple software engineer', 'financial tools applications', 'Nordic Growth Market', 'wild price swings', 'The Valour Terra', 'terra exchange-traded products', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'VanEck Terra ETN', 'UST) stable coin', 'terra ecosystem', 'terra blockchain', 'token price', 'redemption operations', 'prevailing uncertainty', 'US dollar', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'ETF Stream', 'Hany Rashwan', 'evolving situation', 'current instability', 'market makers', 'bid-offer spreads', 'NGM exchange', 'continuous dialogue', 'decentralised stablecoin', 'Daniel Shin', 'former Microsoft', 'NFT solutions', 'Related articles', 'affected products', 'high volatility', 'LUNA) ETP', 'torrid week', 'one day', 'Do Kwon', 'luna network', 'market statement', '21Shares’ LUNA', 'ETP.', 'ETPs', 'creations', 'redemptions', 'trading', 'VLNA', '13 May', 'TerraUSD', 'suspensions', 'ETFs', 'NAV', 'Euronext', 'Xetra', '15.8% discount', 'Bloomberg', '218.4% premium', 'founder', 'CEO', 'quotation', 'underlying', 'illiquidity', 'inability', 'issuer', 'shareholders', 'intention', 'BlackRock', 'depegging', 'tokens', 'line', 'cryptocurrencies', 'TicketMonster', 'last', 'ditch', 'alignment', 'rate']",2022-05-13,2022-05-14,etfstream.com

Net of fee performance was calculated using actual management fees. Current performance may be lower or higher. Periods over one-year are annualized. Please reference the GIPS Report which accompanies this commentary.The commentary is not intended as a guarantee of profitable outcomes. Any forward-looking statements are based on certain expectations and assumptions that are susceptible to changes in circumstances.CommentaryThe year started with a generally favorable backdrop for global economic activity. However  ongoing pandemic-related supply chain issues  higher inflation  and fears that tighter-than- expected monetary policies by global central banks would slow economic growth worldwide sparked an equity market selloff over the first quarter of 2022. With a rising interest rate environment becoming more of a possibility  investors turned from growth stocks to cyclical and value stocks. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further exacerbated financial market volatility and investors turned away from long-duration assets to the “safety” of commodity and utility companies  which performed relatively well.Despite the heightened equity market uncertainty of the first quarter  we remain confident that our Portfolio holdings are performing at a very high level.We believe the notable divergence between underlying business fundamentals and stock prices that occurred over the quarter will not persist over our multi-year investment horizon. We believe a company’s earnings growth – not short-term fluctuations in stock prices – is a critical factor that dictates long-term stock returns.We target a mid-teens earnings growth rate or higher for any company we invest in. This growth threshold provides a potential cushion during periods of market and multiple contraction.To illustrate this concept for our clients  we created the Polen Heat Map  which serves to depict the relationship between earnings growth and changes in P/E multiples  and how this potentially influences long-term returns.Portfolio Performance & AttributionOver the first quarter  the Portfolio returned -22.37% gross and - 22.48% net of fees  respectively  versus the -6.41% return for the ACWI SMID Capitalization Index (the “Index”). The Portfolio’s underweight positions in the energy  materials  and industrials sectors detracted from performance  as these sectors were favored by investors over the quarter. We tend to underweight these sectors as the companies within them do not typically meet our investment criteria. The Portfolio’s positions in the information technology and consumer discretionary sectors detracted from performance. From a style perspective  an investor preference for value-oriented equities over the types of growth-oriented equities the Portfolio tends to own detracted from its performance over the quarter.Our most significant absolute contributors to performance over the first quarter were Cochlear (OTCPK:CHEOF)  FICO (FICO)  and Euronext (OTCPK:EUXTF).Cochlear  which is the global leader in implantable hearing devices  continues to experience robust demand for its products and services. The business was negatively impacted in 2020 and 2021 as COVID-19-related restrictions led to surgery deferrals  but unit volumes have since recovered in most parts of the world and now exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. Importantly  we believe Cochlear has continued to expand its leadership position over the past few years through continued investments in innovation and market growth activities. We believe the company is well positioned going forward.FICO  which is the leading credit decision making solutions provider  reported robust results during the quarter. In recent years  FICO has successfully leveraged its dominant credit scoring business to thoughtfully expand into software solutions that financial institutions use for insights and decision making. The company's solutions are mission critical for its customers  giving FICO attractive competitive advantages and pricing power that we believe are durable and likely to expand further.Euronext  which offers various trading services and post-trade services (like clearing  custody  and settlement)  benefited from additional trading activity during the period.Our most significant absolute detractors from performance included Etsy (ETSY)  Floor & Decor (FND)  and Fevertree Drinks (OTCPK:FQVTF).E-commerce company Etsy has experienced challenges from the return to “normal” after the pandemic. Management made a point of lowering expectations for 2022  sounding more cautious in areas like home furnishings. We are monitoring the situation  but broadly speaking  we believe the long-term potential for the business remains unchanged. In our opinion  Etsy has done a good job retaining the customers it gained during the pandemic and driving repeat purchases within this customer segment.Floor & Decor is a specialty retail company that we own across multiple Polen Capital strategies. We believe the company offers an attractive customer value proposition in the form of low prices on the widest  in-stock assortment of hard-surface flooring.Despite the recent sell-off in the company’s share price  we believe the long-term prospects for Floor & Decor remain attractive given the long runway of store expansion we expect over the next few years.Fevertree Drinks  according to our research  has continued to make thoughtful  value-creating investments and innovations to expand its leadership position in the premium mixer market globally. As an example  Fevertree now has the number one tonic brand at retail in the U.S. market  displacing the longtime competitor Schweppes.Portfolio ActivityDuring the quarter  we initiated a position in Euronext  while exiting Cybozu and Blackline (BL).We initiated a position in Amsterdam-based Euronext  a leading exchange operator with exposure to capital markets across Europe. This is a company that we have studied for years and have come to admire for both its attractive underlying businesses and management’s reinvestment of capital to acquire strategic assets throughout Europe. We capitalized on the recent market volatility and year-to-date decline in Euronext's stock price to opportunistically initiate a position in what we consider a best-in-class company.We exited the Portfolio’s position in software company Cybozu and Blackline in favor of Euronext  which we believe will be a more attractive investment opportunity over the next three to five years.OutlookWhile we are “macro aware” and monitor the impact of short-term market conditions on the companies we own (or seek to own)  we base our investment decisions on a business’s underlying fundamentals and future growth prospects.Regardless of a given quarter’s market behavior  we will continue to adhere to our bottom-up investment approach when finding attractive companies that offer enduring long-term growth potential and seek to deliver our clients a compelling return. We wrote about how the market can operate as a short-term voting machine and a long-term weighing machine in our recent PoV  “Tale of Two Market Machines.”We take a long-term view and engage the market as a weighing machine  identifying leaders of secular growth that have clean balance sheets and talented management teams. We believe our Portfolio companies are better equipped than their competitors to not just survive  but to thrive  during challenging periods.Thank you for your interest in Polen Capital and the Global SMID Company Growth strategy.

The Oslo Stock Exchange has admitted the shares of Kalera S.A. to trading on Euronext Growth Oslo  and it is expected that the first day of trading in the shares will be on or about 1 June 2022 .

As a result of the above described exchange ratio  the total amount of shares in Kalera S.A. following the Merger is expected to be approximately 104 677 409 shares (which equals approximately half the amount of shares in the Company as of today). It is the shareholders as of the Effectiveness  as such shareholders appear in the shareholders register of the Company with the Norwegian Central Securities Depositary (the ""VPS"") as at the day of Effectiveness (the ""Record Date"")  that will receive consideration shares in Kalera S.A.

Thus  Korian joins national nursing home associations and other elderly care networks in 27 countries  EAN’ members.EAN contributes to major European projects such as the EU Health Data Space and the EU Care Strategy.Longevity is one of the biggest challenge for the next decade in Europe  along with the rise of chronic diseases. By 2030  65+ population will grow significantly by over 20% to 126 million people across Europe and 45 million of this same age range will have to live with at least two chronic diseases.The result is a considerable increase in the need for support and health services and greater needs in terms of training employees  defining good practices and quality standards for care  and developing and integrating information systems. European societal developments - and their economic and social impact - will need to be supported by effective public policies  both at national and European level.European Ageing Network members are serving over 1 million older people in Europe and are paving the way to improve best practices in elderly care so that older people everywhere can live healthier  more independent lives with services tailored to their needs as they evolve.Sophie Boissard  Group Chief Executive Officer  affirms: ""In addition to the actions we already carry out through our national professional organizations in each one of the countries in which we are present  by becoming a direct member of the EAN  we wish to contribute to the design of common responses on a European scale in the field of health and for the elderly.""""With members in 27 countries  EAN represents more than 10 000 organizations providing services to elderly and fragile people in Europe every day. The care sector throughout Europe is facing challenging times in terms of goals: educating staff and upgrading skills  developing new training systems  assuring quality social services and  last but not least  keeping up with the digital revolution. We warmly welcome Korian as one of the major private European players  and we are sure that their contribution will be crucial for expert discussions  bringing all the stakeholders together in order to work on sustainable and future-oriented solutions."" said Jiří Horecký  president of EAN.Story continuesAbout KorianKorian  the leading European care services group for elderly and fragile people. www.korian.comKorian has been listed on Euronext Paris Section A since November 2006 and is included in the following indices: SBF 120  CAC Health Care  CAC Mid 60  CAC Mid & Small and MSCI Global Small CapEuronext ticker: KORI - ISIN: FR0010386334 – Reuters: KORI.PA – Bloomberg: KORI.FPView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220513005415/en/ContactsINVESTOR RELATIONSSarah MinghamVP Investor Relations & Financingsarah.mingham@korian.comTel: +33 (0)1 55 37 53 55Carole AlexandreDeputy Head ofInvestor Relationscarole.alexandre@korian.comTel: +33 (0)7 64 65 22 44MEDIA CONTACTSCyrille LachèvreClachevre@cylans.ovhTél. : 06 20 42 12 08Pascal JentschVP International communicationspascal.jentsch-ext@korian.comTél. 07 65 18 58 55Marjorie CastoriadisHead of Media Relationsmarjorie.castoriadis@korian.frTel: +33 (0)7 63 59 88 81",neutral,0.05,0.92,0.03,mixed,0.4,0.32,0.27,True,English,"['European Ageing Network', 'Care Services', 'Fragile People', 'Korian', 'Elderly', 'leading European care services group', 'Group Chief Executive Officer', 'MSCI Global Small Cap', 'Cyrille Lachèvre Clachevre', 'leading European services Group', 'major private European players', 'national nursing home associations', 'VP International communications pascal', 'EU Health Data Space', 'European Ageing Network members', 'Euronext Paris Section A', 'other elderly care networks', 'major European projects', 'European societal developments', 'EU Care Strategy', 'same age range', 'effective public policies', 'VP Investor Relations', 'two chronic diseases', 'new training systems', 'CAC Health Care', 'national professional organizations', 'quality social services', '1 million older people', 'European level', 'European scale', 'health services', 'Euronext ticker', 'Pascal Jentsch', 'care sector', '126 million people', 'training employees', 'quality standards', 'information systems', 'social impact', 'CAC Mid', 'Media Relations', 'fragile people', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'Regulatory News', 'strong footprint', 'General Assembly', 'biggest challenge', 'next decade', '65+ population', 'considerable increase', 'good practices', 'best practices', 'independent lives', 'Sophie Boissard', 'direct member', 'common responses', 'challenging times', 'digital revolution', 'expert discussions', 'future-oriented solutions', 'Jiří Horecký', 'following indices', 'source version', 'Financing sarah', 'Tél', 'EAN’ members', 'greater needs', 'Sarah Mingham', 'Deputy Head', 'MEDIA CONTACTS', 'KORI.FP', 'Carole Alexandre', 'Marjorie Castoriadis', '10,000 organizations', 'Korian', '7 countries', 'April', 'Malmö', 'Sweden', 'Longevity', 'rise', '20% to', 'result', 'support', 'terms', 'economic', 'way', 'addition', 'actions', 'design', 'field', 'goals', 'staff', 'skills', 'contribution', 'stakeholders', 'order', 'sustainable', 'president', 'Story', 'November', 'SBF', 'ISIN', 'Reuters', 'Bloomberg', 'businesswire', 'Tel', 'cylans', 'ovh', '33']",2022-05-14,2022-05-14,finance.yahoo.com
