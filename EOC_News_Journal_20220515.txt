(NYSE:FRGE) Shares?,If you want to know who really controls Forge Global Holdings  Inc. ( NYSE:FRGE )  then you'll have to look at the...,"If you want to know who really controls Forge Global Holdings  Inc. (NYSE:FRGE)  then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Generally speaking  as a company grows  institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely  insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Warren Buffett said that he likes ""a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people."" So it's nice to see some insider ownership  because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.With a market capitalization of US$4.8b  Forge Global Holdings is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors  too. In the chart below  we can see that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Forge Global Holdings.View our latest analysis for Forge Global HoldingsWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Forge Global Holdings?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors  so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register  especially if they are growing.Forge Global Holdings already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed  they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else  they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time  you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Forge Global Holdings' earnings history below. Of course  the future is what really matters.Forge Global Holdings is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Deutsche Boerse AG  Asset Management Arm is the largest shareholder with 14% of shares outstanding. For context  the second largest shareholder holds about 8.3% of the shares outstanding  followed by an ownership of 6.0% by the third-largest shareholder. Furthermore  CEO Kelly Rodriques is the owner of 3.3% of the company's shares.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging  we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company  suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research  it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company  so it is probably flying under the radar.Insider Ownership Of Forge Global HoldingsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders  capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However  it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members  especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However  on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Forge Global Holdings  Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$4.8b  and insiders have US$727m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders  especially in a company of this size. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 49% stake in the company  and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership  while considerable  may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Private Equity OwnershipWith a stake of 13%  private equity firms could influence the Forge Global Holdings board. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term  but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company  there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks  for instance. Every company has them  and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Forge Global Holdings you should know about.Of course this may not be the best stock to buy.

The prestigious award recognizes artists and projects that made a significant contribution to international photography over the last 12 months with a grand prize of ¬£30 ,The Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation has just announced its 2022 winner. The prestigious award recognizes artists and projects that made a significant contribution to international photography over the last 12 months with a grand prize of ¬£30 000 ($36 800) up for grabs.This year  first place was awarded to the American photographer Deana Lawson for her solo exhibition ‚Äúentropy‚Äù at Kunsthalle Basel which took place from 9 June - 11 October 2020. Lawson‚Äôs distinctive and provocative approach to photography reframes and reclaims the black experience while exploring the intergenerational relationships  their effect on black culture and the space held by communities and individuals.While most of her work focuses on strangers cast specifically for the image  Lawson manages to create intimate portraits that have a sense of familiarity between the characters whom Lawson describes as mythological extended family. Although her work sometimes contains natural phenomena such as waterfalls and galaxies  she is often found shooting in domestic settings. By using unsettling elements which act as ‚Äòportals‚Äô into other worlds she is able to portray scenes of death and birth.Installation image of the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize 2022 winner Deana Lawson at The Photographers' Gallery  London (Image credit: Deana Lawson - Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation 2022)Brett Rogers OBE  Director of The Photographers‚Äô Gallery and Chair of the Jury said  ‚ÄúDeana Lawson is a deserved winner of this year‚Äôs prize  not least for the sheer inventiveness and complexity of her approach to image-making.‚Äù He continues ‚Äú Her subject matter sits somewhere between the ‚Äòhere and now‚Äô and the past  a person and a people  the staged and the naturalistic  in a manner which is not didactic or issue-driven but genuinely radical‚ÄùThis year‚Äôs Jury included Yto Barrada  an artist living between New York and Morocco  Jessica Dimson  The New York Times deputy director of photography  Yasufumi Nakamori  Tate Modern's International Art Senior Curator  Anne-Marie Beckman  the Director of the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation and Jury Chair Brett Rogers OBE.Lawson's work will be showcased in an exhibition taking place at The Photographers Gallery in London until 12 June alongside finalists Anastasia Samoylova  Jo Ractliffe and Gilles Peress and from 30 June  the exhibition will be on show at the Deutsche B√∂rse‚Äôs headquarters in Eschborn/Frankfurt.Installation image of the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize 2022 winner Deana Lawson at The Photographers' Gallery  London (Image credit: Deana Lawson - Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation 2022)Read more:Best camera for portraitsBest lens for portraitsBest film cameras,neutral,0.06,0.91,0.03,mixed,0.64,0.06,0.3,True,English,"['Deutsche B√∂rse award', 'black experience', 'Photographer', 'Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize 2022 winner', 'The Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation', 'The New York Times deputy director', 'International Art Senior Curator', 'American photographer Deana Lawson', ""The Photographers' Gallery"", 'The Photographers‚Äô Gallery', 'The Photographers Gallery', 'mythological extended family', 'Brett Rogers OBE', 'Best film cameras', 'international photography', 'grand prize', 'deserved winner', 'Best camera', 'Best lens', 'prestigious award', 'significant contribution', 'last 12 months', 'Kunsthalle Basel', 'black experience', 'intergenerational relationships', 'black culture', 'natural phenomena', 'domestic settings', 'unsettling elements', 'other worlds', 'sheer inventiveness', 'subject matter', 'Yto Barrada', 'Jessica Dimson', 'Yasufumi Nakamori', 'Tate Modern', 'Anne-Marie Beckman', 'Anastasia Samoylova', 'Jo Ractliffe', 'Gilles Peress', 'Installation image', 'Image credit', 'provocative approach', 'first place', 'solo exhibition', 'intimate portraits', 'Jury Chair', 'artists', 'projects', 'grabs', 'entropy', '9 June', '11 October', 'distinctive', 'effect', 'space', 'communities', 'individuals', 'work', 'strangers', 'sense', 'familiarity', 'characters', 'waterfalls', 'galaxies', 'portals', 'scenes', 'death', 'birth', 'London', 'year', 'complexity', 'image-making', 'past', 'person', 'people', 'manner', 'Morocco', '12 June', 'finalists', '30 June', 'show', 'headquarters', 'Frankfurt']",2022-05-15,2022-05-15,digitalcameraworld.com

Latest results from the Phase 3 IKEMA clinical trial evaluating Sarclisa¬Æ (isatuximab) in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) demonstrated a median progression free survival (mPFS) of 35.7 months (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.58; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 25.8 to 44.0; n=179)  compared to 19.2 months in patients treated with Kd alone (95% CI: 15.8 to 25.1; n=123)  as evaluated by an Independent Review Committee. These results  presented at the Controversies in Multiple Myeloma World Congress  represent the longest mPFS among studies investigating a proteasome inhibitor backbone in the second-line setting for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). These data will also be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology on May 19.Philippe Moreau  MDHead of the Department of Hematology  University Hospital of Nantes  France‚ÄúThe increase in progression free survival  observed consistently across all subgroups  when adding Sarclisa to carfilzomib and dexamethasone is remarkable in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma in a proteasome inhibitor combination. Relapse is common in multiple myeloma  creating the need for differentiated second-line treatments that provide patients a longer period of time without disease progression. This updated analysis reinforces the potential for Sarclisa to become a new standard of care for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.‚ÄùStory continuesA PFS analysis following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommendations on censoring rules  as applied in the approved U.S. prescribing information  showed an mPFS of 41.7 months for Sarclisa added to Kd (Sarclisa combination therapy) compared to 20.8 months in patients treated with Kd alone (HR 0.59; 95% CI: 27.1 to Not Calculable [NC]).Time to next treatment for patients treated with Sarclisa combination therapy was 44.9 months (HR 0.55; 95% CI: 31.6 to NC) versus those treated with Kd alone at 25 months (95% CI: 17.9 to 31.3). Time to next treatment measured the interval from the date of randomization1 to the date of commencement of the next line of therapy  thereby allowing for measurement of the period of therapeutic benefit.2Peter C. Adamson  MDGlobal Head of Oncology Clinical Development and Pediatric Innovation at Sanofi‚ÄúTo observe progression free survival of more than three years in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma when Sarclisa was added to a proteasome inhibitor backbone of therapy is unprecedented and reinforces our confidence in Sarclisa as a potential best in class anti-CD38 antibody.‚ÄùThe safety and tolerability of Sarclisa observed in this analysis were consistent with the safety profile of Sarclisa in other clinical trials  with no new safety signals observed. For the Sarclisa combination therapy and Kd groups  the most common adverse events were infusion related reaction (45.8%  3.3%)  diarrhea (39.5%  32%)  hypertension (37.9%  35.2%)  upper respiratory tract infection (37.3%  27%)  fatigue (31.6%  20.5%)  dyspnoea (30.5%  22.1%)  pneumonia (27.1%  21.3%)  back pain (25.4%  21.3%)  insomnia (25.4%  24.6%)  and bronchitis (24.3%  12.3%). Treatment exposure in the Sarclisa combination therapy arm was 30 weeks longer than in the control arm. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of ‚â• Grade 3 were reported in 83.6% of patients treated with Sarclisa combination therapy and in 73% of those treated with Kd alone. Serious TEAEs were higher in the Sarclisa combination therapy arm versus Kd alone (70.1% versus 59.8%). No difference was observed after exposure adjustment.‚ÄùThese results will be discussed with regulatory authorities at a future date.About the IKEMA trialThe randomized  multi-center  open label Phase 3 IKEMA clinical trial enrolled 302 patients with relapsed MM across 69 centers spanning 16 countries. All study participants had received one to three prior anti-myeloma therapies. During the trial  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks  then every other week for 28-day cycles in combination with carfilzomib twice weekly at the 20/56mg/m2 dose and dexamethasone at the standard dose for the duration of treatment. The primary endpoint of IKEMA was progression free survival. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate  the rate of complete response or better  the rate of very good partial response or better  rate of minimal residual disease-negativity  overall survival and safety.3About SarclisaSarclisa is a monoclonal antibody that targets a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on multiple myeloma (MM) cells. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells  making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa.Based on the Phase 3 ICARIA-MM study  Sarclisa is approved in a number of countries  including the U.S. and EU  in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory MM (RRMM) who have received ‚â•2 prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the Phase 3 IKEMA study  Sarclisa is also approved in multiple countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with RRMM who have received 1‚Äì3 prior lines of therapy and in the European Union for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the U.S.  the generic name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc  with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The safety and efficacy of these additional uses have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority worldwide.For more information on Sarclisa clinical trials  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About multiple myelomaMM is the second most common hematologic malignancy 4 with more than 130 000 new diagnoses of MM worldwide yearly.5 Despite available treatments  MM remains an incurable malignancy and is associated with significant patient burden. Since MM does not have a cure  most patients will relapse. Relapsed MM is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission.

Does this mean that Irish businesses have run out of other things to do with their money?,Grafton is the latest company to announce plans to buy back its shares. Does this mean that Irish businesses have run out of other things to do with their money?The building materials and DIY group said last week it plans to spend up to ¬£100m (‚Ç¨117m) buying back its shares between now and the end of the year.AIB and Bank of Ireland are at it too. Earlier this month Bank of Ireland completed a ‚Ç¨50m buyback  its first since 2004  while AIB hopes to spend up to ‚Ç¨91m buying back its shares.And it‚Äôs not just Grafton and the banks  agrifood giant Glanbia completed another ‚Ç¨50m share buyback this month. This comes on top of a previous ‚Ç¨50m buyback completed in April 2021.Origin Enterprises is also buying back its shares. It announced a ‚Ç¨40m buyback in March. Shareholders will be hoping this buyback works out better than the previous one. In 2013 the company splurged ‚Ç¨100m buying back 13.3 million of its own shares  at an average price of ‚Ç¨7.50 a share.It turned out Origin bought at close to the top and the share price started slip-sliding away soon after the buyback  bottoming out at just ‚Ç¨2.11 during the depths of the pandemic panic in March 2020. The Origin share price has since recovered strongly and is now trading around ‚Ç¨4.35.Read MoreHowever  these buyback sagas pale by comparison with those of CRH and Ryanair.CRH  Ireland‚Äôs largest industrial company  spent a massive $3.2bn (‚Ç¨3.1bn) CRH switched its reporting currency from euro to dollars in 2020) buying back 85 million of its shares between May 2018 and March of this year. And the company isn‚Äôt done yet.It plans to spend a further $300m on its own shares by the end of next month  with further buybacks likely after that.Announcing the completion of the last phase of the buyback in March  CRH stated that: ‚ÄúAny decision in relation to any future buyback programmes will be based on an ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business and general market conditions.‚ÄùBut even the huge CRH share buyback falls into the tuppence ha‚Äôpenny category by contrast with Ryanair.Since 2008  Michael O‚ÄôLeary‚Äôs company has spent just under ‚Ç¨5bn buying back its shares and a further ‚Ç¨1.9bn in special dividends and distributions. That‚Äôs a grand total of ‚Ç¨6.85bn.Traditional corporate finance theory holds that companies should only buy back their own shares when they have run out of other more profitable investment opportunities. Many companies reject this interpretation and point to individual company-specific circumstances as justification for their buybacks.A Grafton spokesperson points out that the company disposed of its UK merchanting business in July 2021 for an enterprise value (the purchase price plus the company debt being assumed by the buyer) of ¬£520m. This left Grafton flush with cash  some of which is now being returned to shareholders by way of the buyback.In addition  the Grafton share price has fallen by over a third since last August.‚ÄúWhy go out and buy other businesses if the state of the market means that our shares represent better value?‚Äù asked the spokesperson.In AIB‚Äôs case  with the State still owning about 71pc of the bank  most of the buyback proceeds ‚Äì about ‚Ç¨64m ‚Äì will go to the Exchequer in part repayment of the near ‚Ç¨21bn of taxpayers‚Äô money that was pumped into the bank to save it from collapse after the 2008 crash.The CRH buyback is probably best interpreted as a gradual unwinding of the ‚Ç¨1.1bn one-for-four rights issue in 2009  when CRH issued almost 104 million new shares at ‚Ç¨10.50 each.The current CRH share price is ‚Ç¨36. However  a CRH spokesperson points out that the company has paid less than the weighted average of the share price since 2018.‚ÄúBuybacks are an efficient means of cash distribution to shareholders  allied to disciplined financial management  powerful cash generation and dynamic capital management ‚Ä¶ all with the aim to maximise long term value and deliver superior returns for shareholders‚Äù  said the CRH spokesperson.In the case of Ryanair  despite having been a listed company since 1997  the airline has not paid an ordinary dividend over the past quarter of a century ‚Äì so the regular flow of share buybacks and distributions should be seen as being at least a partial substitute. A kind of quasi-dividend  as it were.Still  no matter how strongly the companies buying back their shares insist that this is an efficient use of their cash  there is something seriously wonky about a market where companies are in aggregate returning far more cash to their existing shareholders than they are raising from new investors.Only two new companies listed on Euronext Dublin in the past 12 months ‚Äì while  in addition to share buybacks  no fewer than four companies ‚Äì CPL  Applegreen  Abbey and Total Produce ‚Äì have exited the market.Share buybacks running into the billions of euro and IPOs slowing to a trickle cast a long shadow over the future of the Dublin equities market.,negative,0.18,0.39,0.43,mixed,0.13,0.19,0.68,True,English,"['Share buybacks', 'Dublin exchange', 'part', 'Traditional corporate finance theory', 'current CRH share price', 'The Origin share price', 'huge CRH share buyback', 'agrifood giant Glanbia', 'Michael O‚ÄôLeary', 'profitable investment opportunities', 'individual company-specific circumstances', 'four rights issue', 'UK merchanting business', 'dynamic capital management', 'general market conditions', '‚Ç¨50m share buyback', 'The CRH buyback', 'powerful cash generation', 'long term value', 'largest industrial company', 'Grafton share price', 'two new companies', 'previous ‚Ç¨50m buyback', 'Dublin equities market', 'future buyback programmes', '104 million new shares', 'A Grafton spokesperson', 'purchase price', 'new investors', 'previous one', 'capital needs', 'financial management', 'Euronext Dublin', 'long shadow', 'Origin Enterprises', 'share buybacks', 'average price', 'four companies', '‚Ç¨40m buyback', 'buyback sagas', 'buyback proceeds', 'Irish businesses', 'building materials', 'DIY group', 'pandemic panic', 'reporting currency', 'next month', 'last phase', 'ongoing assessment', 'tuppence ha', 'penny category', 'special dividends', 'grand total', 'enterprise value', 'last August', 'part repayment', 'gradual unwinding', 'CRH spokesperson', 'efficient means', 'superior returns', 'past quarter', 'regular flow', 'partial substitute', 'efficient use', 'past 12 months', 'Total Produce', 'other things', 'Many companies', 'other businesses', 'cash distribution', 'taxpayers‚Äô money', 'ordinary dividend', 'latest company', 'company debt', 'existing shareholders', 'plans', 'year', 'AIB', 'Bank', 'Ireland', 'top', 'April', 'March', 'depths', 'comparison', 'Ryanair', 'massive $', 'dollars', 'May', 'completion', 'decision', 'relation', 'contrast', 'distributions', 'interpretation', 'justification', 'July', 'buyer', 'way', 'addition', 'state', 'case', '71pc', 'Exchequer', 'collapse', '2008 crash', '‚Ç¨1.1bn', 'aim', 'airline', 'century', 'something', 'aggregate', 'fewer', 'CPL', 'Applegreen', 'Abbey', 'billions', 'IPOs', 'trickle']",2022-05-15,2022-05-15,independent.ie

4917,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.brecorder.com/news/40173079/french-cereal-crop-ratings-down-sharply,French cereal crop ratings down sharply,20 hours ago,PARIS: Crop conditions for French wheat and barley crops declined sharply last week as dry weather persisted in the EU‚Äôs biggest grain-growing country  data from farm office FranceAgriMer showed on Friday. An estimated 82% of French soft wheat crops were in good or excellent condition in the week to May 9  down from 89% the previous week  FranceAgriMer said in a cereal report. That marked a second straight weekly decline in the rating after a two-point drop the previous week. The latest score was nonetheless above a 79% rating a year earlier.Crop observers have warned that cereals may start losing yield potential  with a hot  dry spell this week expected to increase pressure on plants  before the possible return of rain next week. FranceAgriMer officials said earlier this week that crops were suffering in particular in the southeast and in zones with light soils  although rainfall in the coming days could avert widespread damage to cereals.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre reaching a tipping point for some soil types ‚Äù Catherine Cauchard  head of FranceAgriMer‚Äôs crop monitoring service told reporters. ‚ÄúFarmers are hoping for rain so that yield potential can be maintained.‚ÄùDrought in France has added to tension in grain markets that are grappling with disruption to Ukrainian supplies as a result of the war and poor weather conditions in other major producing countries like the United States and India.Euronext wheat futures rallied on Thursday to contract highs  fuelled by US government estimates of tighter domestic and world wheat supplies next season. French barley and durum wheat ratings also fell sharply last week  with spring barley sown at the end of winter showing the steepest decline  FranceAgriMer‚Äôs data showed.For spring barley  the good/excellent score shed 12 points to 76%  now below a year-earlier level of 85%. The winter barley rating fell by 7 points to 79%  while the durum score lost six points to 77%  although both remained above year-earlier levels. Weather forecasts are projecting some showers in the week ahead as storms break the hot spell  but traders are concerned that precipitation may be erratic.

This increase was primarily due to revenue contracts executed by newly acquired and existing customers.Gross ProfitGross profit increased by a notable $1.86 million or 673.9% year-over-year in the first quarter  while gross profit margin improved to 75.4% in Q1 2022  compared to 51.6% for Q1 2021. The improvement was due in part to the Company‚Äôs prior investment in research and development  which enabled the utilization of existing technologies with relatively nominal implementation costs for new deployments.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development (R&D) costs decreased by $261 thousand or 34.6% year-over-year in the first quarter. The decrease in R&D expenses in the comparison periods was driven by the Company‚Äôs continued efforts to transition software development resources towards expanding internal capabilities and away from external third-party software development.Selling  General  and Administrative ExpensesSelling  general  and administrative (SG&A) expense increased to $3.12 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.33 million for Q1 2021. The increase in SG&A expense during the period ended March 31  2022 was driven by legal and professional services fees  other fees related to the listing of the Company‚Äôs common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market  and internal sales commissions.Operating LossOperating loss decreased by $295 thousand to $1.64 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.94 million for Q1 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in operating loss was the growth in net revenue  which outpaced the growth in operating costs by a factor of 5.3.

Latest results from the Phase 3 IKEMA clinical trial evaluating Sarclisa¬Æ (isatuximab) in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) demonstrated a median progression free survival (mPFS) of 35.7 months (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.58; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 25.8 to 44.0; n=179)  compared to 19.2 months in patients treated with Kd alone (95% CI: 15.8 to 25.1; n=123)  as evaluated by an Independent Review Committee. These results  presented at the Controversies in Multiple Myeloma World Congress  represent the longest mPFS among studies investigating a proteasome inhibitor backbone in the second-line setting for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). These data will also be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology on May 19.Philippe Moreau  MDHead of the Department of Hematology  University Hospital of Nantes  France‚ÄúThe increase in progression free survival  observed consistently across all subgroups  when adding Sarclisa to carfilzomib and dexamethasone is remarkable in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma in a proteasome inhibitor combination. Relapse is common in multiple myeloma  creating the need for differentiated second-line treatments that provide patients a longer period of time without disease progression. This updated analysis reinforces the potential for Sarclisa to become a new standard of care for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.‚ÄùA PFS analysis following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommendations on censoring rules  as applied in the approved U.S. prescribing information  showed an mPFS of 41.7 months for Sarclisa added to Kd (Sarclisa combination therapy) compared to 20.8 months in patients treated with Kd alone (HR 0.59; 95% CI: 27.1 to Not Calculable [NC]).Time to next treatment for patients treated with Sarclisa combination therapy was 44.9 months (HR 0.55; 95% CI: 31.6 to NC) versus those treated with Kd alone at 25 months (95% CI: 17.9 to 31.3). Time to next treatment measured the interval from the date of randomization1 to the date of commencement of the next line of therapy  thereby allowing for measurement of the period of therapeutic benefit.2Peter C. Adamson  MDGlobal Head of Oncology Clinical Development and Pediatric Innovation at Sanofi‚ÄúTo observe progression free survival of more than three years in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma when Sarclisa was added to a proteasome inhibitor backbone of therapy is unprecedented and reinforces our confidence in Sarclisa as a potential best in class anti-CD38 antibody.‚ÄùThe safety and tolerability of Sarclisa observed in this analysis were consistent with the safety profile of Sarclisa in other clinical trials  with no new safety signals observed. For the Sarclisa combination therapy and Kd groups  the most common adverse events were infusion related reaction (45.8%  3.3%)  diarrhea (39.5%  32%)  hypertension (37.9%  35.2%)  upper respiratory tract infection (37.3%  27%)  fatigue (31.6%  20.5%)  dyspnoea (30.5%  22.1%)  pneumonia (27.1%  21.3%)  back pain (25.4%  21.3%)  insomnia (25.4%  24.6%)  and bronchitis (24.3%  12.3%). Treatment exposure in the Sarclisa combination therapy arm was 30 weeks longer than in the control arm. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of ‚â• Grade 3 were reported in 83.6% of patients treated with Sarclisa combination therapy and in 73% of those treated with Kd alone. Serious TEAEs were higher in the Sarclisa combination therapy arm versus Kd alone (70.1% versus 59.8%). No difference was observed after exposure adjustment.‚ÄùThese results will be discussed with regulatory authorities at a future date.About the IKEMA trialThe randomized  multi-center  open label Phase 3 IKEMA clinical trial enrolled 302 patients with relapsed MM across 69 centers spanning 16 countries. All study participants had received one to three prior anti-myeloma therapies. During the trial  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10mg/kg once weekly for four weeks  then every other week for 28-day cycles in combination with carfilzomib twice weekly at the 20/56mg/m2 dose and dexamethasone at the standard dose for the duration of treatment. The primary endpoint of IKEMA was progression free survival. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate  the rate of complete response or better  the rate of very good partial response or better  rate of minimal residual disease-negativity  overall survival and safety.3About SarclisaSarclisa is a monoclonal antibody that targets a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on multiple myeloma (MM) cells. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activity. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells  making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa.Based on the Phase 3 ICARIA-MM study  Sarclisa is approved in a number of countries  including the U.S. and EU  in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory MM (RRMM) who have received ‚â•2 prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the Phase 3 IKEMA study  Sarclisa is also approved in multiple countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with RRMM who have received 1‚Äì3 prior lines of therapy and in the European Union for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the U.S.  the generic name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc  with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The safety and efficacy of these additional uses have not been reviewed by any regulatory authority worldwide.For more information on Sarclisa clinical trials  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About multiple myelomaMM is the second most common hematologic malignancy 4 with more than 130 000 new diagnoses of MM worldwide yearly.5 Despite available treatments  MM remains an incurable malignancy and is associated with significant patient burden. Since MM does not have a cure  most patients will relapse. Relapsed MM is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Refractory MM refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people‚Äôs lives.

Hence  we find it worthwhile to present 27 of the most important and astounding stock market statistics  good and bad  reminding us how crucial a stable and healthy economy is for a nation‚Äôs growth.Global stock market capitalization -116.78 trillion dollarsDespite the devastating effects of lockdowns enforced in many parts of the world  the stock market‚Äôs resilience is quite remarkable  bouncing back big time. At the beginning of 2022  the total value of global stock markets has already reached nearly 117 trillion dollars  a 460 percent growth from its value of 25 trillion dollars in 2009.US stock market value ‚Äì 41 trillion dollarsUS stock exchanges  NYSE and NASDAQ  account for 54 percent of the total world stock market capitalization  dominating the market in value and scale. These operators are so big that their value is equivalent to combining the stock exchanges of Canada  Japan  London  China  Hongkong  Saudi Arabia  and Euronext.Stock ownership of US top 1% ‚Äì 22 trillion dollarsThe class gap cannot be broader and more evident than the value of stocks owned by the ultra-rich in the US. With the top 10% owning 89 percent of the stocks and funds in the country  that leaves only 11 percent for the rest of the investors.Number of stock exchange operators with more than 1 trillion dollars in market value ‚Äì 19Aside from the NYSE and NASDAQ  there are 17 more that are part of this exclusive trillion-dollar club. They include Shanghai Stock Exchange  Euronext  and Japan Exchange Group  to name a few. These operators account for over 93 percent of the world‚Äôs stock market cap.Total market value of top 5 US companies in the world ‚Äì 7.93 trillion dollarsWhen you combine the valuation of Apple  Microsoft  Alphabet  Amazon  and Tesla  it will exceed the third highest stock market cap  the Shanghai Stock Exchange in China. However  it has a current value of 7.37 trillion dollars  more than half a trillion short of the top 5‚Äôs total market cap.Approximate number of US stock indices ‚Äì 5 000Many of us are familiar with three of them  the most widely followed: the S&P 500  Dow Jones Industrial Average  and NASDAQ Composite. However  it is the Wilshire 5000 that has all the listed companies in the US; hence it is often referred to as the total market index.Longest US bull market ‚Äì 11 yearsThe 11-year bull run is the longest in US record  whose end in March 2020 was brought about by the sudden Covid shutdown. It achieved its extraordinary feat with slow yet steady growth  lasting more than twice the industry average of 4 years.Stock market correction frequency ‚Äì once in 2 yearsThe biennial correction in the stock market is a significant improvement from its usual once-a-year occurrence pre-World War II. This market correction refers to a drop in stocks ranging from 10 to 20%. Beyond this figure  you have a bear market just like what happened during the initial lockdowns  where stocks have dropped significantly but have since recovered.Apple‚Äôs current market cap ‚Äì 2.5 trillion dollarsBased on its staggering figures  Apple is the most valuable company globally. It not only has the highest market value among corporations  but it was also the first publicly-traded company to hit the 3 trillion mark in early 2022. What‚Äôs more impressive is that the 1 trillion increase occurred in less than 2 years since it first reached 2 trillion.IT stock market share ‚Äì 27.6 percentAs of 2021  IT‚Äôs exposure to the S&P 500 index is almost 28 percent. This sector consists of software services  hardware  electronic equipment  etc.  led by Apple  Microsoft  and Nvidia Corporation. Its dominance is not surprising because its ubiquitous products are made for a virtual world that has prospered even more during the Covid lockdowns.Estimated algorithmic trading ‚Äì above 80%The days of traditional trading where orders are placed over the phone are almost gone  at least in the US and several other developed financial markets. It has been replaced by algorithmic trading  more than 80 percent of it. This trading is an automated approach using computer algorithms to trade the stock market. While it is widely used in first-world countries  it has yet to catch on among emerging economies such as India  whose overall market volume is only 40 percent.Total share buybacks in 2021 ‚Äì 881.7 billion dollars2021 has set a new record for the highest share repurchases amounting to over 880 billion dollars. It marks an almost 70 percent increase from 2020 and a 9.3 percent rise from the previous record of 806.4 billion dollars in 2018. Moreover  analysts expect its number to rise in 2022 despite reduced prices  which will raise the number of purchased shares and jack its earnings-per-share.NASDAQ‚Äôs 20-year investment return ‚Äì 907%One of two goliaths in the industry  the NASDAQ 100 Index Tracking ETF would have made you nearly a 1000 percent return if you‚Äôve had your money with them since 2002. As such  it has become the best performing major stock index. The honor of being the best in the world overall goes to the Indian Sensex  increasing 1792% in the last 2 decades.Average loss from the September effect ‚Äì (-0.83%)Historically  the three leading stock market indices had the worst performance in September. However  many stock analysts acknowledge it as a global phenomenon and attribute it to seasonal portfolio changes and the practice of selling losing positions in mutual funds during this month. Conversely  April is the best month to buy stocks based on the increased average return of 2.4% within the last 20 years.Total stock market loss during the Great Depression ‚Äì 89.2 percentThe Dow experienced its worst numbers from 381.17 to 41.22 and an almost 90 percent loss within 3 years of the stock market crash. Before the Great Depression  it was the roaring 20s for a reason ‚Äì many businesses experienced significant success  frequently raising stock prices until 1929.Best stock market gain in the last 90 years ‚Äì 46.59 percent1933 is regarded as the best year after coming back from the Great Depression  rebounding with more than 46 percent. However  a series of wins and losses would ensue until the market earned big at 45.02 percent in 1954.Expected number of bear markets in a 50-year investment period ‚Äì 14Watching the stock dive may be pretty painful  but such downturns are temporary and short-lived. And besides  one should not automatically assume that bear markets are the same as recessions. Out of the 26 bear markets since the Great Depression  you can only associate 15 recessions with them.Stock market yield from 1995 to 1999 ‚Äì 26.3% per yearThis period has produced one of the best bull markets  coming off the heels of Bill Clinton‚Äôs special relationship with Tony Blair. A jump of 34.11% was recorded in 1995 and continued its exceptional showing for five years.S&P 500 annual return from 1996 to 2020 ‚Äì 8 percentWe know that investors stand to earn more in stocks than in government bonds  but it does not happen 100 percent of the time. During this 25-year period  long-term bonds  which are one-third less volatile  beat the US stock market by earning more at 8.2 percent.Number of economic recessions in the last century ‚Äì 18With 18 recessions in the last 100 years  one would occur every five years or so. While there is always that massive risk in the stock market  staying invested is the key to outliving such market crashes.Zoom stock gain in 2020 ‚Äì 248 percentWhile many companies have suffered from losses during the Covid lockdowns  there are a few that made bank. For example  zoom  a company that offers a teleconferencing platform  was one of the top gainers in 2020. From trading at under 69 dollars per share  it skyrocketed to more than 239 dollars in less than a year.Percentage of US households with equity overseas ‚Äì 10 percentTen percent of U.S. households had equity in foreign investments  according to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs Survey of Consumer Finances. This was up from 7 percent three years ago. The survey does not specify the percentage of households with overseas investments held in the form of equity.Number of recessions since 2000 (excluding Covid recession) ‚Äì 2There have been two recessions since 2000  excluding the Covid recession. The first was from 2001 to 2002 and the second was from 2007 to 2009.Projected assets to be managed by robo advisors in 2022 ‚Äì 1.78 trillion dollarsRobo advisors are expected to manage a staggering 1.78 trillion dollars in assets in just a few years. That represents a massive opportunity for these cutting-edge investment firms  and it‚Äôs one that they are well-positioned to capitalize on.Major global stock exchanges ‚Äì 60These include the likes of the New York Stock Exchange  Nasdaq  London Stock Exchange  and Tokyo Stock Exchange. Each one offers investors a different range of opportunities to buy and sell stocks.Age of the longest operating stock exchange (Frankfurt Stock Exchange) ‚Äì 436 yearsThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange is one of the oldest stock exchanges globally. It was founded in 1585 by an edict of Emperor Maximilian I. This makes it the oldest still operating exchange in the world. The exchange is also one of the largest in Germany  with a market capitalization of over ‚Ç¨1 trillion.NASDAQ stock exchange size ‚Äì 3 767 listed companiesThe NASDAQ is a relatively young exchange  having only been founded in 1971. It was the first stock exchange to be entirely electronic  and it has remained at the forefront of technological innovation ever since. Today  the NASDAQ is one of the most widely-used and respected stock exchanges globally.Jacob Maslow is a native New Yorker with five children.

All you need to know News,16 hours ago,"FDJ SHARES - After a very noticeable IPO  the FDJ share remains below the 22 euro mark. Find in our article all the information about La Fran√ßaise des Jeux.[Updated on December 05  2019 at 10:32 a.m.] The month of November was marked by the privatization and listing of La Fran√ßaise des Jeux on Euronext. More than 500 000 individuals have subscribed to FDJ shares. The first day of trading was marked by a sharp rise in the opening  the stock exceeding 23 euros per share during the very first minutes of trading. The rise in the FDJ stock is partly linked to the priority given to small savers (orders of less than 2 000 euros were served in priority)  to the detriment of institutional investors. Clearly  they may have come forward more to buy shares  so that demand was greater than supply. Another determining factor is a limited supply. Small savers are encouraged by the State to keep their shares (at least 18 months to acquire one for free after having acquired ten).Since that first day on the stock market  FDJ shares have fallen back below the 22 euro mark  a price that is still high. Indeed  small savers may be tempted to sell their shares to pocket the capital gain  at the risk of losing the benefits promised by the State. As a sign of the interest in this operation  the company announced the release of a package of additional titles on Wednesday. The IPO of La Fran√ßaise des Jeux has become the largest operation in France since Natixis in 2006.On the eve of the FDJ's IPO  the share price of La Fran√ßaise des Jeux was set at 19.90 euros for institutional investors and 19.50 euros for individuals by Bruno Le Maire. As a reminder  the latter benefit from a discount of 2% on the price. The purchase of ten shares  and their conservation for eighteen months  also makes it possible to acquire one for free. These incentive schemes are intended to bring small savers back to the stock market  when they had deserted it after the 2008 crisis.This is the question asked by many small savers who have bought FDJ shares. Indeed  the FDJ title has certainly fallen compared to the first day of trading  but the price remains high. However  it is advisable to avoid the ""stock market blow"": La Fran√ßaise des Jeux is considered a yield value. By choosing to sell  you risk losing the benefits granted by the State.As the Boursorama site recently pointed out  it is advisable to set management objectives - upwards or downwards - when you own shares to see more in the long term  and not to panic as soon as the price is rising or falling. For example  you decide to sell a security only above a certain gain or loss.Individuals cannot buy shares in La Fran√ßaise des Jeux as they see fit. It is imperative to have a stock savings plan (PEA) or a securities account. To do this  you must contact your usual banking contact. If you hesitate between these two products  know that with the securities account  you can acquire shares of European and foreign companies. The PEA does not allow this  but it has more attractive taxation. Once you have made your choice  you must place a purchase order with several information as follows:As mentioned earlier  the FDJ is often considered a yield value. It presents recurring dividends and its activity  focused on gambling  is weakly influenced by the economic situation. La Fran√ßaise des Jeux has several figures in its favour. The company boasts an average stake growth of ""5% per year for 25 years"" and bets on ‚Ç¨16.9 billion in stakes in 2019  up 7% from last year.""More than the share price  it is necessary to look at the dividends""  insisted Philippe Crevel  director of the Cercle de l'Epargne  with Linternaute.com. ""The added value  it should be considered more as a bonus"".The risks to which one is exposed by buying FDJ sharesAs noted by Le Revenu  the title of La Fran√ßaise des Jeux confirms for the time being its profile as a yield value  resisting the volatile nature of the stock market. Between November 21 and December 3  FDJ shares lost 0.80%  the magazine notes. Before investing  it is therefore advisable to look at the timing and the stock market price. As Boursorama pointed out  a downward movement is not necessarily a sign that you should jump at the chance and acquire shares immediately. The reasons for a decline  and therefore investor disaffection  can be multiple. If you are new to the markets  therefore  be particularly careful and thoughtful.In addition  the Fran√ßaise des Jeux will have to pay 380 million euros to the State to maintain its monopoly. The company will most certainly have to borrow  which will weigh on the net result and  ultimately  on the title. There are also longer term risks. In the registration document (382 pages long and approved by the AMF) which you can consult here  La Fran√ßaise des Jeux lists a series of risks. In detail  the operator believes in particular that a change in the regulatory framework  for example  could be harmful by ‚Äúputting constraints on its growth strategy‚Äù or ‚Äúaffecting [its] ability to recruit new players‚Äù.In this case  how to limit the capital risk? Experts recommend diversifying. Clearly  if you start  it is advisable to buy shares of other companies  in addition to those of the Fran√ßaise des Jeux. The Boursorama site thus recommends that a line not exceed ""20% within your portfolio""  but also not to concentrate your efforts on one and the same sector.Also  be wary of any information about the business you get from a friend or relative. A ""good tip"" that encourages you to invest may constitute insider trading. The latter is liable to a fine of up to 1.5 million euros and a prison sentence of two years. If the information in question is false  you expose yourself to a high risk of capital loss.Through the privatization of the Fran√ßaise des Jeux  the State wishes to supply a fund dedicated to innovation and industry to the tune of ""1.8 billion euros""  indicated the Minister of the Economy  Bruno Le Mayor. As a reminder  this operation was recorded under the Pacte law. This law was definitively adopted by Parliament in April  thus allowing the transfer of the majority of the capital to the private sector. As a reminder  the State remains present in the capital of the company  up to 20%.The privatization of La Fran√ßaise des Jeux could bring up to 1.9 billion euros to the State  during the IPO scheduled for Thursday  November 21. After privatization  the state will continue to pocket tax revenues estimated at 3.5 billion euros per year. The dividend will de facto fall since the State's participation in the capital will fall to 20%. For information  the State received 87 million euros for the 2018 financial year. CEO St√©phane Pallez indicated that the next dividend paid to all shareholders this year will be 122 million euros. ‚ÄúWe will not make shareholders pay the costs of privatization ‚Äù she assured.",neutral,0.2,0.78,0.02,mixed,0.08,0.16,0.77,True,English,"['FDJ share', 'Stock market', 'price', 'purchase', 'News', 'La Fran√ßaise des Jeux', 'usual banking contact', 'Bruno Le Maire', 'average stake growth', 'stock savings plan', 'stock market blow', 'many small savers', 'longer term risks', 'stock market price', 'long term', 'Le Revenu', 'growth strategy', 'FDJ stock', '22 euro mark', 'first day', 'first minutes', 'institutional investors', 'determining factor', 'additional titles', 'incentive schemes', 'management objectives', 'securities account', 'two products', 'foreign companies', 'attractive taxation', 'economic situation', 'several figures', 'Philippe Crevel', 'Cercle de', 'Linternaute.com', 'volatile nature', 'downward movement', 'investor disaffection', 'net result', 'registration document', 'regulatory framework', 'new players', 'yield value', 'FDJ share', 'sharp rise', 'limited supply', 'largest operation', 'ten shares', 'eighteen months', 'Boursorama site', 'The PEA', 'purchase order', 'several information', 'recurring dividends', 'last year', 'noticeable IPO', 'share price', '380 million euros', 'FDJ title', 'capital gain', '18 months', '23 euros', '2,000 euros', '19.90 euros', '19.50 euros', 'article', 'December', '10:32 a', 'November', 'privatization', 'listing', 'Euronext', 'More', '500,000 individuals', 'trading', 'opening', 'priority', 'orders', 'less', 'detriment', 'demand', 'State', 'benefits', 'sign', 'interest', 'company', 'release', 'package', 'Wednesday', 'France', 'Natixis', 'reminder', 'discount', 'conservation', '2008 crisis', 'question', 'example', 'security', 'loss', 'European', 'choice', 'activity', 'gambling', 'favour', '25 years', 'bets', 'stakes', 'director', 'Epargne', 'bonus', 'time', 'profile', 'magazine', 'timing', 'chance', 'reasons', 'decline', 'markets', 'monopoly', 'AMF', 'series', 'detail', 'operator', 'change', 'constraints', 'ability', 'case']",2022-05-15,2022-05-15,indonewyork.com
