Completion of the combination is planned to occur on 30 June 2022.Item 9: Resolution in respect of remuneration of the Chair and other members of the Board of DirectorsThe Nomination Committee proposes the following annual remuneration of the Chair and other members of the Board of Directors to be paid pro rata in relation to the period between the date on which the resolution takes legal effect and the end of the Annual General Meeting 2023:EUR 120 000 for the Chair of the Board of Directors;EUR 60 000 for each of the other members of the Board of Directors elected by the Extraordinary General Meeting (excluding the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer);EUR 10 000 for Chairs of Committees of the Board of Directors; andEUR 5 000 for other members of Committees of the Board of Directors (excluding Chairs of Committees of the Board of Directors)  with the total fees for Committee work (including fees for Chairs of Committees) not to exceed EUR 50 000.The resolution shall be conditional upon  and take legal effect in connection with  the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP. Completion of the combination is planned to occur on 30 June 2022.Item 10: Resolution in respect of Board LTIP 2022The Nomination Committee proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to establish a one-off long-term share-related incentive plan in the form of a share option plan for members of the Board of Directors of the Company on the terms and conditions set out below (the ‚ÄúBoard LTIP 2022‚Äù).Background and purposeThe reason for establishing a one-off long-term share-related incentive plan for the members of the Board of Directors is to align their interests with the interests of the shareholders as well as to provide market appropriate reward for a new business reflecting continuity  commitment and share price appreciation. The Nomination Committee believes that the Board LTIP 2022 will provide the Company with a crucial component to a competitive total compensation package to the members of the Board of Directors who are critical to the Company‚Äôs future success after the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP.Terms and conditionsThe Company will grant options (‚ÄúBoard Options‚Äù) free of charge to members of the Board of Directors (excluding the Chief Executive Officer) pursuant to the following principles.1. The Nomination Committee may grant a maximum of 450 000 Board Options to the Chair of the Board of Directors that is proposed to be elected under item 12 of the proposed agenda and a maximum of 225 000 Board Options to the other members of the Board of Directors (excluding the Chief Executive Officer) that are proposed to be elected under item 12 of the proposed agenda (i.e. a maximum of 1 125 000 Board Options in total). The value of the granted Board Options is to correspond to an amount equal to one year of the annual remuneration proposed under item 9 of the proposed agenda as determined using a customary valuation method.2. Each Board Option shall entitle the holder to purchase one share in the Company subject to the continued engagement as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. Accordingly  the maximum number of shares available for the participants under the Board LTIP 2022 shall be 1 125 000.3. The purchase price per share in the Company upon exercise of a Board Option (the ‚ÄúExercise Price‚Äù) shall correspond to 120 per cent of the volume weighted average price for the Company‚Äôs share on Nasdaq Stockholm during 18‚Äì22 July 2022  or a later period of five trading days as determined by the Nomination Committee in the event (a) completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP has not occurred by 18 July 2022 or (b) the volume weighted average price during 18‚Äì22 July 2022 is not deemed to be an appropriate Exercise Price due to intervening changes in the Group  the market or otherwise in the industry.4. Instead of participants purchasing shares by paying the Exercise Price at exercise of the Board Options  the primary settlement method shall be to ‚Äúnet equity settle‚Äù the Board Options  meaning that the purchase price for each share shall be equal to the quotient value of the share (currently approximately SEK 0.01 per share) and that the number of shares that may be purchased shall be reduced by applying the following formula:Adjusted number of shares = ((A minus B) multiplied by D) divided by (A minus C)  where:A = the volume weighted average price for the Company‚Äôs share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately preceding the date of exercise of the Board OptionB = the Exercise PriceC = the quotient value of the Company‚Äôs shareD = the number of Board Options exercised by the participantOnly whole shares (no fractions) may be delivered and the number of shares delivered at net equity settlement shall thus be rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares.5. In the event a participant cannot exercise its Board Options to purchase shares in the Company under applicable laws or regulations or at reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative effort by the participant or the Company  the Nomination Committee shall have the right to decide to wholly or partly settle the Board Options in cash. The Nomination Committee shall also have the right to in its own discretion decide that shares and/or cash shall be withheld by the Company in order to cover or facilitate the payment of applicable taxes.6. The intention is that the Nomination Committee shall resolve to grant Board Options on 1 August 2022  but the Nomination Committee shall be authorised to in its own discretion finally determine the date of grant after the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP taking into account any potential restrictions under applicable laws or regulations. The Board Options shall vest on 31 July 2025 (the ‚ÄúVesting Date‚Äù). The three-year period from 1 August 2022 to the Vesting Date is referred to as the ‚ÄúVesting Period‚Äù. After the end of the Vesting Period  participants shall be entitled to exercise all or part of the Board Options until 31 July 2029.7. In the event of a change of control of the Company or a direct or indirect sale  transfer or other disposal of all or substantially all of the business and assets  the Vesting Period shall be deemed to have completed and the participants shall be entitled to exercise the Board Options as of the date when the transaction becomes unconditional.8. Continued engagement as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company during the entire Vesting Period shall be a condition for the Board Options to vest. If the participant‚Äôs engagement as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company is discontinued after the expiry of the Vesting Period  the participant shall only be entitled to exercise Board Options during a period of six months  which may be reasonably extended taking into account any potential restrictions under applicable laws or regulations. The Nomination Committee shall be authorised to waive and alter these conditions according to circumstances deemed reasonable.9. In order to further align the interests of the members of Board of Directors with the interests of the shareholders  each participant shall be required to undertake to retain shares received when exercising the Board Options to such an extent that the participant‚Äôs personal ownership of shares in the Company equals 100 per cent of the participant‚Äôs regular annual board remuneration (as proposed under item 9 of the proposed agenda).10. The Nomination Committee shall recalculate the maximum number of shares (per Board Option and in total) and the Exercise Price in the event of intervening rights issues  bonus issues  share splits  reverse share splits  dividends or similar events.11. The Nomination Committee shall be responsible for the detailed terms and the administration of the Board LTIP 2022 within the scope and framework of this proposal.Delivery of shares and hedging of costsIn order to secure the delivery of shares to the participants and cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges) at exercise of Board Options under the Board LTIP 2022  the Nomination Committee proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to issue up to 1 237 500 warrants of series 2022:1 (see item 11 a) of the proposed agenda).In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the Nomination Committee‚Äôs proposal to issue and transfer warrants of series 2022:1 under item 11 a) of the proposed agenda is not satisfied  the Nomination Committee proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves that the Nomination Committee shall instruct the Company to hedge its obligations under the Board LTIP 2022 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Board LTIP 2022 (see item 11 b) of the proposed agenda).Estimated costsThe Board LTIP 2022 grants participants the right on vesting to purchase shares in the Company for a price equivalent to the Exercise Price. The Board LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and the costs will be charged to the income statement over the period the Board Options are earned.The maximum cost for granting Board Options under the Board LTIP 2022 (assuming 100 per cent vesting)  excluding costs related to delivery of shares and social security charges  is approximately SEK 3.2 million. Under a scenario where the share price grows by 10 per cent per annum  the maximum cost for social security charges is estimated to be less than SEK 0.1 million if Board Options are exercised on the Vesting Date.Effects on key figuresThe effects on key figures depend on the share price development. Assuming a share price no lower than SEK 7.50; giving an Exercise Price no lower than SEK 9.00 (which includes a 20 per cent premium on the assumed quoted share price); a volatility of 40 per cent; a risk-free rate of 2 per cent; a 0 per cent dividend yield; and exercise after 7 years  the maximum number of shares required under the Board LTIP 2022 amounts to approximately 1.1 million shares in the Company (subject to final determination of the Exercise Price)  corresponding to approximately 0.4 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. If the Exercise Price is set above SEK 9.00  the maximum number of shares will decrease with the expected costs constant  and if the Exercise Price is set below SEK 9.00  the maximum number of shares will be constant with a decrease in expected costs. The Board LTIP 2022 is expected to have only marginal effects on the Company‚Äôs key figures.If the Board Options are ‚Äúnet equity settled‚Äù  the number of shares used can be significantly reduced. Under a scenario where the share price grows by 10 per cent per annum  the use of shares if all Board Options were exercised on vesting just after the end of the Vesting Period would decrease from 0.4 per cent to less than 0.1 per cent and if all Board Options were exercised just before the end of the exercise period on 31 July 2029 to less than 0.2 per cent.If the warrant settlement method proposed under item 11 a) of the proposed agenda is not approved with the requisite majority and the Company‚Äôs obligations under the Board LTIP 2022 are settled by way of an equity swap arrangement with a third party  no dilution effect will arise.Preparation of the proposalThe Board LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Nomination Committee in consultation with external advisers. The Chairman of the Nomination Committee and proposed member of the Board of Directors Aksel Azrac did not participate in the process.Other long-term share-related incentive plans for members of the Board of DirectorsThe Company does not have any outstanding long-term share-related incentive plans for members of the Board of Directors. For information about outstanding programs to employees  please see the corresponding section in the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal under item 15 of the proposed agenda.ConditionsThe resolution shall be conditional upon  and take legal effect in connection with  the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP. Completion of the combination is planned to occur on 30 June 2022.Majority requirementA resolution in accordance with the Nomination Committee‚Äôs proposal regarding the establishment of the Board LTIP 2022 requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.A resolution in accordance with the Nomination Committee‚Äôs proposal regarding the issue and transfer of warrants of series 2022:1 under item 11 a) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenth (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Extraordinary General Meeting. A resolution in accordance with the Nomination Committees proposal regarding the equity swap arrangement under item 11 b) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.Item 11 a)‚Äìb): Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the Board LTIP 2022 through (a) an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2022:1 or (b) an equity swap arrangement with a third partyBackgroundUnder the Board LTIP 2022 proposed by the Nomination Committee under item 10 of the proposed agenda  the Company has an obligation  subject to certain conditions  to deliver shares in the Company to the participants in the Board LTIP 2022.In order to secure the Company‚Äôs obligation to deliver shares and to cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges)  the Nomination Committee proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to issue and transfer up to 1 237 500 warrants of series 2022:1 on the terms and conditions set out in item 11 a) below. In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the proposed warrant settlement method is not satisfied  the Nomination Committee proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to approve that the Nomination Committee instructs the Company to hedge its obligations under the Board LTIP 2022 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) on the terms and conditions set out in item 11 b) below.The Nomination Committee considers the warrant settlement method to be the preferred alternative since the costs for an equity swap arrangement are significantly higher than the costs for issuing and transferring warrants. If the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to approve the proposed warrant settlement method under item 11 a) below with the requisite majority  the Nomination Committee intends to withdraw its equity swap arrangement proposal under item 11 b) below.Item 11 a): Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the Board LTIP 2022 through an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2022:1In order to secure the Company‚Äôs obligation to deliver shares under the Board LTIP 2022  the Nomination Committee proposes that the Extraordinary General Meetings resolves to issue and transfer warrants of series 2022:1 in the Company on the following terms and conditions:A maximum of 1 237 500 warrants shall be issued.The right to subscribe for warrants shall  with deviation of the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  rest with the Company itself.The reason for deviating from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights is to secure the Company‚Äôs obligations to deliver shares and to cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the Board LTIP 2022.Subscription for the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list not later than 1 August 2022.The warrants shall be issued free of charge.Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company. The subscription price for each new share shall be equal to the quotient value of the Company‚Äôs share.The warrants may be exercised during the period from and including 1 August 2022 up to and including 1 August 2030.The new shares shall carry rights to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs after subscription has been effected.The subscription price and the number of shares for which each warrant entitles subscription may be re-calculated under certain circumstances as set forth in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants.Upon exercise of all 1 237 500 warrants  the Company‚Äôs share capital will increase by SEK 15 056.10 (based on a quotient value of approximately SEK 0.01). If the subscription price exceeds the quotient value of the shares  the excess amount shall be allotted to the non-restricted statutory reserve (Sw. den fria √∂verkursfonden).The Company may transfer up to 1 237 500 warrants (a) free of charge to participants (and/or a designated third party) for the purpose of enabling the delivery of shares in the Company at exercise of Board Options under the Board LTIP 2022 and (b) at a price equal to the fair market value of the warrants as determined using a customary valuation method to a designated third party for the purpose of covering any costs (including taxes and social security charges) at exercise of Board Options under the Board LTIP 2022.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants of series 2022:1  a transcript of the Company‚Äôs Articles of Association and documents prepared pursuant to Chapter 14  section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act will be available at the Company and on the Company‚Äô website  www.lundin-energy.com  not later than three weeks prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting.The resolution shall be conditional upon  and take legal effect in connection with  the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP.

The Nomination Committee appointed in accordance with the proposed revised Nomination Committee Process shall replace the Nomination Committee for the Annual General Meeting 2023 appointed in accordance with the Nomination Committee Process adopted at the Annual General Meeting 2020 (if a new Nomination Committee for the Annual General Meeting 2023 already has been appointed prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting‚Äôs resolution to adopt this revised instruction taking legal effect).The resolution shall be conditional upon  and take legal effect in connection with  the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP.

The main changes to the Policy are:redefined categories of performance measures for the annual bonus plan; andlong-term incentive redefined to accommodate the changes to structure and business  calculated on a fair value basis.The Company is looking to reward a different strategy and growth model appropriate for a new renewable energy company with a downsized organisational make-up. In particular  the proposed Policy on Remuneration for Group Management wants reward to reflect the re-emphasis on the Company‚Äôs entrepreneurial culture and roots. For 2022 the application of the proposed Policy will therefore mean that base salaries  annual bonus opportunities and benefits for Group Management are considerably reduced from the current levels at Lundin Energy and are set below the market median level  in combination with grant levels under the Employee LTIP 2022 (proposed under item 15) set to deliver competitive pay and better if significant value creation is achieved for all shareholders.The resolution shall be conditional upon  and take legal effect in connection with  the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP. Completion of the combination is planned to occur on 30 June 2022.POLICY ON REMUNERATION FOR GROUP MANAGEMENTApplication of the PolicyThis Policy on Remuneration applies to the remuneration of ‚ÄúGroup Management‚Äù at the Company  which includes (i) the Chief Executive Officer (the ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù)  (ii) the Deputy CEO  who from time to time may be designated from one of the other members of Group Management  and (iii) executives so designated by the Board. The Policy also applies to members of the Board of Directors (the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù) of the Company where remuneration is paid for work performed outside the directorship.The Policy is  together with previous years‚Äô Policies  available on the Company‚Äôs website and it will remain available for ten years.Key remuneration principles at the CompanyThe Company‚Äôs remuneration principles and policies are designed to ensure responsible and sustainable remuneration decisions that support the Company‚Äôs strategy  shareholders‚Äô long-term interests and sustainable business practices. It is the aim of the Company to recruit  motivate and retain high calibre executives capable of achieving the objectives of the Company and to encourage and appropriately and fairly reward executives for their contributions to the Company‚Äôs success.Remuneration to members of the BoardIn addition to Board fees resolved by the General Meeting  remuneration as per prevailing market conditions may be paid to members of the Board for work performed outside the directorship.Compensation CommitteeThe Board has established a Compensation Committee to support it on matters of remuneration relating to the CEO  the Deputy CEO (if appointed)  other members of Group Management and other key employees of the Company. The objective of the Committee is to structure and implement remuneration principles to achieve the Company‚Äôs strategy  the principal matters for consideration being:the review and implementation of the Company‚Äôs remuneration principles for Group Management  including this Policy which requires approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders;the remuneration of the CEO and the Deputy CEO (if appointed)  as well as other members of Group Management  and any other specific remuneration issues arising;the design of long-term incentive plans that require approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders; andcompliance with relevant rules and regulatory provisions  such as this Policy  the Swedish Companies Act  the Swedish Corporate Governance Code and the Swedish Corporate Governance Board‚Äôs Rules on Remuneration of the Board and Executive Management and on Incentive Programmes.When the Committee makes decisions  including determining  reviewing and implementing the Policy  it follows a process where:the Board sets and reviews the terms of reference of the Committee;the Chair of the Committee approves the Committee‚Äôs agenda;the Committee considers any reports  data and presentations and debates any proposal. In its considerations the Committee will give due regard to the Company‚Äôs situation  the general and industry specific remuneration environment  the remuneration and terms of employment of the broader employee population  feedback from different stakeholders  relevant codes  regulations and guidelines published from time to time;the Committee may request the advice and assistance of management representatives  other internal expertise and of external advisors. However  it shall ensure that there is no conflict of interest regarding other assignments that any such advisors may have for the Company and Group Management;the Committee ensures through a requirement to notify and recuse oneself that no individual with a conflict of interest will take part in a remuneration decision that may compromise such a decision;once the Committee is satisfied that it has been properly and sufficiently informed  it will make its decisions and  where required  formulate proposals for approval by the Board; andthe Board will consider any items for approval or proposals from the Committee and  following its own discussions  make decisions  proposals for a General Meeting of Shareholders and/or further requests for the Committee to deliberate on.Elements of remuneration for Group ManagementThere are four key elements to the remuneration of Group Management:Description  purpose and link to strategy and sustainability Process and governance Relative share of total reward1 a) Base salary - Fixed cash remuneration paid monthly. Provides predictable remuneration to aid attraction and retention of key talent. - The Committee reviews salaries every year as part of the review of total remuneration (see below for a description of the benchmarking process). 30% b) Annual variable remuneration - Annual bonus is paid for performance over the financial year.- Each position has a set expected bonus opportunity  which can be up to the equivalent of 12 months‚Äô base salary.- Any value awarded by the Board that is more than 12 months‚Äô base salary is paid for delivering outstanding performance  subject to a maximum cap of 18 months base salary.- Signals and rewards the strategic andoperational results and behaviours expected for the year that contribute to the long-term  sustainable value creation of the Company.- The annual review of total remuneration also considers annual bonus awards  outcomes  target structure  weightings of targets and specific target levels of performance.- Measurable financial and non-financial performance requirements are identified according to position and responsibilities and include delivery against power generation  investment  financial  ESG and strategic targets.- The Committee reviews the design of annual variable remuneration separately. 15% c) Long-term incentive plan - Annual awards of equity-based long-term incentives  approved by the General Meeting  that align the interests of participants with those of shareholders.- Awards may be granted with a fair value of up to 300% of base salary at award.- Annual review of total remuneration considers long-term incentive awards and outcomes.- Group Management are required to build asignificant personal shareholding of up to 100% of base salary (200% for the CEO) over time by retaining 50% of exercised shares  net of tax  untilthe predetermined limit for the personal shareholding has been achieved.- The Committee reviews the design oflong-term incentives separately. 50% d) Benefits - Predictable benefits to help facilitate the discharge of each executive‚Äôs duties  aiding the attraction and retention of key talent. - The Committee reviews benefits and contractual terms regularly to ensure that the Company does not fall behind the market.- Benefits are set with reference toexternal market practices  internal practices  position and relevant reference remuneration. 5% Total 100%1 Estimated reward shows the percentage of total reward where proportions are estimated assuming 50 per cent of maximum annual bonus and the fair value of the long-term incentive without any further share price or dividend effect. Different actual awards and the variable nature of incentives means that the actual proportions for an individual may be different.Review and benchmarkingThe Committee undertakes reviews of the Company‚Äôs remuneration policies and practices considering the total remuneration of each executive as well as the individual components. Levels are set considering:the total remuneration opportunity;the external pay market;the scope and responsibilities of the position;the skills  experience and performance of the individual;the Company‚Äôs performance  affordability of reward and general market conditions; andlevels and increases in remuneration  as well as other terms of employment  for other positions within the Company.External benchmarks for total remuneration are acquired when the Committee considers it necessary  consisting of one or more sets of companies that compete with the Company for talent  taking into consideration factors like size  complexity  geography and business profile when determining such peer groups.Variable remunerationThe Company considers that variable remuneration forms important parts of executives‚Äô remuneration packages  where associated performance targets reflect the key drivers for pursuing the Company‚Äôs strategy  and to achieve sustainable value creation and growth in long-term shareholder value. The Committee ensures that performance and design align with the strategic direction and risk appetite of the Company before incentives are approved by the Board.There is no deferral of incentive payments  however  the Board can recover annual bonuses paid in the unlikely event of outcomes based on information which is subsequently proven to have been manifestly misstated. The Board can also in exceptional circumstances reduce long-term incentive awards  including reducing them to zero  should it consider the vesting outcome to incorrectly reflect the true performance of the Company.BenefitsBenefits provided shall be based on market terms and shall facilitate the discharge of each executive‚Äôs duties. The pension provision is the main benefit and follows the local practice of the geography where the individual is based. The pension benefits consist of a basic defined contribution pension plan  where the employer provides 60 per cent and the employee 40 per cent of an annual contribution of up to 18 per cent of the capped pensionable salary and  at the Board‚Äôs discretion  a supplemental defined contribution pension plan where the employer provides 60 per cent and the employee 40 per cent of a contribution up to 14 per cent of the capped pensionable salary.Severance arrangementsExecutives have rolling contracts where mutual notice periods of up to twelve months apply between the Company and the executive. In addition  severance terms are incorporated into the employment contracts for executives that give rise to compensation in the event of termination of employment due to a change of control of the Company. Such compensation  together with applicable notice periods  shall not exceed 24 months‚Äô base salary.The Board is further authorised  in individual cases  to approve severance arrangements  in addition to the notice periods and the severance arrangements in respect of a change of control of the Company  where employment is terminated by the Company without cause  or otherwise in circumstances at the discretion of the Board. Such severance arrangements may provide for the payment of up to 12 months‚Äô base salary.In all circumstances  severance payments in aggregate (i.e. for notice periods and severance arrangements) shall be limited to a maximum of 24 months‚Äô base salary.Item 15: Resolution in respect of Employee LTIP 2022The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to establish a long-term share-related incentive plan in the form of a share option plan for members of Group Management and other employees of the Company on the terms and conditions set out below (the ‚ÄúEmployee LTIP 2022‚Äù).Background and purposeThe reason for establishing the Employee LTIP 2022 is to align the interests of the members of Group Management and other employees with the interests of the shareholders as well as to provide market appropriate reward for a new business reflecting continuity  commitment and share price appreciation. The Board of Directors believes that the Employee LTIP 2022 will provide the Company with a crucial component to a competitive total compensation package to attract and retain employees who are critical to the Company‚Äôs future success after the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP.The Employee LTIP 2022 is being introduced as part of a new remuneration approach within the new Policy on Remuneration for Group Management proposed under item 14 of the agenda  where base salaries and annual bonus opportunities have been set at the lower end of the market to create an overall remuneration approach that further emphasises the long-term sustainable growth and strategic success of the Company.Terms and conditionsSubject to the terms and conditions of the Employee LTIP 2022  the Company will grant options (‚ÄúEmployee Options‚Äù) free of charge to members of Group Management and other employees as allocated by the Board of Directors  or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors  pursuant to the following principles.1. The maximum number of Employee Options that may be granted is 8 400 000. Each Employee Option shall entitle the holder to purchase one share in the Company subject to continued employment within the Group. Accordingly  the maximum number of shares available for the participants under the Employee LTIP 2022 shall be 8 400 000.2. The Board of Directors shall at its discretion be entitled to grant Employee Options to all employees following the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP (approximately 15 employees). The Chief Executive Officer may be granted up to 2 800 000 Employee Options and other employees may be granted up to 1 400 000 Employee Options each (subject to the cap of 8 400 000 Employee Options in total).3. The purchase price per share in the Company upon exercise of an Employee Option (the ‚ÄúExercise Price‚Äù) shall correspond to the volume weighted average price for the Company‚Äôs share on Nasdaq Stockholm during 18‚Äì22 July 2022  or a later period of five trading days as determined by the Board of Directors in the event (a) completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP has not occurred by 18 July 2022 or (b) the volume weighted average price during 18‚Äì22 July 2022 is not deemed to be an appropriate Exercise Price due to intervening changes in the Group  the market or otherwise in the industry.4. Instead of participants purchasing shares by paying the Exercise Price at exercise of the Employee Options  the primary settlement method shall be to ‚Äúnet equity settle‚Äù the Employee Options  meaning that the purchase price for each share shall be equal to the quotient value of the share (currently approximately SEK 0.01 per share) and that the number of shares that may be purchased shall be reduced by applying the following formula:Adjusted number of shares = ((A minus B) multiplied by D) divided by (A minus C)  where:A = the volume weighted average price for the Company‚Äôs share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately preceding the date of exercise of the Employee OptionB = the Exercise PriceC = the quotient value of the Company‚Äôs shareD = the number of Employee Options exercised by the participantOnly whole shares (no fractions) may be delivered and the number of shares delivered at net equity settlement shall thus be rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares.5. In the event a participant cannot exercise its Employee Options to purchase shares in the Company under applicable laws or regulations or at reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative effort by the participant or the Company  the Board of Directors shall have the right to decide to wholly or partly settle the Employee Options in cash. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to in its own discretion decide that shares and/or cash shall be withheld by the Company in order to cover or facilitate the payment of applicable taxes.6. The intention is that the Board of Directors shall grant Employee Options on 1 August 2022  but the Board of Directors shall be authorised to in its own discretion finally determine the date of grant after the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP taking into account any potential restrictions under applicable laws or regulations. The Employee Options shall vest on 31 July 2025 (the ‚ÄúVesting Date‚Äù). The three-year period from 1 August 2022 to the Vesting Date is referred to as the ‚ÄúVesting Period‚Äù. After the end of the Vesting Period  participants shall be entitled to exercise all or part of the Employee Options until 31 July 2029.7. In the event of a change of control of the Company or a direct or indirect sale  transfer or other disposal of all or substantially all of the business and assets  the Vesting Period shall be deemed to have completed and the participants shall be entitled to exercise the Employee Options as of the date when the transaction becomes unconditional.8. Continued employment within the group during the entire Vesting Period shall be a condition for the Employee Options to vest. If the participant resigns after the expiry of the Vesting Period  the participant shall only be entitled to exercise Employee Options during a period of three months following the last day of employment  which may be reasonably extended taking into account any potential restrictions under applicable laws or regulations. The Board of Directors shall be authorised to waive and alter these conditions according to circumstances deemed reasonable.9. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to recalculate the maximum number of shares (per Employee Option and in total) and the Exercise Price in the event of intervening rights issues  bonus issues  share splits  reverse share splits  dividends or similar events.10. In order to further align the interests of the members of Group Management with the interests of the shareholders  each member of Group Management shall be required to undertake to retain a minimum of 50 per cent of the shares received when exercising the Employee Options (net after taxes) until the participant has built a personal ownership of shares in the Company equal to 100 per cent of the participant‚Äôs annual gross base salary (200 per cent for the Chief Executive Officer).11. The Board of Directors  or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors  shall be responsible for the detailed terms and the administration of the Employee LTIP 2022 within the scope and framework of this proposal. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to adopt different terms and conditions e.g. due to new recruitment  illness  disability  death  redundancy  contractual retirement and other exceptional circumstances determined by the Board of Directors.Delivery of shares and hedging of costsIn order to secure the delivery of shares to the participants and cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges) at exercise of Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2022  the Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to issue up to 8 560 000 warrants of series 2022:2 (see item 16 a) of the proposed agenda).In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal to issue and transfer warrants of series 2022:2 under item 16 a) of the proposed agenda is not satisfied  the Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company hedges its obligations under the Employee LTIP 2022 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employee LTIP 2022 (see item 16 b) of the proposed agenda).Estimated costsThe Employee LTIP 2022 grants participants the right on vesting to purchase shares in the Company for a price equivalent to the Exercise Price. The Employee LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and the costs will be charged to the income statement over the period the Employee Options are earned.The maximum cost for granting Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2022 (assuming 100 per cent vesting)  excluding costs related to delivery of shares and social security charges  is approximately SEK 27.5 million. Under a scenario where the share price grows by 10 per cent per annum  the maximum cost for social security charges is estimated to be approximately SEK 0.5 million if Employee Options are exercised on the Vesting Date.Effects on key figuresThe effects on key figures depend on the share price development. Assuming a share price and Exercise Price no lower than SEK 7.50; a volatility of 40 per cent; a risk-free rate of 2 per cent; a 0 per cent dividend yield; and exercise after 7 years  the number of shares required under the Employee LTIP 2022 amounts to approximately 8.4 million shares in the Company (subject to final determination of the Exercise Price)  corresponding to approximately 2.9 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. If the Exercise Price is set above SEK 7.50 the maximum number of shares will decrease with the expected costs constant  and if the Exercise Price is set below SEK 7.50  the maximum number of shares will be constant with a decrease in expected costs. The Employee LTIP 2022 is expected to have only marginal effects on the Company‚Äôs key figures.If the Employee Options are ‚Äúnet equity settled‚Äù  the number of shares used can be significantly reduced. Under a scenario where the share price grows by 10 per cent per annum  the use of shares if all Employee Options were exercised on vesting just after the end of the Vesting Period would decrease from a maximum of 2.9 per cent to less than 0.8 per cent and if all Employee Options were exercised just before the end of the exercise period on 31 July 2029 to less than 1.5 per cent.If the warrant settlement method proposed under item 16 a) of the proposed agenda is not approved with the requisite majority and the Company‚Äôs obligations under the Employee LTIP 2022 are settled by way of an equity swap arrangement with a third party  no dilution effect will arise.Preparation of the proposalThe Employee LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the members of the Board of Directors that are proposed to be re-elected for the period until the close of the Annual General Meeting 2023 ‚Äì i.e. C. Ashley Heppenstall  Grace Reksten Skaugen and Jakob Thomasen (see item 12 of the proposed agenda) ‚Äì in consultation with external advisers.Other long-term share-related incentive plans for employeesIn connection with the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP  the Company‚Äôs currently outstanding long-term share related incentive plans (adopted at the Annual General Meetings in 2019  2020 and 2021) will lapse and be terminated.ConditionsThe resolution shall be conditional upon  and take legal effect in connection with  the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP. Completion of the combination is planned to occur on 30 June 2022.Majority requirementA resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal regarding the establishment of the Employee LTIP 2022 requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal regarding the issue and transfer of warrants of series 2022:2 under item 16 a) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenth (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Extraordinary General Meeting. A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal regarding the equity swap arrangement under item 16 b) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.Item 16: Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the Employee LTIP 2022 through (a) an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2022:2 or (b) an equity swap arrangement with a third partyBackgroundUnder the Employee LTIP 2022 proposed by the Board of Directors under item 15 of the proposed agenda  the Company has an obligation  subject to certain conditions  to deliver shares in the Company to the participants in the Employee LTIP 2022.In order to secure the Company‚Äôs obligation to deliver shares and to cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges)  the Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to issue and transfer up to 8 560 000 warrants of series 2022:2 on the terms and conditions set out in item 16 a) below. In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the proposed warrant settlement method is not satisfied  the Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company hedges its obligations under the Employee LTIP 2022 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) on the terms and conditions set out in item 16 b) below.The Board of Directors considers the warrant settlement method to be the preferred alternative since the costs for an equity swap arrangement are significantly higher than the costs for issuing and transferring warrants. If the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to approve the proposed warrant settlement method under item 16 a) below with the requisite majority  the Board of Directors‚Äô intends to withdraw its equity swap arrangement proposal under item 16 b) below.Item 16 a): Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the Employee LTIP 2022 through an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2022:2In order to secure the Company‚Äôs obligation to deliver shares under the Employee LTIP 2022  the Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meetings resolves to issue and transfer warrants of series 2022:2 in the Company on the following terms and conditions:A maximum of 8 560 000 warrants shall be issued.The right to subscribe for warrants shall  with deviation of the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  rest with the Company itself.The reason for deviating from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights is to secure the Company‚Äôs obligations to deliver shares and to cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the Employee LTIP 2022.Subscription for the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list not later than 1 August 2022.The warrants shall be issued free of charge.Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company. The subscription price for each new share shall be equal to the quotient value of the Company‚Äôs share.The warrants may be exercised during the period from and including 1 August 2022 up to and including 1 August 2030.The new shares shall carry rights to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs after subscription has been effected.The subscription price and the number of shares for which each warrant entitles subscription may be re-calculated under certain circumstances as set forth in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants.Upon exercise of all 8 560 000 warrants  the Company‚Äôs share capital will increase by SEK 104 145.59 (based on a quotient value of approximately SEK 0.01). If the subscription price exceeds the quotient value of the shares  the excess amount shall be allotted to the non-restricted statutory reserve (Sw. den fria √∂verkursfonden).The Company may transfer up to 8 560 000 warrants (a) free of charge to participants (and/or a designated third party) for the purpose of enabling the delivery of shares in the Company at exercise of Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2022 and (b) at a price equal to the fair market value of the warrants as determined using a customary valuation method to a designated third party for the purpose of covering any costs (including taxes and social security charges) at exercise of Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2022.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants of series 2022:2  a transcript of the Company‚Äôs Articles of Association and documents prepared pursuant to Chapter 14  section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act will be available at the Company and on the Company‚Äô website  www.lundin-energy.com  not later than three weeks prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting.The resolution shall be conditional upon  and take legal effect in connection with  the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP.

If the Board of Directors resolves to deviate from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  the reason shall be to enable or facilitate acquisitions of companies or businesses or other major investments.The total number of shares that can be issued based on the proposed authorisations under (i) and (ii) may not together exceed 28 500 000. If the authorisation is exercised in full for issues with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  the dilution effect is approximately ten per cent.The resolution shall be conditional upon  and take legal effect in connection with  the completion of the combination of the Company‚Äôs exploration & production business with Aker BP. Completion of the combination is planned to occur on 30 June 2022.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and of the shares represented at the Extraordinary General Meeting.Item 18: Resolution in respect of amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to amend ¬ß 1 (Name)  ¬ß 3 (Object of the Company) and ¬ß 11 (Participation at general meetings of shareholders) of the Articles of Association in accordance with the following.Current wording of ¬ß 1 (Name) :The name of the Company is Lundin Energy AB.

REUTERS/Jim Young/File PhotoNAPERVILLE  Ill.  May 15 (Reuters) - Speculators have been easing massively bullish bets in Chicago-traded grain and oilseed futures in recent weeks  though they have been hesitant to add too many shorts due to unprecedented price levels and continuing uncertainties over global supplies.That sentiment may have been confirmed late last week with the U.S. government‚Äôs first supply and demand outlooks for the upcoming year  which showed stocks remaining relatively narrow through mid-2023  especially for wheat.CBOT corn and soybean futures have softened so far this month  falling a little more than 2% in the week ended May 10. In that period  money managers cut their net long position in CBOT soybean futures and options to 130 661 contracts from 153 253 a week earlier.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterThat capped off their largest two-week soybean selling streak since June 2021 and their net long fell to the lowest levels since January  according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That move was led by the removal of gross longs.In CBOT corn futures and options  money managers reduced their net long by nearly 15 000 contracts through May 10 to 338 562  their least bullish since mid-February. Funds added gross corn shorts for a fifth consecutive week  though the adding was light.But corn and soy futures were up late last week. CBOT December corn futures set a contract high Friday of $7.58-1/2 per bushel  and November soybeans on the same day notched their highest settle of the month at $14.98-1/4.The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday unexpectedly cut U.S. corn trend yield because of delayed planting. Although U.S. stock projections for the upcoming year came in at expectations  the supply threat to the U.S. balance sheet as well as a Ukraine corn crop 54% smaller than last year renewed jitters.USDA also said U.S. farmers would harvest a record soybean crop in 2022  but 2022-23 U.S. ending stocks are set to grow only 75 million bushels  emphasizing the low margin for error.Managed money net position in CBOT soybean futures and optionsOILSHARE LIFTAs of May 10  money managers‚Äô view in the CBOT oilshare  measuring soyoil‚Äôs share of value in the soy products  was the most bullish since November at 36 062 futures and options contracts. They sold nearly 39 000 soybean meal contracts in the latest two-week stretch  the most for any two weeks since May 2021.The managed money soymeal net long as of May 10 was 52 314 contracts  the lowest since December. Most-active meal futures on Thursday hit $395 per short ton  the lowest since Jan. 26  but they ended up nearly 2% over the last three sessions.Money managers bought less than 3 000 soybean oil futures and options contracts through May 10 and their net long rose to 88 376. Most-active futures rose 3.4% between Wednesday and Friday  settling at 83.79 cents per pound Friday  its highest finish of the month.CBOT oilshare hit all-time highs late last week  reaching 52.7% on Thursday.Managed money net position in CBOT soybean meal futures and optionsWHEAT REVIVALWheat trade had stagnated in the few weeks following the March surge to record highs  but fresh concerns about global supplies have had futures on the rise this month  particularly after USDA‚Äôs forecast late last week.Traders have been uncomfortable with the slow pace of U.S. spring wheat planting  the poor condition of U.S. winter wheat  uncertainties in Ukraine  and unfavorable weather in India and France  among other things. USDA said on Thursday the U.S. hard red winter wheat crop would be the smallest since 1963  some 14% below what analysts thought.USDA‚Äôs 2022-23 world wheat supply outlook excluding China is near record lows relative to demand  down from the current year. read more Paris-traded Euronext wheat futures hit contract highs on Friday  and most-active Chicago wheat reached a two-month high of $11.98-1/2 per bushel.July Kansas City and Minneapolis wheat futures both set contract highs on Friday of $12.92 and $13.35-3/4 per bushel  respectively. So far in May  CBOT wheat had risen 11.5%  K.C. wheat 16%  Minneapolis 14% and Paris September wheat 10%.As of May 10  money managers remained very bullish in K.C. and Minneapolis wheat and modestly so in Chicago. They slightly raised their CBOT and K.C. net longs but barely shaved their Minneapolis one  and none have undergone huge changes in several weeks.However  trade estimates suggest commodity funds purchased 39 000 CBOT wheat futures contracts between Wednesday and Friday on 8% gains. Open interest in CBOT wheat remains the lowest for the date since 2009 and among the lowest for any date since.Karen Braun is a market analyst for Reuters.

The warrants will have a term of 12 years and become exercisable upon the maturity of Tranche A or upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g.  change of control  event of default repayment demand)  thus avoiding dilution for existing shareholders in the near term.At the maturity of Tranche A or upon the occurrence of certain events  the EIB will be granted an option to sell its warrants to Inventiva for an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value and the exercise price of the warrants2  as an alternative to the exercise of the warrants.About the European Investment Bank (EIB)The EIB is the European Union (EU) long-term financing institution  and its shareholders are the 27 EU Member States.

May 16  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- RuffleButts  the kids' swimwear and clothing company  has selected Centric Software¬Æ's Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solution. Centric Software provides the most innovative enterprise solutions to plan  design  develop  source and sell products such as apparel  footwear  sporting goods  furniture  home d√©cor  cosmetics  food & beverage and luxury to achieve strategic and operational digital transformation goals.RuffleButts Selects Centric PLM‚Ñ¢ as their Product Development Foundation""Our growth rate right now is phenomenal. I wanted to make sure that whatever company we chose could scale with us.""Based in a suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth  Texas  RuffleButts was founded 15 years ago starting with ruffled bloomers for baby girls  hence the name. The company creates joyful clothing for the treasured years of childhood. RuggedButts for boys was added later  offering a full wardrobe for girls and boys all the way into the tween years.Audrie Garcia  Production & Design Manager at RuffleButts  says  ""We're growing quite a bit and adding new product categories  new sizing‚Äîand it was just getting to be a lot to manage."" She talks about the manual work and duplicate data entry in a typical product development cycle  adding  ""We have hundreds of Google sheets for specs alone. Then we have different sheets for our color library  and a SKU creation doc on another sheet.""There were many steps on the creative side as well. Designers would have to copy-paste their designs from Adobe‚Ñ¢ Illustrator to a digital project board in the design phase. When the project moves on to development or production  the design gets re-entered into another sheet where tech packs are created and is finally sent to the factory  often via email. Garcia says  ""We're entering data in multiple spots. And things just get lost or missed  or someone changes the size in one doc but forgets to change it in another... We want to streamline the process overall.""Story continuesOn top of all that  being in the children's apparel category subjects the company to strict regulations to comply with government safety standards. Garcia says  ""There are so many rules  for example  no lead in the thread  zippers  buttons and obviously  flammability. We save that information on our internal shared drive  but you can't access it outside of the office. And it isn't currently linked back to any product. I may know that we have a testing document for certain products and where to go find it  but there's not an easy way for anyone  other than me  to know that this product has been tested.""RuffleButts decided on PLM as a strategy and evaluated a few providers. Much research and several demos took place over the course of a year. One of the most important features Garcia says  is ""scalability  because our growth rate right now is phenomenal. I wanted to make sure that whatever company we chose could scale with us. The PLM had to have capabilities beyond just the product team‚Äîwe may want to bring in more users like marketing  our e-commerce team  or our buyers and planners. During the demos  I eventually noticed that Centric was one of the only companies I saw that allows for that without going through a lot of hoop jumping.""Garcia expects to save a considerable amount of time once they are fully up and running. She states  ""I did the math a while ago. Overall  we will save about a week and a half's worth of work per season  just on the product engineering or data information side. On the design side  the Adobe Connect plugin is great to link Adobe Illustrator directly with Centric PLM; designers won't have to leave Illustrator  eliminating many of their repetitive tasks. It'll also help with calendar management and sample status‚Äîlooking at the Centric home screen  I could have a widget on my dashboard that tells me the status at a glance.""Chris Groves  President and CEO of Centric says  ""We are pleased to be partnering with RuffleButts  a fresh  rapidly growing company in the apparel space. They bring fun and functional clothing to families  and we are thrilled to have been selected as their partner.""Learn more about Centric PLMRequest a DemoRuffleButts (www.rufflebutts.com)We create joyful clothing for the treasured years of childhood.

The new results announced today are derived from a data extraction performed on April 25th  2022  which shows the continuous treatment effect for CMT1A patients treated with PXT3003 High Dose (‚ÄòHD‚Äô) in the PLEO-CMT-FU Period 2 trial with a data readout at 60 months of total trial time (15 months of PLEO-CMT trial + 9 months of PLEO-CMT-FU trial period 1 + 36 months of PLEO-CMT-FU trial period 2). Please refer to an illustration of the first PXT3003 Phase III program design in the ‚ÄúAbout the PLEO-CMT-FU Trial‚Äù section below for more details.Key features of the data analysis are as follows:PXT3003 continues to show a good tolerability and safety profile over the course of the first Phase III program (double-blind + ongoing open-label).PXT3003 continues to show encouraging efficacy results as measured on the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‚ÄòONLS‚Äô) which evaluates the patient‚Äôs functional motor disability. The best efficacy signal was observed in the cohort of patients treated with PXT3003 HD during 5 years of total trial time (double blind + ongoing open-label). Patients treated with placebo declined on ONLS during the double-blind phase but then improved when switched to PXT3003 in the ongoing open-label phase.Story continuesPlease refer to the illustration of the ONLS data below for more details.Dr. Burkhard Blank  Chief Medical Officer at Pharnext commented: ‚ÄúThe data announced today  while generated from an open-label extension study  show a sustained treatment benefit with PXT3003 High Dose for patients with CMT1A. As we approach completion of enrollment in our pivotal Phase III study  the PREMIER trial  in the same mild to moderate CMT1A patients‚Äô population  with the same High Dose of PXT3003 and using the same primary efficacy ONLS endpoint  this reinforces our confidence in potentially confirming the safety and efficacy of PXT3003.‚ÄùShahram Attarian  MD  PhD  Head of the Neuromuscular Diseases and ALS department at the University Hospital La Timone in Marseille (France)  Coordinator of the FILNEMUS Rare Diseases Network and Neuromuscular Diseases Reference Centers in France  and Lead Investigator of the PLEO-CMT  PLEO-CMT-FU and PREMIER trials in Europe  said: ‚ÄúAs an investigator involved since the beginning in the clinical development of PXT3003 in CMT1A  I find these long term safety and efficacy data very encouraging. Being able to stabilize  or even improve  patients with CMT1A is an extremely worthwhile goal particularly as these individuals will inevitably decline following the long-term natural course of the disease with the currently available standard of care. The entire CMT community is hopeful that PXT3003 could be the first approved therapy for this debilitating disease.‚ÄùResults of First Double-Blind Phase III (PLEO-CMT) & Open-Label Extension (PLEO-CMT-FU)Studies of PXT3003 with an ONLS Data Readout at 60 Months of Total Trial Time**Results based on database extraction done on April 25th  2022a Cohort of CMT1A patients treated with PXT3003 High Dose during PLEO-CMT and ongoing PLEO-CMT-FU trialsb Cohort of CMT1A patients treated with PXT3003 Low Dose during PLEO-CMT + PLEO-CMT-FU Period 1  and then switched to PXT3003 High Dose during PLEO-CMT-FU period 2c Cohort of CMT1A patients treated with placebo during PLEO-CMT  PXT3003 Low Dose or High Dose during PLEO-CMT-FU Period 1 and PXT3003 High Dose during PLEO-CMT-FU Period 2Please refer to a graphic illustration of the first double-blind Phase III (PLEO-CMT) and open-label extension (PLEO-CMT-FU) studies design in the ‚ÄúAbout the PLEO-CMT-FU Trial‚Äù section below.About the PLEO-CMT TrialThe PLEO-CMT trial was an international  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 in patients with CMT1A  over a 15-month period. Two dose levels  named low dose (‚ÄòLD‚Äô) and high dose (‚ÄòHD‚Äô)  of PXT3003 in comparison to placebo were tested in patients diagnosed with mild-to-moderate CMT1A (HD equals double LD). A total of 323 patients were enrolled in 29 centers across Europe  the U.S. and Canada by December 2016 and last-patient-last-visit occurred in March 2018. Due to an unexpected issue in the HD formulation  the HD arm was prematurely stopped in September 2017. A revised statistical analysis plan was developed to take into account the premature HD arm discontinuation. Analysis of the primary endpoint  Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‚ÄòONLS‚Äô) from all investigated populations in the HD arm suggested preliminary efficacy in humans. The study further demonstrated the safety and tolerability of PXT3003. Further information on the PLEO-CMT trial  including study results  can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (study identification number: NCT03023540) here or in the following publication: https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-021-02040-8.pdf.About the PLEO-CMT-FU TrialAll randomized CMT1A patients who completed the PLEO-CMT trial (treated with PXT3003 or placebo) were eligible to pursue treatment with PXT3003 in the PLEO-CMT-FU trial. This trial enrolled a total of 187 patients and was designed to primarily assess the long-term safety and tolerability of PXT3003. It was initially planned to be a double-blind  nine-month  Phase III follow-up extension study where patients treated with PXT3003 in the PLEO-CMT trial were eligible to continue their treatment at the same dose (High dose ‚ÄòHD‚Äô or Low Dose ‚ÄòLD‚Äô). Patients treated with placebo in the PLEO-CMT trial were randomized in PLEO-CMT-FU to receive LD or HD of PXT3003. Due to the PXT3003 HD formulation issue which occurred during the PLEO-CMT trial  the HD arm was discontinued in September 2017. Consequently  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial became an open-label study divided into two periods:Period 1 (9-month treatment period) from March 2017 to April 2019. Patients randomized to PXT3003 LD in PLEO-CMT continued on the same dose. Patients randomized to PXT3003 HD in PLEO-CMT continued on the same dose  but it was given as twice the volume of PXT3003 LD formulation after the PXT3003 HD formulation issue. Patients randomized to placebo in PLEO-CMT continued only on PXT3003 LD after the HD formulation issue.Period 2 from July 2018 (still on-going). The 153 patients who entered in PLEO-CMT-FU Period 2 were all switched to PXT3003 HD given as twice the volume of PXT3003 LD formulation.In PLEO-CMT-FU  on top of safety and tolerability of PXT3003 which is evaluated every 3 months  long-term efficacy is evaluated with the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‚ÄòONLS‚Äô) measured every 6 months. Results from the PLEO-CMT-FU trial will be reported on a yearly basis.Further information on the PLEO-CMT-FU trial can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (study identification number: NCT03023540) here.Design of First Double-Blind Phase III (PLEO-CMT) andOpen-Label Extension (PLEO-CMT-FU) Studies of PXT3003About the PREMIER TrialThe PREMIER trial is an international  randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  pivotal Phase III study  evaluating the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 versus placebo in mild-to-moderate CMT1A patients  over a 15-month period. The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the high dose (‚ÄòHD‚Äô) tested in the prior Phase III trial (‚ÄòPLEO-CMT‚Äô). As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint will be the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‚ÄòONLS‚Äô) which measures functional motor disability. The secondary endpoints include the following outcome measures: 1) 10-Meter Walk Test (‚Äò10mWT‚Äô)  2) Quantified Muscular Testing (bilateral foot dorsiflexion dynamometry)  3) Patient Global Impression of Severity (‚ÄòPGI-S‚Äô)  4) Patient Global Impression of Change (‚ÄòPGI-C‚Äô)  5) Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score  version 2 (‚ÄòCMTNS-v2‚Äô)  and 6) Quantified Muscular Testing (hand grip). Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Further information on the PREMIER trial can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (study identification number: NCT04762758) here.About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (‚ÄòCMT1A‚Äô)Charcot-Marie-Tooth (‚ÄòCMT‚Äô) disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery. More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/disease/charcot-marie-toothAbout PXT3003PXT3003 is a novel fixed-dose synergistic combination of baclofen  naltrexone and sorbitol formulated as an oral solution given twice a day. The three individual components of PXT3003 were selected to downregulate the overexpression of PMP22 protein  leading to improvement of neuronal signaling in dysfunctional peripheral nerves that are an essential part of the pathophysiology of this disease. PXT3003 could also have a positive effect on other cellular types of the motor unit such as the axon (direct protection)  neuromuscular junctions or muscle cells. PXT3003 has shown promising and consistent results across preclinical and clinical studies in Phase II and Phase III (PLEO-CMT and PLEO-CMT-FU). More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/pipeline/pxt3003About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases that currently lack curative and/or disease-modifying treatments.

With the recent 30-day extension to the proposal's original May 20th end date for public comment  battle lines over the proposed rules are starting to emerge as interested parties weigh in on the rules' potential reach and impacts.In defending the SEC's historic risk disclosure proposal at a recent public briefing  SEC Chairman Gary Gensler underscored that the agency's core bargain with investors from the 1930s that investors get to decide which risks to take  as long as public companies provide full and fair disclosures. Gensler again asserted the need for SEC action to mandate climate-related disclosures and information relevant to investors' decisions. Meanwhile  members of Congress from both sides of the aisle are voicing opposition to the proposal with promises of court action if the rules are approved in their current form.Who: Brad Rosen  J.D.

Brad's areas of expertise and focus include legal and regulatory developments related to climate change  sustainability  and ESG matters  futures and derivatives  and digital assets. Brad also closely tracks legal practice and technological innovation.""With congressional and industry opponents claiming the SEC's proposed climate rules far exceed the agency's legal authority  Chairman Gensler appears to be readying for a legal fight by focusing on the Commission's 'long tradition' of mandating relevant risk disclosures  as well as overwhelming demands from investors for consistent  comparable and useful information on climate-related risks."" ‚Äî Brad Rosen  J.D.

May 16  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- RuffleButts  the kids' swimwear and clothing company  has selected Centric Software¬Æ's Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solution. Centric Softw‚Ä¶,"Based in a suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth  Texas  RuffleButts was founded 15 years ago starting with ruffled bloomers for baby girls  hence the name. The company creates joyful clothing for the treasured years of childhood. RuggedButts for boys was added later  offering a full wardrobe for girls and boys all the way into the tween years.""Our growth rate right now is phenomenal. I wanted to make sure that whatever company we chose could scale with us.""Audrie Garcia  Production & Design Manager at RuffleButts  says  ""We're growing quite a bit and adding new product categories  new sizing‚Äîand it was just getting to be a lot to manage."" She talks about the manual work and duplicate data entry in a typical product development cycle  adding  ""We have hundreds of Google sheets for specs alone. Then we have different sheets for our color library  and a SKU creation doc on another sheet.""There were many steps on the creative side as well. Designers would have to copy-paste their designs from Adobe‚Ñ¢ Illustrator to a digital project board in the design phase. When the project moves on to development or production  the design gets re-entered into another sheet where tech packs are created and is finally sent to the factory  often via email. Garcia says  ""We're entering data in multiple spots. And things just get lost or missed  or someone changes the size in one doc but forgets to change it in another... We want to streamline the process overall.""On top of all that  being in the children's apparel category subjects the company to strict regulations to comply with government safety standards. Garcia says  ""There are so many rules  for example  no lead in the thread  zippers  buttons and obviously  flammability. We save that information on our internal shared drive  but you can't access it outside of the office. And it isn't currently linked back to any product. I may know that we have a testing document for certain products and where to go find it  but there's not an easy way for anyone  other than me  to know that this product has been tested.""RuffleButts decided on PLM as a strategy and evaluated a few providers. Much research and several demos took place over the course of a year. One of the most important features Garcia says  is ""scalability  because our growth rate right now is phenomenal. I wanted to make sure that whatever company we chose could scale with us. The PLM had to have capabilities beyond just the product team‚Äîwe may want to bring in more users like marketing  our e-commerce team  or our buyers and planners. During the demos  I eventually noticed that Centric was one of the only companies I saw that allows for that without going through a lot of hoop jumping.""Garcia expects to save a considerable amount of time once they are fully up and running. She states  ""I did the math a while ago. Overall  we will save about a week and a half's worth of work per season  just on the product engineering or data information side. On the design side  the Adobe Connect plugin is great to link Adobe Illustrator directly with Centric PLM; designers won't have to leave Illustrator  eliminating many of their repetitive tasks. It'll also help with calendar management and sample status‚Äîlooking at the Centric home screen  I could have a widget on my dashboard that tells me the status at a glance.""Chris Groves  President and CEO of Centric says  ""We are pleased to be partnering with RuffleButts  a fresh  rapidly growing company in the apparel space. They bring fun and functional clothing to families  and we are thrilled to have been selected as their partner.""Learn more about Centric PLMRequest a DemoRuffleButts (www.rufflebutts.com)We create joyful clothing for the treasured years of childhood.

We are particularly proud of our teams‚Äô continued dedication and collective spirit  ensuring the satisfaction of our customers  as well as the Group‚Äôs high level of agility with our multi-channel sourcing  the use of our refurbishing capabilities  and the optimization of our supply chain. Refurbishing and selling an additional 12 000 refurbished vehicles  +56% compared with the first half of 2021  represents a true industrial performance  illustrating the relevance of our unique vertically integrated business model  particularly since half of the refurbished vehicles sold over this period had previously been acquired from private owners. Aramis Group is perfectly positioned today to continue moving forward with its roadmap and become the preferred digital platform across Europe for buying and selling used cars online‚Äù.2022 FIRST-HALF BUSINESSDuring the first half of 2022  ended March 31  the Group recorded revenues of ‚Ç¨872.6 million  up +47.5% from the first half of 2021 pro forma and +77.7% on a reported basis. In a complex market environment  Aramis Group faced two opposite trends.On the one hand  the Group‚Äôs business in the refurbished vehicle segment  its strategic priority and representing more than 80% of its B2C volumes during the first half of 2022  saw very strong growth  highlighting the success of Aramis Group‚Äôs value proposition  focused at all times on ensuring customer satisfaction.On the other hand  business in the pre-registered vehicle segment was significantly affected by the very limited availability of new vehicles  the difficulties faced by production lines against a backdrop of a shortage of semiconductors  further compounded in recent months by the war in Ukraine.Overview of volumes and revenues2022 first-half B2C volumesIn units Pro forma Reported basis H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) Refurbished cars 33 385 21 417 +55.9% 33 385 15 568 +114.4% Pre-registered cars 7 832 14 204 -44.9% 7 832 14 204 -44.9% Total Volumes B2C 41 217 35 621 +15.7% 41 217 29 772 +38.4%2022 first-half revenuesBy segmentIn millions of euros Pro forma Reported basis H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) Refurbished cars 575.0 301.5 +90.7% 575.0 221.8 +159.3% Pre-registered cars 151.3 208.0 -27.2% 151.3 208.0 -27.2% Total B2C 726.4 509.5 +42.6% 726.4 429.8 +69.0% Total B2B 99.5 50.5 +97.3% 99.5 36.4 +173.3% Total Services 46.7 31.8 +46.8% 46.7 24.8 +87.9% Revenues 872.6 591.8 +47.5% 872.6 490.9 +77.7%By countryIn millions of euros Pro forma Reported basis H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) France 359.2 302.0 +19.0% 359.2 302.0 +19.0% Belgium 116.4 86.9 +34.0% 116.4 86.9 +34.0% Spain 187.0 78.6 +138.0% 187.0 78.6 +138.0% UK 210.0 124.4 +68.8% 210.0 23.6 +791.4% Revenues 872.6 591.8 +47.5% 872.6 490.9 +77.7%Analysis of revenues by segmentB2C ‚Äì sales of cars to private customers (83% of revenues)Revenues for the B2C segment - corresponding to sales of refurbished and pre-registered cars to private customers ‚Äì totaled ‚Ç¨726.4 million for the first half of 2022  up +42.6% pro forma compared with the first half of 2021 and +69.0% on a reported basis.Revenues for the refurbished cars segment came to ‚Ç¨575.0 million  up +90.7% pro forma compared with the first half of 2021 and +159.3% on a reported basis. 33 385 vehicles were delivered  up +55.9% pro forma and +114.4% on a reported basis  reflecting the growing success of Aramis Group‚Äôs offer with its customers across Europe.To support this very strong growth around healthy and sustainable foundations  the Group has accelerated the opening of new refurbishing centers in the last few months and further strengthened its agility in terms of sourcing. Across each of its geographies  the Group‚Äôs very strong focus on buying B2C vehicles from private customers through its digital platforms (51% of the refurbished vehicles sold during the first half of 2022 were purchased from private owners vs 33% in the first half of 2021) has enabled it to ensure the depth of its selection available online for customers  as well as a continuous flow of cars to be refurbished. The Group maintained a very high NPS  with 68 at end-March 2022.Reflecting the widespread increase in vehicle prices across all segments  the unit sales price for the refurbished cars sold by Aramis Group during the first half of 2022 came in significantly higher than the first half of 2021  up +22.3%.Revenues for the pre-registered cars segment came to ‚Ç¨151.3 million  with a marked contraction of-27.2% versus the first half of 2021. 7 832 units were sold during the first half of 2022  with the volume down -44.9% due to the major difficulties experienced with sourcing this type of vehicle  linked to the major disruption affecting production lines for new cars. Prices also show strong growth  achieving a unit average increase of +32.0% compared with the first half of 2021.B2B ‚Äì sales of cars to professional customers (11% of revenues)Revenues for the B2B segment totaled ‚Ç¨99.5 million during the first half of 2022  driven by very strong growth of +97.3% pro forma in relation to the first half of 2021 and +173.3% on a reported basis. This growth reflects the increase in prices and in the sourcing of vehicles from private owners  some of which are resold to professionals (mainly vehicles over eight years old or 150 000 km).Services (6% of revenues)Lastly  services generated ‚Ç¨46.7 million of revenues during the first half of 2022  up +46.8% pro forma compared with the first half of 2021 and +87.9% on a reported basis. The penetration rate for financing solutions maintained its positive trend  while Aramis Group continued to further strengthen its range of services  particularly through extended warranties. The Group intends to continue ramping up its innovations in terms of services  which represent one of the three pillars from its ambitious growth strategy.Analysis of revenues by countryFrance (41% of revenues)Revenues for the first half of 2022 are up +19.0% compared with the first half of 2021 to ‚Ç¨359.2 million. This robust trend reflects an excellent performance on the refurbished vehicle segment  with its volumes sold up +47% from the first half of 2021 and nearly offsetting the contraction in volumes by around half over the same period for pre-registered vehicles  a segment that Aramis Group has historically had strong exposure to in this geography. The change in the average unit sales price also contributed to revenue growth. In terms of refurbishment  the Group is able to capitalize on the major in-house capacity in place at its Donz√®re site  which will be joined very soon by the Nemours site  where it will inaugurate its second refurbishing center in France in June. In terms of sourcing  the number of vehicles purchased from private owners virtually doubled during the first half of 2022 compared with the first half of 2021  illustrating the flexibility offered by the Group‚Äôs multi-channel sourcing.Belgium (13% of revenues)2022 first-half revenues are up +34.0% from the first half of 2021 to ‚Ç¨116.4 million. Refurbished vehicle sales are up +250% compared with the first half of 2021  clearly more than offsetting the contraction in pre-registered vehicle ones  a segment that Aramis Group has also historically had strong exposure to in Belgium. This very strong performance was achieved thanks to the work of the Belgian teams  ramping up the Antwerp refurbishing center following its inauguration in November 2021  as well as the French and Group teams  who have been working for several months to integrate inventory between the two countries. In 2019  Aramis Group sold less than 10% of the refurbished cars in Belgium  compared with more than 50% today. This trend is also supported by the sourcing of used vehicles from private owners  tripling during the first half of 2022 compared with the first half of 2021. An increase was also recorded in the average unit sales price.Spain (22% of revenues)Revenues for the first half of 2022 totaled ‚Ç¨187.0 million  a very significant increase of +138.0% versus the same period in 2021. The volumes of refurbished vehicles sold increased by around +75%. The higher average unit sales price achieved was also a major factor behind this performance. The number of vehicles acquired from private owners was multiplied by nearly 7x compared with the first half of 2021. Aramis Group‚Äôs business in Spain has virtually zero exposure to the pre-registered vehicle segment.United Kingdom (24% of revenues)Revenues for the first half of 2022 reached ‚Ç¨210.0 million  up +68.8% on a pro forma basis compared with the first half of 2021. The refurbished vehicle volumes sold rose +30%  with the increase in the unit sales price making a similar contribution to growth. Sourcing from private owners was multiplied by nearly 2.5x. For reference  Aramis Group did not sell any pre-registered vehicles in the UK.INCOME STATEMENTThe income statement for the period highlights three key developments: 1/ strong consolidated revenues growth  despite the slowdown in the pre-registered vehicle segment  2/ the excellent level of the gross profit generated per unit of vehicle sold  highlighting the robust features of the Company‚Äôs vertically integrated business model  3/ a proactive increase in SG&A costs to enable Aramis Group to continue moving forward with its roadmap for very strong growth in its volumes over the coming years.Condensed income statementIn millions of euros Pro forma Reported basis H12022 H12021 Change (%) H12022 H12021 Change (%) Revenues 872.6 591.8 +47.5% 872.6 490.9 +77.7% Gross profit 95.2 84.2 +13.1% 95.2 72.2 +31.9% Gross profit per unit of B2C vehicle sold - GPU (‚Ç¨) 2 311 2  358 -2.0% 2 311 2 416 -4.4% Adjusted EBITDA 2.9 18.3 -84.1% 2.9 13.9 -79.0% Operating income -17.9 - - -17.9 2.8 N/A Net profit (loss) -20.3 - - -20.3 0.2 N/AGross marginFor the first half of 2022  the gross margin came to ‚Ç¨95.2 million  up +13.1% pro forma compared with the first half of 2021. This change is linked to the increase in the volumes of refurbished vehicles sold  as well as the growing penetration rate in services. The gross profit per unit generated per B2C vehicle sold (GPU)  was ‚Ç¨2 311  in line with the first half of 2021 (‚Ç¨2 358) and the full-year figure for FY 2021 (‚Ç¨2 292)  on a pro forma basis.This is significantly higher than the level recorded by its main European peers and reflects Aramis Group‚Äôs operational expertise  built up over the past 21 years since it was founded  while effectively commanding all the links in the value chain thanks to its vertically integrated business model  which is unique in Europe.Adjusted EBITDAFor the first half of 2022  adjusted EBITDA came to ‚Ç¨2.9 million  compared with ‚Ç¨18.3 million in the first half of 2021. The contraction compared with the same period in 2021 factors in the absorption of SG&A costs being less effective than expected due to the Group‚Äôs overall activity in terms of volumes - and therefore its overall gross profit in euros - coming in lower than expected  particularly in France  with the Group‚Äôs pre-registered vehicle sales significantly affected by the shortage of new cars as explained previously.Sales  general and administrative (SG&A) costs totaled ‚Ç¨92.4 million for the first half of 2022  up +40.2% pro forma compared with the first half of 2021  and +12.4% versus the second half of 2021.This amount includes ‚Ç¨21.2 million of marketing costs  up +53.9% pro forma from the first half of 2021 and +16.6% compared with the second half of 2021. As already announced  Aramis Group maintained its marketing investments  continuing to ramp up its efforts to generate traffic with a view to both boosting its online sales and promoting its offer to buy vehicles from private customers. The Group also continued to invest in its brands.Labor costs came to ‚Ç¨42.6 million  up +42.1% pro forma from the first half of 2021 and +13.0% compared with the second half of 2021. For reference  in 2021  Aramis Group began consolidating its teams in order to put in place the capacity needed to deliver an always more efficient and effective response to the demand from European customers for quality vehicles  enabling it to continue to generate very strong growth in its volumes over the coming years. Since its IPO mid-2021  the Group has also further strengthened several of its corporate departments  focusing in particular on compliance  structuring and control.As for delivery costs  they amounted to ‚Ç¨13.6 million  up +15.5% pro forma from the first half of 2021 and down -2.9% compared with the second half of 2021.Lastly  other SG&A represent ‚Ç¨14.9 million  up +44.0% pro forma from the first half of 2021 and +21.7% compared with the second half of 2021.Operating incomeOperating income for the first half of 2022 totaled -‚Ç¨17.9 million. This amount includes ‚Ç¨8.7 million of personnel expenses relating to acquisitions  ‚Ç¨1.3 million of personnel expenses relating to share-based payments  ‚Ç¨0.8 million of transaction-related costs and ‚Ç¨10.1 million of depreciation charges.Net profit (loss)The net loss for the first half of 2022 came to -‚Ç¨20.3 million. It includes -‚Ç¨1.6 million of financial income and expenses and a -‚Ç¨0.8 million tax expense.CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL STRUCTUREThe Group‚Äôs balance sheet includes virtually zero debt. Cash consumption for the first half of 2022 is linked primarily to building up the inventory of vehicles to be sold  as well as investments in new refurbishing capacity and the Group‚Äôs digital ecosystem.Inventory and operating working capital requirementsIn millions of euros Mar 31  2022 Sep 30  2021 Change (%) Inventories 264.6 173.8 +90.7 Trade receivables 26.0 23.7 +2.2 Other current assets (excl. non-operational items) 22.5 23.1 -0.6 Trade payables 56.0 46.6 +9.3 Other current liabilities (excl. non-operational items) 41.8 44.9 -3.1 Other items 0.8 0.7 +0.2 Operating working capital requirements 214.5 128.5 +86.0Inventory represented ‚Ç¨264.6 million at March 31  2022. This ‚Ç¨90.7 million increase compared with September 30  2021 reflects three factors: 1/ the widespread price inflation seen across all vehicle segments (for 25%); 2/ a mix effect linked to higher exposure to refurbished vehicles than previously for the Group‚Äôs business (for 58%); 3/ a proactive approach to build up surplus inventory to protect the Group against potential sourcing difficulties (for 17%). In a supply-based business like Aramis Group‚Äôs activity  this increase in inventory is making it possible to support the strong growth in business  offering an increasingly wide and diversified selection for European consumers looking to acquire used cars. The level of operating working capital requirements at March 31  2022 represents 48 days of revenues based on the last rolling12-month reported revenues.Cash positionIn millions of euros Mar 31  2022 Net cash at period-start 102.0 Adjusted EBITDA +2.9 Change in operating working capital requirements -86.0 Other operation-related cash flow -0.6 Capex -12.1 Other investment-related cash flow 0.0 Capital increase / decrease +0.1 Interest paid -0.6 IFRS 16 (interest and capital) -5.7 Other financing-related cash flow(excl. issuing and repayment of borrowings) -1.2 Net debt at period-end 1.2Net debt at March 31  2022 represented ‚Ç¨1.2 million. The change over the period primarily reflects the operational cash consumption linked to the change in operating working capital requirements for-‚Ç¨86.0 million  as well as the acquisition of fixed assets for -‚Ç¨12.1 million  corresponding primarily to the Group‚Äôs investments in its new refurbishing centers and its technological platform.GOVERNANCE CHANGES AT CLICARSOn April 4  2022  Aramis Group announced certain changes to the leadership team of Clicars  its Spanish business unit.Jos√© Carlos del Valle  37  was appointed CEO of Clicars. With extensive experience in e-commerce and logistics  working for Amazon in particular  as well as one and a half years as Sales Director for Clicars  and an MBA from Harvard Business School  he will have a mission to consolidate the company‚Äôs roadmap for strong growth. To achieve this  he will be supported by a strong team of professionals  combining Clicars‚Äô longstanding staff with the high-level profiles recruited recently.This change has been made in connection with Clicars‚Äô two founders  Carlos Rivera and Pablo Fernandez  selling their remaining minority interest in this company‚Äôs capital. As stipulated in the shareholder agreement signed between Aramis Group and Clicars‚Äô co-founders in 2017  and the agreement from April 19  2021  under which the Company and the two co-founders agreed for the put and call options to be exercised within 90 days of March 31  2022  they will sell their remaining interest in Clicars and will soon leave the Group.Following this operation  Aramis Group will hold 100% of the capital and voting rights of Clicars.This company was already fully consolidated in the Group‚Äôs accounts. Its governance will evolve to reflect the new shareholding structure.The development objectives and priorities for Clicars  as for all of the Aramis Group business units  will remain unchanged: selling a growing number of refurbished vehicles across Europe  guided primarily by the commitment to providing the best possible service for customers  capitalizing on the teams‚Äô dedication and engagement  the Group‚Äôs technological and industrial know-how  and its strong position at the heart of a circular economy approach.OUTLOOKIn view of the size of the refurbished vehicle market  its significant fragmentation in all European countries  and Aramis Group‚Äôs very strong value proposition  the Group still has considerable potential for market share gains. Aramis Group will therefore continue to focus the majority of its resources on its strategy launched in 2019 for acceleration on this segment  which represented more than 80% of its B2C volumes during the first half of 2022.Alongside this  considering the difficulties faced by auto manufacturers to normalize their production  the pre-registered vehicle segment is not expected to see any tangible improvement over the coming months.The second part of 2022 will be marked in particular by the opening of two new refurbishing centers in Nemours (France) and Goole (UK). Following these openings  Aramis Group will own and operate six refurbishing centers  with an annual refurbishing capacity of 132 000 vehicles at end-2023. They will enable it to continue to provide its European customers with very high-quality refurbished vehicles at competitive prices and delivered in record time  and consolidate its leading positions in terms of its in-house capacity for industrial-scale refurbishing  its innovations  its local job creation and its commitment to a more sustainable development.Aramis Group is confirming its full-year objectives for 2022 as revised on April 19:Total revenues of over ‚Ç¨1.7 billion;Growth of over +45% in refurbished car volumes;Positive EBITDA.These full-year objectives are like-for-like and do not include any assumption for a further significant deterioration in automotive market conditions or the current geopolitical situation.Aramis Group also reconfirm the medium and long-term ambitions set out at the time of its IPO  aiming to generate  on a like-for-like basis  at least ‚Ç¨3 billion of revenues and a 3% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2025  and then at least ‚Ç¨6 billion of revenues and an 8% adjusted EBITDA margin by 2030.***Status of the statutory auditors‚Äô procedures:During its meeting on May 16  2022  Aramis Group‚Äôs Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements for the first half of FY 2022  ended March 31  2022. The procedures for a limited review of these accounts have been completed.

It was unclear whether these visits will now go ahead.The export ban drew sharp criticism from the Group of Seven industrialised nations  which said that such measures ‚Äúwould worsen the crisis‚Äù of rising commodity prices.India recorded its warmest March on record ‚Äî blamed on climate change ‚Äî and in recent weeks has seen a scorching heatwave with temperatures upwards of 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit).This hit farmers in wheat-producing northern India  prompting the government to predict output would fall at least five percent this year from 109 million tonnes in 2021Advertisement.

4993,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.ifre.com/story/3367022/russia-bondholder-hopeful-of-ofac-licence-extension-w1tmjgwdgw,Russia bondholder hopeful of OFAC licence extension,1 day ago,"A leading holder of Russian bonds is confident the US government will extend a special licence that expires on May 25  ensuring that international investors can continue receiving payments from the sovereign.Russia yet again faces the prospect of defaulting on its foreign currency bonds in the coming weeks. The sovereign has coupon payments due on two bonds on May 27 ‚Äì its US$3bn 4.75% 2026s and ‚Ç¨1bn 2.65% 2036s. But that is two days after the expiration of a temporary licence issued by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control that allows US entities and individuals to receive Russian bond payments.The Treasury has not indicated whether it will extend the licence but one bondholder said he felt it will eventually do so. ""We‚Äôve had a lot of conversations with the US Treasury. They can‚Äôt say definitely if they can or will extend  but they alluded to the fact that they will extend this. I‚Äôm sure it will be done at the eleventh hour "" he said.Given that the Treasury has allowed all of Russia's bond payments to go through to its international creditors since its invasion of Ukraine  he said it would be inconsistent for it not to do so now. ""I just don‚Äôt see it as consistent with what they have done so far to just allow a default. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. All the payments have been getting through  albeit there is a backlog "" he said.If an extension is granted  he said it would be ""the last hurdle"" cleared to prevent Russia being forced into default. ""It makes me feel pretty comfortable in an inherently uncomfortable situation "" he said.The Treasury might extend the licence because further restrictions mean Russia can now only use onshore reserves to meet its obligations ‚Äì as it eventually did earlier this month for its previous two foreign currency bond payments. With Russia servicing its foreign currency bonds suggesting it would rather deplete its reserves than default on its debt  Treasury officials might consider it worthwhile to extend the licence.On the other hand  the amounts due are so small that payments would not make much difference to Russia's available resources. The coupon payment due on the US dollar 2026s  for example  is US$71m  while on the euro 2036s it is just ‚Ç¨29m. Even considering the amounts due on its US dollar and euro bonds for the rest of this year ‚Äì US$1.732bn  including the 2026s  on its US dollar bonds  and ‚Ç¨127m  including the 2036s  on its euro bonds  according to JP Morgan ‚Äì the total payments are unlikely to make much of a dent in Russia's finances  even though they are under increasing pressure.Some investors are adamant that Russia should be forced into default. ""I can just imagine a huge lobbying effort underway before the US Treasury by bondholders who were long and wrong Russian risk "" said Tim Ash  senior EM sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. ""I just hope that the US Treasury puts the strategic interests of the US and its allies ahead of a few bondholders who really should have known better.""He said that if OFAC does extend the licence  ""this will be taken as a significant win by Moscow"".Additional complicationsThe next repayments face other complications than just OFAC. They include the first payment on a euro-denominated bond since the war began. That in itself brings an added twist as to what EU authorities will allow. The two bonds will also be settled via Russia's National Settlement Depository  while the euro 2036s have rouble-payment fallback language too.The mechanics involved are far from straightforward. According to a Clifford Chance note  ""the European Commission states that EU sanctions principally do 'not impose any impediments to receive income payments  dividend payments or principal repayments of existing securities from Russian issuers'  such as coupon payments by the Russian state on its Eurobonds"".One analyst following Russia's bond payments trail thinks that those comments suggest the EU will allow investors in the region to receive payments  though it is not clear whether the EU ‚Äì unlike the US ‚Äì has blocked the Russian ministry of finance and central bank's accounts with their correspondent banks. ""I have not seen EU regulation or clarification which would allow usage of these accounts for debt servicing "" said the analyst.Even if they are not blocked  he said that an OFAC licence extension is necessary to service the US dollar and euro bonds  ""otherwise correspondent banks will not process the payments"".Potential hurdleAssuming OFAC does extend the licence  there is another potential hurdle to consider. The Clifford Chance note highlighted that the European Commission ""said that the NSD  as a legal person established in Russia  is subject to the prohibition"" on European central securities depositories providing relevant services to such entities  ""so that 'enhanced due diligence is thus warranted for processing transactions where the NSD would be involved'"".Could the NSD's status prevent payments going through? Given there has been no experience of euro payments since Russia was ostracised  any interpretation of the EU's guidelines is speculative. However  the analyst said that there is a path through  in theory.""I have the impression that the EU settlement guidelines now permit clearance of transfers from Euroclear to the NSD related to bonds issued prior to April 12. But God knows how these guidelines will be interpreted in practice "" he said.He said the most likely outcome is that local bondholders will be paid in roubles via the NSD ‚Äì as they were on Russia's recent April 2022 bond repayment ‚Äì while the sovereign's international creditors will receive payments in US dollars and euros through Euroclear.If OFAC does not extend its licence  then all of that is moot. Russia could argue that it was willing to make the payments but was not able to  or try to pay all of its creditors in roubles. That would certainly be a violation of the US dollar bonds' terms  and possibly the euro bonds' too despite the fallback language  as the ministry needs to give 15 days' notice if the state intends to pay in roubles.""Let's see how it goes "" said the analyst.(Additional reporting by Robert Hogg)",neutral,0.06,0.81,0.14,mixed,0.05,0.17,0.79,True,English,"['OFAC licence extension', 'Russia bondholder', 'previous two foreign currency bond payments', 'senior EM sovereign strategist', 'The Clifford Chance note', 'European central securities depositories', 'foreign currency bonds', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'huge lobbying effort', 'BlueBay Asset Management', 'National Settlement Depository', 'rouble-payment fallback language', 'wrong Russian risk', 'bond payments trail', 'Russian bond payments', 'US dollar bonds', 'US dollar 2026s', 'two bonds', 'euro-denominated bond', 'existing securities', 'central bank', 'OFAC licence extension', 'Russian bonds', 'European Commission', 'The Treasury', 'euro bonds', 'Russian issuers', 'Russian state', 'Russian ministry', 'leading holder', 'US government', 'coming weeks', 'coupon payments', 'one bondholder', 'eleventh hour', 'international creditors', 'last hurdle', 'uncomfortable situation', 'other hand', 'available resources', 'JP Morgan', 'total payments', 'increasing pressure', 'Tim Ash', 'strategic interests', 'significant win', 'Additional complications', 'next repayments', 'other complications', 'first payment', 'added twist', 'income payments', 'dividend payments', 'principal repayments', 'Potential hurdle', 'legal person', 'relevant services', 'due diligence', 'euro payments', 'US Treasury', 'Treasury officials', 'euro 2036s', 'EU authorities', 'EU sanctions', 'EU regulation', 'special licence', 'temporary licence', 'US entities', 'onshore reserves', 'One analyst', 'debt servicing', 'international investors', 'correspondent banks', 'May', 'prospect', 'expiration', 'Office', 'individuals', 'lot', 'conversations', 'fact', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'default', 'sense', 'backlog', 'restrictions', 'obligations', 'amounts', 'difference', 'example', 'year', 'finances', 'bondholders', 'long', 'allies', 'Moscow', 'war', 'mechanics', 'impediments', 'Eurobonds', 'comments', 'region', 'accounts', 'clarification', 'usage', 'NSD', 'prohibition', 'transactions', 'status', 'experience', 'interpretati']",2022-05-17,2022-05-17,ifre.com

The impact of the crisis on business and vendor support is limited.The Group is closely monitoring further developments and will continuously adapt its risk assessment to the current situation.Core Data Centre migration updateEuronext announced in April 2021 the strategic decision to migrate its Core Data Centre from Basildon  in the United Kingdom  to Bergamo  in Italy.The migration is a response to multiple factors  including the dynamic created by Brexit and a strong rationale to locate the Group‚Äôs Core Data Centre in a European Union country where Euronext operates a large business. This transformative move  managed in collaboration with clients  marks a milestone in bringing back to the European Union the data centre that handles 25% of European trading volumes.This migration will allow Euronext to fully control and directly manage its core IT infrastructure  and provide clients with a key service that was previously outsourced. This will also allow the generation of colocation revenues  embedded in the upgraded synergies. Clients will benefit from a state-of-the-art colocation facility  and since this data centre is 100% powered by renewable energy sources  clients will see their own carbon footprints reduced. The date targeted for the first part of the Group Core Data Centre migration  as announced in November 2021  is 6 June 2022. The Core Data Centre migration has been timed in order to pave the way for the migration of the Borsa Italiana equity and derivatives markets onto Euronext Optiq¬Æ trading technology by mid-2023.Euronext has successfully finalised the build phase of the Core Data Centre  which focused on setting up the production infrastructure (servers and networks) and the colocation room (client racks). Client connectivity has been implemented and is now operational. Optiq¬Æ  Euronext‚Äôs proprietary state-of-the-art technology  has also been successfully installed in Bergamo. The colocation and connectivity offerings have been designed and shared with clients. Euronext has rolled-out the client installation (equipment shipping  installation  and testing)  which is almost finalised. The first successful tests connecting clients to the production environment in Bergamo confirmed the readiness for the upcoming migration in June 2022.Progress on the pillars of Euronext‚Äôs ESG commitmentEuronext has advanced its ‚ÄúFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äù climate commitment with the launch of the OBX¬Æ ESG index in Norway and the AEX¬Æ ESG index in the Netherlands in May 2022  joining Euronext‚Äôs growing franchise of national blue-chip ESG indices. Beyond blue-chip ESG indices  Euronext has introduced a number of products tailored towards evolving business challenges  such as the Euronext French Employment 40 EW Index. The relevance of Euronext‚Äôs ESG index franchise has been recognised by Finance for Tomorrow  which identified Euronext as a leading contributor to the protection of biodiversity15 thanks to its biodiversity index solutions  such as the Euronext ESG Biodiversity Screened World Index.In the first quarter of 2022  Euronext welcomed four new sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) to its markets. L‚ÄôOr√©al  Carrefour  Sanofi and Pernod Ricard listed SLBs on Euronext Paris  which link coupon payments to the achievement of sustainability objectives.As part of its ESG commitment  Euronext recognises the impact it can have on its partners and society at large. Euronext has therefore become a founding member of Sustainable Trading  a non-profit membership network that aims to drive the ESG transition across financial markets. Furthermore  Euronext published the ‚ÄúEuronext Guide for ESG reporting - Target 1.5¬∞C‚Äù. This guide aims to help companies engage in climate change mitigation policies with the support of their investors.Euronext has also joined forces with Climate Fresk to train its employees through climate workshops aimed at developing awareness and the ability to act at individual and company level. Euronext has already trained 200 employees across all European locations and is now rolling out the second phase of the project with the ambition to train 30% of its staff by the end of June 2022.With the planned migration to its new Core Data Centre powered by renewable energy  much of which is self-produced  on 6 June 2022  Euronext expects to reach the next significant milestone of its ESG commitment in Q2 2022. Euronext will disclose its SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative) targets in June 2022.Strategic partnership agreement between Euronext Securities and Spafid on issuer servicesOn 3 March 2022  Euronext Securities Milan and Spafid announced the agreement of a strategic partnership whereby Euronext Securities Milan will acquire the General Meetings  Designated Representative  and Shareholder‚Äôs Register activities of Spafid  and Euronext Securities Milan and Spafid will establish a closer cooperation aimed at mutually supporting the development of their respective core businesses16.The acquisition is an important step to further develop local added-value services to issuers  and to deliver on Euronext Securities‚Äô ambition to converge issuers services across all its locations (Denmark  Norway  Portugal and Italy).Euronext Securities is already providing similar services in Denmark and Norway  and this acquisition marks an important milestone of the Euronext ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan  to pan-Europeanise and scale up Euronext Securities  and specifically to expand added-value services for financial institutions and issuers across all its locations. In Italy  the integration of these activities into Euronext Securities Milan allows clients to benefit from the comprehensive and end-to-end management of the entire shareholder process.Disposal of Euronext Funds360On 30 March 2022  Euronext completed the sale of Euronext Funds360 to FE fundinfo  a global provider of data and tools management for the funds industry.

The company's CEO shall be authorized to make minor formal adjustments of the resolution which may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.

By democratising information on the impact of portfolios  FNZ Impact empowers investors  their advisers and wealth managers to contribute to a sustainable future for the next generation through their investment decisions.‚ÄúIn GIST  we believe we‚Äôve found not only one of the most rigorous and transparent methodologies in the market  but a company and team with a mission aligned strongly to our own and whose growth we are excited to support.‚ÄùGIST founder and chief executive Pavan Sukhdev said: ‚ÄúWe are delighted to have FNZ as a strategic investor and a partner in our mission. FNZ and GIST have shared goals and we believe that  together  we can drive real  measurable change in the investment landscape by empowering investors with the impact data they need to make better informed decisions at all stages of investment life cycles  from asset selection to risk management to exits.‚ÄúOur shared mission is to embed GIST impact methodology and algorithms into every responsible investor‚Äôs toolkit. There has never been greater urgency for investors and corporations to recognise and quantify all dimensions of investment impacts  and in doing so  to redefine corporate performance.‚ÄúFNZ‚Äôs support will boost GIST‚Äôs objective to mainstream our solutions  enabling more and more investors and corporations to measure performance across all value dimensions  manage material risks  and make better decisions in the interest of shareholders as well as other significant stakeholders.‚ÄùLast month  FNZ and Clearstream announced they had launched a high-tech business intelligence solution for the UK & European asset management industry.In February  FNZ announced that it had secured US$1.4bn (¬£1.03bn) in new equity funding from Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) and Motive Partners (Motive).It was part of the platform technology provider‚Äôs ambitious plan to accelerate growth through increased research and development alongside expanding in markets it has recently entered.Last year  it acquired the Zurich-based Appway to boost its automation offering to wealth managers.FNZ provides high tech IT solutions that underpin platforms such as Embark and Nucleus.It made a failed bid in 2019 to purchase rival technology firm GBST that was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).The CMA was concerned the transaction would be harmful to consumers and prevented the acquisition from going ahead.

SFC Energy AG (?SFC ? F3C:DE  ISIN: DE0007568578)  a leading supplier of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions  reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2022 today.?The demand for our environmentally friendly energy solutions remains high. We were able to significantly increase our record order backlog of EUR 30 551k at the end of 2021 to EUR 57 144k in the first quarter of 2022. The transformation of the energy landscape towards climate-neutral solutions is not only intact  but is experiencing further dynamization in the wake of the latest geopolitical developments. Intact demand is offset by a globally strained supply chain and logistics situation as well as increased prices for precursors  raw materials and transport costs  however. These factors are putting a temporary strain on profitability. We have already addressed these issues by implementing clearly defined measures. For example  we are trying to cushion possible fluctuations in the supply chains by increasingly relying on European suppliers and building up our inventories. We have also adjusted the prices of our products to the new market conditions so that we can significantly increase profitability again over the next quarters of 2022.The milestones achieved in the first quarter as part of the regional expansion of the business are further consistent steps in our growth strategy. We are strengthening our local presence in India  as local value creation will significantly facilitate access to an enormously fast-growing market in cooperation with our long-standing partners FC TecNrgy and Bharat Electronics. Here  we now offer the entire EFOY hydrogen and methanol fuel cell product range. The situation is similar in Singapore  where we are meeting the high demand for hydrogen technologies in cooperation with Oneberry Technologies. In Europe  together with Test-Fuchs and the Auto AG Group  we are meeting with great interest from a wide range of user industries with the pilot system of the H 2 genset  a mobile and emission-free hydrogen-based power generator ? a ?green generator?. The high potential of H 2 technologies is also underscored by our cooperation with the Wolftank Group. We have been testing a backup hydrogen power supply for telecom towers for the leading Italian telecommunications company TIM (formerly Telecom Italia) since March.Due to the intact demand situation  we have already rolled out the largest investment program in the company?s history and are continuing to systematically work through the individual steps. Specifically  we are doubling our production capacity at the Brunnthal site and introducing an additional production line in Cluj  Romania.We are convinced that our products will not only accompany  but also shape and accelerate the transformation towards a climate-neutral energy landscape. We therefore remain very optimistic about the rest of the 2022 financial year and the tasks that lie ahead of us.?Development of sales and ordersOrder intake increased significantly to EUR 44 257k (Q1/2021: EUR 15 647k) due to the continued strong demand momentum in the first quarter. This adds up to a nearly threefold increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. The good order situation led to an increase in the order backlog to EUR 57 144k as of March 31  2022 (December 31  2021: EUR 30 551k).In the period from January 1 to March 31  2022  the SFC Energy Group generated sales growth of 5.4% to EUR 17 905k (Q1/2021: EUR 16 984k). This positive development in the challenging economic environment resulted from the growth of the Clean Energy segment  which achieved a 21.9% increase in sales compared to the same quarter of the previous year due to continued high demand for fuel cells. About 10% of potential additional sales could not be realized in the first quarter due to delays in the supply chain.Sales by segments in EURk Q1/2022 Q1/2021 Clean Energy 12 279 10 071 Clean Power Management 5 627 6 913 Total 17 905 16 984Development of the segmentsSales in the Clean Energy segment increased by 21.9% to EUR 12 279k in the first quarter compared to EUR 10 071k in the same quarter of the previous year. Sales of fuel cell solutions for industrial applications  which made the largest contribution to segment sales  increased significantly in the reporting quarter  followed by SFC solutions for private (consumer) applications. Sales to public safety customers  which made the smallest contribution to segment sales  also increased significantly in the reporting quarter  following low sales in the same period of the previous year due to the pandemic. In addition to significantly higher demand from Asia  the increased contribution from the fuel cell business in the US was a key driving factor of growth. The largest US order in the company?s history from LiveView Technologies in 2021 was followed by another large-volume order from this customer for fuel cells for use in civil surveillance technology in March 2022. At 68.6% (Q1/2021: 59.3%)  the Clean Energy segment further expanded its share of total Group sales in the first quarter  while the Clean Power Management segment?s share of Group sales decreased to 31.4% (Q1/2021: 40.7%). Sales in this segment fell by 18.6% to EUR 5 627k in the reporting quarter  compared to EUR 6 913k in the same quarter of the previous year. Despite the very high order backlog  the main reason for the decline is the challenging procurement environment for electronic components  which affects the Clean Power Management segment more than the Clean Energy segment and results in shifts in sales.Development of earningsDespite the positive development of Group sales in the first quarter  increased material  logistics and transport costs in particular had an offsetting effect on gross profit. Gross profit declined to EUR 5 608k in the first quarter (Q1/2021: EUR 6 203k). The resulting gross profit margin of the Group (gross profit as a percentage of sales) amounted to 31.3% in the reporting quarter (Q1/2021: 36.5%).The gross profit for the individual segments compared to the previous year is as follows:Gross profit by segment in EURk Q1/2022 Q1/2021 Clean Energy 4 206 4 096 Clean Power Management 1 402 2 107 Total 5 608 6 203Underlying EBITDA  i.e. EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring effects  declined to EUR 809k in the first quarter of 2022 (Q1/2021: EUR 2 346k). The underlying EBITDA margin decreased significantly to 4.5% in the reporting quarter (Q1/2021: 13.8%). The decline in underlying EBITDA was mainly due to the decrease in gross profit in conjunction with the increase in functional costs  in particular general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses is attributable to higher personnel expenses and significantly higher audit  legal and consulting expenses in the first quarter.Underlying EBIT  i.e. EBIT adjusted for non-recurring effects  decreased significantly to EUR -418k (Q1/2021: EUR 1 425k) compared to the same quarter of the previous year. This resulted in an adjusted EBIT margin of -2.3% (Q1/2021: 8.4%). The first quarter closed with a consolidated net loss for the period of EUR -1 178k (Q1/2021: EUR -3 635k). Earnings per share in accordance with IFRS  basic and diluted  improved in the reporting quarter to EUR -0.08 (Q1/2021: EUR -0.25).Balance sheetAt 57.1%  the equity ratio in the first quarter was roughly at the level of the 2021 balance sheet date (57.3%). The net financial position (freely available cash and cash equivalents less liabilities to banks) declined to EUR 16 870k as of March 31  2022 (December 31  2021: EUR 21 888k). As of March 31  2022  the SFC Energy Group had 316 permanent employees (December 31  2021: 288).Forecast for 2022The macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains characterized by exceptional uncertainty. The war in Ukraine with its effects on supply and transport chains  as well as on the timely availability and price development of energy and raw materials  also contributes to this. SFC Energy AG is not currently aware of any further effects from the rapidly changing situation in Russia and Ukraine  but they could potentially have negative consequences for its business activities if the situation were to worsen beyond the current level.Besides further geopolitical uncertainties  the forecast is also hampered by continuing shortages of electronic components and other industrial precursors as well as considerable inflationary pressure on companies. Last but not least  the further course of the pandemic  and in particular the strict countermeasures in China  harbor uncertainties for global supply chains and production.?Despite these macroeconomic uncertainties  we anticipate continued growth in global demand for fuel cell solutions and increasing market penetration of our products based on strong order momentum in the first quarter of 2022. This is based on the assumptions of a constantly rising (off-grid) energy demand  a continuing effort by society and politics to reduce dependency or use of fossil fuels  and the rapidly growing global acceptance of sustainable green energy technologies necessary to achieve long-term climate goals ? said Dr. Peter Podesser.In light of this situation  the Management Board confirms its full-year forecast for the current fiscal year dated February 14  2022  and expects consolidated sales in the range of EUR 75 million to EUR 83 million  underlying EBITDA in the range of EUR 6.0 million to EUR 9.1 million and underlying EBIT in the range of EUR 1.6 million to EUR 2.9 million.The forecast is based on the assumption that the increased costs on the input material and logistics side can be passed on via the price adjustments that have been made. Furthermore  SFC Energy assumes that the impact on its business from COVID-19 and bottlenecks in the supply chains will not worsen dramatically in the course of fiscal year 2022.Strategic medium-term planningAccording to a study conducted by a prestigious consulting firm[1]  European companies are expected to generate sales of up to EUR 65 billion in Europe and another EUR 65 billion in the global markets for hydrogen and fuel cells in 2030. In view of these enormous growth opportunities for hydrogen and fuel cells combined with extensive government investment programs worldwide in this technology  the Management Board also sees growth potential for SFC Energy AG.The Management Board assumes that organic and inorganic sales growth to around EUR 350 million to 400 million and an increase in the underlying EBITDA margin to 15% to 20% can be achieved in the medium term. These assumptions are based on the extremely dynamic development of global demand for hydrogen and methanol fuel cells in stationary applications. Worldwide  awareness of the importance of environmentally friendly energy sources continues to grow significantly in society and politics. In this context  fuel cells from SFC Energy AG are an integral part of a sustainable decentralized energy supply as a replacement for conventional (diesel) generators  whether for industrial  governmental or private applications. Whether for the emergency power supply of critical infrastructures  telecommunications  new autonomous mobility concepts or advancing digitalization ? the fuel cell is a key technology for generating electrical energy efficiently and cleanly. As a fuel cell pioneer with approx. 55 000 fuel cells sold worldwide  totaling more than 100 million operating hours  SFC Energy AG is one of the few market players with comprehensive industrial experience and high technological expertise. The National Hydrogen Strategy in Germany and the related government investment incentives with a volume of more than EUR 9 billion  as well as the broad-based European hydrogen initiatives and support programs  represent a great opportunity for the SFC Energy Group to grow strongly. SFC Energy AG positioned itself in this dynamically growing market at an early stage and is one of the first companies in the world that is fully capable of providing industrially mature products to a steadily growing number of user industries. The use of established market access as well as new fields of application are just as much part of the accelerated growth strategy as strategic acquisitions and the expansion of regional partnerships. SFC Energy AG therefore expects to benefit disproportionately from the dynamic development of the fuel cell market and to grow faster than the market as a whole.Key figures Q1 2022/Q1 2021In EURk 01/01-03/31/2022 01/01-03/31/2021 Sales 17 905 16 984 Gross profit 5 608 6 203 Gross margin 31.3% 36.5% EBITDA 161 -2 458 EBITDA margin 0.9% -14.5% Underlying EBITDA 809 2 346 Underlying EBITDA margin 4.5% 13.8% EBIT -1 066 -3 378 EBIT margin -6.0% -19.9% Underlying EBIT -418 1 425 Underlying EBIT margin -2.3% 8.4% Consolidated net result for the period -1 178 -3 635 Order backlog* 57 144 30 551* As of March 31  2022Detailed financial informationThe Quarterly Release for the first quarter of 2022 of SFC Energy AG is available for download at www.sfc.com.SFC Energy AG will hold a conference call in English today  May 17  2022  at 9:00 a.m. for interested investors and journalists.

This builds upon the recent extension of the collaboration with AstraZeneca to include two new disease areas  systemic lupus erythematosus and heart failure  signed in January 2022.The Benevolent Platform‚Ñ¢ is a disease-agnostic AI-enabled drug discovery platform that is capable of generating novel targets at scale. As part of the collaboration  BenevolentAI integrated AstraZeneca's data into its biomedical Knowledge Graph  which includes proprietary  public and licensed data from a variety of sources including  but not limited to  scientific literature  patents  genetics  chemistry and clinical trials. BenevolentAI and AstraZeneca scientists work side-by-side  using the platform and Knowledge Graph to interrogate the underlying mechanisms of IPF  to frame and test hypotheses and rapidly identify novel targets.Professor Maria Belvisi  SVP and Head of Research and Early Development  Respiratory and Immunology at AstraZeneca commented: ""IPF is a devastating disease with median survival of around 3 years and there is a serious need for better treatment options. At AstraZeneca  we are continuously striving to improve our R&D productivity in order to quickly bring potentially innovative treatments to complex diseases such as IPF. Our partnership with BenevolentAI furthers our commitment and we are proud to deliver a second novel target for IPF to our portfolio.""Story continuesDr Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer at BenevolentAI commented: ""Target identification is an essential first step in the drug discovery pipeline  and where we believe the Benevolent Platform‚Ñ¢ can make the biggest impact. Our AI-enabled approach empowers scientists to explore all the available evidence to unravel the enormous complexity of biological systems and the underlying mechanisms of disease. By reaching this third milestone  we have further validated the ability of BenevolentAI's disease agnostic platform to identify novel targets and deliver tangible scientific results for complex and debilitating conditions such as IPF.""ABOUT BENEVOLENTAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading  clinical-stage AI-enabled drug discovery company listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Through the combined capabilities of its AI platform  scientific expertise  and wet-lab facilities  BenevolentAI is well-positioned to deliver novel drug candidates with a higher probability of clinical success than those developed using traditional methods.

We are preparing for the launch of our two Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trials which we plan to initiate as soon as possible. We look forward to sharing topline results from our Phase 2 DESTINY-1 study in NASH for PXL065 in the third quarter of 2022 ‚Äù said Thomas Kuhn  Chief Executive Officer of Poxel. ‚ÄúWe continue to pursue various financing options to extend our cash runway  prioritizing non-dilutive sources. We remain focused on developing our clinical candidates and demonstrating their value in the field of metabolic diseases.‚ÄùCommercial UpdateTWYMEEG¬Æ (Imeglimin)As of March 31  2022  royalty revenue to Poxel based on TWYMEEG net sales in Japan under the Sumitomo Pharma license agreement has been limited following TWYMEEG‚Äôs recent commercial launch on September 16  2021. TWYMEEG‚Äôs initial commercial uptake has been affected by restrictions in Japan on prescribing any new drug in its first year of commercialization  and conditions related to COVID-19  which have reduced the frequency of physician visits and limited the extensive prescriber education efforts required for any launch of an innovative drug with a new mechanism of action. However  as a result of Sumitomo Pharma's promotional activities and efforts since launch  TWYMEEG is very well known among prescribers.Clinical UpdatesNASHPXL065 (deuterium-stabilised R-pioglitazone) is in a Phase 2 study (DESTINY-1). Results from this 36-week  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  dose-ranging study designed to assess efficacy and safety are anticipated in Q3 2022. The goal of DESTINY-1 is to identify the optimal dose or doses of PXL065 to advance into a Phase 3 registration trial for the treatment of noncirrhotic biopsy-proven NASH patients.Rare metabolic diseasesIn ALD  Phase 2a biomarker proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trials of PXL065 and PXL770 are expected to initiate as soon as possible  subject to additional financing. Two identical studies will enroll adult male patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  the most common ALD subtype. The POC studies will evaluate the pharmacokinetics  safety and efficacy of PXL065 and PXL770 after 12 weeks of treatment based on relevant disease biomarkers  such as the effect on very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)  the characteristic plasma marker of the disease.In February and April  the FDA awarded Fast Track Designation (FTD) to PXL065 and PXL770 respectively  for ALD. The FDA grants FTD to investigational drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition  and which fill an unmet medical need. Filling an unmet medical need is defined as providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available therapy. The key benefits of FTD comprise enhanced access to the FDA  with regular and more frequent opportunities for consultation and discussion.Significant Events after the PeriodDuring the 2nd quarter  the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to PXL065 and PXL770 for ALD. ODD confers a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received.First Quarter 2022 Financial UpdateAs of March 31  2022  cash and cash equivalents were EUR 24.0 million (USD 26.7 million)  as compared to EUR 32.3 million (USD 36.6 million) as of December 31  2021.

However  the Company is subject to certain financial covenants1 related to its debt with IPF Partners which could be potentially breached in Q3 2022.The Company is actively pursuing various financing options  which include dilutive and non-dilutive sources  as well as discussions with IPF partners.First Quarter 2022 RevenuePoxel reported EUR 32 thousand revenue for the quarter ended March 31  2022  as compared to no revenue during the corresponding period in 2021.Revenue for the first quarter of 2022 reflects JPY 4.4 million (EUR 32 thousand) of royalty revenue from Sumitomo Pharma which represents 8% of TWYMEEG net sales in Japan. Based on the current forecast  Poxel expects to receive 8% royalties on TWYMEEG net sales in Japan through the Sumitomo Pharma fiscal year 2022 (April 2022 to March 2023). As part of the Merck Serono licensing agreement  Poxel will pay Merck Serono a fixed 8% royalty based on the net sales of Imeglimin  independent of the level of sales.EUR (in thousands) Q1 Q1 2022 2021 3 months 3 months Sumitomo Pharma Agreement 32 - Other - - Total revenues 32 - Unaudited dataPlanned Presentations and Participation at the Following Upcoming EventsEuropean Renal Association  May 25-285 th Global NASH Congress  May 26-27Global NASH Congress  May 26-27 Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference  June 8-10JMP Securities 2022 Life Sciences Conference  June 15-16Next Financial Press Release : Second Quarter 2022 Financial Update on August 30  2022.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders.

PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-stereoisomer of pioglitazone. PXL770 is a novel  first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator. Both compounds are preparing to enter into Phase 2a clinical Proof-of-Concept (POC) biomarker studies as soon as possible  subject to financing.Poxel CEO  Thomas Kuhn  commented: ‚ÄúThe award of Orphan Drug Designation to both PXL065 and PXL770 by the FDA is an additional regulatory milestone for the development of these potential medicines in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy  for which there is currently no approved therapy. This status could give either molecule a seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  and  along with its recent Fast Track Designation  gives us confidence in the strategic shift into rare diseases we initiated last year. We remain excited to pursue treatments for ALD as this represents an area with very high unmet medical need. We look forward to the next steps as we are preparing for the initiation of our Phase 2a clinical studies as soon as possible. To enable this effort  we continue to pursue various financing options that will also extend our cash runway  prioritizing non-dilutive sources.‚ÄùOrphan Drug Designation (ODD)ODD is granted by the FDA to novel therapeutics for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200 000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation1 gives a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received.About ALDX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an orphan neurometabolic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which encodes for a key protein that is required for metabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) by peroxisomes (cellular organelles). ALD is the most common leukodystrophy with a prevalence similar to hemophilia ‚Äì up to 1/10 000 individuals in the general population have ALD [https://rarediseases.org]. Forms of this disease include cerebral ALD (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) which is the most common form ‚Äì typically occurring in adolescence through adulthood. AMN is characterized by chronic and progressive distal axonopathy involving the long tracts of the spinal cord and to a lesser extent the peripheral nerves resulting in progressive stiffness and weakness in the legs  impaired gait and balance  incontinence  and loss of sensation. Nearly all men with a diagnosis of ALD will develop AMN  and many women also present with features of AMN with a later onset. C-ALD is characterized by inflammatory demyelination of cells in the brain and typically afflicts children  but many men with AMN may also develop cerebral disease; these white matter brain lesions lead to severe neurologic deficits and death. There are no approved medicines for ALD (other than glucocorticoid supplements for associated adrenal insufficiency). C-ALD when first detected in early childhood  can be treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HSCT is currently limited to early stage of C-ALD and this procedure is at risk of severe adverse reactions.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. Poxel has clinical and earlier-stage programs from its adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator and deuterated TZD platforms targeting chronic and rare metabolic diseases. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) is in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). PXL770  a first-in-class direct AMPK activator  has successfully completed a Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of NASH  which met its objectives. For the rare inherited metabolic disorder  adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)  the company intends to initiate Phase 2a proof of concept studies with PXL065 and PXL770 in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). TWYMEEG¬Æ (Imeglimin)  Poxel‚Äôs first-in-class lead product that targets mitochondrial dysfunction  has been approved and launched for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan. Poxel expects to receive royalties and sales-based payments from Sumitomo Pharma.

The world was banking on India to alleviate wheat supplies crimped by the Ukraine war.India  the world‚Äôs second-largest wheat grower  on May 13 said it was banning private exports to manage its food security which is ‚Äúat risk‚Äù  but kept a window open for overseas shipments only on the specific request of a foreign government to ‚Äúmeet their food-security needs‚Äù.The country‚Äôs move to ban overseas sales will worsen a global food shortage and could drive up prices even more  analysts said.According to a Financial Times report  wheat futures traded in Chicago Board of Trade  a global benchmark  rose 5.9% to $12.47 a bushel (about 27 kg)  touching a two-month high  while overall prices of the staple have risen more than 60% this year on the back of disruptions due to the Ukraine war. Russia and Ukraine account for almost a third of the world‚Äôs total wheat exports.In Europe  wheat prices surged to a new record on Monday  jumping to 435 euros ($453) per tonne (100 kg) at the benchmark Euronext market  up from the previous record of 422 euros on Friday  an AFP report said.‚ÄúIndia isn‚Äôt a big exporter of wheat in normal years. Yet  its ban on exports have set prices on fire precisely because global supplies are currently running very thin ‚Äù said Ashok Agrawal of Comtrade  a trading firm.India was hoping to export large quantities as the government had forecast a record output of 111 million tonne of wheat in February. A heatwave from mid-March shriveled the winter staple  forcing the government to cut production estimates by at least 5.7% to 105 million tonnes.‚Äú‚Ä¶there is a sudden spike in the global prices of wheat arising out of many factors  as a result of which the food security of India  neighbouring and other vulnerable countries is at risk‚Äù  the Indian commerce ministry order banning exports said.The decision appeared to raise hackles  with the G7 countries appearing to criticise India‚Äôs decision in a statement on Saturday.India exported a record 7.85 million tonnes in the fiscal year to March  up 275% from a year ago. Before the export ban took effect  the country had already contracted to export 4.5 million tonne as the government sought to ramp up overseas sales.These sales are expected to go through if formalities  such as letters of credit  have been issued  according to the government‚Äôs notification curbing export. In April 2022  the country‚Äôs traders sold 1.4 million tonne overseas  taking advantage of high global demand and prices.‚ÄúIf this ban occurred in a normal year the impact would be minimal  but the loss of Ukraine volumes exacerbates the issues ‚Äù Andrew Whitelaw  a grains analyst at Melbourne-based Thomas Elder Markets  told Bloomberg.SHARE THIS ARTICLE ONABOUT THE AUTHOR Zia Haq Zia Haq reports on public policy  economy and agriculture.

It was unclear whether these visits will now go ahead.The export ban drew sharp criticism from the Group of Seven industrialised nations  which said that such measures ""would worsen the crisis"" of rising commodity prices.India recorded its warmest March on record -- blamed on climate change -- and in recent weeks has seen a scorching heatwave with temperatures upwards of 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit).This hit farmers in wheat-producing northern India  prompting the government to predict output would fall at least five percent this year from 109 million tonnes in 2021.¬© 2022 AFP",neutral,0.08,0.67,0.26,negative,0.02,0.16,0.82,True,English,"['Indian export ban', 'Wheat prices', 'Commerce Secretary BVR Subrahmanyam', 'Seven industrialised nations', 'major buffer stocks', 'largest wheat producer', 'food security needs', 'higher global prices', 'rising commodity prices', 'express government approval', 'Global wheat prices', 'warmest March', 'climate change', 'recent weeks', 'temperatures upwards', '45 degrees Celsius', 'European trading', 'Euronext market', 'February invasion', 'agricultural powerhouse', 'fertiliser shortages', 'poor harvests', 'social unrest', 'poorer countries', 'hottest March', 'new deals', 'New Delhi', '1.4 billion people', 'sharp rise', '20 million tonnes', 'poor families', 'Export deals', 'future shipments', 'other governments', 'supply shortages', 'export ban', 'sharp criticism', '109 million tonnes', 'global exports', 'scorching heatwave', 'wheat exports', 'supply fears', 'lower production', 'possible famine', 'Ukraine war', 'new record', 'previous record', 'northern India', 'Fahrenheit', 'Paris', 'AFP', 'Monday', 'Advertising', '435 euros', '422 euros', 'Friday', 'Russia', '12 percent', 'spike', 'inflation', 'world', 'Saturday', 'traders', 'move', 'face', 'parts', 'flour', 'Sunday', 'farmers', 'pandemic', 'handouts', 'millions', 'crisis', 'directive', 'May', 'place', 'requests', 'delegations', 'Egypt', 'Turkey', 'visits', 'Group', 'measures', 'wheat-producing', 'output', '40']",2022-05-16,2022-05-17,france24.com

This transformative move  managed in collaboration with clients  marks a milestone in bringing back to the European Union the data centre that handles 25% of European trading volumes.This migration will allow Euronext to fully control and directly manage its core IT infrastructure  and provide clients with a key service that was previously outsourced. This will also allow the generation of colocation revenues  embedded in the upgraded synergies. Clients will benefit from a state-of-the-art colocation facility  and since this data centre is 100% powered by renewable energy sources  clients will see their own carbon footprints reduced. The date targeted for the first part of the Group Core Data Centre migration  as announced in November 2021  is 6 June 2022. The Core Data Centre migration has been timed in order to pave the way for the migration of the Borsa Italiana equity and derivatives markets onto Euronext Optiq¬Æ trading technology by mid-2023.Euronext has successfully finalised the build phase of the Core Data Centre  which focused on setting up the production infrastructure (servers and networks) and the colocation room (client racks). Client connectivity has been implemented and is now operational. Optiq¬Æ  Euronext‚Äôs proprietary state-of-the-art technology  has also been successfully installed in Bergamo. The colocation and connectivity offerings have been designed and shared with clients. Euronext has rolled-out the client installation (equipment shipping  installation  and testing)  which is almost finalised. The first successful tests connecting clients to the production environment in Bergamo confirmed the readiness for the upcoming migration in June 2022.Progress on the pillars of Euronext‚Äôs ESG commitmentEuronext has advanced its ‚ÄúFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äù climate commitment with the launch of the OBX¬Æ ESG index in Norway and the AEX¬Æ ESG index in the Netherlands in May 2022  joining Euronext‚Äôs growing franchise of national blue-chip ESG indices. Beyond blue-chip ESG indices  Euronext has introduced a number of products tailored towards evolving business challenges  such as the Euronext French Employment 40 EW Index. The relevance of Euronext‚Äôs ESG index franchise has been recognised by Finance for Tomorrow  which identified Euronext as a leading contributor to the protection of biodiversity15 thanks to its biodiversity index solutions  such as the Euronext ESG Biodiversity Screened World Index.In the first quarter of 2022  Euronext welcomed four new sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) to its markets. L‚ÄôOr√©al  Carrefour  Sanofi and Pernod Ricard listed SLBs on Euronext Paris  which link coupon payments to the achievement of sustainability objectives.As part of its ESG commitment  Euronext recognises the impact it can have on its partners and society at large. Euronext has therefore become a founding member of Sustainable Trading  a non-profit membership network that aims to drive the ESG transition across financial markets. Furthermore  Euronext published the ‚ÄúEuronext Guide for ESG reporting - Target 1.5¬∞C‚Äù. This guide aims to help companies engage in climate change mitigation policies with the support of their investors.Euronext has also joined forces with Climate Fresk to train its employees through climate workshops aimed at developing awareness and the ability to act at individual and company level. Euronext has already trained 200 employees across all European locations and is now rolling out the second phase of the project with the ambition to train 30% of its staff by the end of June 2022.With the planned migration to its new Core Data Centre powered by renewable energy  much of which is self-produced  on 6 June 2022  Euronext expects to reach the next significant milestone of its ESG commitment in Q2 2022. Euronext will disclose its SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative) targets in June 2022.Strategic partnership agreement between Euronext Securities and Spafid on issuer servicesOn 3 March 2022  Euronext Securities Milan and Spafid announced the agreement of a strategic partnership whereby Euronext Securities Milan will acquire the General Meetings  Designated Representative  and Shareholder‚Äôs Register activities of Spafid  and Euronext Securities Milan and Spafid will establish a closer cooperation aimed at mutually supporting the development of their respective core businesses16.The acquisition is an important step to further develop local added-value services to issuers  and to deliver on Euronext Securities‚Äô ambition to converge issuers services across all its locations (Denmark  Norway  Portugal and Italy).Euronext Securities is already providing similar services in Denmark and Norway  and this acquisition marks an important milestone of the Euronext ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan  to pan-Europeanise and scale up Euronext Securities  and specifically to expand added-value services for financial institutions and issuers across all its locations.

Developments of the Ukraine crisis Euronext does not own any entities in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine and the Group has a limited activity with clients and/or entities based in those countries. Similarly  the Group does not have critical vendors that are linked to Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. The impact of the crisis on business and vendor support is limited. The Group is closely monitoring further developments and will continuously adapt its risk assessment to the current situation. Core Data Centre migration update Euronext announced in April 2021 the strategic decision to migrate its Core Data Centre from Basildon  in the United Kingdom  to Bergamo  in Italy. The migration is a response to multiple factors  including the dynamic created by Brexit and a strong rationale to locate the Group‚Äôs Core Data Centre in a European Union country where Euronext operates a large business. This transformative move  managed in collaboration with clients  marks a milestone in bringing back to the European Union the data centre that handles 25% of European trading volumes. This migration will allow Euronext to fully control and directly manage its core IT infrastructure  and provide clients with a key service that was previously outsourced. This will also allow the generation of colocation revenues  embedded in the upgraded synergies. Clients will benefit from a state-of-the-art colocation facility  and since this data centre is 100% powered by renewable energy sources  clients will see their own carbon footprints reduced. The date targeted for the first part of the Group Core Data Centre migration  as announced in November 2021  is 6 June 2022. The Core Data Centre migration has been timed in order to pave the way for the migration of the Borsa Italiana equity and derivatives markets onto Euronext Optiq¬Æ trading technology by mid-2023. Euronext has successfully finalised the build phase of the Core Data Centre  which focused on setting up the production infrastructure (servers and networks) and the colocation room (client racks). Client connectivity has been implemented and is now operational. Optiq¬Æ  Euronext‚Äôs proprietary state-of-the-art technology  has also been successfully installed in Bergamo. The colocation and connectivity offerings have been designed and shared with clients. Euronext has rolled-out the client installation (equipment shipping  installation  and testing)  which is almost finalised. The first successful tests connecting clients to the production environment in Bergamo confirmed the readiness for the upcoming migration in June 2022. Progress on the pillars of Euronext‚Äôs ESG commitment Euronext has advanced its ‚ÄúFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äù climate commitment with the launch of the OBX¬Æ ESG index in Norway and the AEX¬Æ ESG index in the Netherlands in May 2022  joining Euronext‚Äôs growing franchise of national blue-chip ESG indices. Beyond blue-chip ESG indices  Euronext has introduced a number of products tailored towards evolving business challenges  such as the Euronext French Employment 40 EW Index. The relevance of Euronext‚Äôs ESG index franchise has been recognised by Finance for Tomorrow  which identified Euronext as a leading contributor to the protection of biodiversity15 thanks to its biodiversity index solutions  such as the Euronext ESG Biodiversity Screened World Index. In the first quarter of 2022  Euronext welcomed four new sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) to its markets. L‚ÄôOr√©al  Carrefour  Sanofi and Pernod Ricard listed SLBs on Euronext Paris  which link coupon payments to the achievement of sustainability objectives. As part of its ESG commitment  Euronext recognises the impact it can have on its partners and society at large. Euronext has therefore become a founding member of Sustainable Trading  a non-profit membership network that aims to drive the ESG transition across financial markets. Furthermore  Euronext published the ‚ÄúEuronext Guide for ESG reporting - Target 1.5¬∞C‚Äù. This guide aims to help companies engage in climate change mitigation policies with the support of their investors. Euronext has also joined forces with Climate Fresk to train its employees through climate workshops aimed at developing awareness and the ability to act at individual and company level. Euronext has already trained 200 employees across all European locations and is now rolling out the second phase of the project with the ambition to train 30% of its staff by the end of June 2022. With the planned migration to its new Core Data Centre powered by renewable energy  much of which is self-produced  on 6 June 2022  Euronext expects to reach the next significant milestone of its ESG commitment in Q2 2022. Euronext will disclose its SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative) targets in June 2022. Strategic partnership agreement between Euronext Securities and Spafid on issuer services On 3 March 2022  Euronext Securities Milan and Spafid announced the agreement of a strategic partnership whereby Euronext Securities Milan will acquire the General Meetings  Designated Representative  and Shareholder‚Äôs Register activities of Spafid  and Euronext Securities Milan and Spafid will establish a closer cooperation aimed at mutually supporting the development of their respective core businesses16. The acquisition is an important step to further develop local added-value services to issuers  and to deliver on Euronext Securities‚Äô ambition to converge issuers services across all its locations (Denmark  Norway  Portugal and Italy). Euronext Securities is already providing similar services in Denmark and Norway  and this acquisition marks an important milestone of the Euronext ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan  to pan-Europeanise and scale up Euronext Securities  and specifically to expand added-value services for financial institutions and issuers across all its locations. In Italy  the integration of these activities into Euronext Securities Milan allows clients to benefit from the comprehensive and end-to-end management of the entire shareholder process.

Appendix Adjustments in financial disclosure To highlight its underlying performance  starting from Q1 2022  Euronext will publish underlying recurring costs  adjusted EBITDA and non-recurring costs. Euronext will then remove the exceptional items line from its financial statements. Consequently  costs previously reported as exceptional items will from Q1 2022 be included into their respective lines within Euronext operating expenses as non-recurring items. The ‚Ç¨150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-recurring items and will be withdrawn from Q1 2022 from underlying recurring costs. From Q1 2022  the computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share will be adjusted accordingly. The computation of reported net income and earnings per share will not be impacted. 2024 strategic plan targets remain unchanged and are not affected by this change in reporting. The new non-IFRS indicators are defined below. Non-IFRS financial measures For comparative purposes  the company provides unaudited non-IFRS measures including: Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisationEBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA  adjusted EBITDA margin Non-IFRS measures are defined as follows: Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expensesUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expenses  excluding non-recurring costsAdjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businessesEBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisationAdjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisationEBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and incomeAdjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and incomeAdjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.

Shareholders representing a total of 6.41% of the total issued and outstanding share capital entitled to vote were represented by proxy.Bryan Jennings  CFO of NOXXON commented: ‚ÄúThe approval of NOXXON‚Äôs proposed share consolidation is an important sign of shareholder support for the company‚Äôs plans to improve share liquidity and stability. The consolidation  along with our compelling progress in the clinic  will strengthen our position with respect to potential future financing opportunities.

By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  NOXXON‚Äôs approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses against the immune system and enable greater therapeutic impact. NOXXON‚Äôs lead program NOX-A12 has delivered final top-line data from a Keytruda¬Æ combination trial in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients published at the ESMO conference in September 2020 and in July 2021 the company announced its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck‚Äôs Keytruda¬Æ and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. NOXXON is also studying NOX-A12 in brain cancer in combination with radiotherapy which has been granted orphan drug status in the US and EU for the treatment of certain brain cancers. GLORIA  a trial of NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy has delivered top-line data from all three dose-escalation cohorts showing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA has been expanded to assess the benefit of NOX-A12 with other treatment combinations  radiotherapy + bevacizumab and radiotherapy + pembrolizumab. The company‚Äôs second clinical-stage asset NOX-E36 is a Phase 2 TME asset targeting the innate immune system. NOXXON plans to test NOX‚ÄëE36 in patients with solid tumors.

GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 three additional arms combining NOX-A12 with: A. radiotherapy in patients with complete tumor resection; B. radiotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with incomplete tumor resection; and C. radiotherapy and pembrolizumab in patients with incomplete tumor resection.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is NOXXON‚Äôs open-label two-arm phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.

Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH's primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company's lead product candidate  eryaspase  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells' altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer.

PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-stereoisomer of pioglitazone. PXL770 is a novel  first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator. Both compounds are preparing to enter into Phase 2a clinical Proof-of-Concept (POC) biomarker studies as soon as possible  subject to financing.Poxel CEO  Thomas Kuhn  commented: ‚ÄúThe award of Orphan Drug Designation to both PXL065 and PXL770 by the FDA is an additional regulatory milestone for the development of these potential medicines in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy  for which there is currently no approved therapy. This status could give either molecule a seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  and  along with its recent Fast Track Designation  gives us confidence in the strategic shift into rare diseases we initiated last year. We remain excited to pursue treatments for ALD as this represents an area with very high unmet medical need. We look forward to the next steps as we are preparing for the initiation of our Phase 2a clinical studies as soon as possible. To enable this effort  we continue to pursue various financing options that will also extend our cash runway  prioritizing non-dilutive sources.‚ÄùOrphan Drug Designation (ODD)ODD is granted by the FDA to novel therapeutics for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200 000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation1 gives a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received.About ALDX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an orphan neurometabolic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which encodes for a key protein that is required for metabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) by peroxisomes (cellular organelles). ALD is the most common leukodystrophy with a prevalence similar to hemophilia ‚Äì up to 1/10 000 individuals in the general population have ALD [https://rarediseases.org]. Forms of this disease include cerebral ALD (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) which is the most common form ‚Äì typically occurring in adolescence through adulthood. AMN is characterized by chronic and progressive distal axonopathy involving the long tracts of the spinal cord and to a lesser extent the peripheral nerves resulting in progressive stiffness and weakness in the legs  impaired gait and balance  incontinence  and loss of sensation. Nearly all men with a diagnosis of ALD will develop AMN  and many women also present with features of AMN with a later onset. C-ALD is characterized by inflammatory demyelination of cells in the brain and typically afflicts children  but many men with AMN may also develop cerebral disease; these white matter brain lesions lead to severe neurologic deficits and death. There are no approved medicines for ALD (other than glucocorticoid supplements for associated adrenal insufficiency). C-ALD when first detected in early childhood  can be treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HSCT is currently limited to early stage of C-ALD and this procedure is at risk of severe adverse reactions.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. Poxel has clinical and earlier-stage programs from its adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator and deuterated TZD platforms targeting chronic and rare metabolic diseases. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) is in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). PXL770  a first-in-class direct AMPK activator  has successfully completed a Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of NASH  which met its objectives. For the rare inherited metabolic disorder  adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)  the company intends to initiate Phase 2a proof of concept studies with PXL065 and PXL770 in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). TWYMEEG¬Æ (Imeglimin)  Poxel‚Äôs first-in-class lead product that targets mitochondrial dysfunction  has been approved and launched for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan.
