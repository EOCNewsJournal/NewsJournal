Similarly  the Group does not have critical vendors that are linked to Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. The impact of the crisis on business and vendor support is limited.The Group is closely monitoring further developments and will continuously adapt its risk assessment to the current situation.Core Data Centre migration updateEuronext announced in April 2021 the strategic decision to migrate its Core Data Centre from Basildon  in the United Kingdom  to Bergamo  in Italy.The migration is a response to multiple factors  including the dynamic created by Brexit and a strong rationale to locate the Group’s Core Data Centre in a European Union country where Euronext operates a large business. This transformative move  managed in collaboration with clients  marks a milestone in bringing back to the European Union the data centre that handles 25% of European trading volumes.This migration will allow Euronext to fully control and directly manage its core IT infrastructure  and provide clients with a key service that was previously outsourced. This will also allow the generation of colocation revenues  embedded in the upgraded synergies. Clients will benefit from a state-of-the-art colocation facility  and since this data centre is 100% powered by renewable energy sources  clients will see their own carbon footprints reduced. The date targeted for the first part of the Group Core Data Centre migration  as announced in November 2021  is 6 June 2022. The Core Data Centre migration has been timed in order to pave the way for the migration of the Borsa Italiana equity and derivatives markets onto Euronext Optiq® trading technology by mid-2023.Euronext has successfully finalised the build phase of the Core Data Centre  which focused on setting up the production infrastructure (servers and networks) and the colocation room (client racks). Client connectivity has been implemented and is now operational. Optiq®  Euronext’s proprietary state-of-the-art technology  has also been successfully installed in Bergamo. The colocation and connectivity offerings have been designed and shared with clients. Euronext has rolled-out the client installation (equipment shipping  installation  and testing)  which is almost finalised. The first successful tests connecting clients to the production environment in Bergamo confirmed the readiness for the upcoming migration in June 2022.Progress on the pillars of Euronext’s ESG commitmentEuronext has advanced its “Fit for 1.5°” climate commitment with the launch of the OBX® ESG index in Norway and the AEX® ESG index in the Netherlands in May 2022  joining Euronext’s growing franchise of national blue-chip ESG indices. Beyond blue-chip ESG indices  Euronext has introduced a number of products tailored towards evolving business challenges  such as the Euronext French Employment 40 EW Index. The relevance of Euronext’s ESG index franchise has been recognised by Finance for Tomorrow  which identified Euronext as a leading contributor to the protection of biodiversity15 thanks to its biodiversity index solutions  such as the Euronext ESG Biodiversity Screened World Index.In the first quarter of 2022  Euronext welcomed four new sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) to its markets. L’Oréal  Carrefour  Sanofi and Pernod Ricard listed SLBs on Euronext Paris  which link coupon payments to the achievement of sustainability objectives.As part of its ESG commitment  Euronext recognises the impact it can have on its partners and society at large. Euronext has therefore become a founding member of Sustainable Trading  a non-profit membership network that aims to drive the ESG transition across financial markets. Furthermore  Euronext published the “Euronext Guide for ESG reporting - Target 1.5°C”. This guide aims to help companies engage in climate change mitigation policies with the support of their investors.Euronext has also joined forces with Climate Fresk to train its employees through climate workshops aimed at developing awareness and the ability to act at individual and company level. Euronext has already trained 200 employees across all European locations and is now rolling out the second phase of the project with the ambition to train 30% of its staff by the end of June 2022.With the planned migration to its new Core Data Centre powered by renewable energy  much of which is self-produced  on 6 June 2022  Euronext expects to reach the next significant milestone of its ESG commitment in Q2 2022. Euronext will disclose its SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative) targets in June 2022.Strategic partnership agreement between Euronext Securities and Spafid on issuer servicesOn 3 March 2022  Euronext Securities Milan and Spafid announced the agreement of a strategic partnership whereby Euronext Securities Milan will acquire the General Meetings  Designated Representative  and Shareholder’s Register activities of Spafid  and Euronext Securities Milan and Spafid will establish a closer cooperation aimed at mutually supporting the development of their respective core businesses16.The acquisition is an important step to further develop local added-value services to issuers  and to deliver on Euronext Securities’ ambition to converge issuers services across all its locations (Denmark  Norway  Portugal and Italy).Euronext Securities is already providing similar services in Denmark and Norway  and this acquisition marks an important milestone of the Euronext ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan  to pan-Europeanise and scale up Euronext Securities  and specifically to expand added-value services for financial institutions and issuers across all its locations.

By democratising information on the impact of portfolios  FNZ Impact empowers investors  their advisers and wealth managers to contribute to a sustainable future for the next generation through their investment decisions.“In GIST  we believe we’ve found not only one of the most rigorous and transparent methodologies in the market  but a company and team with a mission aligned strongly to our own and whose growth we are excited to support.”GIST founder and chief executive Pavan Sukhdev said: “We are delighted to have FNZ as a strategic investor and a partner in our mission. FNZ and GIST have shared goals and we believe that  together  we can drive real  measurable change in the investment landscape by empowering investors with the impact data they need to make better informed decisions at all stages of investment life cycles  from asset selection to risk management to exits.“Our shared mission is to embed GIST impact methodology and algorithms into every responsible investor’s toolkit. There has never been greater urgency for investors and corporations to recognise and quantify all dimensions of investment impacts  and in doing so  to redefine corporate performance.“FNZ’s support will boost GIST’s objective to mainstream our solutions  enabling more and more investors and corporations to measure performance across all value dimensions  manage material risks  and make better decisions in the interest of shareholders as well as other significant stakeholders.”Last month  FNZ and Clearstream announced they had launched a high-tech business intelligence solution for the UK & European asset management industry.In February  FNZ announced that it had secured US$1.4bn (£1.03bn) in new equity funding from Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) and Motive Partners (Motive).It was part of the platform technology provider’s ambitious plan to accelerate growth through increased research and development alongside expanding in markets it has recently entered.Last year  it acquired the Zurich-based Appway to boost its automation offering to wealth managers.FNZ provides high tech IT solutions that underpin platforms such as Embark and Nucleus.It made a failed bid in 2019 to purchase rival technology firm GBST that was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).The CMA was concerned the transaction would be harmful to consumers and prevented the acquisition from going ahead.

Revenue models include 1. in-app registration fees and digital goods  2. advertising  3. subscription  4. NFTs  and 5. franchise fees. Klocked already offers in-app fees and digital goods. The recently announced Trivver partnership unlocks brand new advertising revenues. Development of subscriptions and NFT’s is underway. Full commercialization also requires release on multiple platforms including Android  smart watch  smart TV  iPad  etc.With many of the necessary monetization pillars in place and based on first quarter 2022 revenue and marketing data  ePlay Digital is projecting a 400% increase in revenues from 2021 to 2022.Advertising MonetizationThe company recently announced metaverse ad activation with Trivver to bring dynamic virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) advertising and NFT’s directly into the Klocked app and Klocked World.

This builds upon the recent extension of the collaboration with AstraZeneca to include two new disease areas  systemic lupus erythematosus and heart failure  signed in January 2022.The Benevolent Platform™ is a disease-agnostic AI-enabled drug discovery platform that is capable of generating novel targets at scale. As part of the collaboration  BenevolentAI integrated AstraZeneca's data into its biomedical Knowledge Graph  which includes proprietary  public and licensed data from a variety of sources including  but not limited to  scientific literature  patents  genetics  chemistry and clinical trials. BenevolentAI and AstraZeneca scientists work side-by-side  using the platform and Knowledge Graph to interrogate the underlying mechanisms of IPF  to frame and test hypotheses and rapidly identify novel targets.Professor Maria Belvisi  SVP and Head of Research and Early Development  Respiratory and Immunology at AstraZeneca commented: ""IPF is a devastating disease with median survival of around 3 years and there is a serious need for better treatment options. At AstraZeneca  we are continuously striving to improve our R&D productivity in order to quickly bring potentially innovative treatments to complex diseases such as IPF. Our partnership with BenevolentAI furthers our commitment and we are proud to deliver a second novel target for IPF to our portfolio.""Story continuesDr Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer at BenevolentAI commented: ""Target identification is an essential first step in the drug discovery pipeline  and where we believe the Benevolent Platform™ can make the biggest impact. Our AI-enabled approach empowers scientists to explore all the available evidence to unravel the enormous complexity of biological systems and the underlying mechanisms of disease. By reaching this third milestone  we have further validated the ability of BenevolentAI's disease agnostic platform to identify novel targets and deliver tangible scientific results for complex and debilitating conditions such as IPF.""ABOUT BENEVOLENTAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading  clinical-stage AI-enabled drug discovery company listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.

We are preparing for the launch of our two Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trials which we plan to initiate as soon as possible. We look forward to sharing topline results from our Phase 2 DESTINY-1 study in NASH for PXL065 in the third quarter of 2022 ” said Thomas Kuhn  Chief Executive Officer of Poxel. “We continue to pursue various financing options to extend our cash runway  prioritizing non-dilutive sources. We remain focused on developing our clinical candidates and demonstrating their value in the field of metabolic diseases.”Commercial UpdateTWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)As of March 31  2022  royalty revenue to Poxel based on TWYMEEG net sales in Japan under the Sumitomo Pharma license agreement has been limited following TWYMEEG’s recent commercial launch on September 16  2021. TWYMEEG’s initial commercial uptake has been affected by restrictions in Japan on prescribing any new drug in its first year of commercialization  and conditions related to COVID-19  which have reduced the frequency of physician visits and limited the extensive prescriber education efforts required for any launch of an innovative drug with a new mechanism of action. However  as a result of Sumitomo Pharma's promotional activities and efforts since launch  TWYMEEG is very well known among prescribers.Clinical UpdatesNASHPXL065 (deuterium-stabilised R-pioglitazone) is in a Phase 2 study (DESTINY-1). Results from this 36-week  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  dose-ranging study designed to assess efficacy and safety are anticipated in Q3 2022. The goal of DESTINY-1 is to identify the optimal dose or doses of PXL065 to advance into a Phase 3 registration trial for the treatment of noncirrhotic biopsy-proven NASH patients.Rare metabolic diseasesIn ALD  Phase 2a biomarker proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trials of PXL065 and PXL770 are expected to initiate as soon as possible  subject to additional financing. Two identical studies will enroll adult male patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  the most common ALD subtype. The POC studies will evaluate the pharmacokinetics  safety and efficacy of PXL065 and PXL770 after 12 weeks of treatment based on relevant disease biomarkers  such as the effect on very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)  the characteristic plasma marker of the disease.In February and April  the FDA awarded Fast Track Designation (FTD) to PXL065 and PXL770 respectively  for ALD. The FDA grants FTD to investigational drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition  and which fill an unmet medical need. Filling an unmet medical need is defined as providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available therapy. The key benefits of FTD comprise enhanced access to the FDA  with regular and more frequent opportunities for consultation and discussion.Significant Events after the PeriodDuring the 2nd quarter  the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to PXL065 and PXL770 for ALD. ODD confers a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received.First Quarter 2022 Financial UpdateAs of March 31  2022  cash and cash equivalents were EUR 24.0 million (USD 26.7 million)  as compared to EUR 32.3 million (USD 36.6 million) as of December 31  2021.

However  the Company is subject to certain financial covenants1 related to its debt with IPF Partners which could be potentially breached in Q3 2022.The Company is actively pursuing various financing options  which include dilutive and non-dilutive sources  as well as discussions with IPF partners.First Quarter 2022 RevenuePoxel reported EUR 32 thousand revenue for the quarter ended March 31  2022  as compared to no revenue during the corresponding period in 2021.Revenue for the first quarter of 2022 reflects JPY 4.4 million (EUR 32 thousand) of royalty revenue from Sumitomo Pharma which represents 8% of TWYMEEG net sales in Japan. Based on the current forecast  Poxel expects to receive 8% royalties on TWYMEEG net sales in Japan through the Sumitomo Pharma fiscal year 2022 (April 2022 to March 2023). As part of the Merck Serono licensing agreement  Poxel will pay Merck Serono a fixed 8% royalty based on the net sales of Imeglimin  independent of the level of sales.EUR (in thousands) Q1 Q1 2022 2021 3 months 3 months Sumitomo Pharma Agreement 32 - Other - - Total revenues 32 - Unaudited dataPlanned Presentations and Participation at the Following Upcoming EventsEuropean Renal Association  May 25-285 th Global NASH Congress  May 26-27Global NASH Congress  May 26-27 Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference  June 8-10JMP Securities 2022 Life Sciences Conference  June 15-16Next Financial Press Release : Second Quarter 2022 Financial Update on August 30  2022.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders.

PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-stereoisomer of pioglitazone. PXL770 is a novel  first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator. Both compounds are preparing to enter into Phase 2a clinical Proof-of-Concept (POC) biomarker studies as soon as possible  subject to financing.Poxel CEO  Thomas Kuhn  commented: “The award of Orphan Drug Designation to both PXL065 and PXL770 by the FDA is an additional regulatory milestone for the development of these potential medicines in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy  for which there is currently no approved therapy. This status could give either molecule a seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  and  along with its recent Fast Track Designation  gives us confidence in the strategic shift into rare diseases we initiated last year. We remain excited to pursue treatments for ALD as this represents an area with very high unmet medical need. We look forward to the next steps as we are preparing for the initiation of our Phase 2a clinical studies as soon as possible. To enable this effort  we continue to pursue various financing options that will also extend our cash runway  prioritizing non-dilutive sources.”Orphan Drug Designation (ODD)ODD is granted by the FDA to novel therapeutics for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200 000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation1 gives a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received.About ALDX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an orphan neurometabolic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which encodes for a key protein that is required for metabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) by peroxisomes (cellular organelles). ALD is the most common leukodystrophy with a prevalence similar to hemophilia – up to 1/10 000 individuals in the general population have ALD [https://rarediseases.org]. Forms of this disease include cerebral ALD (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) which is the most common form – typically occurring in adolescence through adulthood. AMN is characterized by chronic and progressive distal axonopathy involving the long tracts of the spinal cord and to a lesser extent the peripheral nerves resulting in progressive stiffness and weakness in the legs  impaired gait and balance  incontinence  and loss of sensation. Nearly all men with a diagnosis of ALD will develop AMN  and many women also present with features of AMN with a later onset. C-ALD is characterized by inflammatory demyelination of cells in the brain and typically afflicts children  but many men with AMN may also develop cerebral disease; these white matter brain lesions lead to severe neurologic deficits and death. There are no approved medicines for ALD (other than glucocorticoid supplements for associated adrenal insufficiency). C-ALD when first detected in early childhood  can be treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HSCT is currently limited to early stage of C-ALD and this procedure is at risk of severe adverse reactions.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. Poxel has clinical and earlier-stage programs from its adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator and deuterated TZD platforms targeting chronic and rare metabolic diseases. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) is in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). PXL770  a first-in-class direct AMPK activator  has successfully completed a Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of NASH  which met its objectives. For the rare inherited metabolic disorder  adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)  the company intends to initiate Phase 2a proof of concept studies with PXL065 and PXL770 in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). TWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)  Poxel’s first-in-class lead product that targets mitochondrial dysfunction  has been approved and launched for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan. Poxel expects to receive royalties and sales-based payments from Sumitomo Pharma.

The impact of the crisis on business and vendor support is limited.The Group is closely monitoring further developments and will continuously adapt its risk assessment to the current situation.Core Data Centre migration updateEuronext announced in April 2021 the strategic decision to migrate its Core Data Centre from Basildon  in the United Kingdom  to Bergamo  in Italy.The migration is a response to multiple factors  including the dynamic created by Brexit and a strong rationale to locate the Group’s Core Data Centre in a European Union country where Euronext operates a large business. This transformative move  managed in collaboration with clients  marks a milestone in bringing back to the European Union the data centre that handles 25% of European trading volumes.This migration will allow Euronext to fully control and directly manage its core IT infrastructure  and provide clients with a key service that was previously outsourced. This will also allow the generation of colocation revenues  embedded in the upgraded synergies. Clients will benefit from a state-of-the-art colocation facility  and since this data centre is 100% powered by renewable energy sources  clients will see their own carbon footprints reduced. The date targeted for the first part of the Group Core Data Centre migration  as announced in November 2021  is 6 June 2022. The Core Data Centre migration has been timed in order to pave the way for the migration of the Borsa Italiana equity and derivatives markets onto Euronext Optiq® trading technology by mid-2023.Euronext has successfully finalised the build phase of the Core Data Centre  which focused on setting up the production infrastructure (servers and networks) and the colocation room (client racks). Client connectivity has been implemented and is now operational. Optiq®  Euronext’s proprietary state-of-the-art technology  has also been successfully installed in Bergamo. The colocation and connectivity offerings have been designed and shared with clients. Euronext has rolled-out the client installation (equipment shipping  installation  and testing)  which is almost finalised. The first successful tests connecting clients to the production environment in Bergamo confirmed the readiness for the upcoming migration in June 2022.Progress on the pillars of Euronext’s ESG commitmentEuronext has advanced its “Fit for 1.5°” climate commitment with the launch of the OBX® ESG index in Norway and the AEX® ESG index in the Netherlands in May 2022  joining Euronext’s growing franchise of national blue-chip ESG indices. Beyond blue-chip ESG indices  Euronext has introduced a number of products tailored towards evolving business challenges  such as the Euronext French Employment 40 EW Index. The relevance of Euronext’s ESG index franchise has been recognised by Finance for Tomorrow  which identified Euronext as a leading contributor to the protection of biodiversity15 thanks to its biodiversity index solutions  such as the Euronext ESG Biodiversity Screened World Index.In the first quarter of 2022  Euronext welcomed four new sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) to its markets. L’Oréal  Carrefour  Sanofi and Pernod Ricard listed SLBs on Euronext Paris  which link coupon payments to the achievement of sustainability objectives.As part of its ESG commitment  Euronext recognises the impact it can have on its partners and society at large. Euronext has therefore become a founding member of Sustainable Trading  a non-profit membership network that aims to drive the ESG transition across financial markets. Furthermore  Euronext published the “Euronext Guide for ESG reporting - Target 1.5°C”. This guide aims to help companies engage in climate change mitigation policies with the support of their investors.Euronext has also joined forces with Climate Fresk to train its employees through climate workshops aimed at developing awareness and the ability to act at individual and company level. Euronext has already trained 200 employees across all European locations and is now rolling out the second phase of the project with the ambition to train 30% of its staff by the end of June 2022.With the planned migration to its new Core Data Centre powered by renewable energy  much of which is self-produced  on 6 June 2022  Euronext expects to reach the next significant milestone of its ESG commitment in Q2 2022. Euronext will disclose its SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative) targets in June 2022.Strategic partnership agreement between Euronext Securities and Spafid on issuer servicesOn 3 March 2022  Euronext Securities Milan and Spafid announced the agreement of a strategic partnership whereby Euronext Securities Milan will acquire the General Meetings  Designated Representative  and Shareholder’s Register activities of Spafid  and Euronext Securities Milan and Spafid will establish a closer cooperation aimed at mutually supporting the development of their respective core businesses16.The acquisition is an important step to further develop local added-value services to issuers  and to deliver on Euronext Securities’ ambition to converge issuers services across all its locations (Denmark  Norway  Portugal and Italy).Euronext Securities is already providing similar services in Denmark and Norway  and this acquisition marks an important milestone of the Euronext ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan  to pan-Europeanise and scale up Euronext Securities  and specifically to expand added-value services for financial institutions and issuers across all its locations. In Italy  the integration of these activities into Euronext Securities Milan allows clients to benefit from the comprehensive and end-to-end management of the entire shareholder process.Disposal of Euronext Funds360On 30 March 2022  Euronext completed the sale of Euronext Funds360 to FE fundinfo  a global provider of data and tools management for the funds industry.

Consequently  costs previously reported as exceptional items will from Q1 2022 be included into their respective lines within Euronext operating expenses as non-recurring items.The €150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-recurring items and will be withdrawn from Q1 2022 from underlying recurring costs.From Q1 2022  the computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share will be adjusted accordingly.

In Asia  market conditions normalized and conditions improved in Europe and the US during the quarter. However  it remains difficult to say how the pandemic will affect the coming quarters with any great certainty.SIGNIFICANT events AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODIn April  Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital placed an order for RayStation  thereby becoming RaySearch's first customer in Hong Kong within the proton therapy segment.In April  Seoul National University Hospital placed an order for RayStation.In April  Mevion China placed an order for RayStation  which it sold together with Mevion's proton therapy system to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan in China.In May  RaySearch entered into an agreement with GE Healthcare to develop a new radiation therapy simulation and treatment planning workflow solution.In May  RayCare was taken into clinical use with Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system at Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland.CFO Torbjörn Wingårdh left RaySearchStory continuesfinancial SUMMARY1AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s JAN-MAR APR 2021- FULL-YEAR2022 2021 MAR 2022 2021 Net sales 208 149 162 102 687 720 641 673 Operating profit/loss 29 564 12 261 -36 038 -53 341 Operating margin  % 14.2 7.6 -5.2 -8.3 Profit/loss for the period 19 298 7 110 -35 127 -47 315 Earnings/loss per share before/after dilution  SEK 0.56 0.21 -1.02 -1.38 Cash flow from operating activities 125 787 104 332 259 617 238 162 Cash flow for the period 35 320 32 840 -69 223 -71 703 Return on equity  % 2.9 1.0 -5.3 -7.3 Equity/assets ratio  %  at the end of the period 38.9 52.7 38.9 37.3 Share price at the end of the period  SEK 51.7 89.5 51.7 56.51 For definitions of key ratios  see page 20.HIGHEST EVER FIRST QUARTER SALESThe pandemic had a negative impact on our sales  but we could see clear signs of a recovery already in the fourth quarter of 2021 and are delighted to note that this positive trend has continued. During the year's first quarter  we witnessed an increase in order intake of 88 percent compared with the year-on-year period and RaySearch's sales were at the highest ever level for a first quarter  SEK 208 M. In addition  EBIT totaled SEK 30 M  representing an operating margin of 14 percent. We also had more opportunities to meet customers face-to-face as travel restrictions were lifted in many countries. The positive signals are in line with our expectations and I am optimistic about a stabilization in market conditions and a return to normal circumstances  even though the pandemic is not yet completely behind us.A few days ago  we returned from one of our industry's main trade fairs  ESTRO  which was a highly positive experience. There was a palpable energy among the many visitors to our booth and great interest in our products  with many demonstrations and a large number of fruitful partnership discussions.NEW ORDERS STRENGTHEN LEADING POSITION IN PROTON MARKETTreatment planning for particle treatments (protons/carbon ions/BNCT) is an important focus area for RaySearch and today RayStation has a global market share of more than 60 percent. This position was also strengthened by several important orders  including from Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital  Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) and Proton International Arkansas. Another important order  though not in proton therapy  was from Charles-Le Moyne in Canada. The hospital's cancer clinic has used RayStation since 2018 and has now ordered additional licenses as well as upgrades to the system.We have seen a sharp increase in interest for RayCare. In addition to that fact that RayCare is seen as a next generation oncology information system  this was mainly driven by three factors. The first is the positive feedback provided by reference customers  such as Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland and UZ Leuven in Belgium. Furthermore  we can see that RaySearch's strong offering in proton therapy – which has given us a market-leading position – means new  potential proton customers look upon RayCare as an attractive alternative. Lastly  we expect to see increased interest when it becomes possible to connect RayCare to Varian's TrueBeam later in the year. We believe most interest in acquiring RayCare will be shown by centers with treatment machines from several different manufacturers.RAYCOMMAND IN CLINICAL USEAn important milestone was reached in April when RaySearch's latest product  RayCommand  was taken into clinical use for the first time  which occurred at MedAustron in Austria. MedAustron has used RayStation for some time to plan carbon ion therapy  which is the most advanced form of radiation therapy. RaySearch and MedAustron have had a unique and close cooperation for several years in the development of RayCommand and it is very gratifying to see how this has now resulted in a new and innovative product. Earlier this spring  MedAustron also took RayCare into clinical use and therefore became the first center in the world to use the three systems – RayStation  RayCare and RayCommand – together to treat patients. The RayCommand treatment delivery system serves as a link between the treatment machine  RayStation and RayCare and also coordinates and orchestrates the other systems at the center  such as imaging systems  beam delivery systems and the patient positioning systems.Another key milestone after the end of the quarter was that Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland treated its first patient using Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system together with RayStation and RayCare. In addition to these two extraordinary events  product development is progressing according to plan for all products and RayStation and RayCare are both in the final phase ahead of their half-year launches in June.WELL POSITIONED FOR GROWTHThe cost-saving program initiated in autumn 2021 is continuing and we can see a clear reduction in costs for travel and events as well as a slight decrease in personnel costs as a result of the continued recruitment freeze. Given all of the positive signals from the market  I am optimistic about the future. Concurrently  I am retaining a realistic view of business  well aware of the fact that we have yet to fully leave the pandemic behind us. We will therefore continue along the route we have set  focusing on sales  product development and cost control. With this strategy  combined with improving market conditions  a quarter with strong figures and an order backlog that once again achieved a new peak (SEK 1 489 M)  we have an solid foundation for a return to growth during the year.Stockholm  May 18  2022Johan LöfCEO and founderFinancial informationRaySearch operates in a market with uneven order flows where large individual orders can have a substantial impact on revenue recognition between the quarters and  because the company has limited (less than 10 percent) variable costs for license revenue  operating profit is affected by an amount that is nearly as high. For this reason  a longer perspective than a few quarters should be taken.order intake and order backlogIn the first quarter of 2022  order intake rose 87.8 percent year-on-year to SEK 272.5 M (145.1). License order intake increased 68.5 percent to SEK 131.4 M (78.0) while order intake for support increased 128.8 percent to SEK 111.2 M (48.6).Order intake (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Licenses 131.4 170.9 46.2 55.6 78.0404.1 350.7 Hardware 24.1 35.7 7.9 9.3 12.177.0 65.0 Support (incl. warranty support) 111.2 130.7 69.1 116.6 48.6427.6 365.0 Training and other 5.8 7.7 4.7 8.2 6.526.4 27.1 Total order intake 272.5 345.0 127.9 189.8 145.1935.1 807.8Order backlog (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Licenses 184.1 176.6 105.3 115.0 129.6Hardware 74.2 66.2 38.4 36.9 48.5Support (incl. warranty support) 1 159.9 1 053.3 1 009.2 1 001.7 974.2Training and other 70.5 66.8 59.5 59.9 54.8Total order backlog at the end of the period 1 488.7 1 362.9 1 212.4 1 213.4 1 207.1At March 31  2022  the total order backlog was SEK 1 488.7 M (1 207.1)  which is expected to generate revenue of approximately SEK 422 M over the next 12 months. The remaining amount in the order backlog mainly pertains to support obligations  which are primarily expected to generate revenue over a subsequent four-year period.RevenueIn the first quarter of 2022  net sales rose 28.4 percent year-on-year to SEK 208.1 M (162.1). The change was attributable to higher license sales  which rose 35.2 percent to SEK 111.7 M (82.6). The increase in net sales at unchanged currencies was 15.9 percent (-14.2).Support revenue rose 23.8 percent to SEK 76.6 M (61.9)  accounting for 36.8 percent (38.2) of net sales during the first quarter. Hardware sales  which have a limited profit margin  rose 7.8 percent to SEK 16.6 M (15.4). Excluding hardware  sales rose 30.6 percent year-on-year.Revenue (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 License revenue 111.7 105.5 55.7 63.4 82.6336.2 307.1 Hardware revenue 16.6 9.2 7.1 19.8 15.452.7 51.5 Support revenue 76.6 71.8 67.3 67.5 61.9283.2 268.5 Training and other revenue 3.2 2.1 6.4 3.9 2.115.6 14.5 Net sales 208.1 188.6 136.4 154.6 162.1687.7 641.7 Change in sales  corresp. period  % 28.4 17.6 14.5 -5.6 -22.413.7 -1.6 Change in organic sales  corresp. period  % 15.9 22.0 11.9 4.5 -14.213.2 1.6In the first quarter of 2022  net sales had the following geographic distribution: North America  39 percent (36); Asia  29 percent (26); Europe and the rest of the world  32 percent (38).Operating profitIn the first quarter of 2022  operating profit totaled SEK 29.6 M (12.3)  representing an operating margin of 14.2 percent (7.6). The earnings improvement was largely attributable to higher license revenue.In the first quarter  operating expenses increased 19.2 percent to SEK 178.6 M (149.8). The change was largely due to increased administrative costs.In the first quarter  the net of exchange gains and losses amounted to SEK 4.9 M (10.0) since a large proportion of the Group's receivables are denominated in USD and EUR  which strengthened against the SEK in the first quarter compared with the end of the fourth quarter. Adjusted for these currency translation effects  operating profit would have totaled SEK 24.7 M (2.3) in the first quarter and operating expenses would have increased 14.8 percent (-11.1).Currency effectsConsolidated sales and earnings are impacted by USD/EUR to SEK exchange rates  since most sales are invoiced in USD and EUR  while most costs are denominated in SEK.At unchanged exchange rates  the change in sales was 15.9 percent in the first quarter of 2022  compared with the year-earlier period. In addition  the Group's exchange gains on balance sheet items amounted to SEK 4.4 M (10.0) in the first quarter. Currency effects therefore had a positive impact on net sales and operating profit in the first quarter 2022.A sensitivity analysis of the Group's currency exposure shows that a 1-percentage point change in the USD exchange rate against the SEK would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 2.6 M in the first quarter of 2022  while a corresponding change in the EUR exchange rate would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 1.4 M.The Group follows the financial policy established by the Board  whereby exchange-rate fluctuations are not hedged.Capitalization of development costsRaySearch is a research and development-oriented company that makes significant investments in the development of software solutions for improved cancer treatment. At March 31  2022  some 199 employees (210) were engaged in research and development  corresponding to 50 percent (51) of the total number of employees.Capitalization of development costs Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Research and development costs 64.3 79.1 57.9 68.0 64.9269.4 270.0 Capitalization of development costs -52.4 -59.3 -40.0 -52.5 -51.5-204.1 -203.3 Amortization of capitalized development costs 45.0 44.1 43.2 40.1 39.2172.5 166.7 Research and development costs 57.0 63.9 61.2 55.7 52.6237.8 233.4In 2022  RaySearch continued to invest in both existing products and future products. Overall  research and development costs decreased 1 percent to SEK 64.3 M (64.9) in the first quarter of 2022  corresponding to 31 percent (40) of the Group's net sales.Development costs of SEK 52.4 M (51.5) were capitalized  up 1.7 percent  corresponding to 81 percent (79) of total research and development costs.Amortization of capitalized development costs rose 14.7 percent to SEK 45.0 M (39.2)  and the increase was attributable to an expansion of development activities  and that amortization periods had commenced for all products  including RayCommand and RayIntelligence.Research and development costs (after adjustments for capitalization and amortization of development costs) rose 8.2 percent to SEK 57.0 M (52.6).Amortization and depreciationIn the first quarter of 2022  total amortization and depreciation rose 19.8 percent to SEK 70.0 M (58.3)  of which amortization of intangible fixed assets accounted for SEK 45.0 M (39.3)  mainly related to capitalized development costs. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 25.0 M (19.1).profit and earnings per shareIn the first quarter of 2022  profit after tax was SEK 19.3 M (7.1)  corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 0.56 (0.21) before and after dilution.Tax expense for the quarter was SEK -6.9 M (-4.3)  corresponding to an effective tax rate of 26.2 percent (37.5).Cash flow and liquidityIn the first quarter of 2022  cash flow from operating activities was SEK 125.8 M (104.3) and the change was largely attributable to a decrease in working capital  which mainly comprises various types of receivables from customers  such as accounts receivable and current and long-term unbilled customer receivables where payment plans have been drawn up.At the end of the period  the company's total customer receivables amounted to 46 percent (56) of net sales over the past 12 months.Working capital amounted to 2 percent (5) of net sales over the past 12 months.In the first quarter  cash flow from investing activities was SEK -60.6 M (-60.3). Investments in intangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -52.4 M (-51.5) and consisted of capitalized development costs for the company's products – RayStation  RayCare  RayCommand and RayIntelligence. Investments in tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -8.2 M (-8.8)  mainly related to investments in the head office in Stockholm.Cash flow from financing activities was SEK -29.9 M (-11.2) for the first quarter of 2022. The change was largely due to a bank overdraft of SEK 21 M drawn in the first quarter.Cash flow for the first quarter amounted to SEK 35.3 M (32.8). At March 31  2022  consolidated cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 139.8 M (205.2).Financial positionAt March 31  2022  RaySearch's total assets amounted to SEK 1 722 M (1 334) and the equity/assets ratio was 38.9 percent (52.7). The change in total assets and the equity/assets ratio was largely attributable to an increase in right-of-use assets related to rented premises following the granting of access to the new head office premises.Current receivables amounted to SEK 376.7 M (414.3). The receivables mainly comprise various types of customer receivables.RaySearch's credit facility comprises a revolving loan facility of up to SEK 150 M that matures in March 2025 and an overdraft facility of SEK 50 M the matures in December 2022. Chattel mortgages amounted to SEK 100 M. At March 31  2022  a short-term loan of SEK 0 M (50) was raised under the company's revolving loan facility and SEK 0 M (0) of the credit facility had been drawn.At March 31  2022  the Group's net debt amounted to SEK 397.0 M (-66.0). The change was largely due to an increase in lease liabilities following the granting of access to the new head office premises during the fourth quarter.EMPLOYEESAt the end of the first quarter  the Group had 389 (413) employees  of whom 284 (310) were based in Sweden  and 105 (102) in foreign subsidiaries.PARENT COMPANYRaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is the Parent Company of the RaySearch Group. Since the Parent Company's operations are consistent with the Group's operations in all material respects  the comments for the Group are also largely relevant for the Parent Company.Differences in profitability between the Parent Company and the Group are attributable to the Parent Company accounting for a relatively high proportion of operating expenses  and to the capitalization of development costs being recognized in the Group but not in the Parent Company. The Parent Company was also not affected by the changes pertaining to lease recognition under IFRS 16  and instead continues to recognize lease payments as operating lease payments. This reduces operating profit compared with if IFRS 16 had been applied.The Parent Company's current receivables mainly comprise receivables from Group companies and external customers.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTERAgreement signed with Proton International ArkansasIn January  RaySearch signed an agreement with Proton International Arkansas to provide RayStation at the UAMS Radiation Oncology Center. The center will open in 2023 and be the first proton center in the state of Arkansas. The center at UAMS brings RaySearch's presence in proton therapy to thirty centers in the United States  a large majority of operating facilities.Agreement with Charles-Le Moyne in CanadaIn February  Montérégie Integrated Cancer Center (CICM)  which is part of the Charles-Le Moyne hospital in Longueuil in Quebec in Canada  placed an order for additional RayStation licenses as well as upgrades to the system which includes advanced treatment planning functionality.SIGNIFICANT events AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODAgreement with Hong Kong Sanatorium & HospitalIn April  Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital placed an order for RayStation as treatment planning system for its proton therapy center. The hospital thereby became RaySearch's first customer in Hong Kong within the proton therapy segment.Agreement with Seoul National University HospitalIn April  Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) placed an order for RayStation. SNUH is the second carbon ion center in Korea to select RaySearch  the first customer was Yonsei Cancer Center in Seoul.Agreement with Mevion ChinaIn April  Mevion China placed an order for RayStation  which it sold together with Mevion's proton therapy system to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan in China. RaySearch and Mevion have been collaborating since 2014. Treatment planning for particle treatments (protons/carbon ions/BNCT) is an important focus area for RaySearch and today RayStation has a global market share of more than 60 percent  a position that is further strengthened by the new order.Agreement with GE HealthcareIn May  RaySearch entered into an agreement with GE Healthcare to develop a new radiation therapy simulation and treatment planning workflow solution designed to make use of the latest advancements in treatment planning technology. The companies aim to combine RaySearch's advanced treatment planning system RayStation with GE Healthcare's leading multi-modality (CT/MR/molecular imaging) simulator systems to make cancer treatment faster and more precise.RayCare taken into clinical use with CyberKnife at Swiss Medical Network in SwitzerlandIn May  RayCare was taken into clinical use with Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system at La Clinique Générale-Beaulieu  a part of Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland. The center became first in the world to treat a patient using RayCare and CyberKnife.Management changeTorbjörn Wingårdh stepped down as CFO of RaySearch on April 4  2022.Effects of the COVID-19 pandemicEven though the pandemic is over in most countries  the effects of it remain a challenge for many operations. RaySearch is monitoring the situation closely and is prepared to take new action and align the company's operations if needed.Effects on RaySearch's operations in the first quarter of 2022Sales. The negative effect of the pandemic on RaySearch's sales appears to be weakening as the pandemic subsides. In Asia  market conditions normalized and conditions improved in Europe and the US during the quarter.Delivery capacity. As a software company  RaySearch is well equipped for remote collaboration and both our R&D and delivery capacity have remained relatively unscathed by the COVID-19 pandemic to date.In the first quarter  COVID-19 did not have any major impact on the company's assessment items.Expected future effectsIt is still difficult to say how the ongoing pandemic will affect the coming quarters with any great certainty. The situation has normalized in most countries  though a few countries have registered rising case numbers.The company believes the underlying need and demand for effective software solutions for cancer care is in the process of returning to pre-pandemic levels. Since sales activities have been restricted for some time  however  it may take time before the full sales effect is regained. We see no major challenges in terms of R&D or the company's delivery capacity. The company will continue to focus on protecting the company's cash flow and liquidity.Increased focus on efficiencies and digitization. One effect of the COVID-19 pandemic could be a further acceleration of the ongoing digital transformation. The pandemic has drastically highlighted the major potential and benefits of digital technology  which could be positive for RaySearch's operations in the long term because the company's software solutions enable cancer clinics to improve their efficiency.The company's shareAt March 31  2022  the total number of registered shares in RaySearch was 34 282 773  of which 8 454 975 were Class A and 25 827 798 Class B shares.

RaySearch's risk management aims to identify  measure and reduce risks related to the Group's transactions and operations. For more information about risks and risk management  refer to pages 39-41 of RaySearch's 2021 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes with any impact on the risks reported. This also applies to the risks and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that could affect RaySearch's sales  earnings and financial position.Seasonal variationsRaySearch's customers are healthcare providers and the company's operations are somewhat characterized by seasonal variations that are typical for the industry  whereby the fourth quarter is normally the strongest – mainly because many customers have budgets that follow the calendar year.Environment and sustainabilitySustainability is a key aspect of RaySearch's strategy and operations  and the company is working actively to become a sustainable enterprise. The primary aim of RaySearch's operations is to help cancer clinics improve and save the lives of cancer patients. Through innovative software solutions  the company is continuously striving to improve and streamline workflows in clinical environments and to improve treatment outcomes for cancer patients. The customer value created presents business opportunities for RaySearch  but also major social benefit and economic gains.The negative environmental impact of the company's products is limited. The company's environmental impact is mainly related to the purchase of goods and services  energy use and transportation. RaySearch aims to contribute to sustainable development and therefore works actively to improve the company's environmental performance wherever this is economically viable.

During the year's first quarter  we witnessed an increase in order intake of 88 percent compared with the year-on-year period and RaySearch's sales were at the highest ever level for a first quarter  SEK 208 M. In addition  EBIT totaled SEK 30 M  representing an operating margin of 14 percent. We also had more opportunities to meet customers face-to-face as travel restrictions were lifted in many countries. The positive signals are in line with our expectations and I am optimistic about a stabilization in market conditions and a return to normal circumstances  even though the pandemic is not yet completely behind us.A few days ago  we returned from one of our industry's main trade fairs  ESTRO  which was a highly positive experience. There was a palpable energy among the many visitors to our booth and great interest in our products  with many demonstrations and a large number of fruitful partnership discussions.NEW ORDERS STRENGTHEN LEADING POSITION IN PROTON MARKETTreatment planning for particle treatments (protons/carbon ions/BNCT) is an important focus area for RaySearch and today RayStation has a global market share of more than 60 percent. This position was also strengthened by several important orders  including from Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital  Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) and Proton International Arkansas. Another important order  though not in proton therapy  was from Charles-Le Moyne in Canada. The hospital's cancer clinic has used RayStation since 2018 and has now ordered additional licenses as well as upgrades to the system.We have seen a sharp increase in interest for RayCare. In addition to that fact that RayCare is seen as a next generation oncology information system  this was mainly driven by three factors. The first is the positive feedback provided by reference customers  such as Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland and UZ Leuven in Belgium. Furthermore  we can see that RaySearch's strong offering in proton therapy – which has given us a market-leading position – means new  potential proton customers look upon RayCare as an attractive alternative. Lastly  we expect to see increased interest when it becomes possible to connect RayCare to Varian's TrueBeam later in the year. We believe most interest in acquiring RayCare will be shown by centers with treatment machines from several different manufacturers.RAYCOMMAND IN CLINICAL USEAn important milestone was reached in April when RaySearch's latest product  RayCommand  was taken into clinical use for the first time  which occurred at MedAustron in Austria. MedAustron has used RayStation for some time to plan carbon ion therapy  which is the most advanced form of radiation therapy. RaySearch and MedAustron have had a unique and close cooperation for several years in the development of RayCommand and it is very gratifying to see how this has now resulted in a new and innovative product. Earlier this spring  MedAustron also took RayCare into clinical use and therefore became the first center in the world to use the three systems – RayStation  RayCare and RayCommand – together to treat patients. The RayCommand treatment delivery system serves as a link between the treatment machine  RayStation and RayCare and also coordinates and orchestrates the other systems at the center  such as imaging systems  beam delivery systems and the patient positioning systems.Another key milestone after the end of the quarter was that Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland treated its first patient using Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system together with RayStation and RayCare. In addition to these two extraordinary events  product development is progressing according to plan for all products and RayStation and RayCare are both in the final phase ahead of their half-year launches in June.WELL POSITIONED FOR GROWTHThe cost-saving program initiated in autumn 2021 is continuing and we can see a clear reduction in costs for travel and events as well as a slight decrease in personnel costs as a result of the continued recruitment freeze. Given all of the positive signals from the market  I am optimistic about the future. Concurrently  I am retaining a realistic view of business  well aware of the fact that we have yet to fully leave the pandemic behind us. We will therefore continue along the route we have set  focusing on sales  product development and cost control. With this strategy  combined with improving market conditions  a quarter with strong figures and an order backlog that once again achieved a new peak (SEK 1 489 M)  we have an solid foundation for a return to growth during the year.Stockholm  May 18  2022Johan LöfCEO and founderFinancial informationRaySearch operates in a market with uneven order flows where large individual orders can have a substantial impact on revenue recognition between the quarters and  because the company has limited (less than 10 percent) variable costs for license revenue  operating profit is affected by an amount that is nearly as high. For this reason  a longer perspective than a few quarters should be taken.order intake and order backlogIn the first quarter of 2022  order intake rose 87.8 percent year-on-year to SEK 272.5 M (145.1). License order intake increased 68.5 percent to SEK 131.4 M (78.0) while order intake for support increased 128.8 percent to SEK 111.2 M (48.6).Order intake (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Licenses 131.4 170.9 46.2 55.6 78.0404.1 350.7 Hardware 24.1 35.7 7.9 9.3 12.177.0 65.0 Support (incl. warranty support) 111.2 130.7 69.1 116.6 48.6427.6 365.0 Training and other 5.8 7.7 4.7 8.2 6.526.4 27.1 Total order intake 272.5 345.0 127.9 189.8 145.1935.1 807.8Order backlog (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Licenses 184.1 176.6 105.3 115.0 129.6Hardware 74.2 66.2 38.4 36.9 48.5Support (incl. warranty support) 1 159.9 1 053.3 1 009.2 1 001.7 974.2Training and other 70.5 66.8 59.5 59.9 54.8Total order backlog at the end of the period 1 488.7 1 362.9 1 212.4 1 213.4 1 207.1At March 31  2022  the total order backlog was SEK 1 488.7 M (1 207.1)  which is expected to generate revenue of approximately SEK 422 M over the next 12 months. The remaining amount in the order backlog mainly pertains to support obligations  which are primarily expected to generate revenue over a subsequent four-year period.RevenueIn the first quarter of 2022  net sales rose 28.4 percent year-on-year to SEK 208.1 M (162.1). The change was attributable to higher license sales  which rose 35.2 percent to SEK 111.7 M (82.6). The increase in net sales at unchanged currencies was 15.9 percent (-14.2).Support revenue rose 23.8 percent to SEK 76.6 M (61.9)  accounting for 36.8 percent (38.2) of net sales during the first quarter. Hardware sales  which have a limited profit margin  rose 7.8 percent to SEK 16.6 M (15.4). Excluding hardware  sales rose 30.6 percent year-on-year.Revenue (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 License revenue 111.7 105.5 55.7 63.4 82.6336.2 307.1 Hardware revenue 16.6 9.2 7.1 19.8 15.452.7 51.5 Support revenue 76.6 71.8 67.3 67.5 61.9283.2 268.5 Training and other revenue 3.2 2.1 6.4 3.9 2.115.6 14.5 Net sales 208.1 188.6 136.4 154.6 162.1687.7 641.7 Change in sales  corresp. period  % 28.4 17.6 14.5 -5.6 -22.413.7 -1.6 Change in organic sales  corresp. period  % 15.9 22.0 11.9 4.5 -14.213.2 1.6In the first quarter of 2022  net sales had the following geographic distribution: North America  39 percent (36); Asia  29 percent (26); Europe and the rest of the world  32 percent (38).Operating profitIn the first quarter of 2022  operating profit totaled SEK 29.6 M (12.3)  representing an operating margin of 14.2 percent (7.6). The earnings improvement was largely attributable to higher license revenue.In the first quarter  operating expenses increased 19.2 percent to SEK 178.6 M (149.8). The change was largely due to increased administrative costs.In the first quarter  the net of exchange gains and losses amounted to SEK 4.9 M (10.0) since a large proportion of the Group's receivables are denominated in USD and EUR  which strengthened against the SEK in the first quarter compared with the end of the fourth quarter. Adjusted for these currency translation effects  operating profit would have totaled SEK 24.7 M (2.3) in the first quarter and operating expenses would have increased 14.8 percent (-11.1).Currency effectsConsolidated sales and earnings are impacted by USD/EUR to SEK exchange rates  since most sales are invoiced in USD and EUR  while most costs are denominated in SEK.At unchanged exchange rates  the change in sales was 15.9 percent in the first quarter of 2022  compared with the year-earlier period. In addition  the Group's exchange gains on balance sheet items amounted to SEK 4.4 M (10.0) in the first quarter. Currency effects therefore had a positive impact on net sales and operating profit in the first quarter 2022.A sensitivity analysis of the Group's currency exposure shows that a 1-percentage point change in the USD exchange rate against the SEK would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 2.6 M in the first quarter of 2022  while a corresponding change in the EUR exchange rate would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 1.4 M.The Group follows the financial policy established by the Board  whereby exchange-rate fluctuations are not hedged.Capitalization of development costsRaySearch is a research and development-oriented company that makes significant investments in the development of software solutions for improved cancer treatment. At March 31  2022  some 199 employees (210) were engaged in research and development  corresponding to 50 percent (51) of the total number of employees.Capitalization of development costs Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Research and development costs 64.3 79.1 57.9 68.0 64.9269.4 270.0 Capitalization of development costs -52.4 -59.3 -40.0 -52.5 -51.5-204.1 -203.3 Amortization of capitalized development costs 45.0 44.1 43.2 40.1 39.2172.5 166.7 Research and development costs 57.0 63.9 61.2 55.7 52.6237.8 233.4In 2022  RaySearch continued to invest in both existing products and future products. Overall  research and development costs decreased 1 percent to SEK 64.3 M (64.9) in the first quarter of 2022  corresponding to 31 percent (40) of the Group's net sales.Development costs of SEK 52.4 M (51.5) were capitalized  up 1.7 percent  corresponding to 81 percent (79) of total research and development costs.Amortization of capitalized development costs rose 14.7 percent to SEK 45.0 M (39.2)  and the increase was attributable to an expansion of development activities  and that amortization periods had commenced for all products  including RayCommand and RayIntelligence.Research and development costs (after adjustments for capitalization and amortization of development costs) rose 8.2 percent to SEK 57.0 M (52.6).Amortization and depreciationIn the first quarter of 2022  total amortization and depreciation rose 19.8 percent to SEK 70.0 M (58.3)  of which amortization of intangible fixed assets accounted for SEK 45.0 M (39.3)  mainly related to capitalized development costs. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 25.0 M (19.1).profit and earnings per shareIn the first quarter of 2022  profit after tax was SEK 19.3 M (7.1)  corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 0.56 (0.21) before and after dilution.Tax expense for the quarter was SEK -6.9 M (-4.3)  corresponding to an effective tax rate of 26.2 percent (37.5).Cash flow and liquidityIn the first quarter of 2022  cash flow from operating activities was SEK 125.8 M (104.3) and the change was largely attributable to a decrease in working capital  which mainly comprises various types of receivables from customers  such as accounts receivable and current and long-term unbilled customer receivables where payment plans have been drawn up.At the end of the period  the company's total customer receivables amounted to 46 percent (56) of net sales over the past 12 months.Working capital amounted to 2 percent (5) of net sales over the past 12 months.In the first quarter  cash flow from investing activities was SEK -60.6 M (-60.3). Investments in intangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -52.4 M (-51.5) and consisted of capitalized development costs for the company's products – RayStation  RayCare  RayCommand and RayIntelligence. Investments in tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -8.2 M (-8.8)  mainly related to investments in the head office in Stockholm.Cash flow from financing activities was SEK -29.9 M (-11.2) for the first quarter of 2022. The change was largely due to a bank overdraft of SEK 21 M drawn in the first quarter.Cash flow for the first quarter amounted to SEK 35.3 M (32.8). At March 31  2022  consolidated cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 139.8 M (205.2).Financial positionAt March 31  2022  RaySearch's total assets amounted to SEK 1 722 M (1 334) and the equity/assets ratio was 38.9 percent (52.7). The change in total assets and the equity/assets ratio was largely attributable to an increase in right-of-use assets related to rented premises following the granting of access to the new head office premises.Current receivables amounted to SEK 376.7 M (414.3). The receivables mainly comprise various types of customer receivables.RaySearch's credit facility comprises a revolving loan facility of up to SEK 150 M that matures in March 2025 and an overdraft facility of SEK 50 M the matures in December 2022. Chattel mortgages amounted to SEK 100 M. At March 31  2022  a short-term loan of SEK 0 M (50) was raised under the company's revolving loan facility and SEK 0 M (0) of the credit facility had been drawn.At March 31  2022  the Group's net debt amounted to SEK 397.0 M (-66.0). The change was largely due to an increase in lease liabilities following the granting of access to the new head office premises during the fourth quarter.EMPLOYEESAt the end of the first quarter  the Group had 389 (413) employees  of whom 284 (310) were based in Sweden  and 105 (102) in foreign subsidiaries.PARENT COMPANYRaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is the Parent Company of the RaySearch Group. Since the Parent Company's operations are consistent with the Group's operations in all material respects  the comments for the Group are also largely relevant for the Parent Company.Differences in profitability between the Parent Company and the Group are attributable to the Parent Company accounting for a relatively high proportion of operating expenses  and to the capitalization of development costs being recognized in the Group but not in the Parent Company. The Parent Company was also not affected by the changes pertaining to lease recognition under IFRS 16  and instead continues to recognize lease payments as operating lease payments. This reduces operating profit compared with if IFRS 16 had been applied.The Parent Company's current receivables mainly comprise receivables from Group companies and external customers.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTERAgreement signed with Proton International ArkansasIn January  RaySearch signed an agreement with Proton International Arkansas to provide RayStation at the UAMS Radiation Oncology Center. The center will open in 2023 and be the first proton center in the state of Arkansas. The center at UAMS brings RaySearch's presence in proton therapy to thirty centers in the United States  a large majority of operating facilities.Agreement with Charles-Le Moyne in CanadaIn February  Montérégie Integrated Cancer Center (CICM)  which is part of the Charles-Le Moyne hospital in Longueuil in Quebec in Canada  placed an order for additional RayStation licenses as well as upgrades to the system which includes advanced treatment planning functionality.SIGNIFICANT events AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODAgreement with Hong Kong Sanatorium & HospitalIn April  Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital placed an order for RayStation as treatment planning system for its proton therapy center. The hospital thereby became RaySearch's first customer in Hong Kong within the proton therapy segment.Agreement with Seoul National University HospitalIn April  Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) placed an order for RayStation. SNUH is the second carbon ion center in Korea to select RaySearch  the first customer was Yonsei Cancer Center in Seoul.Agreement with Mevion ChinaIn April  Mevion China placed an order for RayStation  which it sold together with Mevion's proton therapy system to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan in China. RaySearch and Mevion have been collaborating since 2014. Treatment planning for particle treatments (protons/carbon ions/BNCT) is an important focus area for RaySearch and today RayStation has a global market share of more than 60 percent  a position that is further strengthened by the new order.Agreement with GE HealthcareIn May  RaySearch entered into an agreement with GE Healthcare to develop a new radiation therapy simulation and treatment planning workflow solution designed to make use of the latest advancements in treatment planning technology. The companies aim to combine RaySearch's advanced treatment planning system RayStation with GE Healthcare's leading multi-modality (CT/MR/molecular imaging) simulator systems to make cancer treatment faster and more precise.RayCare taken into clinical use with CyberKnife at Swiss Medical Network in SwitzerlandIn May  RayCare was taken into clinical use with Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system at La Clinique Générale-Beaulieu  a part of Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland. The center became first in the world to treat a patient using RayCare and CyberKnife.Management changeTorbjörn Wingårdh stepped down as CFO of RaySearch on April 4  2022.Effects of the COVID-19 pandemicEven though the pandemic is over in most countries  the effects of it remain a challenge for many operations. RaySearch is monitoring the situation closely and is prepared to take new action and align the company's operations if needed.Effects on RaySearch's operations in the first quarter of 2022Sales. The negative effect of the pandemic on RaySearch's sales appears to be weakening as the pandemic subsides. In Asia  market conditions normalized and conditions improved in Europe and the US during the quarter.Delivery capacity. As a software company  RaySearch is well equipped for remote collaboration and both our R&D and delivery capacity have remained relatively unscathed by the COVID-19 pandemic to date.In the first quarter  COVID-19 did not have any major impact on the company's assessment items.Expected future effectsIt is still difficult to say how the ongoing pandemic will affect the coming quarters with any great certainty. The situation has normalized in most countries  though a few countries have registered rising case numbers.The company believes the underlying need and demand for effective software solutions for cancer care is in the process of returning to pre-pandemic levels. Since sales activities have been restricted for some time  however  it may take time before the full sales effect is regained. We see no major challenges in terms of R&D or the company's delivery capacity. The company will continue to focus on protecting the company's cash flow and liquidity.Increased focus on efficiencies and digitization. One effect of the COVID-19 pandemic could be a further acceleration of the ongoing digital transformation. The pandemic has drastically highlighted the major potential and benefits of digital technology  which could be positive for RaySearch's operations in the long term because the company's software solutions enable cancer clinics to improve their efficiency.The company's shareAt March 31  2022  the total number of registered shares in RaySearch was 34 282 773  of which 8 454 975 were Class A and 25 827 798 Class B shares.

RaySearch's risk management aims to identify  measure and reduce risks related to the Group's transactions and operations. For more information about risks and risk management  refer to pages 39-41 of RaySearch's 2021 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes with any impact on the risks reported. This also applies to the risks and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that could affect RaySearch's sales  earnings and financial position.Seasonal variationsRaySearch's customers are healthcare providers and the company's operations are somewhat characterized by seasonal variations that are typical for the industry  whereby the fourth quarter is normally the strongest – mainly because many customers have budgets that follow the calendar year.Environment and sustainabilitySustainability is a key aspect of RaySearch's strategy and operations  and the company is working actively to become a sustainable enterprise. The primary aim of RaySearch's operations is to help cancer clinics improve and save the lives of cancer patients. Through innovative software solutions  the company is continuously striving to improve and streamline workflows in clinical environments and to improve treatment outcomes for cancer patients.

The accounting policies applied are consistent with those described in the 2021 Annual Report for RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ)  which is available at www.raysearchlabs.com This interim report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act.RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is the Parent Company of the RaySearch Group. The Parent Company applies the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities. The Parent Company's operations are consistent with the Group's operations in all material respects.Differences in profitability between the Parent Company and the Group are attributable to the Parent Company accounting for a relatively high proportion of operating expenses  and to the capitalization of development costs being recognized in the Group but not in the Parent Company. The Parent Company was also not affected by IFRS 16  and will continue to recognize lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This reduces operating profit compared with if IFRS 16 had been applied.The Parent Company's current receivables mainly comprise receivables from Group companies and external customers.Note 2 Revenue from contracts with customersRaySearch conducts sales of goods and services in various regions. Revenue from sales of licenses and hardware is recognized in profit or loss at a point in time  while revenue from sales of training and support is recognized over time.AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s JAN-MAR2022 2021 ChangeAPR 2021-MAR 2022 Full-year 2021 Revenue by typeLicenses 111 711 82 605 35.2%336 244 307 138 Support 76 644 61 937 23.7%283 233 268 526 Hardware 16 597 15 428 7.6%52 665 51 496 Training and other 3 197 2 132 50.0%15 578 14 513 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4%687 720 641 673Revenue by geographic marketNorth America 79 993 58 688 36.3%245 646 224 341 APAC 61 037 41 718 46.3%192 866 173 547 Europe and rest of the world 67 119 61 696 8.8%249 208 243 785 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4%687 720 641 673Revenue by date for revenue recognitionGoods/services transferred at a point in time 128 308 98 033 30.9%388 909 358 634 Services transferred over time 79 841 64 069 24.6%298 811 283 039 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4%687 720 641 673NOTE 3 EstimatesPreparation of the interim report requires that company management make estimates that affect the carrying amounts. The actual outcome could deviate from these estimates. The critical sources of uncertainty in the estimates are the same as those in the most recent Annual Report.Note 4 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSRaySearch's financial assets and liabilities comprise billed and unbilled receivables  cash and cash equivalents  accrued expenses  accounts payable  bank loans and lease liabilities. Long-term receivables and lease liabilities are discounted  while other financial assets and liabilities have short maturities. Accordingly  the fair values of all financial instruments are deemed to correspond approximately to their carrying amounts.The provision for expected credit losses is a weighted assessment of payment history  reports from external credit rating agencies and other customer-specific information. At the end of March 2022  the credit loss provision amounted to SEK 40.0 M (26.7)  corresponding to 12 percent (8) of total customer receivables. The increased credit loss provision despite lower total receivables was mainly related to a customer in the US. The Group's credit losses have historically been limited and amounted to about 0.7 percent of the company's average customer receivables over the past five years.Note 5 Related-party transactionsThere were no transactions between RaySearch and related parties with any material impact on the company's position and earnings during the period.Note 6 Pledged assets in the Group and Parent CompanyAMOUNTS IN SEK 000sMar 31  2022 Mar 31  2021Dec 31  2021 Chattel mortgages100 000 100 000100 000 Guarantees31 314 14 81531 046The year-on-year increase was largely attributable to bank guarantees issued for the new office premises.group quarterly overview2022 2021 2020 AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Order intakeTotal order intake 272 442 345 028 127 853 189 750 145 131 239 125 138 480 177 133Income statementNet sales 208 149 188 573 136 419 154 579 162 102 159 835 119 130 163 758 Change in sales  % 28.4 18.0 14.5 -5.6 -22.4 -31.8 -17.5 -13.7 Operating profit/loss 29 564 -16 578 -26 561 -22 463 12 261 -14 592 -29 477 -10 954 Operating margin  % 14.2 -8.8 -19.5 -14.5 7.6 -9.1 -24.7 -6.7 Profit/loss for the period 19 298 -15 968 -21 990 -16 467 7 110 -14 164 -26 182 -9 196 Net margin  % 9.3 -8.5 -16.1 -10.7 4.4 -8.9 -22.0 -5.6Cash flowOperating activities 125 787 28 397 47 356 58 077 104 332 51 505 78 486 135 443 Investing activities -60 551 -60 944 -45 569 -70 843 -60 275 -64 094 -45 372 -55 913 Financing activities -29 916 12 482 -11 875 -61 624 -11 217 -8 909 -11 394 -13 618 Cash flow for the period 35 320 -20 065 -10 088 -74 390 32 840 -21 498 21 720 65 912Capital structureEquity/assets ratio  % 38.9 37.3 56.7 57.8 52.7 54.0 57.0 56.2 Net debt 397 045 459 742 -52 983 -50 385 -65 952 -22 439 -31 476 206 Debt/equity ratio 0.6 0.7 -0.1 -0.1 -0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Net debt/EBITDA 1.8 2.3 -0.3 -0.3 -0.4 -0.1 -0.1 0.0Per share data  SEKEarnings/loss per share before dilution 0.56 -0.47 -0.64 -0.48 0.21 -0.41 -0.76 -0.27 Earnings/loss per share after dilution 0.56 -0.47 -0.64 -0.48 0.21 -0.41 -0.76 -0.27 Equity per share 19.52 18.94 19.38 20.00 20.49 20.25 20.71 21.48 Share price at the end of the period 51.70 56.50 61.50 87.40 89.50 82.70 87.50 86.50OtherNo. of shares before/after dilution  000s 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 Average no. of employees 399 419 418 414 412 404 399 391Group  rolling 12 monthsAMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Apr 2021- Jan 2021- Oct 2020- Jul 2020- Apr 2020- Jan 2020- Oct 2019- Jul 2019- Mar 2022 Dec 2021 Sep 2021 Jun 2021 Mar 2021 Dec 2020 Sep 2020 Jun 2020 Order intakeTotal order intake 935 073 807 762 701 859 712 486 699 868 854 755 892 846 951 160 Income statementNet sales 687 720 641 673 612 935 595 646 604 825 651 612 726 276 751 495 Operating profit/loss -36 038 -53 341 -51 355 -54 271 -42 762 -3 466 33 594 56 726 Operating margin  % -5.2 -8.3 -8.4 -9.1 -7.1 -0.5 4.6 7.5 Cash flowCash flow -69 223 -72 380 -73 136 -41 328 98 972 61 890 91 165 55 970 Cash flow adjusted for repayment of bank loans -47 955 -22 380 -23 136 8 672 98 972 61 890 91 165 55 970definitions of key ratiosThe interim report refers to a number of non-IFRS financial measures that are used to provide investors and company management with additional information to assess the company's operations. The various non-IFRS measures used to complement the IFRS financial statements are described below.Non-IFRS measures Definition Reason for using the measure Order intake The value (transaction price) of all orders received and changes to existing orders during the current period Order intake is an indicator of future revenue and thus a key figure for the management of RaySearch's operations Order backlog The value of orders at the end of the period that the company has yet to deliver and recognize as revenue  meaning remaining performance obligations. The order backlog shows the value of orders already booked by RaySearch that will be converted to revenue in the future. Net sales/Order intake Recognized net sales in relation to total order intake during the corresponding period The measurement is used to monitor the recognized revenue in relation to sales  which is part of the reason for the change in order backlog. Change in sales The change in net sales compared with the year-earlier period expressed as a percentage The measure is used to track the performance of the company's operations between periods Change in sales at unchanged currencies Change in sales at unchanged exchange rates  i.e. excluding currency effects This measure is used to monitor underlying change in sales driven by alterations in volume  pricing and mix for comparable units between different periods Gross profit Net sales minus cost of goods sold Gross profit is used to measure the margin before sales  research  development and administrative expenses Operating profit/loss Calculated as profit for the period before financial items and tax Operating profit/loss provides an overall picture of the total generation of earnings in operating activities Operating profit adjusted for currency translation effects Calculated as operating profit less other operating income/expenses Operating profit provides an overall picture of the total generation of earnings in operating activities excluding currency translation effects for balance sheet items Operating margin Operating profit expressed as a percentage of net sales Together with sales growth  the operating margin is a key element for monitoring value creation Net margin Profit for the period as a percentage of net sales for the period The net margin shows the percentage of net sales remaining after the company's expenses have been deducted Cash flow adjusted for changes in bank loans Cash flow for the period less cash flow from changes to bank loans The measurement shows the underlying cash flow before financing activities  but including amortization of lease liabilities. Equity per share Equity divided by number of shares at the end of the period The measurement shows the return generated on the owners' invested capital per share Rolling 12 months' sales  operating profit or other results Sales  operating profit or other results measured over the past 12-month period This measure is used to more clearly illustrate the trends for sales  operating profit and other results  which is relevant because RaySearch's revenue is subject to monthly variations Working capital Working capital comprises inventories  operating receivables and operating liabilities  and is obtained from the statement of financial position. Operating receivables comprise accounts receivable  other current/long-term receivables and non-interest bearing prepaid expenses and accrued income.

Because the laws of some jurisdictions require certain types of purchasers to take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form  you may encounter difficulties in your ability to own  transfer or pledge beneficial interests in a global security.So long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security  we and the trustee will treat the depositary as the sole owner or holder of the debt securities for purposes of the applicable indenture. Therefore  except as set forth below  you will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in your name or to receive physical delivery of certificates representing the debt securities. Accordingly  you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and the participant in the depositary through whom you hold your beneficial interest in order to exercise any rights of a holder under the indenture. We understand that under existing practices  the depositary would act upon the instructions of a participant or authorize that participant to take any action that a holder is entitled to take.Unless stated otherwise in an accompanying prospectus supplement  you may elect to hold interests in the global securities through either DTC (in the United States) or Clearstream Banking  société anonyme   which we refer to as Clearstream  Luxembourg  or Euroclear Bank  S.A./N.V.  or its successor  as operator of the Euroclear System  which we refer to as Euroclear (outside of the United States)  if you are participants of such systems  or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. Interests held through Clearstream and Euroclear will be recorded on DTC’s books as being held by the U.S. depositary for each of Clearstream and Euroclear  which U.S. depositaries will in turn hold interests on behalf of their participants’ customers’ securities accounts.As long as the debt securities of a series are represented by the global securities  we will pay principal of and interest and premium of  if any  on those securities to or as directed by DTC as the registered holder of the global securities. Payments to DTC will be in immediately available funds by wire transfer. DTC  Clearstream  Luxembourg or Euroclear  as applicable  will credit the relevant accounts of their participants on the applicable date. Neither we nor the trustee will be responsible for making any payments to participants or customers of participants or for maintaining any records relating to the holdings of participants and their customers  and you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and its participants. If an issue of debt securities is denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar  we will make payments of principal and any interest in the foreign currency in which the debt securities are denominated or in U.S. dollars. DTC has elected to have all payments of principal and interest paid in U.S. dollars unless notified by any of its participants through which an interest in the debt securities is held that it elects  in accordance with  and to the extent permitted by  an accompanying prospectus supplement and the relevant debt security  to receive payment of principal or interest in the foreign currency. No fewer than 15 calendar days prior to the regular record date for a payment  a participant will be required to notify DTC of (a) its election to receive all  or the specified portion  of payment in the foreign currency and (b) its instructions for wire transfer of payment to a foreign currency account. DTC will notify the trustee or paying agent on or prior to the fifth business day after the regular record date for any payment of interest  and the tenth business day prior to the payment date for any payment of principal  with the amount of such payment to be received in such foreign currency and the applicable wire transfer instructions. The trustee or paying agent shall use such instructions to pay the participant directly. If DTC does not notify the trustee or paying agent  it is understood that only U.S. dollar payments are to be made in respect of the payment.We have been advised by DTC as follows:•DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities deposited with it by its participants and facilitates the settlement of transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in accounts of the participants  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations  some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC.

In Asia  market conditions normalized and conditions improved in Europe and the US during the quarter. However  it remains difficult to say how the pandemic will affect the coming quarters with any great certainty.SIGNIFICANT events AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODIn April  Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital placed an order for RayStation  thereby becoming RaySearch's first customer in Hong Kong within the proton therapy segment.In April  Seoul National University Hospital placed an order for RayStation.In April  Mevion China placed an order for RayStation  which it sold together with Mevion's proton therapy system to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan in China.In May  RaySearch entered into an agreement with GE Healthcare to develop a new radiation therapy simulation and treatment planning workflow solution.In May  RayCare was taken into clinical use with Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system at Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland.CFO Torbjörn Wingårdh left RaySearchfinancial SUMMARY1AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s JAN-MAR APR 2021- FULL-YEAR 2022 2021 MAR 2022 2021 Net sales 208 149 162 102 687 720 641 673 Operating profit/loss 29 564 12 261 -36 038 -53 341 Operating margin  % 14.2 7.6 -5.2 -8.3 Profit/loss for the period 19 298 7 110 -35 127 -47 315 Earnings/loss per share before/after dilution  SEK 0.56 0.21 -1.02 -1.38 Cash flow from operating activities 125 787 104 332 259 617 238 162 Cash flow for the period 35 320 32 840 -69 223 -71 703 Return on equity  % 2.9 1.0 -5.3 -7.3 Equity/assets ratio  %  at the end of the period 38.9 52.7 38.9 37.3 Share price at the end of the period  SEK 51.7 89.5 51.7 56.51 For definitions of key ratios  see page 20.HIGHEST EVER FIRST QUARTER SALESThe pandemic had a negative impact on our sales  but we could see clear signs of a recovery already in the fourth quarter of 2021 and are delighted to note that this positive trend has continued. During the year's first quarter  we witnessed an increase in order intake of 88 percent compared with the year-on-year period and RaySearch's sales were at the highest ever level for a first quarter  SEK 208 M. In addition  EBIT totaled SEK 30 M  representing an operating margin of 14 percent. We also had more opportunities to meet customers face-to-face as travel restrictions were lifted in many countries. The positive signals are in line with our expectations and I am optimistic about a stabilization in market conditions and a return to normal circumstances  even though the pandemic is not yet completely behind us.A few days ago  we returned from one of our industry's main trade fairs  ESTRO  which was a highly positive experience. There was a palpable energy among the many visitors to our booth and great interest in our products  with many demonstrations and a large number of fruitful partnership discussions.NEW ORDERS STRENGTHEN LEADING POSITION IN PROTON MARKETTreatment planning for particle treatments (protons/carbon ions/BNCT) is an important focus area for RaySearch and today RayStation has a global market share of more than 60 percent. This position was also strengthened by several important orders  including from Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital  Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) and Proton International Arkansas. Another important order  though not in proton therapy  was from Charles-Le Moyne in Canada. The hospital's cancer clinic has used RayStation since 2018 and has now ordered additional licenses as well as upgrades to the system.We have seen a sharp increase in interest for RayCare. In addition to that fact that RayCare is seen as a next generation oncology information system  this was mainly driven by three factors. The first is the positive feedback provided by reference customers  such as Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland and UZ Leuven in Belgium. Furthermore  we can see that RaySearch's strong offering in proton therapy – which has given us a market-leading position – means new  potential proton customers look upon RayCare as an attractive alternative. Lastly  we expect to see increased interest when it becomes possible to connect RayCare to Varian's TrueBeam later in the year. We believe most interest in acquiring RayCare will be shown by centers with treatment machines from several different manufacturers.RAYCOMMAND IN CLINICAL USEAn important milestone was reached in April when RaySearch's latest product  RayCommand  was taken into clinical use for the first time  which occurred at MedAustron in Austria. MedAustron has used RayStation for some time to plan carbon ion therapy  which is the most advanced form of radiation therapy. RaySearch and MedAustron have had a unique and close cooperation for several years in the development of RayCommand and it is very gratifying to see how this has now resulted in a new and innovative product. Earlier this spring  MedAustron also took RayCare into clinical use and therefore became the first center in the world to use the three systems – RayStation  RayCare and RayCommand – together to treat patients. The RayCommand treatment delivery system serves as a link between the treatment machine  RayStation and RayCare and also coordinates and orchestrates the other systems at the center  such as imaging systems  beam delivery systems and the patient positioning systems.Another key milestone after the end of the quarter was that Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland treated its first patient using Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system together with RayStation and RayCare. In addition to these two extraordinary events  product development is progressing according to plan for all products and RayStation and RayCare are both in the final phase ahead of their half-year launches in June.WELL POSITIONED FOR GROWTHThe cost-saving program initiated in autumn 2021 is continuing and we can see a clear reduction in costs for travel and events as well as a slight decrease in personnel costs as a result of the continued recruitment freeze. Given all of the positive signals from the market  I am optimistic about the future. Concurrently  I am retaining a realistic view of business  well aware of the fact that we have yet to fully leave the pandemic behind us. We will therefore continue along the route we have set  focusing on sales  product development and cost control. With this strategy  combined with improving market conditions  a quarter with strong figures and an order backlog that once again achieved a new peak (SEK 1 489 M)  we have an solid foundation for a return to growth during the year.Stockholm  May 18  2022Johan LöfCEO and founderFinancial informationRaySearch operates in a market with uneven order flows where large individual orders can have a substantial impact on revenue recognition between the quarters and  because the company has limited (less than 10 percent) variable costs for license revenue  operating profit is affected by an amount that is nearly as high. For this reason  a longer perspective than a few quarters should be taken.order intake and order backlogIn the first quarter of 2022  order intake rose 87.8 percent year-on-year to SEK 272.5 M (145.1). License order intake increased 68.5 percent to SEK 131.4 M (78.0) while order intake for support increased 128.8 percent to SEK 111.2 M (48.6).Order intake (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21 Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Licenses 131.4 170.9 46.2 55.6 78.0 404.1 350.7 Hardware 24.1 35.7 7.9 9.3 12.1 77.0 65.0 Support (incl. warranty support) 111.2 130.7 69.1 116.6 48.6 427.6 365.0 Training and other 5.8 7.7 4.7 8.2 6.5 26.4 27.1 Total order intake 272.5 345.0 127.9 189.8 145.1 935.1 807.8 Order backlog (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21 Licenses 184.1 176.6 105.3 115.0 129.6 Hardware 74.2 66.2 38.4 36.9 48.5 Support (incl. warranty support) 1 159.9 1 053.3 1 009.2 1 001.7 974.2 Training and other 70.5 66.8 59.5 59.9 54.8 Total order backlog at the end of the period 1 488.7 1 362.9 1 212.4 1 213.4 1 207.1At March 31  2022  the total order backlog was SEK 1 488.7 M (1 207.1)  which is expected to generate revenue of approximately SEK 422 M over the next 12 months. The remaining amount in the order backlog mainly pertains to support obligations  which are primarily expected to generate revenue over a subsequent four-year period.RevenueIn the first quarter of 2022  net sales rose 28.4 percent year-on-year to SEK 208.1 M (162.1). The change was attributable to higher license sales  which rose 35.2 percent to SEK 111.7 M (82.6). The increase in net sales at unchanged currencies was 15.9 percent (-14.2).Support revenue rose 23.8 percent to SEK 76.6 M (61.9)  accounting for 36.8 percent (38.2) of net sales during the first quarter. Hardware sales  which have a limited profit margin  rose 7.8 percent to SEK 16.6 M (15.4). Excluding hardware  sales rose 30.6 percent year-on-year.Revenue (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21 Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 License revenue 111.7 105.5 55.7 63.4 82.6 336.2 307.1 Hardware revenue 16.6 9.2 7.1 19.8 15.4 52.7 51.5 Support revenue 76.6 71.8 67.3 67.5 61.9 283.2 268.5 Training and other revenue 3.2 2.1 6.4 3.9 2.1 15.6 14.5 Net sales 208.1 188.6 136.4 154.6 162.1 687.7 641.7 Change in sales  corresp. period  % 28.4 17.6 14.5 -5.6 -22.4 13.7 -1.6 Change in organic sales  corresp. period  % 15.9 22.0 11.9 4.5 -14.2 13.2 1.6In the first quarter of 2022  net sales had the following geographic distribution: North America  39 percent (36); Asia  29 percent (26); Europe and the rest of the world  32 percent (38).Operating profitIn the first quarter of 2022  operating profit totaled SEK 29.6 M (12.3)  representing an operating margin of 14.2 percent (7.6). The earnings improvement was largely attributable to higher license revenue.In the first quarter  operating expenses increased 19.2 percent to SEK 178.6 M (149.8). The change was largely due to increased administrative costs.In the first quarter  the net of exchange gains and losses amounted to SEK 4.9 M (10.0) since a large proportion of the Group's receivables are denominated in USD and EUR  which strengthened against the SEK in the first quarter compared with the end of the fourth quarter. Adjusted for these currency translation effects  operating profit would have totaled SEK 24.7 M (2.3) in the first quarter and operating expenses would have increased 14.8 percent (-11.1).Currency effectsConsolidated sales and earnings are impacted by USD/EUR to SEK exchange rates  since most sales are invoiced in USD and EUR  while most costs are denominated in SEK.At unchanged exchange rates  the change in sales was 15.9 percent in the first quarter of 2022  compared with the year-earlier period. In addition  the Group's exchange gains on balance sheet items amounted to SEK 4.4 M (10.0) in the first quarter. Currency effects therefore had a positive impact on net sales and operating profit in the first quarter 2022.A sensitivity analysis of the Group's currency exposure shows that a 1-percentage point change in the USD exchange rate against the SEK would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 2.6 M in the first quarter of 2022  while a corresponding change in the EUR exchange rate would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 1.4 M.The Group follows the financial policy established by the Board  whereby exchange-rate fluctuations are not hedged.Capitalization of development costsRaySearch is a research and development-oriented company that makes significant investments in the development of software solutions for improved cancer treatment. At March 31  2022  some 199 employees (210) were engaged in research and development  corresponding to 50 percent (51) of the total number of employees.Capitalization of development costs Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21 Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Research and development costs 64.3 79.1 57.9 68.0 64.9 269.4 270.0 Capitalization of development costs -52.4 -59.3 -40.0 -52.5 -51.5 -204.1 -203.3 Amortization of capitalized development costs 45.0 44.1 43.2 40.1 39.2 172.5 166.7 Research and development costs 57.0 63.9 61.2 55.7 52.6 237.8 233.4In 2022  RaySearch continued to invest in both existing products and future products. Overall  research and development costs decreased 1 percent to SEK 64.3 M (64.9) in the first quarter of 2022  corresponding to 31 percent (40) of the Group's net sales.Development costs of SEK 52.4 M (51.5) were capitalized  up 1.7 percent  corresponding to 81 percent (79) of total research and development costs.Amortization of capitalized development costs rose 14.7 percent to SEK 45.0 M (39.2)  and the increase was attributable to an expansion of development activities  and that amortization periods had commenced for all products  including RayCommand and RayIntelligence.Research and development costs (after adjustments for capitalization and amortization of development costs) rose 8.2 percent to SEK 57.0 M (52.6).Amortization and depreciationIn the first quarter of 2022  total amortization and depreciation rose 19.8 percent to SEK 70.0 M (58.3)  of which amortization of intangible fixed assets accounted for SEK 45.0 M (39.3)  mainly related to capitalized development costs. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 25.0 M (19.1).profit and earnings per shareIn the first quarter of 2022  profit after tax was SEK 19.3 M (7.1)  corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 0.56 (0.21) before and after dilution.Tax expense for the quarter was SEK -6.9 M (-4.3)  corresponding to an effective tax rate of 26.2 percent (37.5).Cash flow and liquidityIn the first quarter of 2022  cash flow from operating activities was SEK 125.8 M (104.3) and the change was largely attributable to a decrease in working capital  which mainly comprises various types of receivables from customers  such as accounts receivable and current and long-term unbilled customer receivables where payment plans have been drawn up.At the end of the period  the company's total customer receivables amounted to 46 percent (56) of net sales over the past 12 months.Working capital amounted to 2 percent (5) of net sales over the past 12 months.In the first quarter  cash flow from investing activities was SEK -60.6 M (-60.3). Investments in intangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -52.4 M (-51.5) and consisted of capitalized development costs for the company's products – RayStation  RayCare  RayCommand and RayIntelligence. Investments in tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -8.2 M (-8.8)  mainly related to investments in the head office in Stockholm.Cash flow from financing activities was SEK -29.9 M (-11.2) for the first quarter of 2022. The change was largely due to a bank overdraft of SEK 21 M drawn in the first quarter.Cash flow for the first quarter amounted to SEK 35.3 M (32.8). At March 31  2022  consolidated cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 139.8 M (205.2).Financial positionAt March 31  2022  RaySearch's total assets amounted to SEK 1 722 M (1 334) and the equity/assets ratio was 38.9 percent (52.7). The change in total assets and the equity/assets ratio was largely attributable to an increase in right-of-use assets related to rented premises following the granting of access to the new head office premises.Current receivables amounted to SEK 376.7 M (414.3). The receivables mainly comprise various types of customer receivables.RaySearch's credit facility comprises a revolving loan facility of up to SEK 150 M that matures in March 2025 and an overdraft facility of SEK 50 M the matures in December 2022. Chattel mortgages amounted to SEK 100 M. At March 31  2022  a short-term loan of SEK 0 M (50) was raised under the company's revolving loan facility and SEK 0 M (0) of the credit facility had been drawn.At March 31  2022  the Group's net debt amounted to SEK 397.0 M (-66.0). The change was largely due to an increase in lease liabilities following the granting of access to the new head office premises during the fourth quarter.EMPLOYEESAt the end of the first quarter  the Group had 389 (413) employees  of whom 284 (310) were based in Sweden  and 105 (102) in foreign subsidiaries.PARENT COMPANYRaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is the Parent Company of the RaySearch Group. Since the Parent Company's operations are consistent with the Group's operations in all material respects  the comments for the Group are also largely relevant for the Parent Company.Differences in profitability between the Parent Company and the Group are attributable to the Parent Company accounting for a relatively high proportion of operating expenses  and to the capitalization of development costs being recognized in the Group but not in the Parent Company. The Parent Company was also not affected by the changes pertaining to lease recognition under IFRS 16  and instead continues to recognize lease payments as operating lease payments. This reduces operating profit compared with if IFRS 16 had been applied.The Parent Company's current receivables mainly comprise receivables from Group companies and external customers.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTERAgreement signed with Proton International ArkansasIn January  RaySearch signed an agreement with Proton International Arkansas to provide RayStation at the UAMS Radiation Oncology Center. The center will open in 2023 and be the first proton center in the state of Arkansas.

RaySearch is monitoring the situation closely and is prepared to take new action and align the company's operations if needed.Effects on RaySearch's operations in the first quarter of 2022Sales. The negative effect of the pandemic on RaySearch's sales appears to be weakening as the pandemic subsides. In Asia  market conditions normalized and conditions improved in Europe and the US during the quarter.Delivery capacity. As a software company  RaySearch is well equipped for remote collaboration and both our R&D and delivery capacity have remained relatively unscathed by the COVID-19 pandemic to date.In the first quarter  COVID-19 did not have any major impact on the company's assessment items.Expected future effectsIt is still difficult to say how the ongoing pandemic will affect the coming quarters with any great certainty. The situation has normalized in most countries  though a few countries have registered rising case numbers.The company believes the underlying need and demand for effective software solutions for cancer care is in the process of returning to pre-pandemic levels. Since sales activities have been restricted for some time  however  it may take time before the full sales effect is regained. We see no major challenges in terms of R&D or the company's delivery capacity. The company will continue to focus on protecting the company's cash flow and liquidity.Increased focus on efficiencies and digitization. One effect of the COVID-19 pandemic could be a further acceleration of the ongoing digital transformation. The pandemic has drastically highlighted the major potential and benefits of digital technology  which could be positive for RaySearch's operations in the long term because the company's software solutions enable cancer clinics to improve their efficiency.The company's shareAt March 31  2022  the total number of registered shares in RaySearch was 34 282 773  of which 8 454 975 were Class A and 25 827 798 Class B shares.

The accounting policies applied are consistent with those described in the 2021 Annual Report for RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ)  which is available at www.raysearchlabs.com This interim report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act.RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is the Parent Company of the RaySearch Group. The Parent Company applies the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities. The Parent Company's operations are consistent with the Group's operations in all material respects.Differences in profitability between the Parent Company and the Group are attributable to the Parent Company accounting for a relatively high proportion of operating expenses  and to the capitalization of development costs being recognized in the Group but not in the Parent Company. The Parent Company was also not affected by IFRS 16  and will continue to recognize lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This reduces operating profit compared with if IFRS 16 had been applied.The Parent Company's current receivables mainly comprise receivables from Group companies and external customers.Note 2 Revenue from contracts with customersRaySearch conducts sales of goods and services in various regions. Revenue from sales of licenses and hardware is recognized in profit or loss at a point in time  while revenue from sales of training and support is recognized over time.AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s JAN-MAR 2022 2021 Change APR 2021-MAR 2022 Full-year 2021 Revenue by type Licenses 111 711 82 605 35.2% 336 244 307 138 Support 76 644 61 937 23.7% 283 233 268 526 Hardware 16 597 15 428 7.6% 52 665 51 496 Training and other 3 197 2 132 50.0% 15 578 14 513 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4% 687 720 641 673 Revenue by geographic market North America 79 993 58 688 36.3% 245 646 224 341 APAC 61 037 41 718 46.3% 192 866 173 547 Europe and rest of the world 67 119 61 696 8.8% 249 208 243 785 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4% 687 720 641 673 Revenue by date for revenue recognition Goods/services transferred at a point in time 128 308 98 033 30.9% 388 909 358 634 Services transferred over time 79 841 64 069 24.6% 298 811 283 039 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4% 687 720 641 673NOTE 3 EstimatesPreparation of the interim report requires that company management make estimates that affect the carrying amounts. The actual outcome could deviate from these estimates. The critical sources of uncertainty in the estimates are the same as those in the most recent Annual Report.Note 4 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSRaySearch's financial assets and liabilities comprise billed and unbilled receivables  cash and cash equivalents  accrued expenses  accounts payable  bank loans and lease liabilities. Long-term receivables and lease liabilities are discounted  while other financial assets and liabilities have short maturities. Accordingly  the fair values of all financial instruments are deemed to correspond approximately to their carrying amounts.The provision for expected credit losses is a weighted assessment of payment history  reports from external credit rating agencies and other customer-specific information. At the end of March 2022  the credit loss provision amounted to SEK 40.0 M (26.7)  corresponding to 12 percent (8) of total customer receivables. The increased credit loss provision despite lower total receivables was mainly related to a customer in the US. The Group's credit losses have historically been limited and amounted to about 0.7 percent of the company's average customer receivables over the past five years.Note 5 Related-party transactionsThere were no transactions between RaySearch and related parties with any material impact on the company's position and earnings during the period.Note 6 Pledged assets in the Group and Parent CompanyAMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Mar 31  2022 Mar 31  2021 Dec 31  2021 Chattel mortgages 100 000 100 000 100 000 Guarantees 31 314 14 815 31 046The year-on-year increase was largely attributable to bank guarantees issued for the new office premises.group quarterly overview2022 2021 2020 AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Order intake Total order intake 272 442 345 028 127 853 189 750 145 131 239 125 138 480 177 133 Income statement Net sales 208 149 188 573 136 419 154 579 162 102 159 835 119 130 163 758 Change in sales  % 28.4 18.0 14.5 -5.6 -22.4 -31.8 -17.5 -13.7 Operating profit/loss 29 564 -16 578 -26 561 -22 463 12 261 -14 592 -29 477 -10 954 Operating margin  % 14.2 -8.8 -19.5 -14.5 7.6 -9.1 -24.7 -6.7 Profit/loss for the period 19 298 -15 968 -21 990 -16 467 7 110 -14 164 -26 182 -9 196 Net margin  % 9.3 -8.5 -16.1 -10.7 4.4 -8.9 -22.0 -5.6 Cash flow Operating activities 125 787 28 397 47 356 58 077 104 332 51 505 78 486 135 443 Investing activities -60 551 -60 944 -45 569 -70 843 -60 275 -64 094 -45 372 -55 913 Financing activities -29 916 12 482 -11 875 -61 624 -11 217 -8 909 -11 394 -13 618 Cash flow for the period 35 320 -20 065 -10 088 -74 390 32 840 -21 498 21 720 65 912 Capital structure Equity/assets ratio  % 38.9 37.3 56.7 57.8 52.7 54.0 57.0 56.2 Net debt 397 045 459 742 -52 983 -50 385 -65 952 -22 439 -31 476 206 Debt/equity ratio 0.6 0.7 -0.1 -0.1 -0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Net debt/EBITDA 1.8 2.3 -0.3 -0.3 -0.4 -0.1 -0.1 0.0 Per share data  SEK Earnings/loss per share before dilution 0.56 -0.47 -0.64 -0.48 0.21 -0.41 -0.76 -0.27 Earnings/loss per share after dilution 0.56 -0.47 -0.64 -0.48 0.21 -0.41 -0.76 -0.27 Equity per share 19.52 18.94 19.38 20.00 20.49 20.25 20.71 21.48 Share price at the end of the period 51.70 56.50 61.50 87.40 89.50 82.70 87.50 86.50 Other No. of shares before/after dilution  000s 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 Average no. of employees 399 419 418 414 412 404 399 391Group  rolling 12 monthsAMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Apr 2021- Jan 2021- Oct 2020- Jul 2020- Apr 2020- Jan 2020- Oct 2019- Jul 2019- Mar 2022 Dec 2021 Sep 2021 Jun 2021 Mar 2021 Dec 2020 Sep 2020 Jun 2020 Order intake Total order intake 935 073 807 762 701 859 712 486 699 868 854 755 892 846 951 160 Income statement Net sales 687 720 641 673 612 935 595 646 604 825 651 612 726 276 751 495 Operating profit/loss -36 038 -53 341 -51 355 -54 271 -42 762 -3 466 33 594 56 726 Operating margin  % -5.2 -8.3 -8.4 -9.1 -7.1 -0.5 4.6 7.5 Cash flow Cash flow -69 223 -72 380 -73 136 -41 328 98 972 61 890 91 165 55 970 Cash flow adjusted for repayment of bank loans -47 955 -22 380 -23 136 8 672 98 972 61 890 91 165 55 970definitions of key ratiosThe interim report refers to a number of non-IFRS financial measures that are used to provide investors and company management with additional information to assess the company's operations. The various non-IFRS measures used to complement the IFRS financial statements are described below.Non-IFRS measures Definition Reason for using the measure Order intake The value (transaction price) of all orders received and changes to existing orders during the current period Order intake is an indicator of future revenue and thus a key figure for the management of RaySearch's operations Order backlog The value of orders at the end of the period that the company has yet to deliver and recognize as revenue  meaning remaining performance obligations. The order backlog shows the value of orders already booked by RaySearch that will be converted to revenue in the future. Net sales/Order intake Recognized net sales in relation to total order intake during the corresponding period The measurement is used to monitor the recognized revenue in relation to sales  which is part of the reason for the change in order backlog. Change in sales The change in net sales compared with the year-earlier period expressed as a percentage The measure is used to track the performance of the company's operations between periods Change in sales at unchanged currencies Change in sales at unchanged exchange rates  i.e. excluding currency effects This measure is used to monitor underlying change in sales driven by alterations in volume  pricing and mix for comparable units between different periods Gross profit Net sales minus cost of goods sold Gross profit is used to measure the margin before sales  research  development and administrative expenses Operating profit/loss Calculated as profit for the period before financial items and tax Operating profit/loss provides an overall picture of the total generation of earnings in operating activities Operating profit adjusted for currency translation effects Calculated as operating profit less other operating income/expenses Operating profit provides an overall picture of the total generation of earnings in operating activities excluding currency translation effects for balance sheet items Operating margin Operating profit expressed as a percentage of net sales Together with sales growth  the operating margin is a key element for monitoring value creation Net margin Profit for the period as a percentage of net sales for the period The net margin shows the percentage of net sales remaining after the company's expenses have been deducted Cash flow adjusted for changes in bank loans Cash flow for the period less cash flow from changes to bank loans The measurement shows the underlying cash flow before financing activities  but including amortization of lease liabilities. Equity per share Equity divided by number of shares at the end of the period The measurement shows the return generated on the owners' invested capital per share Rolling 12 months' sales  operating profit or other results Sales  operating profit or other results measured over the past 12-month period This measure is used to more clearly illustrate the trends for sales  operating profit and other results  which is relevant because RaySearch's revenue is subject to monthly variations Working capital Working capital comprises inventories  operating receivables and operating liabilities  and is obtained from the statement of financial position. Operating receivables comprise accounts receivable  other current/long-term receivables and non-interest bearing prepaid expenses and accrued income. Operating liabilities include other non-interest bearing long-term liabilities  advance payments from customers  accounts payable  other current liabilities and non-interest bearing accrued expenses and deferred income. This measure shows how much working capital is tied up in operations and can be shown in relation to net sales to demonstrate the efficiency with which working capital has been used Return on equity Calculated as profit/loss for the period as a percentage of average equity. Average equity is calculated as the sum of equity at the end of the period plus equity at the end of the year-earlier period  divided by two Shows the return generated on the owners' invested capital from a shareholder perspective Equity/assets ratio Equity expressed as a percentage of total assets at the end of the period This is a standard measure to show financial risk  and is expressed as the percentage of the total restricted equity financed by the owners Net debt Interest-bearing liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing current and long-term receivables This measure shows the Group's total indebtedness Debt/equity ratio Net debt in relation to equity The measure shows financial risk and is used by management to monitor the Group's indebtedness EBITDA Operating profit before financial items  tax  depreciation/amortization and impairment The measurement is a way to evaluate the result without taking into consideration financial decisions or taxes Net debt/EBITDA Net debt at the end of the period in relation to operating profit before depreciation and amortization over the past 12-month period A relevant measure from a credit perspective that shows the company's ability to handle its debtCalculation of financial measures not included in the IFRS frameworkAMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Mar 31  2022 Mar 31  2021 Dec 31  2021 Working capital Accounts receivable (current billed customer receivables) 187 159 160 379 170 591 Current unbilled customer receivables 120 850 153 955 146 771 Long-term unbilled customer receivables 6 291 26 223 10 204 Inventories 38 452 22 189 29 991 Other current receivables (excl. tax) 67 322 47 762 63 702 Accounts payable -29 852 -21 975 -48 774 Other current liabilities (excl. tax) -375 819 -356 215 -367 212 Working capital 14 403 32 318 5 273 AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Mar 31  2022 Mar 31  2021 Dec 31  2021 Net debt Current interest-bearing liabilities 50 500 84 828 70 381 Long-term interest-bearing liabilities 486 361 54 435 491 017 Cash and cash equivalents -139 816 -205 215 -102 535 Net debt 397 045 -65 952 458 863 AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s APR 2021- MAR 2022 APR 2020- MAR 2021 Full-year 2021 EBITDA Operating profit/loss -36 038 -42 762 -53 341 Amortization and depreciation 261 665 222 165 250 184 EBITDA 225 627 179 403 196 843 CHANGE IN SALES AT UNCHANGED CURRENCIES APR 2021- MAR 2022 APR 2020- MAR 2021 Full-year 2021 Net sales for the year 706 117 604 825 641 673 Currency adjustment -2 859 29 482 20 868 Adjusted Net sales 684 861 634 307 662 541 Net sales  preceding year 604 825 777 395 651 612 Organic growth 13.2% -18.4% 1.7%Head officeRaySearch Laboratories AB (publ)Box 45169SE-104 30 Stockholm  SwedenStreet addressEugeniavägen 18 CSE-113 68 Stockholm  SwedenTel: +46 (0)8 510 530 00raysearchlabs.comCorp.

Because the laws of some jurisdictions require certain types of purchasers to take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form  you may encounter difficulties in your ability to own  transfer or pledge beneficial interests in a global security.So long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security  we and the trustee will treat the depositary as the sole owner or holder of the debt securities for purposes of the applicable indenture. Therefore  except as set forth below  you will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in your name or to receive physical delivery of certificates representing the debt securities. Accordingly  you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and the participant in the depositary through whom you hold your beneficial interest in order to exercise any rights of a holder under the indenture. We understand that under existing practices  the depositary would act upon the instructions of a participant or authorize that participant to take any action that a holder is entitled to take.Unless stated otherwise in an accompanying prospectus supplement  you may elect to hold interests in the global securities through either DTC (in the United States) or Clearstream Banking  société anonyme   which we refer to as Clearstream  Luxembourg  or Euroclear Bank  S.A./N.V.  or its successor  as operator of the Euroclear System  which we refer to as Euroclear (outside of the United States)  if you are participants of such systems  or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. Interests held through Clearstream and Euroclear will be recorded on DTC’s books as being held by the U.S. depositary for each of Clearstream and Euroclear  which U.S. depositaries will in turn hold interests on behalf of their participants’ customers’ securities accounts.As long as the debt securities of a series are represented by the global securities  we will pay principal of and interest and premium of  if any  on those securities to or as directed by DTC as the registered holder of the global securities. Payments to DTC will be in immediately available funds by wire transfer. DTC  Clearstream  Luxembourg or Euroclear  as applicable  will credit the relevant accounts of their participants on the applicable date. Neither we nor the trustee will be responsible for making any payments to participants or customers of participants or for maintaining any records relating to the holdings of participants and their customers  and you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and its participants. If an issue of debt securities is denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar  we will make payments of principal and any interest in the foreign currency in which the debt securities are denominated or in U.S. dollars. DTC has elected to have all payments of principal and interest paid in U.S. dollars unless notified by any of its participants through which an interest in the debt securities is held that it elects  in accordance with  and to the extent permitted by  an accompanying prospectus supplement and the relevant debt security  to receive payment of principal or interest in the foreign currency. No fewer than 15 calendar days prior to the regular record date for a payment  a participant will be required to notify DTC of (a) its election to receive all  or the specified portion  of payment in the foreign currency and (b) its instructions for wire transfer of payment to a foreign currency account. DTC will notify the trustee or paying agent on or prior to the fifth business day after the regular record date for any payment of interest  and the tenth business day prior to the payment date for any payment of principal  with the amount of such payment to be received in such foreign currency and the applicable wire transfer instructions. The trustee or paying agent shall use such instructions to pay the participant directly. If DTC does not notify the trustee or paying agent  it is understood that only U.S. dollar payments are to be made in respect of the payment.We have been advised by DTC as follows:•DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

Stocks were mixed in Asia; the dollar  Treasury yields and oil gained; and gold weakened.Equities:European shares may struggle for momentum Wednesday following another hawkish message from Jerome Powell and despite a tech-led rally on Wall Street.U.S. stocks briefly pared gains as Powell voiced resolve in fighting inflation  before indexes climbed back toward new session highs.""There could be some pain involved"" in restoring price stability  Powell said in remarks at The Wall Street Journal's Future of Everything Festival.Powell said he wasn't at odds with those who believe the Fed faces a difficult path toward achieving what is known as a ""soft landing "" in which growth slows enough to bring down inflation without triggering a recession.""I would say there is no disagreement really. It is a challenging task  made more challenging the last couple months because of global events "" he said. ""It is challenging because unemployment is very low already and because inflation is very high.""Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf  speaking at the same event  said it would be difficult to avoid a recession but noted that consumers and businesses remain financially solid.""The fact that everyone is so strong going into this should hopefully provide a cushion such that whatever recession there is  if there is one  is short and not all that deep "" he said.Read more from Powell here.Economic Insight:European and U.S. consumers look set to tighten their belts in response to the rising cost of living  but prices may increase more than they think  according to a survey.A JPMorgan poll of 5 000 French  German  Spanish  British and U.S. consumers found they expect to reduce non-essential spending by more than 6% this year  though most appear to be under-estimating inflation  JPM said.Consumers plan fewer do-it-yourself projects than before the pandemic  potentially hitting home-improvement retailers  the survey found. Consumers also look set to prioritize leisure spending over buying jewellery/premium accessories and sports and beauty products. Still  online grocers and food-delivery firms could benefit as only 20% of respondents plan to visit supermarkets more  the report showed.Forex:The dollar edged higher following Tuesday's pullback  as emerging risk aversion driven by losses in some Asian equity markets and U.S. stock futures boosted the currency's haven appeal.Westpac said it was still far too early to call a long-term peak in the dollar and retracements should be shallow.Jerome Powell reinforced the Fed's resolutely hawkish stance  although the European Central Bank was beginning to coalesce around a more hawkish posture  Westpac said.---The Fed's Charles Evans said Tuesday that aggressive central bank rate rises are needed to get inflation back under control.""Inflation is clearly much too high and monetary policy must be repositioned to address this "" Mr. Evans said in a speech in New York.Read more here.Bonds:Treasury yields extended their gains in Asia after they rose to their highest levels in at least a week Tuesday.U.S. data that included in-line retail sales and industrial activity that surprised on the upside helped lift yields Tuesday  and they remained elevated after Powell reinforced the Fed's commitment to stabilize price increases.""Powell was open to moving rates past neutral if necessary and added that the landing could be a bit bumpy with an emphasis on balancing the labor market and restoring price stability "" said BMO Capital Markets.""Powell's comments only served to reinforce the Fed's current mantra of combating inflation at all costs "" with the costs being economic performance.Energy:Oil futures pushed higher in Asia on optimism over China fuel demand after Shanghai on Tuesday had a third straight day of no new Covid-19 infections outside quarantine zones.The ""less awful news on China offers a nip in the tail in the form of much higher oil demand and prices "" said SPI Asset Management.However  the lack of an EU ban on Russian oil could limit the topside until the special summit on May 30-31  which is the next opportunity to agree on such an embargo  SPI added.---While the near-term outlook for oil is strong  Macquarie expects prices to fade in the second half.Brent crude has averaged $107 in the second quarter so far but a likely increase in supply from OPEC and other countries  potentially including Iran  should weigh on prices in the second half  Macquarie said.""We maintain our long-term assumption of $65 but defer this to the first quarter of 2024 [from 1Q of 2023] "" Macquarie said.Metals:Gold futures weakened as contrary influences in the market continued to cause volatility.Interest-rate differentials between the U.S. and some countries have narrowed  which has put downward pressure on the dollar and given the ""green light"" for gold investors to buy the dip  said OANDA.However  bullion has pared recent gains partly because the U.S. retail sales data suggested the consumer remains strong  which is spurring expectations that the Fed won't ease up on its policy tightening.---Base metals were marginally lower on worries about China's economic slowdown.Recent data suggested that China's stalling economy requires aggressive stimulus and a swift easing of Covid-19 restrictions  which don't appear likely soon  said TD Securities. In this context  base metals are expected to remain under selling pressure.---Iron-ore futures were down more than 2% on concerns over steel demand in China.According to a media report  China Steel Corp. said this week that it will lower domestic steel prices by 2.1% on average for June delivery  partly due to a brief slowdown in steel demand.Commodity-grade steel prices remain under pressure as international supply-side constraints continue to ease for basic steel products  said Rystad Energy.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESPowell Says Fed Has Resolve to Bring U.S. Inflation DownThe Future of Everything Festival is happening right now.

CEO Charlie Scharf said Tuesday there was ""no question"" that the U.S. is headed for an economic downturn.The Federal Reserve has raised rates twice this year and plans to keep doing so  part of its bid to cool the economy and curb red-hot inflation.

Wainwright Conference website https://hcwevents.com/globalconference/.About ERYTECH and eryaspase (GRASPA®) www.erytech.comERYTECH is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative red blood cell-based therapeutics for severe forms of cancer and orphan diseases. Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS® platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH’s primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company’s lead product candidate  eryaspase  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells’ altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer. An investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial (IST) evaluating the use of eryaspase in ALL patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase recently reported positive results  based on which the Company intends to request approval in the United States and potentially other territories. The Company is also pursuing a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in first-line pancreatic cancer.Story continuesEryaspase received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who have developed hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived pegylated asparaginase. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have granted eryaspase orphan drug status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and ALL. Eryaspase is not an approved medicine.ERYTECH produces its product candidates for treatment of patients in Europe at its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France  and expects to be able to produce for patients in the United States through a long-term supply agreement with Catalent  operating from ERYTECH’s former GMP facility in Princeton  New Jersey  USA.ERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135  ticker: ERYP).

Having already provided clinical validation of the novel  physics-based MoA of NBTXR3 in soft tissue sarcoma  showed the potential survival benefit as a monotherapy in head and neck cancer  replicated the high response rate across multiple cancer types  and reported data suggesting the potential to combine with and expand the benefits of checkpoint inhibitors to more patients  we remain steadfast in our conviction that NBTXR3 has the potential to radically impact the future of cancer care for millions of patients ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder and chairman of the executive board of Nanobiotix. “To ensure this fundamental value as we continue to see unprecedented deterioration in the capital markets  we are taking proactive steps to adjust our cost structure  reduce spend  and focus our operational activities on building a head and neck franchise. We believe that by beginning with single agent approval in locally advanced head and neck cancer and expanding through combinations across treatment modalities will create a model that can be replicated across solid tumor indications  improving patient outcomes and driving significant value to shareholders.”Prioritizing Registration Programs and Reducing Operating ExpensesNanobiotix is pursuing various initiatives to reduce operating costs while maintaining targeted research efforts focused on the continued execution of its pivotal phase III study in LA-HNSCC  the continuation of I/O combination Study 1100  and the development of a registration pathway in I/O combination therapy while leveraging its on-going strategic collaboration with MD Anderson to validate the feasibility of future development opportunities. In prioritizing late-stage programs and strategic collaborations  the company plans to deprioritize direct funding in several areas  including:Modifying or postponing additional company-sponsored clinical trials   including planned amendments to Study 102 reducing follow-up time from 24 to 12 months and postponement of post-marketing studies previously planned in soft tissue sarcoma  including planned amendments to Study 102 reducing follow-up time from 24 to 12 months and postponement of post-marketing studies previously planned in soft tissue sarcoma Reducing on-going and previously planned preclinical research   including development activities related to the Company’s subsidiary  Curadigm  including development activities related to the Company’s subsidiary  Curadigm Adjusting planned manufacturing activities to support revised preclinical and clinical development activitiesAdapting infrastructure  including reducing satellite office facilities and implementing a temporary hiring-freezeThese initiatives are expected to reduce the Company’s cash burn by approximately €12-15 million  which will be reflected in Nanobiotix’ financial outlook for 2022 and 2023.First Quarter Financial UpdatesNanobiotix reported cash  cash equivalents  and short-term investments totaling €70.6 million as of March 31  2022  compared to €83.9M as of December 31  2021. To supplement its financial resources  Nanobiotix has established an equity financing line with Kepler Cheuvreux. This line of financing will provide optionality and create near-term flexibility  if needed  as the company continues efforts to reduce operating expenses and  potentially  restructure its existing debt facilities. Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  Nanobiotix anticipates that the available capital will fund its operations into  at least  the fourth quarter of 2023.Implementing Equity Line Financing to Strengthen Financial FlexibilityIn accordance with the terms of this agreement  Kepler Cheuvreux committed to underwrite up to 5 200 000 shares representing  for information purposes  an issued amount of approximately €25m1  over a maximum timeframe of 24 months  provided the contractual conditions are met. Should Nanobiotix choose to use this facility  the shares will be issued based on the volume-weighted average share price on Euronext: Paris for the two trading days prior to issuance  minus a maximum discount 5.0%. In addition to controlling if and when to access capital  including consideration of current share valuation  Nanobiotix has guaranteed access to capital to fund operations along with control over potential dilution despite any sustained turbulence in the broader market  while retaining the right to suspend the implementation of the equity line or terminate this agreement at any time  free of charge.Agreements have been set up based on and in accordance with the 21st resolution from the annual shareholders meeting of April 28  2021. Should Nanobiotix choose to use this facility  the number of shares issued under this agreement and admitted to trading will be disclosed on the Company’s website. In accordance with the provisions of the General Regulations of the French Financial Markets Authority (“AMF”)  this financial operation will not be subject to a prospectus requiring a visa from the AMF.If this financing line were to be fully used with the issue of 5 200 000 shares  a shareholder holding 1.00% of the capital of Nanobiotix before it is set up  would see their stake reduced to 0.87% of the capital on an undiluted basis and to 0.84% of the capital on a fully diluted basis.This operation was advised and structured by Vester Finance. Kepler Cheuvreux is the sole underwriter of the facility and is not expected to maintain ownership of any shares issued in conjunction with the equity line.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday  May 19  2022  at 2:00 PM CET/8:00 AM EDT  prior to the open of the US market.

The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company is leveraging its proprietary nanoparticle platform  including its lead product candidate  radiotherapy activated NBTXR3  to develop a pipeline of therapeutic options designed to enhance local and systemic control of solid tumors with an initial focus on the treatment of head and neck cancers.For more information about Nanobiotix  visit us at www.nanobiotix.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.DisclaimerThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws  including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

With environmental challenges now a growing  global concern  Thales  the leader in high tech security  has developed solutions for a greener world  recently certified by Mastercard’s Sustainable Card Program. To date  Thales has deployed 30 million eco-friendly payment cards for banks and card issuers that address consumer concerns without compromising the user experience.All eco-friendly cards offered by Thales are made with innovative and sustainable components. For example  one solution is a card made from 85% PLA (polylactic acid)  which is produced from corn. Another innovative approach reduces the amount of new plastic while fighting sea pollution  with a card made of Ocean Plastic® collected by Parley for the Oceans. This innovative material comes from plastic waste collected from coastal clean-up operations  in partnership with “Parley for the Oceans”. Banks can also reduce their first-use plastic with a recycled PVC card that is made entirely with plastic waste from the packaging and printing industries.Thales not only works to minimise the carbon footprint of all its products and services but also offers a carbon offset program to make the cards carbon neutral.By assessing sustainability claims on behalf of the industry  the Mastercard Sustainable Card Program aims to pivot all card selection programs towards eco-friendly solutions  making sustainable choice the norm rather than the exception. This certification demonstrates that Thales solutions have an environmental advantage that is meaningful  verified and sustainable.“A year ago  Findomestic became a pioneer BNP Paribas Personal Finance branch by adopting Thales eco-friendly cards made of PLA  with the goal of removing the use of PVC cards by 2024. This was a significant step to illustrate our commitment to social and environmental responsibility. This common environmental awareness shared with Thales enables us to deliver to our customers secure solutions that are respectful of the environment”. Donatella Ciambellotti  Card Development Officer at Findomestic“The time is right to combine sustainability with the latest payment solutions by focusing on Reduction and Compensation. Indeed  Thales sustainable products and services cover every aspect of a bank card's life. Moving away from plastics isn’t simple when embedding sophisticated technology in the card  such as the contactless chip and antenna. But we are committed to finding new eco-friendly solutions for our customers and making them proud to do business with a responsible and sustainable player.” Sylvie Gibert  VP Payment Cards at Thales.1 Eco-friendly credit cards (2022 update) (thalesgroup.com)About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies  investing in digital and “deep tech” innovations – connectivity  big data  artificial intelligence  cybersecurity and quantum technologies – to build a confident future crucial for the development of our societies.

World's Worry Amid Record Prices,Consumed daily by billions of people around the world in bread and other flour-based products  wheat is a basic food staple  making current record prices for the cereal a global concern.,"Global Wheat Prices: Wheat is the most important cereal for global food security.Consumed daily by billions of people around the world in bread and other flour-based products  wheat is a basic food staple  making current record prices for the cereal a global concern.Low rainfall or droughts in major producing countries were already causing worries before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February sent markets soaring.Since then  wheat-exporting powerhouse Ukraine has struggled to sell and sow its crops  putting consumers in poor countries at risk of poverty and even famineSebastien Abis  head of the Demeter agricultural think tank in Paris and an expert at the Institute for International and Strategic Relations  explains what's at stake:Is it possible to replace wheat with something else?""It's very difficult. Wheat is the most important cereal for global food security: it is eaten by billions of humans in the form of bread  flour or semolina.""Corn is grown in larger quantities but is mostly used for animal feed or for industrial purposes.""Beyond its nutritional qualities  wheat is a very social and democratic product  enabling people to make low-cost food -- and it is often subsidised.""- But prices are putting it beyond the reach of consumers in some countries such as Lebanon or Yemen? -""Yes  because of shortages and because you can't produce it just anywhere. You can grow it in temperate climates  but there are only a dozen countries that produce a lot and can export it  particularly Russia  Ukraine  the United States  Australia.""In recent years  the United States has produced less and less because they are switching to corn and soya . After the Soviet period  the two countries that surged ahead were Ukraine and Russia.""Ukraine accounted for 12-13 percent of global exports in recent years.""- Is the lack of Ukrainian production the reason for the current situation? -""We have at the same time a dreadful geopolitical situation  with multilateralism faltering  to which we must add worrying climatic events  with droughts in the southern Mediterranean basin  worries in the United States and in Europe.""India  which had an exceptional harvest last year and reserves that enabled it to sell more on the markets  has been hit with a terrible drought and will not be able to export.""Prices that were already high before the war are now exploding: wheat reached 440 euros ($463) a tonne on the Euronext market on Monday.""- That came after India announced it would no longer export wheat. Why? -""India had announced a rather ambitious target of exporting 10 million tonnes. It had sold around 3-3.5 million tonnes before it put its export ban in place  so one of the questions is whether it will honour its commitments.""The situation is tense because there's no country that can put more than usual into the export market. Perhaps Russia will if it has a good harvest.""But even if the war stopped  Ukraine's production and exports will not bounce back immediately.""- Have we reached the peak of the crisis  ahead of the harvests in the US and Europe this summer?""We have real long-term risks. We still haven't seen all the shocks  because on global markets for the last two months we've been seeing fulfilments of contracts signed before the Russian invasion. We're now entering the hard part.""What about stocks?""For wheat  we have around 270 million tonnes for a planet that consumes around 800 million a year. Around half are in China which has one year's consumption in reserve. Excluding China  cereal stocks are at their lowest level in 25 years.""We need international solidarity and cooperation. We can't leave countries to struggle on their own for food security but at the same time you can't be surprised that some countries are looking out for themselves first and foremost.""We need to produce everywhere where we can produce  notably in Africa. But for that we need peace and security"".(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",negative,0.03,0.13,0.84,mixed,0.07,0.17,0.75,True,English,"['Record Prices', 'Wheat', 'World', 'Demeter agricultural think tank', 'other flour-based products', 'worrying climatic events', 'southern Mediterranean basin', 'real long-term risks', 'basic food staple', 'last two months', 'dreadful geopolitical situation', 'major producing countries', 'a dozen countries', '3-3.5 million tonnes', 'current record prices', 'global food security', 'Global Wheat Prices', '10 million tonnes', '270 million tonnes', 'low-cost food', 'global concern', 'current situation', 'two countries', 'Low rainfall', 'wheat-exporting powerhouse', 'Sebastien Abis', 'Strategic Relations', 'larger quantities', 'animal feed', 'industrial purposes', 'nutritional qualities', 'democratic product', 'temperate climates', 'United States', 'Soviet period', '12-13 percent', 'global exports', 'same time', 'exceptional harvest', 'terrible drought', 'Euronext market', 'ambitious target', 'export ban', 'export market', 'good harvest', 'hard part', 'one year', 'lowest level', 'NDTV staff', 'syndicated feed', 'poor countries', 'global markets', 'important cereal', 'recent years', 'Ukrainian production', 'Russian invasion', 'international solidarity', 'cereal stocks', '25 years', 'billions', 'people', 'world', 'bread', 'droughts', 'worries', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'crops', 'consumers', 'poverty', 'famine', 'head', 'Paris', 'expert', 'Institute', 'stake', 'something', 'humans', 'form', 'semolina', 'Corn', 'social', 'reach', 'Lebanon', 'Yemen', 'shortages', 'lot', 'Australia', 'soya', 'lack', 'reason', 'multilateralism', 'Europe', 'India', 'reserves', 'war', '440 euros', 'Monday', 'place', 'questions', 'commitments', 'country', 'peak', 'crisis', 'harvests', 'shocks', 'fulfilments', 'contracts', 'planet', 'half', 'China', 'consumption', 'cooperation', 'Africa', 'peace', 'story']",2022-05-18,2022-05-18,ndtv.com

The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in volumes and prices  was more than offset by the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the mine operations and by a less favorable mix on Oil & Gas International markets.Sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A) at €85 million or 9.3% of revenue (versus 11.0% in Q1 2021) increasing by 10.4%.The normalized level of EBITDA is approximately €130 million. The adjustment refers predominantly to the operations of the iron ore mine.Operating income was negative at €(17) million  compared to €27 million in Q1 2021  resulting mainly from lower EBITDA.Financial income was negative at €(13) million  compared with €(82) million in Q1 2021  reflecting the new balance sheet structure and non-recurring financial expenses in Q1 2021.Income tax expense was €(3) million compared to €(40) million in Q1 2021 reflecting the temporary curtailment of the iron ore mine operations.This resulted in a negative net income  Group share  of €(35) million  compared to €(93) million in Q1 2021.III CASH FLOW & FINANCIAL POSITIONCash flow from operating activitiesIn Q1 2022  cash flow from operating activities was positive at €21 million  compared to €13 million in Q1 2021; the improvement reflected mainly financial expenses  as well as income tax paid.Operating working capital requirementIn Q1 2022  operating working capital requirement increased by €(217) million  versus an increase of €(47) million in Q1 2021  reflecting higher forward volume expectations and raw-material price increases. The net working capital requirement  excluding the impact of IFRS 5  stood at 125 days of sales  compared to 104 days in Q1 2021.CapexCapital expenditure was €(34) million in Q1 2022  compared with €(28) million in Q1 2021.Free cash flowAs a result  in Q1 2022  free cash flow was negative at €(230) million versus €(62) million in Q1 2021.Asset disposals & other itemsIn Q1 2022  asset disposals & other items amounted to €(25) million  compared with €(89) million in Q1 2021.Net debt and liquidityAs of March 31  2022  net debt stood at €1 213 million  compared with €958 million on December 31  2021. As of March 31  2022  gross debt amounted to €1 606 million including €86 million of fair value adjustment under IFRS 9 (which will be reversed over the life of the debt). Long-term debt amounted to €1 383 million and short-term debt totaled €223 million.As of March 31  2022  lease debt stood at €50 million following the application of IFRS 5 standards  compared with €48 million on December 31  2021.The liquidity position was strong at €855 million  with cash amounting to €393 million and an undrawn committed Revolving Credit Facility of €462 million.IV UPDATE ON MINEOn January 8  2022  following the exceptionally heavy rainfall in Minas Gerais State (Brazil)  some material from the waste pile associated with the operations of Vallourec’s Pau Branco mine slid into a rainwater dam (“the Lisa Dam”) causing it to overflow  and resulting in the interruption of traffic on the nearby highway. The structure of the dam was not affected  and there were no casualties. As a result of this incident  the operations of the mine have been temporarily suspended.On May 4  2022  Vallourec partially restarted operations  after having obtained the approval of the mining authorities to resume activities for a period of three months without using the waste pile. Under these temporary conditions  Vallourec is targeting a progressive ramp-up from 70% to full capacity.In parallel  Vallourec is continuing to prepare for a return to normal operations  subject to the validation of the stability of the waste pile by the mining and state environmental authorities.V SUPPORTIVE MARKET ENVIRONMENTAfter several years of underinvestment  a global increase in Exploration and Production (E&P) capital spending is forecasted  driven notably by the tight OCTG market environment in North America. According to IHS Markit data  E&P drilling capex forecasts have been revised upwards by $173 billion in aggregate between the projections made in March 2021 and those issued a year later for the 2022-2025 period.Drilling activity is increasing again globally  with the current rig count up 63% from its Covid-19 trough. This situation reflects a tight OCTG market  particularly in North America  which benefits from a strong price environment. The Middle East region is also seeing high activity  particularly in the UAE and Iraq. North Africa is showing strong growth in its region while market conditions are remaining solid in South America.There nevertheless remains substantially more potential for further volume growth  with current rig count at only 78% of pre-Covid levels.OCTG prices are also recovering on the back of the restart of global demand and the increase of raw-material and energy prices.VI LOOKING AHEAD FOR A NEW VALLOUREC1. Pursue footprint reshapingLaunch closure process of German sitesIn November 2021  Vallourec decided to launch the disposal process of all its German manufacturing assets in order to find a new operator  better positioned to profitably serve the European Industry markets. The disposal process has been carried out and no credible buyer has been identified. As a result  Vallourec is launching the closure process of its German assets which will result in a 685kt reduction in less competitive rolling capacity.The closure process will take place over the next two years and will include the sale of the land and buildings.German rolling activity for Oil & Gas relocated to BrazilThis transfer will require €110 million of capex in our Brazilian operations to support the transition of premium tubular volumes from Europe by end 2023.Impact of the closure of German assets on the other European assetsThe closure of the German assets implies a further rationalization of the other European assets which were finishing tubes rolled in Germany.This rationalization will entail the consolidation of all European threading activities in a single location in Aulnoye in France. The Group will launch the closure process of the heat treatment line of Saint-Saulve in France and of the threading line in Bellshill in Scotland. In addition  Vallourec will complete the divestiture of Vallourec Bearing Tubes.Research & DevelopmentAulnoye Competence Center will lead ‘one R&D’ organization.The completion of this footprint reshape will allow Vallourec to benefit from a lower-cost manufacturing base capable of serving worldwide O&G markets. This reorganization is targeted to generate €130 million of run-rate EBITDA and a €20 million capex reduction. The associated headcount reduction2 should be approximatively 2 400The implementation of these measures is subject to consultation of the employee representatives.2. Streamline corporate structure to better manage a reshaped industrial footprint and a leaner organizationIn addition to the reshape of Vallourec’s footprint  the Group has launched a comprehensive program aiming to streamline global overheads in-line with its new manufacturing footprint  representing a major step to lower the break-even point and create a cycle-proof company that is free cash flow-positive at the bottom of the cycle.These measures encompass the following:A leaner organization in all regions (North America  South America and Eastern Hemisphere): the Group will move its main manufacturing base to Americas.Lower overheads and central costs: the Group will further downsize the headquarter functions which will be primarily focused on strategy and expertise.Higher productivity: the Group will implement process automation for all transactional processes and will consolidate support functions in larger Shared Services Centers to leverage the Company’s scale.Focus on value-creating projects: selective approach to R&D and IT projects with careful return on investment parameters and interface with a broader strategic vision. The Group will create one global R&D organization securing consistency and focusing resources on key strategic developments.Support functions close to production sites: the Group targets to locate more than 50% of its support functions in the Americas. The Industrial support will be located in production sites.With this initiative  the Group aims to generate €100 million of additional run-rate EBITDA. The associated headcount reduction3 should be approximatively 550The implementation of these measures is subject to consultation of the employee representatives.Combined  these initiatives will reduce CO2 emissions (the CO2 content of a tube produced in Brazil is 30% lower than of a tube produced in Germany) and lead to €230 million of recurring EBITDA and €250 million ongoing cash up-lift. The execution is expected to be finalized in Q1 2024Preparing the future low-carbon economyAppointment of Ulrika WisingOn May 2  2022  Vallourec announced the appointment of Ulrika Wising as Senior Vice President Energy Transition. Ulrika has a solid energy transition and corporate development background. She reports to Philippe Guillemot and will play a key role in Vallourec's ongoing transformation. She will strengthen the focus and commitments to energy transition and will be responsible for accelerating and developing new profitable business opportunities for the Group.A committed player with a clear roadmapIn 2020  Vallourec announced its ambition to reduce its direct and indirect carbon emissions by 2025  taking 2017 as baseline year. These objectives were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)  and Vallourec became the first company in the Oil & Gas sector to obtain this recognition4. The Group  which is already a low emitter of greenhouse gases  is committed to:reducing its direct emissions by 20% (Scopes 1 & 2);reducing both direct and indirect emissions by 25% (Scopes 1  2 & 3).In December 2021  Vallourec announced that it was again part of the ""A List"" compiled by the CDP. This accomplishment serves as a recognition for the Company's transparency and leadership on climate issues.Concretely  in terms of ton of CO2 emitted to produce a tube  Vallourec is clearly a best-in-class actor. The Group consumes 1.796 ton of CO2 per ton of tube produced versus 2 tons on average for peers5.Investment in Closed Loop Geothermal Company GreenFire EnergyOn May 3  2022  Vallourec announced an investment in GreenFire Energy Inc.  an American start-up developing Advanced Geothermal Systems based on its innovative technology called GreenFire’s GreenLoop™. This transaction was carried out alongside other major investors  Baker Hughes and Helmerich & Payne.Vallourec and GreenFire Energy have been working together since 2019 on several successful Closed- Loop Geothermal demonstrators in various fields. Vallourec THERMOCASE® Vacuum Insulated Tubing (VIT) is a key enabler of closed loop geothermal systems: these thermally insulated pipes allow the harvesting of underground heat and bring it to the surface (as hot water or steam) with minimal losses. Thanks to its leading edge in VIT with its THERMOCASE® product range  Vallourec will be able to support GFE by designing and manufacturing bespoke solutions for their downhole heat exchanger. While conventional geothermal systems rely on the exploitation of geothermal resources in very specific areas  Advanced Geothermal Systems – such as the one developed by GreenFire Energy - could unlock the possibility of producing energy virtually anywhere.New steps in the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Hydrogen fieldsFor the injection of super critical CO2 into carbon storage wells  VAM Top® connections have been tested for specific conditions requiring low temperature (-80°C) and a very sudden temperature drop under severe loading conditions  with full-scale samples. This has been validated by customers including Oil & Gas technology leaders.Due to the small size and low viscosity of the molecule  hydrogen is known to be a difficult gas to contain. Vallourec is the first company to have tested and validated full leak-tightness of the VAM® 21 connection with 100% hydrogen content up to 560 bar that are even more stringent than those required for future storage wells.VII 2022 OUTLOOKOil & GasIn North America  the very favorable market conditions should continue and even improve in H2 2022  in both price and volume terms.In EA-MEA  volumes are expected to significantly recover from Q2 onward; cost increases to be passed on to customers.In South America  volumes are expected to increase leading to margin increase throughout the year.Industry & OtherIn Europe  prices are expected to increase to fully offset cost inflation.In Brazil  volumes are expected to increase slightly  with price increases fully offsetting cost inflation. Vallourec has partially restarted mining operations  while H2 activity depends on validation of waste pile stability by the authorities. FY 2022 consensus estimates for iron ore average prices c.$130/MT6.Based on these market trends and assumptions  particularly related to the operations of the iron ore mine  EBITDA is now expected to increase significantly for FY 2022 compared to prior year.OtherCapex is expected to be slightly above €200 million  including approximately €50 million for the preparation of the transfer of operations from Germany to Brazil.Information and Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release may include forward-looking statements.

Wheat is the most important cereal for global food security: it is eaten by billions of humans in the form of bread  flour or semolina.""Corn is grown in larger quantities but is mostly used for animal feed or for industrial purposes.""Beyond its nutritional qualities  wheat is a very social and democratic product  enabling people to make low-cost food -- and it is often subsidised.""""Yes  because of shortages and because you can't produce it just anywhere. You can grow it in temperate climates  but there are only a dozen countries that produce a lot and can export it  particularly Russia  Ukraine  the United States   Australia.""In recent years  the United States has produced less and less because they are switching to corn and soya . After the Soviet period  the two countries that surged ahead were Ukraine and Russia.""Ukraine accounted for 12-13 percent of global exports in recent years.""""We have at the same time a dreadful geopolitical situation  with multilateralism faltering  to which we must add worrying climatic events  with droughts in the southern Mediterranean basin   worries in the United States and in Europe.""India  which had an exceptional harvest last year and reserves that enabled it to sell more on the markets  has been hit with a terrible drought and will not be able to export.""Prices that were already high before the war are now exploding: wheat reached 440 euros ($463) a tonne on the Euronext market on Monday.""""India had announced a rather ambitious target of exporting 10 million tonnes. It had sold around 3-3.5 million tonnes before it put its export ban in place  so one of the questions is whether it will honour its commitments.""The situation is tense because there's no country that can put more than usual into the export market. Perhaps Russia will if it has a good harvest.""But even if the war stopped  Ukraine's production and exports will not bounce back immediately.""Have we reached the peak of the crisis  ahead of the harvests in the US and Europe this summer?""We have real long-term risks. We still haven't seen all the shocks  because on global markets for the last two months we've been seeing fulfilments of contracts signed before the Russian invasion. We're now entering the hard part.""""For wheat  we have around 270 million tonnes for a planet that consumes around 800 million a year. Around half are in China which has one year's consumption in reserve. Excluding China  cereal stocks are at their lowest level in 25 years.""We need international solidarity and cooperation. We can't leave countries to struggle on their own for food security but at the same time you can't be surprised that some countries are looking out for themselves first and foremost.""We need to produce everywhere where we can produce  notably in Africa.

Euronext (OTCPK:EUXTF)  along with London Stock Exchange Group (OTCPK:LDNXF  OTCPK:LNSTY)  was our top pick for a more volatile environment. After the Russian invasion and the subsequent market turmoil  we decide to reiterate our positive view on Euronext based on:Better than expected synergies from the Borsa Italiana Group integration; Italian IPO acceleration; Strong cash flow has led to a DPS increase at €1.93 per share.Q1 ResultsAt the cost of being repetitive  once again we were looking in the right direction.Euronext Q1 ResultsBorsa Italiana's integration into Euronext continues and drives the positive results within the company's quarterly report. The group which brings together the lists of Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Oslo  Paris  and Milan  delivered revenues of €395.7 million  an increase of 58.8% for Q1 2022. This was a record quarter. In a pro forma comparison (the Italian stock exchange was only consolidated for eight months in the previous year)  this increase was 6%. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter grew by 66.8% reaching €252.2 million and 11.4% on a pro forma basis  thanks to volume growth combined with cost discipline. As a consequence  net profit increased by 50.3% to €164.4 million  accompanied by a 7.3% increase in adjusted earnings per share to €1.54.Euronext Q1 Results (Q1 Press Release)Euronext has updated the guidance on costs for 2022  which now foresees €10 million less in underlying costs (for a total of 612 million) and €10 million less in implementation costs (now €150 million).Euronext Cost Synergy Update (Q1 Results)In the first three months  as we were forecasting (using the VIX as a proxy)  revenue growth is linked to trading  with exchanges ""above average"" confirmed by the CFO Giorgio Modica and further explained as ""driven by the high volatility"" recorded on the markets. In April  the average value of cash transactions was up by 5.7% compared to the same period last year. The first quarter was marked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine  but ""Euronext's business model has remained resilient"" added CEO Boujnah  Confirming also that ""our Russian exposure in Ukraine is negligible"".ConclusionThe company confirms its commitment to pursuing a successful integration while maintaining constant cost discipline. In this regard  the data center migration from Basildon to Bergamo was confirmed. Connectivity tests with customers have confirmed that Euronext is on track to start the migration as planned.Regarding the valuation and based on the recent results  we adjusted synergy improvements and we maintain our buy rating valuing the entity with a P/E based on FY2023(E) of 16x arriving at a new value of €100 per share (previously €98 per share)  implying a 29% upside for an anticyclical company  without taking into account a dividend yield of 2%.If you are interested in our previous articles on European stock exchanges  please have a look at our recent publications:",neutral,0.04,0.58,0.38,mixed,0.33,0.21,0.46,True,English,"['Euronext Stock', 'A Diamond', 'Volatile Environment', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'Borsa Italiana Group integration', 'Euronext Cost Synergy Update', 'Italian stock exchange', 'subsequent market turmoil', 'Italian IPO acceleration', 'pro forma comparison', 'pro forma basis', 'CFO Giorgio Modica', 'Strong cash flow', 'European stock exchanges', 'Q1 Press Release', 'constant cost discipline', 'data center migration', 'first three months', 'Euronext Q1 Results', 'synergy improvements', 'eight months', 'cash transactions', 'first quarter', 'successful integration', 'positive results', 'recent results', 'Getty Images', 'top pick', 'volatile environment', 'Russian invasion', 'positive view', 'right direction', 'quarterly report', 'record quarter', 'previous year', 'volume growth', 'net profit', 'revenue growth', 'high volatility', 'average value', 'same period', 'business model', 'CEO Boujnah', 'Russian exposure', 'Connectivity tests', 'buy rating', 'FY2023(E', 'new value', 'dividend yield', 'previous articles', 'recent publications', 'OTCPK:LDNXF', 'OTCPK:LNSTY', 'underlying costs', 'implementation costs', 'adjusted earnings', '+6% price increase', 'DPS increase', 'anticyclical company', '7.3% increase', 'kuk/E+', 'EUXTF', 'synergies', 'share', 'lists', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Dublin', 'Lisbon', 'Oslo', 'Milan', 'revenues', 'EBITDA', 'consequence', 'guidance', 'total', 'VIX', 'proxy', 'trading', 'markets', 'April', 'Ukraine', 'Conclusion', 'commitment', 'regard', 'Basildon', 'Bergamo', 'customers', 'track', 'valuation', 'entity', 'P/E', '16x', '29% upside', 'account', 'look']",2022-05-18,2022-05-18,seekingalpha.com

Having already provided clinical validation of the novel  physics-based MoA of NBTXR3 in soft tissue sarcoma  showed the potential survival benefit as a monotherapy in head and neck cancer  replicated the high response rate across multiple cancer types  and reported data suggesting the potential to combine with and expand the benefits of checkpoint inhibitors to more patients  we remain steadfast in our conviction that NBTXR3 has the potential to radically impact the future of cancer care for millions of patients ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder and chairman of the executive board of Nanobiotix. “To ensure this fundamental value as we continue to see unprecedented deterioration in the capital markets  we are taking proactive steps to adjust our cost structure  reduce spend  and focus our operational activities on building a head and neck franchise. We believe that by beginning with single agent approval in locally advanced head and neck cancer and expanding through combinations across treatment modalities will create a model that can be replicated across solid tumor indications  improving patient outcomes and driving significant value to shareholders.”ADVERTISEMENTPrioritizing Registration Programs and Reducing Operating ExpensesNanobiotix is pursuing various initiatives to reduce operating costs while maintaining targeted research efforts focused on the continued execution of its pivotal phase III study in LA-HNSCC  the continuation of I/O combination Study 1100  and the development of a registration pathway in I/O combination therapy while leveraging its on-going strategic collaboration with MD Anderson to validate the feasibility of future development opportunities. In prioritizing late-stage programs and strategic collaborations  the company plans to deprioritize direct funding in several areas  including:ADVERTISEMENTModifying or postponing additional company-sponsored clinical trials   including planned amendments to Study 102 reducing follow-up time from 24 to 12 months and postponement of post-marketing studies previously planned in soft tissue sarcomaReducing on-going and previously planned preclinical research   including development activities related to the Company’s subsidiary  CuradigmAdjusting planned manufacturing activities to support revised preclinical and clinical development activitiesAdapting infrastructure   including reducing satellite office facilities and implementing a temporary hiring-freezeThese initiatives are expected to reduce the Company’s cash burn by approximately €12-15 million  which will be reflected in Nanobiotix’ financial outlook for 2022 and 2023.First Quarter Financial UpdatesNanobiotix reported cash  cash equivalents  and short-term investments totaling €70.6 million as of March 31  2022  compared to €83.9M as of December 31  2021. To supplement its financial resources  Nanobiotix has established an equity financing line with Kepler Cheuvreux. This line of financing will provide optionality and create near-term flexibility  if needed  as the company continues efforts to reduce operating expenses and  potentially  restructure its existing debt facilities. Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  Nanobiotix anticipates that the available capital will fund its operations into  at least  the fourth quarter of 2023.ADVERTISEMENTImplementing Equity Line Financing to Strengthen Financial FlexibilityIn accordance with the terms of this agreement  Kepler Cheuvreux committed to underwrite up to 5 200 000 shares representing  for information purposes  an issued amount of approximately €25m 1  over a maximum timeframe of 24 months  provided the contractual conditions are met. Should Nanobiotix choose to use this facility  the shares will be issued based on the volume-weighted average share price on Euronext: Paris for the two trading days prior to issuance  minus a maximum discount 5.0%. In addition to controlling if and when to access capital  including consideration of current share valuation  Nanobiotix has guaranteed access to capital to fund operations along with control over potential dilution despite any sustained turbulence in the broader market  while retaining the right to suspend the implementation of the equity line or terminate this agreement at any time  free of charge.Agreements have been set up based on and in accordance with the 21 st resolution from the annual shareholders meeting of April 28  2021. Should Nanobiotix choose to use this facility  the number of shares issued under this agreement and admitted to trading will be disclosed on the Company’s website. In accordance with the provisions of the General Regulations of the French Financial Markets Authority (“AMF”)  this financial operation will not be subject to a prospectus requiring a visa from the AMF.If this financing line were to be fully used with the issue of 5 200 000 shares  a shareholder holding 1.00% of the capital of Nanobiotix before it is set up  would see their stake reduced to 0.87% of the capital on an undiluted basis and to 0.84% of the capital on a fully diluted basis.This operation was advised and structured by Vester Finance. Kepler Cheuvreux is the sole underwriter of the facility and is not expected to maintain ownership of any shares issued in conjunction with the equity line.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday  May 19  2022  at 2:00 PM CET/8:00 AM EDT  prior to the open of the US market.

The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company is leveraging its proprietary nanoparticle platform  including its lead product candidate  radiotherapy activated NBTXR3  to develop a pipeline of therapeutic options designed to enhance local and systemic control of solid tumors with an initial focus on the treatment of head and neck cancers.For more information about Nanobiotix  visit us at www.nanobiotix.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter .DisclaimerThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws  including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This payment has been recognized over the expected development period with an impact of EUR 115K in 2021 and EUR 86K in 2022.Net Cash PositionThe Company had a cash position of EUR 25.3 million as of March 31  2022  compared to EUR 15.2 million as of December 31  2021. The increase in cash is explained by the sale of the building in March 2022  which resulted in a net cash inflow of 18.9 million Euro. Cash consumption from operations in Q1 2022 amounted to 8.8 million euro  slightly higher than last year (7.8 million euro)  on a comparable basis (excluding financing transactions).Net financial debt (excluding IFRS 16 impacts and derivative debts) amounted to EUR 25.4 million as of March 31  2022  compared with EUR 33.3 million as of December 31  2021. The decrease is mainly due to (i) the early repayment of loans (EUR -4.2 million) linked to the building sale  (ii) the conversion of the OCA 1023 bonds at the end of March 2022 (EUR -2.5 million) and (iii) the repayment of the IPF loan (EUR -0.9 million Euro).Corporate UpdateBioChaperone® LisproAdocia's partner in China  Tonghua Dongbao  is currently conducting its pivotal Phase III program with BioChaperone Lispro. The investigating centers were opened during the first quarter. This clinical program enrolls more than 1 300 people with Type 1 and T2 diabetes recruited in more than 100 centers across China. All of these studies are funded by Tonghua Dongbao  which has an exclusive license to produce and market the product in China and other Asian territories. Upon completion of the Phase 3 clinical program  BioChaperone Lispro dossier is expected to be submitted to the China Drug Agency for marketing approval.On May 9  2022  Tonghua Dongbao and Adocia announced the recruitment and dosing of the first patient. This milestone triggered a payment of $5 million which will be accounted in Q2 2022.BioChaperone® ComboTonghua Dongbao and Adocia have initiated 3 clinical trials in Europe (CT046 - 47 and 48) with BioChaperone Combo.
