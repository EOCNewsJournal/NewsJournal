In Asia  market conditions normalized and conditions improved in Europe and the US during the quarter. However  it remains difficult to say how the pandemic will affect the coming quarters with any great certainty.SIGNIFICANT events AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODIn April  Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital placed an order for RayStation  thereby becoming RaySearch's first customer in Hong Kong within the proton therapy segment.In April  Seoul National University Hospital placed an order for RayStation.In April  Mevion China placed an order for RayStation  which it sold together with Mevion's proton therapy system to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan in China.In May  RaySearch entered into an agreement with GE Healthcare to develop a new radiation therapy simulation and treatment planning workflow solution.In May  RayCare was taken into clinical use with Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system at Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland.CFO Torbjörn Wingårdh left RaySearchStory continuesfinancial SUMMARY1AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s JAN-MAR APR 2021- FULL-YEAR2022 2021 MAR 2022 2021 Net sales 208 149 162 102 687 720 641 673 Operating profit/loss 29 564 12 261 -36 038 -53 341 Operating margin  % 14.2 7.6 -5.2 -8.3 Profit/loss for the period 19 298 7 110 -35 127 -47 315 Earnings/loss per share before/after dilution  SEK 0.56 0.21 -1.02 -1.38 Cash flow from operating activities 125 787 104 332 259 617 238 162 Cash flow for the period 35 320 32 840 -69 223 -71 703 Return on equity  % 2.9 1.0 -5.3 -7.3 Equity/assets ratio  %  at the end of the period 38.9 52.7 38.9 37.3 Share price at the end of the period  SEK 51.7 89.5 51.7 56.51 For definitions of key ratios  see page 20.HIGHEST EVER FIRST QUARTER SALESThe pandemic had a negative impact on our sales  but we could see clear signs of a recovery already in the fourth quarter of 2021 and are delighted to note that this positive trend has continued. During the year's first quarter  we witnessed an increase in order intake of 88 percent compared with the year-on-year period and RaySearch's sales were at the highest ever level for a first quarter  SEK 208 M. In addition  EBIT totaled SEK 30 M  representing an operating margin of 14 percent. We also had more opportunities to meet customers face-to-face as travel restrictions were lifted in many countries. The positive signals are in line with our expectations and I am optimistic about a stabilization in market conditions and a return to normal circumstances  even though the pandemic is not yet completely behind us.A few days ago  we returned from one of our industry's main trade fairs  ESTRO  which was a highly positive experience. There was a palpable energy among the many visitors to our booth and great interest in our products  with many demonstrations and a large number of fruitful partnership discussions.NEW ORDERS STRENGTHEN LEADING POSITION IN PROTON MARKETTreatment planning for particle treatments (protons/carbon ions/BNCT) is an important focus area for RaySearch and today RayStation has a global market share of more than 60 percent. This position was also strengthened by several important orders  including from Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital  Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) and Proton International Arkansas. Another important order  though not in proton therapy  was from Charles-Le Moyne in Canada. The hospital's cancer clinic has used RayStation since 2018 and has now ordered additional licenses as well as upgrades to the system.We have seen a sharp increase in interest for RayCare. In addition to that fact that RayCare is seen as a next generation oncology information system  this was mainly driven by three factors. The first is the positive feedback provided by reference customers  such as Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland and UZ Leuven in Belgium. Furthermore  we can see that RaySearch's strong offering in proton therapy – which has given us a market-leading position – means new  potential proton customers look upon RayCare as an attractive alternative. Lastly  we expect to see increased interest when it becomes possible to connect RayCare to Varian's TrueBeam later in the year. We believe most interest in acquiring RayCare will be shown by centers with treatment machines from several different manufacturers.RAYCOMMAND IN CLINICAL USEAn important milestone was reached in April when RaySearch's latest product  RayCommand  was taken into clinical use for the first time  which occurred at MedAustron in Austria. MedAustron has used RayStation for some time to plan carbon ion therapy  which is the most advanced form of radiation therapy. RaySearch and MedAustron have had a unique and close cooperation for several years in the development of RayCommand and it is very gratifying to see how this has now resulted in a new and innovative product. Earlier this spring  MedAustron also took RayCare into clinical use and therefore became the first center in the world to use the three systems – RayStation  RayCare and RayCommand – together to treat patients. The RayCommand treatment delivery system serves as a link between the treatment machine  RayStation and RayCare and also coordinates and orchestrates the other systems at the center  such as imaging systems  beam delivery systems and the patient positioning systems.Another key milestone after the end of the quarter was that Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland treated its first patient using Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system together with RayStation and RayCare. In addition to these two extraordinary events  product development is progressing according to plan for all products and RayStation and RayCare are both in the final phase ahead of their half-year launches in June.WELL POSITIONED FOR GROWTHThe cost-saving program initiated in autumn 2021 is continuing and we can see a clear reduction in costs for travel and events as well as a slight decrease in personnel costs as a result of the continued recruitment freeze. Given all of the positive signals from the market  I am optimistic about the future. Concurrently  I am retaining a realistic view of business  well aware of the fact that we have yet to fully leave the pandemic behind us. We will therefore continue along the route we have set  focusing on sales  product development and cost control. With this strategy  combined with improving market conditions  a quarter with strong figures and an order backlog that once again achieved a new peak (SEK 1 489 M)  we have an solid foundation for a return to growth during the year.Stockholm  May 18  2022Johan LöfCEO and founderFinancial informationRaySearch operates in a market with uneven order flows where large individual orders can have a substantial impact on revenue recognition between the quarters and  because the company has limited (less than 10 percent) variable costs for license revenue  operating profit is affected by an amount that is nearly as high. For this reason  a longer perspective than a few quarters should be taken.order intake and order backlogIn the first quarter of 2022  order intake rose 87.8 percent year-on-year to SEK 272.5 M (145.1). License order intake increased 68.5 percent to SEK 131.4 M (78.0) while order intake for support increased 128.8 percent to SEK 111.2 M (48.6).Order intake (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Licenses 131.4 170.9 46.2 55.6 78.0404.1 350.7 Hardware 24.1 35.7 7.9 9.3 12.177.0 65.0 Support (incl. warranty support) 111.2 130.7 69.1 116.6 48.6427.6 365.0 Training and other 5.8 7.7 4.7 8.2 6.526.4 27.1 Total order intake 272.5 345.0 127.9 189.8 145.1935.1 807.8Order backlog (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Licenses 184.1 176.6 105.3 115.0 129.6Hardware 74.2 66.2 38.4 36.9 48.5Support (incl. warranty support) 1 159.9 1 053.3 1 009.2 1 001.7 974.2Training and other 70.5 66.8 59.5 59.9 54.8Total order backlog at the end of the period 1 488.7 1 362.9 1 212.4 1 213.4 1 207.1At March 31  2022  the total order backlog was SEK 1 488.7 M (1 207.1)  which is expected to generate revenue of approximately SEK 422 M over the next 12 months. The remaining amount in the order backlog mainly pertains to support obligations  which are primarily expected to generate revenue over a subsequent four-year period.RevenueIn the first quarter of 2022  net sales rose 28.4 percent year-on-year to SEK 208.1 M (162.1). The change was attributable to higher license sales  which rose 35.2 percent to SEK 111.7 M (82.6). The increase in net sales at unchanged currencies was 15.9 percent (-14.2).Support revenue rose 23.8 percent to SEK 76.6 M (61.9)  accounting for 36.8 percent (38.2) of net sales during the first quarter. Hardware sales  which have a limited profit margin  rose 7.8 percent to SEK 16.6 M (15.4). Excluding hardware  sales rose 30.6 percent year-on-year.Revenue (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 License revenue 111.7 105.5 55.7 63.4 82.6336.2 307.1 Hardware revenue 16.6 9.2 7.1 19.8 15.452.7 51.5 Support revenue 76.6 71.8 67.3 67.5 61.9283.2 268.5 Training and other revenue 3.2 2.1 6.4 3.9 2.115.6 14.5 Net sales 208.1 188.6 136.4 154.6 162.1687.7 641.7 Change in sales  corresp. period  % 28.4 17.6 14.5 -5.6 -22.413.7 -1.6 Change in organic sales  corresp. period  % 15.9 22.0 11.9 4.5 -14.213.2 1.6In the first quarter of 2022  net sales had the following geographic distribution: North America  39 percent (36); Asia  29 percent (26); Europe and the rest of the world  32 percent (38).Operating profitIn the first quarter of 2022  operating profit totaled SEK 29.6 M (12.3)  representing an operating margin of 14.2 percent (7.6). The earnings improvement was largely attributable to higher license revenue.In the first quarter  operating expenses increased 19.2 percent to SEK 178.6 M (149.8). The change was largely due to increased administrative costs.In the first quarter  the net of exchange gains and losses amounted to SEK 4.9 M (10.0) since a large proportion of the Group's receivables are denominated in USD and EUR  which strengthened against the SEK in the first quarter compared with the end of the fourth quarter. Adjusted for these currency translation effects  operating profit would have totaled SEK 24.7 M (2.3) in the first quarter and operating expenses would have increased 14.8 percent (-11.1).Currency effectsConsolidated sales and earnings are impacted by USD/EUR to SEK exchange rates  since most sales are invoiced in USD and EUR  while most costs are denominated in SEK.At unchanged exchange rates  the change in sales was 15.9 percent in the first quarter of 2022  compared with the year-earlier period. In addition  the Group's exchange gains on balance sheet items amounted to SEK 4.4 M (10.0) in the first quarter. Currency effects therefore had a positive impact on net sales and operating profit in the first quarter 2022.A sensitivity analysis of the Group's currency exposure shows that a 1-percentage point change in the USD exchange rate against the SEK would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 2.6 M in the first quarter of 2022  while a corresponding change in the EUR exchange rate would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 1.4 M.The Group follows the financial policy established by the Board  whereby exchange-rate fluctuations are not hedged.Capitalization of development costsRaySearch is a research and development-oriented company that makes significant investments in the development of software solutions for improved cancer treatment. At March 31  2022  some 199 employees (210) were engaged in research and development  corresponding to 50 percent (51) of the total number of employees.Capitalization of development costs Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Research and development costs 64.3 79.1 57.9 68.0 64.9269.4 270.0 Capitalization of development costs -52.4 -59.3 -40.0 -52.5 -51.5-204.1 -203.3 Amortization of capitalized development costs 45.0 44.1 43.2 40.1 39.2172.5 166.7 Research and development costs 57.0 63.9 61.2 55.7 52.6237.8 233.4In 2022  RaySearch continued to invest in both existing products and future products. Overall  research and development costs decreased 1 percent to SEK 64.3 M (64.9) in the first quarter of 2022  corresponding to 31 percent (40) of the Group's net sales.Development costs of SEK 52.4 M (51.5) were capitalized  up 1.7 percent  corresponding to 81 percent (79) of total research and development costs.Amortization of capitalized development costs rose 14.7 percent to SEK 45.0 M (39.2)  and the increase was attributable to an expansion of development activities  and that amortization periods had commenced for all products  including RayCommand and RayIntelligence.Research and development costs (after adjustments for capitalization and amortization of development costs) rose 8.2 percent to SEK 57.0 M (52.6).Amortization and depreciationIn the first quarter of 2022  total amortization and depreciation rose 19.8 percent to SEK 70.0 M (58.3)  of which amortization of intangible fixed assets accounted for SEK 45.0 M (39.3)  mainly related to capitalized development costs. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 25.0 M (19.1).profit and earnings per shareIn the first quarter of 2022  profit after tax was SEK 19.3 M (7.1)  corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 0.56 (0.21) before and after dilution.Tax expense for the quarter was SEK -6.9 M (-4.3)  corresponding to an effective tax rate of 26.2 percent (37.5).Cash flow and liquidityIn the first quarter of 2022  cash flow from operating activities was SEK 125.8 M (104.3) and the change was largely attributable to a decrease in working capital  which mainly comprises various types of receivables from customers  such as accounts receivable and current and long-term unbilled customer receivables where payment plans have been drawn up.At the end of the period  the company's total customer receivables amounted to 46 percent (56) of net sales over the past 12 months.Working capital amounted to 2 percent (5) of net sales over the past 12 months.In the first quarter  cash flow from investing activities was SEK -60.6 M (-60.3). Investments in intangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -52.4 M (-51.5) and consisted of capitalized development costs for the company's products – RayStation  RayCare  RayCommand and RayIntelligence. Investments in tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -8.2 M (-8.8)  mainly related to investments in the head office in Stockholm.Cash flow from financing activities was SEK -29.9 M (-11.2) for the first quarter of 2022. The change was largely due to a bank overdraft of SEK 21 M drawn in the first quarter.Cash flow for the first quarter amounted to SEK 35.3 M (32.8). At March 31  2022  consolidated cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 139.8 M (205.2).Financial positionAt March 31  2022  RaySearch's total assets amounted to SEK 1 722 M (1 334) and the equity/assets ratio was 38.9 percent (52.7). The change in total assets and the equity/assets ratio was largely attributable to an increase in right-of-use assets related to rented premises following the granting of access to the new head office premises.Current receivables amounted to SEK 376.7 M (414.3). The receivables mainly comprise various types of customer receivables.RaySearch's credit facility comprises a revolving loan facility of up to SEK 150 M that matures in March 2025 and an overdraft facility of SEK 50 M the matures in December 2022. Chattel mortgages amounted to SEK 100 M. At March 31  2022  a short-term loan of SEK 0 M (50) was raised under the company's revolving loan facility and SEK 0 M (0) of the credit facility had been drawn.At March 31  2022  the Group's net debt amounted to SEK 397.0 M (-66.0). The change was largely due to an increase in lease liabilities following the granting of access to the new head office premises during the fourth quarter.EMPLOYEESAt the end of the first quarter  the Group had 389 (413) employees  of whom 284 (310) were based in Sweden  and 105 (102) in foreign subsidiaries.PARENT COMPANYRaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is the Parent Company of the RaySearch Group. Since the Parent Company's operations are consistent with the Group's operations in all material respects  the comments for the Group are also largely relevant for the Parent Company.Differences in profitability between the Parent Company and the Group are attributable to the Parent Company accounting for a relatively high proportion of operating expenses  and to the capitalization of development costs being recognized in the Group but not in the Parent Company. The Parent Company was also not affected by the changes pertaining to lease recognition under IFRS 16  and instead continues to recognize lease payments as operating lease payments. This reduces operating profit compared with if IFRS 16 had been applied.The Parent Company's current receivables mainly comprise receivables from Group companies and external customers.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTERAgreement signed with Proton International ArkansasIn January  RaySearch signed an agreement with Proton International Arkansas to provide RayStation at the UAMS Radiation Oncology Center. The center will open in 2023 and be the first proton center in the state of Arkansas. The center at UAMS brings RaySearch's presence in proton therapy to thirty centers in the United States  a large majority of operating facilities.Agreement with Charles-Le Moyne in CanadaIn February  Montérégie Integrated Cancer Center (CICM)  which is part of the Charles-Le Moyne hospital in Longueuil in Quebec in Canada  placed an order for additional RayStation licenses as well as upgrades to the system which includes advanced treatment planning functionality.SIGNIFICANT events AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODAgreement with Hong Kong Sanatorium & HospitalIn April  Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital placed an order for RayStation as treatment planning system for its proton therapy center. The hospital thereby became RaySearch's first customer in Hong Kong within the proton therapy segment.Agreement with Seoul National University HospitalIn April  Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) placed an order for RayStation. SNUH is the second carbon ion center in Korea to select RaySearch  the first customer was Yonsei Cancer Center in Seoul.Agreement with Mevion ChinaIn April  Mevion China placed an order for RayStation  which it sold together with Mevion's proton therapy system to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan in China. RaySearch and Mevion have been collaborating since 2014. Treatment planning for particle treatments (protons/carbon ions/BNCT) is an important focus area for RaySearch and today RayStation has a global market share of more than 60 percent  a position that is further strengthened by the new order.Agreement with GE HealthcareIn May  RaySearch entered into an agreement with GE Healthcare to develop a new radiation therapy simulation and treatment planning workflow solution designed to make use of the latest advancements in treatment planning technology. The companies aim to combine RaySearch's advanced treatment planning system RayStation with GE Healthcare's leading multi-modality (CT/MR/molecular imaging) simulator systems to make cancer treatment faster and more precise.RayCare taken into clinical use with CyberKnife at Swiss Medical Network in SwitzerlandIn May  RayCare was taken into clinical use with Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system at La Clinique Générale-Beaulieu  a part of Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland. The center became first in the world to treat a patient using RayCare and CyberKnife.Management changeTorbjörn Wingårdh stepped down as CFO of RaySearch on April 4  2022.Effects of the COVID-19 pandemicEven though the pandemic is over in most countries  the effects of it remain a challenge for many operations. RaySearch is monitoring the situation closely and is prepared to take new action and align the company's operations if needed.Effects on RaySearch's operations in the first quarter of 2022Sales. The negative effect of the pandemic on RaySearch's sales appears to be weakening as the pandemic subsides. In Asia  market conditions normalized and conditions improved in Europe and the US during the quarter.Delivery capacity. As a software company  RaySearch is well equipped for remote collaboration and both our R&D and delivery capacity have remained relatively unscathed by the COVID-19 pandemic to date.In the first quarter  COVID-19 did not have any major impact on the company's assessment items.Expected future effectsIt is still difficult to say how the ongoing pandemic will affect the coming quarters with any great certainty. The situation has normalized in most countries  though a few countries have registered rising case numbers.The company believes the underlying need and demand for effective software solutions for cancer care is in the process of returning to pre-pandemic levels. Since sales activities have been restricted for some time  however  it may take time before the full sales effect is regained. We see no major challenges in terms of R&D or the company's delivery capacity. The company will continue to focus on protecting the company's cash flow and liquidity.Increased focus on efficiencies and digitization. One effect of the COVID-19 pandemic could be a further acceleration of the ongoing digital transformation. The pandemic has drastically highlighted the major potential and benefits of digital technology  which could be positive for RaySearch's operations in the long term because the company's software solutions enable cancer clinics to improve their efficiency.The company's shareAt March 31  2022  the total number of registered shares in RaySearch was 34 282 773  of which 8 454 975 were Class A and 25 827 798 Class B shares.

For more information about risks and risk management  refer to pages 39-41 of RaySearch's 2021 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes with any impact on the risks reported. This also applies to the risks and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that could affect RaySearch's sales  earnings and financial position.Seasonal variationsRaySearch's customers are healthcare providers and the company's operations are somewhat characterized by seasonal variations that are typical for the industry  whereby the fourth quarter is normally the strongest – mainly because many customers have budgets that follow the calendar year.Environment and sustainabilitySustainability is a key aspect of RaySearch's strategy and operations  and the company is working actively to become a sustainable enterprise. The primary aim of RaySearch's operations is to help cancer clinics improve and save the lives of cancer patients. Through innovative software solutions  the company is continuously striving to improve and streamline workflows in clinical environments and to improve treatment outcomes for cancer patients. The customer value created presents business opportunities for RaySearch  but also major social benefit and economic gains.The negative environmental impact of the company's products is limited. The company's environmental impact is mainly related to the purchase of goods and services  energy use and transportation. RaySearch aims to contribute to sustainable development and therefore works actively to improve the company's environmental performance wherever this is economically viable. More information about the company's environmental and sustainability initiatives is available in the company's Sustainability Report on pages 22-28 of RaySearch's 2021 Annual Report.REVIEWThis interim report has not been reviewed by the company's auditors.The Board of Directors and CEO give their assurance that this interim report gives a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations  position and earnings  and describes the significant risks and uncertainties facing the Parent Company and the companies included in the Group.Stockholm  May 18  2022The Board of Directors of RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ)Lars Wollung Chairman of the Board Johan Löf CEO and Board member Carl Filip Bergendal Board member Britta Wallgren Board member Hans Wigzell Board member Johanna Öberg Board memberFOR FURTHER INFORMATION  PLEASE CONTACT:Johan Löf  CEO Tel: +46 (0)8 510 530 00 johan.lof@raysearchlabs.comBjörn Hårdemark Interim CFO Tel: +46 (0)70 95 642 17 bjorn.hardemark@raysearchlabs.comThe information contained in this interim report is such that RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is obliged to disclose under the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Swedish Securities Market Act.

During the year's first quarter  we witnessed an increase in order intake of 88 percent compared with the year-on-year period and RaySearch's sales were at the highest ever level for a first quarter  SEK 208 M. In addition  EBIT totaled SEK 30 M  representing an operating margin of 14 percent. We also had more opportunities to meet customers face-to-face as travel restrictions were lifted in many countries. The positive signals are in line with our expectations and I am optimistic about a stabilization in market conditions and a return to normal circumstances  even though the pandemic is not yet completely behind us.A few days ago  we returned from one of our industry's main trade fairs  ESTRO  which was a highly positive experience. There was a palpable energy among the many visitors to our booth and great interest in our products  with many demonstrations and a large number of fruitful partnership discussions.NEW ORDERS STRENGTHEN LEADING POSITION IN PROTON MARKETTreatment planning for particle treatments (protons/carbon ions/BNCT) is an important focus area for RaySearch and today RayStation has a global market share of more than 60 percent. This position was also strengthened by several important orders  including from Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital  Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) and Proton International Arkansas. Another important order  though not in proton therapy  was from Charles-Le Moyne in Canada. The hospital's cancer clinic has used RayStation since 2018 and has now ordered additional licenses as well as upgrades to the system.We have seen a sharp increase in interest for RayCare. In addition to that fact that RayCare is seen as a next generation oncology information system  this was mainly driven by three factors. The first is the positive feedback provided by reference customers  such as Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland and UZ Leuven in Belgium. Furthermore  we can see that RaySearch's strong offering in proton therapy – which has given us a market-leading position – means new  potential proton customers look upon RayCare as an attractive alternative. Lastly  we expect to see increased interest when it becomes possible to connect RayCare to Varian's TrueBeam later in the year. We believe most interest in acquiring RayCare will be shown by centers with treatment machines from several different manufacturers.RAYCOMMAND IN CLINICAL USEAn important milestone was reached in April when RaySearch's latest product  RayCommand  was taken into clinical use for the first time  which occurred at MedAustron in Austria. MedAustron has used RayStation for some time to plan carbon ion therapy  which is the most advanced form of radiation therapy. RaySearch and MedAustron have had a unique and close cooperation for several years in the development of RayCommand and it is very gratifying to see how this has now resulted in a new and innovative product. Earlier this spring  MedAustron also took RayCare into clinical use and therefore became the first center in the world to use the three systems – RayStation  RayCare and RayCommand – together to treat patients. The RayCommand treatment delivery system serves as a link between the treatment machine  RayStation and RayCare and also coordinates and orchestrates the other systems at the center  such as imaging systems  beam delivery systems and the patient positioning systems.Another key milestone after the end of the quarter was that Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland treated its first patient using Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system together with RayStation and RayCare. In addition to these two extraordinary events  product development is progressing according to plan for all products and RayStation and RayCare are both in the final phase ahead of their half-year launches in June.WELL POSITIONED FOR GROWTHThe cost-saving program initiated in autumn 2021 is continuing and we can see a clear reduction in costs for travel and events as well as a slight decrease in personnel costs as a result of the continued recruitment freeze. Given all of the positive signals from the market  I am optimistic about the future. Concurrently  I am retaining a realistic view of business  well aware of the fact that we have yet to fully leave the pandemic behind us. We will therefore continue along the route we have set  focusing on sales  product development and cost control. With this strategy  combined with improving market conditions  a quarter with strong figures and an order backlog that once again achieved a new peak (SEK 1 489 M)  we have an solid foundation for a return to growth during the year.Stockholm  May 18  2022Johan LöfCEO and founderFinancial informationRaySearch operates in a market with uneven order flows where large individual orders can have a substantial impact on revenue recognition between the quarters and  because the company has limited (less than 10 percent) variable costs for license revenue  operating profit is affected by an amount that is nearly as high. For this reason  a longer perspective than a few quarters should be taken.order intake and order backlogIn the first quarter of 2022  order intake rose 87.8 percent year-on-year to SEK 272.5 M (145.1). License order intake increased 68.5 percent to SEK 131.4 M (78.0) while order intake for support increased 128.8 percent to SEK 111.2 M (48.6).Order intake (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Licenses 131.4 170.9 46.2 55.6 78.0404.1 350.7 Hardware 24.1 35.7 7.9 9.3 12.177.0 65.0 Support (incl. warranty support) 111.2 130.7 69.1 116.6 48.6427.6 365.0 Training and other 5.8 7.7 4.7 8.2 6.526.4 27.1 Total order intake 272.5 345.0 127.9 189.8 145.1935.1 807.8Order backlog (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Licenses 184.1 176.6 105.3 115.0 129.6Hardware 74.2 66.2 38.4 36.9 48.5Support (incl. warranty support) 1 159.9 1 053.3 1 009.2 1 001.7 974.2Training and other 70.5 66.8 59.5 59.9 54.8Total order backlog at the end of the period 1 488.7 1 362.9 1 212.4 1 213.4 1 207.1At March 31  2022  the total order backlog was SEK 1 488.7 M (1 207.1)  which is expected to generate revenue of approximately SEK 422 M over the next 12 months. The remaining amount in the order backlog mainly pertains to support obligations  which are primarily expected to generate revenue over a subsequent four-year period.RevenueIn the first quarter of 2022  net sales rose 28.4 percent year-on-year to SEK 208.1 M (162.1). The change was attributable to higher license sales  which rose 35.2 percent to SEK 111.7 M (82.6). The increase in net sales at unchanged currencies was 15.9 percent (-14.2).Support revenue rose 23.8 percent to SEK 76.6 M (61.9)  accounting for 36.8 percent (38.2) of net sales during the first quarter. Hardware sales  which have a limited profit margin  rose 7.8 percent to SEK 16.6 M (15.4). Excluding hardware  sales rose 30.6 percent year-on-year.Revenue (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 License revenue 111.7 105.5 55.7 63.4 82.6336.2 307.1 Hardware revenue 16.6 9.2 7.1 19.8 15.452.7 51.5 Support revenue 76.6 71.8 67.3 67.5 61.9283.2 268.5 Training and other revenue 3.2 2.1 6.4 3.9 2.115.6 14.5 Net sales 208.1 188.6 136.4 154.6 162.1687.7 641.7 Change in sales  corresp. period  % 28.4 17.6 14.5 -5.6 -22.413.7 -1.6 Change in organic sales  corresp. period  % 15.9 22.0 11.9 4.5 -14.213.2 1.6In the first quarter of 2022  net sales had the following geographic distribution: North America  39 percent (36); Asia  29 percent (26); Europe and the rest of the world  32 percent (38).Operating profitIn the first quarter of 2022  operating profit totaled SEK 29.6 M (12.3)  representing an operating margin of 14.2 percent (7.6). The earnings improvement was largely attributable to higher license revenue.In the first quarter  operating expenses increased 19.2 percent to SEK 178.6 M (149.8). The change was largely due to increased administrative costs.In the first quarter  the net of exchange gains and losses amounted to SEK 4.9 M (10.0) since a large proportion of the Group's receivables are denominated in USD and EUR  which strengthened against the SEK in the first quarter compared with the end of the fourth quarter. Adjusted for these currency translation effects  operating profit would have totaled SEK 24.7 M (2.3) in the first quarter and operating expenses would have increased 14.8 percent (-11.1).Currency effectsConsolidated sales and earnings are impacted by USD/EUR to SEK exchange rates  since most sales are invoiced in USD and EUR  while most costs are denominated in SEK.At unchanged exchange rates  the change in sales was 15.9 percent in the first quarter of 2022  compared with the year-earlier period. In addition  the Group's exchange gains on balance sheet items amounted to SEK 4.4 M (10.0) in the first quarter. Currency effects therefore had a positive impact on net sales and operating profit in the first quarter 2022.A sensitivity analysis of the Group's currency exposure shows that a 1-percentage point change in the USD exchange rate against the SEK would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 2.6 M in the first quarter of 2022  while a corresponding change in the EUR exchange rate would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 1.4 M.The Group follows the financial policy established by the Board  whereby exchange-rate fluctuations are not hedged.Capitalization of development costsRaySearch is a research and development-oriented company that makes significant investments in the development of software solutions for improved cancer treatment. At March 31  2022  some 199 employees (210) were engaged in research and development  corresponding to 50 percent (51) of the total number of employees.Capitalization of development costs Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Research and development costs 64.3 79.1 57.9 68.0 64.9269.4 270.0 Capitalization of development costs -52.4 -59.3 -40.0 -52.5 -51.5-204.1 -203.3 Amortization of capitalized development costs 45.0 44.1 43.2 40.1 39.2172.5 166.7 Research and development costs 57.0 63.9 61.2 55.7 52.6237.8 233.4In 2022  RaySearch continued to invest in both existing products and future products. Overall  research and development costs decreased 1 percent to SEK 64.3 M (64.9) in the first quarter of 2022  corresponding to 31 percent (40) of the Group's net sales.Development costs of SEK 52.4 M (51.5) were capitalized  up 1.7 percent  corresponding to 81 percent (79) of total research and development costs.Amortization of capitalized development costs rose 14.7 percent to SEK 45.0 M (39.2)  and the increase was attributable to an expansion of development activities  and that amortization periods had commenced for all products  including RayCommand and RayIntelligence.Research and development costs (after adjustments for capitalization and amortization of development costs) rose 8.2 percent to SEK 57.0 M (52.6).Amortization and depreciationIn the first quarter of 2022  total amortization and depreciation rose 19.8 percent to SEK 70.0 M (58.3)  of which amortization of intangible fixed assets accounted for SEK 45.0 M (39.3)  mainly related to capitalized development costs. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 25.0 M (19.1).profit and earnings per shareIn the first quarter of 2022  profit after tax was SEK 19.3 M (7.1)  corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 0.56 (0.21) before and after dilution.Tax expense for the quarter was SEK -6.9 M (-4.3)  corresponding to an effective tax rate of 26.2 percent (37.5).Cash flow and liquidityIn the first quarter of 2022  cash flow from operating activities was SEK 125.8 M (104.3) and the change was largely attributable to a decrease in working capital  which mainly comprises various types of receivables from customers  such as accounts receivable and current and long-term unbilled customer receivables where payment plans have been drawn up.At the end of the period  the company's total customer receivables amounted to 46 percent (56) of net sales over the past 12 months.Working capital amounted to 2 percent (5) of net sales over the past 12 months.In the first quarter  cash flow from investing activities was SEK -60.6 M (-60.3). Investments in intangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -52.4 M (-51.5) and consisted of capitalized development costs for the company's products – RayStation  RayCare  RayCommand and RayIntelligence. Investments in tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -8.2 M (-8.8)  mainly related to investments in the head office in Stockholm.Cash flow from financing activities was SEK -29.9 M (-11.2) for the first quarter of 2022. The change was largely due to a bank overdraft of SEK 21 M drawn in the first quarter.Cash flow for the first quarter amounted to SEK 35.3 M (32.8). At March 31  2022  consolidated cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 139.8 M (205.2).Financial positionAt March 31  2022  RaySearch's total assets amounted to SEK 1 722 M (1 334) and the equity/assets ratio was 38.9 percent (52.7). The change in total assets and the equity/assets ratio was largely attributable to an increase in right-of-use assets related to rented premises following the granting of access to the new head office premises.Current receivables amounted to SEK 376.7 M (414.3). The receivables mainly comprise various types of customer receivables.RaySearch's credit facility comprises a revolving loan facility of up to SEK 150 M that matures in March 2025 and an overdraft facility of SEK 50 M the matures in December 2022. Chattel mortgages amounted to SEK 100 M. At March 31  2022  a short-term loan of SEK 0 M (50) was raised under the company's revolving loan facility and SEK 0 M (0) of the credit facility had been drawn.At March 31  2022  the Group's net debt amounted to SEK 397.0 M (-66.0). The change was largely due to an increase in lease liabilities following the granting of access to the new head office premises during the fourth quarter.EMPLOYEESAt the end of the first quarter  the Group had 389 (413) employees  of whom 284 (310) were based in Sweden  and 105 (102) in foreign subsidiaries.PARENT COMPANYRaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is the Parent Company of the RaySearch Group. Since the Parent Company's operations are consistent with the Group's operations in all material respects  the comments for the Group are also largely relevant for the Parent Company.Differences in profitability between the Parent Company and the Group are attributable to the Parent Company accounting for a relatively high proportion of operating expenses  and to the capitalization of development costs being recognized in the Group but not in the Parent Company. The Parent Company was also not affected by the changes pertaining to lease recognition under IFRS 16  and instead continues to recognize lease payments as operating lease payments. This reduces operating profit compared with if IFRS 16 had been applied.The Parent Company's current receivables mainly comprise receivables from Group companies and external customers.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTERAgreement signed with Proton International ArkansasIn January  RaySearch signed an agreement with Proton International Arkansas to provide RayStation at the UAMS Radiation Oncology Center. The center will open in 2023 and be the first proton center in the state of Arkansas. The center at UAMS brings RaySearch's presence in proton therapy to thirty centers in the United States  a large majority of operating facilities.Agreement with Charles-Le Moyne in CanadaIn February  Montérégie Integrated Cancer Center (CICM)  which is part of the Charles-Le Moyne hospital in Longueuil in Quebec in Canada  placed an order for additional RayStation licenses as well as upgrades to the system which includes advanced treatment planning functionality.SIGNIFICANT events AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODAgreement with Hong Kong Sanatorium & HospitalIn April  Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital placed an order for RayStation as treatment planning system for its proton therapy center. The hospital thereby became RaySearch's first customer in Hong Kong within the proton therapy segment.Agreement with Seoul National University HospitalIn April  Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) placed an order for RayStation. SNUH is the second carbon ion center in Korea to select RaySearch  the first customer was Yonsei Cancer Center in Seoul.Agreement with Mevion ChinaIn April  Mevion China placed an order for RayStation  which it sold together with Mevion's proton therapy system to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan in China. RaySearch and Mevion have been collaborating since 2014. Treatment planning for particle treatments (protons/carbon ions/BNCT) is an important focus area for RaySearch and today RayStation has a global market share of more than 60 percent  a position that is further strengthened by the new order.Agreement with GE HealthcareIn May  RaySearch entered into an agreement with GE Healthcare to develop a new radiation therapy simulation and treatment planning workflow solution designed to make use of the latest advancements in treatment planning technology. The companies aim to combine RaySearch's advanced treatment planning system RayStation with GE Healthcare's leading multi-modality (CT/MR/molecular imaging) simulator systems to make cancer treatment faster and more precise.RayCare taken into clinical use with CyberKnife at Swiss Medical Network in SwitzerlandIn May  RayCare was taken into clinical use with Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system at La Clinique Générale-Beaulieu  a part of Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland. The center became first in the world to treat a patient using RayCare and CyberKnife.Management changeTorbjörn Wingårdh stepped down as CFO of RaySearch on April 4  2022.Effects of the COVID-19 pandemicEven though the pandemic is over in most countries  the effects of it remain a challenge for many operations. RaySearch is monitoring the situation closely and is prepared to take new action and align the company's operations if needed.Effects on RaySearch's operations in the first quarter of 2022Sales. The negative effect of the pandemic on RaySearch's sales appears to be weakening as the pandemic subsides. In Asia  market conditions normalized and conditions improved in Europe and the US during the quarter.Delivery capacity. As a software company  RaySearch is well equipped for remote collaboration and both our R&D and delivery capacity have remained relatively unscathed by the COVID-19 pandemic to date.In the first quarter  COVID-19 did not have any major impact on the company's assessment items.Expected future effectsIt is still difficult to say how the ongoing pandemic will affect the coming quarters with any great certainty. The situation has normalized in most countries  though a few countries have registered rising case numbers.The company believes the underlying need and demand for effective software solutions for cancer care is in the process of returning to pre-pandemic levels. Since sales activities have been restricted for some time  however  it may take time before the full sales effect is regained. We see no major challenges in terms of R&D or the company's delivery capacity. The company will continue to focus on protecting the company's cash flow and liquidity.Increased focus on efficiencies and digitization. One effect of the COVID-19 pandemic could be a further acceleration of the ongoing digital transformation.

RaySearch's risk management aims to identify  measure and reduce risks related to the Group's transactions and operations. For more information about risks and risk management  refer to pages 39-41 of RaySearch's 2021 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes with any impact on the risks reported. This also applies to the risks and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that could affect RaySearch's sales  earnings and financial position.Seasonal variationsRaySearch's customers are healthcare providers and the company's operations are somewhat characterized by seasonal variations that are typical for the industry  whereby the fourth quarter is normally the strongest – mainly because many customers have budgets that follow the calendar year.Environment and sustainabilitySustainability is a key aspect of RaySearch's strategy and operations  and the company is working actively to become a sustainable enterprise. The primary aim of RaySearch's operations is to help cancer clinics improve and save the lives of cancer patients. Through innovative software solutions  the company is continuously striving to improve and streamline workflows in clinical environments and to improve treatment outcomes for cancer patients. The customer value created presents business opportunities for RaySearch  but also major social benefit and economic gains.The negative environmental impact of the company's products is limited. The company's environmental impact is mainly related to the purchase of goods and services  energy use and transportation. RaySearch aims to contribute to sustainable development and therefore works actively to improve the company's environmental performance wherever this is economically viable. More information about the company's environmental and sustainability initiatives is available in the company's Sustainability Report on pages 22-28 of RaySearch's 2021 Annual Report.REVIEWThis interim report has not been reviewed by the company's auditors.The Board of Directors and CEO give their assurance that this interim report gives a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations  position and earnings  and describes the significant risks and uncertainties facing the Parent Company and the companies included in the Group.Stockholm  May 18  2022The Board of Directors of RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ)Lars Wollung Chairman of the Board Johan Löf CEO and Board member Carl Filip Bergendal Board member Britta Wallgren Board member Hans Wigzell Board member Johanna Öberg Board memberFOR FURTHER INFORMATION  PLEASE CONTACT:Johan Löf  CEO Tel: +46 (0)8 510 530 00 [email protected]Björn Hårdemark Interim CFO Tel: +46 (0)70 95 642 17 [email protected]The information contained in this interim report is such that RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is obliged to disclose under the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Swedish Securities Market Act.

The accounting policies applied are consistent with those described in the 2021 Annual Report for RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ)  which is available at www.raysearchlabs.com This interim report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act.RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is the Parent Company of the RaySearch Group. The Parent Company applies the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities. The Parent Company's operations are consistent with the Group's operations in all material respects.Differences in profitability between the Parent Company and the Group are attributable to the Parent Company accounting for a relatively high proportion of operating expenses  and to the capitalization of development costs being recognized in the Group but not in the Parent Company. The Parent Company was also not affected by IFRS 16  and will continue to recognize lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This reduces operating profit compared with if IFRS 16 had been applied.The Parent Company's current receivables mainly comprise receivables from Group companies and external customers.Note 2 Revenue from contracts with customersRaySearch conducts sales of goods and services in various regions. Revenue from sales of licenses and hardware is recognized in profit or loss at a point in time  while revenue from sales of training and support is recognized over time.AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s JAN-MAR2022 2021 ChangeAPR 2021-MAR 2022 Full-year 2021 Revenue by typeLicenses 111 711 82 605 35.2%336 244 307 138 Support 76 644 61 937 23.7%283 233 268 526 Hardware 16 597 15 428 7.6%52 665 51 496 Training and other 3 197 2 132 50.0%15 578 14 513 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4%687 720 641 673Revenue by geographic marketNorth America 79 993 58 688 36.3%245 646 224 341 APAC 61 037 41 718 46.3%192 866 173 547 Europe and rest of the world 67 119 61 696 8.8%249 208 243 785 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4%687 720 641 673Revenue by date for revenue recognitionGoods/services transferred at a point in time 128 308 98 033 30.9%388 909 358 634 Services transferred over time 79 841 64 069 24.6%298 811 283 039 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4%687 720 641 673NOTE 3 EstimatesPreparation of the interim report requires that company management make estimates that affect the carrying amounts. The actual outcome could deviate from these estimates. The critical sources of uncertainty in the estimates are the same as those in the most recent Annual Report.Note 4 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSRaySearch's financial assets and liabilities comprise billed and unbilled receivables  cash and cash equivalents  accrued expenses  accounts payable  bank loans and lease liabilities. Long-term receivables and lease liabilities are discounted  while other financial assets and liabilities have short maturities. Accordingly  the fair values of all financial instruments are deemed to correspond approximately to their carrying amounts.The provision for expected credit losses is a weighted assessment of payment history  reports from external credit rating agencies and other customer-specific information. At the end of March 2022  the credit loss provision amounted to SEK 40.0 M (26.7)  corresponding to 12 percent (8) of total customer receivables. The increased credit loss provision despite lower total receivables was mainly related to a customer in the US. The Group's credit losses have historically been limited and amounted to about 0.7 percent of the company's average customer receivables over the past five years.Note 5 Related-party transactionsThere were no transactions between RaySearch and related parties with any material impact on the company's position and earnings during the period.Note 6 Pledged assets in the Group and Parent CompanyAMOUNTS IN SEK 000sMar 31  2022 Mar 31  2021Dec 31  2021 Chattel mortgages100 000 100 000100 000 Guarantees31 314 14 81531 046The year-on-year increase was largely attributable to bank guarantees issued for the new office premises.group quarterly overview2022 2021 2020 AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Order intakeTotal order intake 272 442 345 028 127 853 189 750 145 131 239 125 138 480 177 133Income statementNet sales 208 149 188 573 136 419 154 579 162 102 159 835 119 130 163 758 Change in sales  % 28.4 18.0 14.5 -5.6 -22.4 -31.8 -17.5 -13.7 Operating profit/loss 29 564 -16 578 -26 561 -22 463 12 261 -14 592 -29 477 -10 954 Operating margin  % 14.2 -8.8 -19.5 -14.5 7.6 -9.1 -24.7 -6.7 Profit/loss for the period 19 298 -15 968 -21 990 -16 467 7 110 -14 164 -26 182 -9 196 Net margin  % 9.3 -8.5 -16.1 -10.7 4.4 -8.9 -22.0 -5.6Cash flowOperating activities 125 787 28 397 47 356 58 077 104 332 51 505 78 486 135 443 Investing activities -60 551 -60 944 -45 569 -70 843 -60 275 -64 094 -45 372 -55 913 Financing activities -29 916 12 482 -11 875 -61 624 -11 217 -8 909 -11 394 -13 618 Cash flow for the period 35 320 -20 065 -10 088 -74 390 32 840 -21 498 21 720 65 912Capital structureEquity/assets ratio  % 38.9 37.3 56.7 57.8 52.7 54.0 57.0 56.2 Net debt 397 045 459 742 -52 983 -50 385 -65 952 -22 439 -31 476 206 Debt/equity ratio 0.6 0.7 -0.1 -0.1 -0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Net debt/EBITDA 1.8 2.3 -0.3 -0.3 -0.4 -0.1 -0.1 0.0Per share data  SEKEarnings/loss per share before dilution 0.56 -0.47 -0.64 -0.48 0.21 -0.41 -0.76 -0.27 Earnings/loss per share after dilution 0.56 -0.47 -0.64 -0.48 0.21 -0.41 -0.76 -0.27 Equity per share 19.52 18.94 19.38 20.00 20.49 20.25 20.71 21.48 Share price at the end of the period 51.70 56.50 61.50 87.40 89.50 82.70 87.50 86.50OtherNo. of shares before/after dilution  000s 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 Average no. of employees 399 419 418 414 412 404 399 391Group  rolling 12 monthsAMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Apr 2021- Jan 2021- Oct 2020- Jul 2020- Apr 2020- Jan 2020- Oct 2019- Jul 2019- Mar 2022 Dec 2021 Sep 2021 Jun 2021 Mar 2021 Dec 2020 Sep 2020 Jun 2020 Order intakeTotal order intake 935 073 807 762 701 859 712 486 699 868 854 755 892 846 951 160 Income statementNet sales 687 720 641 673 612 935 595 646 604 825 651 612 726 276 751 495 Operating profit/loss -36 038 -53 341 -51 355 -54 271 -42 762 -3 466 33 594 56 726 Operating margin  % -5.2 -8.3 -8.4 -9.1 -7.1 -0.5 4.6 7.5 Cash flowCash flow -69 223 -72 380 -73 136 -41 328 98 972 61 890 91 165 55 970 Cash flow adjusted for repayment of bank loans -47 955 -22 380 -23 136 8 672 98 972 61 890 91 165 55 970definitions of key ratiosThe interim report refers to a number of non-IFRS financial measures that are used to provide investors and company management with additional information to assess the company's operations. The various non-IFRS measures used to complement the IFRS financial statements are described below.Non-IFRS measures Definition Reason for using the measure Order intake The value (transaction price) of all orders received and changes to existing orders during the current period Order intake is an indicator of future revenue and thus a key figure for the management of RaySearch's operations Order backlog The value of orders at the end of the period that the company has yet to deliver and recognize as revenue  meaning remaining performance obligations.

Because the laws of some jurisdictions require certain types of purchasers to take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form  you may encounter difficulties in your ability to own  transfer or pledge beneficial interests in a global security.So long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security  we and the trustee will treat the depositary as the sole owner or holder of the debt securities for purposes of the applicable indenture. Therefore  except as set forth below  you will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in your name or to receive physical delivery of certificates representing the debt securities. Accordingly  you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and the participant in the depositary through whom you hold your beneficial interest in order to exercise any rights of a holder under the indenture. We understand that under existing practices  the depositary would act upon the instructions of a participant or authorize that participant to take any action that a holder is entitled to take.Unless stated otherwise in an accompanying prospectus supplement  you may elect to hold interests in the global securities through either DTC (in the United States) or Clearstream Banking  société anonyme   which we refer to as Clearstream  Luxembourg  or Euroclear Bank  S.A./N.V.  or its successor  as operator of the Euroclear System  which we refer to as Euroclear (outside of the United States)  if you are participants of such systems  or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. Interests held through Clearstream and Euroclear will be recorded on DTC’s books as being held by the U.S. depositary for each of Clearstream and Euroclear  which U.S. depositaries will in turn hold interests on behalf of their participants’ customers’ securities accounts.As long as the debt securities of a series are represented by the global securities  we will pay principal of and interest and premium of  if any  on those securities to or as directed by DTC as the registered holder of the global securities. Payments to DTC will be in immediately available funds by wire transfer. DTC  Clearstream  Luxembourg or Euroclear  as applicable  will credit the relevant accounts of their participants on the applicable date. Neither we nor the trustee will be responsible for making any payments to participants or customers of participants or for maintaining any records relating to the holdings of participants and their customers  and you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and its participants. If an issue of debt securities is denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar  we will make payments of principal and any interest in the foreign currency in which the debt securities are denominated or in U.S. dollars. DTC has elected to have all payments of principal and interest paid in U.S. dollars unless notified by any of its participants through which an interest in the debt securities is held that it elects  in accordance with  and to the extent permitted by  an accompanying prospectus supplement and the relevant debt security  to receive payment of principal or interest in the foreign currency. No fewer than 15 calendar days prior to the regular record date for a payment  a participant will be required to notify DTC of (a) its election to receive all  or the specified portion  of payment in the foreign currency and (b) its instructions for wire transfer of payment to a foreign currency account. DTC will notify the trustee or paying agent on or prior to the fifth business day after the regular record date for any payment of interest  and the tenth business day prior to the payment date for any payment of principal  with the amount of such payment to be received in such foreign currency and the applicable wire transfer instructions. The trustee or paying agent shall use such instructions to pay the participant directly. If DTC does not notify the trustee or paying agent  it is understood that only U.S. dollar payments are to be made in respect of the payment.We have been advised by DTC as follows:•DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities deposited with it by its participants and facilitates the settlement of transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in accounts of the participants  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations  some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC.

In Asia  market conditions normalized and conditions improved in Europe and the US during the quarter. However  it remains difficult to say how the pandemic will affect the coming quarters with any great certainty.SIGNIFICANT events AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODIn April  Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital placed an order for RayStation  thereby becoming RaySearch's first customer in Hong Kong within the proton therapy segment.In April  Seoul National University Hospital placed an order for RayStation.In April  Mevion China placed an order for RayStation  which it sold together with Mevion's proton therapy system to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan in China.In May  RaySearch entered into an agreement with GE Healthcare to develop a new radiation therapy simulation and treatment planning workflow solution.In May  RayCare was taken into clinical use with Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system at Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland.CFO Torbjörn Wingårdh left RaySearchfinancial SUMMARY1AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s JAN-MAR APR 2021- FULL-YEAR 2022 2021 MAR 2022 2021 Net sales 208 149 162 102 687 720 641 673 Operating profit/loss 29 564 12 261 -36 038 -53 341 Operating margin  % 14.2 7.6 -5.2 -8.3 Profit/loss for the period 19 298 7 110 -35 127 -47 315 Earnings/loss per share before/after dilution  SEK 0.56 0.21 -1.02 -1.38 Cash flow from operating activities 125 787 104 332 259 617 238 162 Cash flow for the period 35 320 32 840 -69 223 -71 703 Return on equity  % 2.9 1.0 -5.3 -7.3 Equity/assets ratio  %  at the end of the period 38.9 52.7 38.9 37.3 Share price at the end of the period  SEK 51.7 89.5 51.7 56.51 For definitions of key ratios  see page 20.HIGHEST EVER FIRST QUARTER SALESThe pandemic had a negative impact on our sales  but we could see clear signs of a recovery already in the fourth quarter of 2021 and are delighted to note that this positive trend has continued. During the year's first quarter  we witnessed an increase in order intake of 88 percent compared with the year-on-year period and RaySearch's sales were at the highest ever level for a first quarter  SEK 208 M. In addition  EBIT totaled SEK 30 M  representing an operating margin of 14 percent. We also had more opportunities to meet customers face-to-face as travel restrictions were lifted in many countries. The positive signals are in line with our expectations and I am optimistic about a stabilization in market conditions and a return to normal circumstances  even though the pandemic is not yet completely behind us.A few days ago  we returned from one of our industry's main trade fairs  ESTRO  which was a highly positive experience. There was a palpable energy among the many visitors to our booth and great interest in our products  with many demonstrations and a large number of fruitful partnership discussions.NEW ORDERS STRENGTHEN LEADING POSITION IN PROTON MARKETTreatment planning for particle treatments (protons/carbon ions/BNCT) is an important focus area for RaySearch and today RayStation has a global market share of more than 60 percent. This position was also strengthened by several important orders  including from Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital  Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) and Proton International Arkansas. Another important order  though not in proton therapy  was from Charles-Le Moyne in Canada. The hospital's cancer clinic has used RayStation since 2018 and has now ordered additional licenses as well as upgrades to the system.We have seen a sharp increase in interest for RayCare. In addition to that fact that RayCare is seen as a next generation oncology information system  this was mainly driven by three factors. The first is the positive feedback provided by reference customers  such as Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland and UZ Leuven in Belgium. Furthermore  we can see that RaySearch's strong offering in proton therapy – which has given us a market-leading position – means new  potential proton customers look upon RayCare as an attractive alternative. Lastly  we expect to see increased interest when it becomes possible to connect RayCare to Varian's TrueBeam later in the year. We believe most interest in acquiring RayCare will be shown by centers with treatment machines from several different manufacturers.RAYCOMMAND IN CLINICAL USEAn important milestone was reached in April when RaySearch's latest product  RayCommand  was taken into clinical use for the first time  which occurred at MedAustron in Austria. MedAustron has used RayStation for some time to plan carbon ion therapy  which is the most advanced form of radiation therapy. RaySearch and MedAustron have had a unique and close cooperation for several years in the development of RayCommand and it is very gratifying to see how this has now resulted in a new and innovative product. Earlier this spring  MedAustron also took RayCare into clinical use and therefore became the first center in the world to use the three systems – RayStation  RayCare and RayCommand – together to treat patients. The RayCommand treatment delivery system serves as a link between the treatment machine  RayStation and RayCare and also coordinates and orchestrates the other systems at the center  such as imaging systems  beam delivery systems and the patient positioning systems.Another key milestone after the end of the quarter was that Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland treated its first patient using Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system together with RayStation and RayCare. In addition to these two extraordinary events  product development is progressing according to plan for all products and RayStation and RayCare are both in the final phase ahead of their half-year launches in June.WELL POSITIONED FOR GROWTHThe cost-saving program initiated in autumn 2021 is continuing and we can see a clear reduction in costs for travel and events as well as a slight decrease in personnel costs as a result of the continued recruitment freeze. Given all of the positive signals from the market  I am optimistic about the future. Concurrently  I am retaining a realistic view of business  well aware of the fact that we have yet to fully leave the pandemic behind us. We will therefore continue along the route we have set  focusing on sales  product development and cost control. With this strategy  combined with improving market conditions  a quarter with strong figures and an order backlog that once again achieved a new peak (SEK 1 489 M)  we have an solid foundation for a return to growth during the year.Stockholm  May 18  2022Johan LöfCEO and founderFinancial informationRaySearch operates in a market with uneven order flows where large individual orders can have a substantial impact on revenue recognition between the quarters and  because the company has limited (less than 10 percent) variable costs for license revenue  operating profit is affected by an amount that is nearly as high. For this reason  a longer perspective than a few quarters should be taken.order intake and order backlogIn the first quarter of 2022  order intake rose 87.8 percent year-on-year to SEK 272.5 M (145.1). License order intake increased 68.5 percent to SEK 131.4 M (78.0) while order intake for support increased 128.8 percent to SEK 111.2 M (48.6).Order intake (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21 Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Licenses 131.4 170.9 46.2 55.6 78.0 404.1 350.7 Hardware 24.1 35.7 7.9 9.3 12.1 77.0 65.0 Support (incl. warranty support) 111.2 130.7 69.1 116.6 48.6 427.6 365.0 Training and other 5.8 7.7 4.7 8.2 6.5 26.4 27.1 Total order intake 272.5 345.0 127.9 189.8 145.1 935.1 807.8 Order backlog (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21 Licenses 184.1 176.6 105.3 115.0 129.6 Hardware 74.2 66.2 38.4 36.9 48.5 Support (incl. warranty support) 1 159.9 1 053.3 1 009.2 1 001.7 974.2 Training and other 70.5 66.8 59.5 59.9 54.8 Total order backlog at the end of the period 1 488.7 1 362.9 1 212.4 1 213.4 1 207.1At March 31  2022  the total order backlog was SEK 1 488.7 M (1 207.1)  which is expected to generate revenue of approximately SEK 422 M over the next 12 months. The remaining amount in the order backlog mainly pertains to support obligations  which are primarily expected to generate revenue over a subsequent four-year period.RevenueIn the first quarter of 2022  net sales rose 28.4 percent year-on-year to SEK 208.1 M (162.1). The change was attributable to higher license sales  which rose 35.2 percent to SEK 111.7 M (82.6). The increase in net sales at unchanged currencies was 15.9 percent (-14.2).Support revenue rose 23.8 percent to SEK 76.6 M (61.9)  accounting for 36.8 percent (38.2) of net sales during the first quarter. Hardware sales  which have a limited profit margin  rose 7.8 percent to SEK 16.6 M (15.4). Excluding hardware  sales rose 30.6 percent year-on-year.Revenue (amounts in SEK M) Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21 Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 License revenue 111.7 105.5 55.7 63.4 82.6 336.2 307.1 Hardware revenue 16.6 9.2 7.1 19.8 15.4 52.7 51.5 Support revenue 76.6 71.8 67.3 67.5 61.9 283.2 268.5 Training and other revenue 3.2 2.1 6.4 3.9 2.1 15.6 14.5 Net sales 208.1 188.6 136.4 154.6 162.1 687.7 641.7 Change in sales  corresp. period  % 28.4 17.6 14.5 -5.6 -22.4 13.7 -1.6 Change in organic sales  corresp. period  % 15.9 22.0 11.9 4.5 -14.2 13.2 1.6In the first quarter of 2022  net sales had the following geographic distribution: North America  39 percent (36); Asia  29 percent (26); Europe and the rest of the world  32 percent (38).Operating profitIn the first quarter of 2022  operating profit totaled SEK 29.6 M (12.3)  representing an operating margin of 14.2 percent (7.6). The earnings improvement was largely attributable to higher license revenue.In the first quarter  operating expenses increased 19.2 percent to SEK 178.6 M (149.8). The change was largely due to increased administrative costs.In the first quarter  the net of exchange gains and losses amounted to SEK 4.9 M (10.0) since a large proportion of the Group's receivables are denominated in USD and EUR  which strengthened against the SEK in the first quarter compared with the end of the fourth quarter. Adjusted for these currency translation effects  operating profit would have totaled SEK 24.7 M (2.3) in the first quarter and operating expenses would have increased 14.8 percent (-11.1).Currency effectsConsolidated sales and earnings are impacted by USD/EUR to SEK exchange rates  since most sales are invoiced in USD and EUR  while most costs are denominated in SEK.At unchanged exchange rates  the change in sales was 15.9 percent in the first quarter of 2022  compared with the year-earlier period. In addition  the Group's exchange gains on balance sheet items amounted to SEK 4.4 M (10.0) in the first quarter. Currency effects therefore had a positive impact on net sales and operating profit in the first quarter 2022.A sensitivity analysis of the Group's currency exposure shows that a 1-percentage point change in the USD exchange rate against the SEK would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 2.6 M in the first quarter of 2022  while a corresponding change in the EUR exchange rate would have impacted consolidated operating profit by approximately +/- SEK 1.4 M.The Group follows the financial policy established by the Board  whereby exchange-rate fluctuations are not hedged.Capitalization of development costsRaySearch is a research and development-oriented company that makes significant investments in the development of software solutions for improved cancer treatment. At March 31  2022  some 199 employees (210) were engaged in research and development  corresponding to 50 percent (51) of the total number of employees.Capitalization of development costs Q1-22 Q4-21 Q3-21 Q2-21 Q1-21 Rolling 12 months Full-year 2021 Research and development costs 64.3 79.1 57.9 68.0 64.9 269.4 270.0 Capitalization of development costs -52.4 -59.3 -40.0 -52.5 -51.5 -204.1 -203.3 Amortization of capitalized development costs 45.0 44.1 43.2 40.1 39.2 172.5 166.7 Research and development costs 57.0 63.9 61.2 55.7 52.6 237.8 233.4In 2022  RaySearch continued to invest in both existing products and future products. Overall  research and development costs decreased 1 percent to SEK 64.3 M (64.9) in the first quarter of 2022  corresponding to 31 percent (40) of the Group's net sales.Development costs of SEK 52.4 M (51.5) were capitalized  up 1.7 percent  corresponding to 81 percent (79) of total research and development costs.Amortization of capitalized development costs rose 14.7 percent to SEK 45.0 M (39.2)  and the increase was attributable to an expansion of development activities  and that amortization periods had commenced for all products  including RayCommand and RayIntelligence.Research and development costs (after adjustments for capitalization and amortization of development costs) rose 8.2 percent to SEK 57.0 M (52.6).Amortization and depreciationIn the first quarter of 2022  total amortization and depreciation rose 19.8 percent to SEK 70.0 M (58.3)  of which amortization of intangible fixed assets accounted for SEK 45.0 M (39.3)  mainly related to capitalized development costs. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 25.0 M (19.1).profit and earnings per shareIn the first quarter of 2022  profit after tax was SEK 19.3 M (7.1)  corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 0.56 (0.21) before and after dilution.Tax expense for the quarter was SEK -6.9 M (-4.3)  corresponding to an effective tax rate of 26.2 percent (37.5).Cash flow and liquidityIn the first quarter of 2022  cash flow from operating activities was SEK 125.8 M (104.3) and the change was largely attributable to a decrease in working capital  which mainly comprises various types of receivables from customers  such as accounts receivable and current and long-term unbilled customer receivables where payment plans have been drawn up.At the end of the period  the company's total customer receivables amounted to 46 percent (56) of net sales over the past 12 months.Working capital amounted to 2 percent (5) of net sales over the past 12 months.In the first quarter  cash flow from investing activities was SEK -60.6 M (-60.3). Investments in intangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -52.4 M (-51.5) and consisted of capitalized development costs for the company's products – RayStation  RayCare  RayCommand and RayIntelligence. Investments in tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK -8.2 M (-8.8)  mainly related to investments in the head office in Stockholm.Cash flow from financing activities was SEK -29.9 M (-11.2) for the first quarter of 2022. The change was largely due to a bank overdraft of SEK 21 M drawn in the first quarter.Cash flow for the first quarter amounted to SEK 35.3 M (32.8). At March 31  2022  consolidated cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 139.8 M (205.2).Financial positionAt March 31  2022  RaySearch's total assets amounted to SEK 1 722 M (1 334) and the equity/assets ratio was 38.9 percent (52.7). The change in total assets and the equity/assets ratio was largely attributable to an increase in right-of-use assets related to rented premises following the granting of access to the new head office premises.Current receivables amounted to SEK 376.7 M (414.3). The receivables mainly comprise various types of customer receivables.RaySearch's credit facility comprises a revolving loan facility of up to SEK 150 M that matures in March 2025 and an overdraft facility of SEK 50 M the matures in December 2022. Chattel mortgages amounted to SEK 100 M. At March 31  2022  a short-term loan of SEK 0 M (50) was raised under the company's revolving loan facility and SEK 0 M (0) of the credit facility had been drawn.At March 31  2022  the Group's net debt amounted to SEK 397.0 M (-66.0). The change was largely due to an increase in lease liabilities following the granting of access to the new head office premises during the fourth quarter.EMPLOYEESAt the end of the first quarter  the Group had 389 (413) employees  of whom 284 (310) were based in Sweden  and 105 (102) in foreign subsidiaries.PARENT COMPANYRaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is the Parent Company of the RaySearch Group. Since the Parent Company's operations are consistent with the Group's operations in all material respects  the comments for the Group are also largely relevant for the Parent Company.Differences in profitability between the Parent Company and the Group are attributable to the Parent Company accounting for a relatively high proportion of operating expenses  and to the capitalization of development costs being recognized in the Group but not in the Parent Company. The Parent Company was also not affected by the changes pertaining to lease recognition under IFRS 16  and instead continues to recognize lease payments as operating lease payments. This reduces operating profit compared with if IFRS 16 had been applied.The Parent Company's current receivables mainly comprise receivables from Group companies and external customers.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTERAgreement signed with Proton International ArkansasIn January  RaySearch signed an agreement with Proton International Arkansas to provide RayStation at the UAMS Radiation Oncology Center. The center will open in 2023 and be the first proton center in the state of Arkansas. The center at UAMS brings RaySearch's presence in proton therapy to thirty centers in the United States  a large majority of operating facilities.Agreement with Charles-Le Moyne in CanadaIn February  Montérégie Integrated Cancer Center (CICM)  which is part of the Charles-Le Moyne hospital in Longueuil in Quebec in Canada  placed an order for additional RayStation licenses as well as upgrades to the system which includes advanced treatment planning functionality.SIGNIFICANT events AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODAgreement with Hong Kong Sanatorium & HospitalIn April  Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital placed an order for RayStation as treatment planning system for its proton therapy center. The hospital thereby became RaySearch's first customer in Hong Kong within the proton therapy segment.Agreement with Seoul National University HospitalIn April  Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) placed an order for RayStation. SNUH is the second carbon ion center in Korea to select RaySearch  the first customer was Yonsei Cancer Center in Seoul.Agreement with Mevion ChinaIn April  Mevion China placed an order for RayStation  which it sold together with Mevion's proton therapy system to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan in China. RaySearch and Mevion have been collaborating since 2014. Treatment planning for particle treatments (protons/carbon ions/BNCT) is an important focus area for RaySearch and today RayStation has a global market share of more than 60 percent  a position that is further strengthened by the new order.Agreement with GE HealthcareIn May  RaySearch entered into an agreement with GE Healthcare to develop a new radiation therapy simulation and treatment planning workflow solution designed to make use of the latest advancements in treatment planning technology. The companies aim to combine RaySearch's advanced treatment planning system RayStation with GE Healthcare's leading multi-modality (CT/MR/molecular imaging) simulator systems to make cancer treatment faster and more precise.RayCare taken into clinical use with CyberKnife at Swiss Medical Network in SwitzerlandIn May  RayCare was taken into clinical use with Accuray's CyberKnife treatment delivery system at La Clinique Générale-Beaulieu  a part of Swiss Medical Network in Switzerland. The center became first in the world to treat a patient using RayCare and CyberKnife.Management changeTorbjörn Wingårdh stepped down as CFO of RaySearch on April 4  2022.Effects of the COVID-19 pandemicEven though the pandemic is over in most countries  the effects of it remain a challenge for many operations. RaySearch is monitoring the situation closely and is prepared to take new action and align the company's operations if needed.Effects on RaySearch's operations in the first quarter of 2022Sales. The negative effect of the pandemic on RaySearch's sales appears to be weakening as the pandemic subsides. In Asia  market conditions normalized and conditions improved in Europe and the US during the quarter.Delivery capacity. As a software company  RaySearch is well equipped for remote collaboration and both our R&D and delivery capacity have remained relatively unscathed by the COVID-19 pandemic to date.In the first quarter  COVID-19 did not have any major impact on the company's assessment items.Expected future effectsIt is still difficult to say how the ongoing pandemic will affect the coming quarters with any great certainty. The situation has normalized in most countries  though a few countries have registered rising case numbers.The company believes the underlying need and demand for effective software solutions for cancer care is in the process of returning to pre-pandemic levels. Since sales activities have been restricted for some time  however  it may take time before the full sales effect is regained. We see no major challenges in terms of R&D or the company's delivery capacity. The company will continue to focus on protecting the company's cash flow and liquidity.Increased focus on efficiencies and digitization. One effect of the COVID-19 pandemic could be a further acceleration of the ongoing digital transformation. The pandemic has drastically highlighted the major potential and benefits of digital technology  which could be positive for RaySearch's operations in the long term because the company's software solutions enable cancer clinics to improve their efficiency.The company's shareAt March 31  2022  the total number of registered shares in RaySearch was 34 282 773  of which 8 454 975 were Class A and 25 827 798 Class B shares.

RaySearch's risk management aims to identify  measure and reduce risks related to the Group's transactions and operations. For more information about risks and risk management  refer to pages 39-41 of RaySearch's 2021 Annual Report. There have been no significant changes with any impact on the risks reported. This also applies to the risks and uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic that could affect RaySearch's sales  earnings and financial position.Seasonal variationsRaySearch's customers are healthcare providers and the company's operations are somewhat characterized by seasonal variations that are typical for the industry  whereby the fourth quarter is normally the strongest – mainly because many customers have budgets that follow the calendar year.Environment and sustainabilitySustainability is a key aspect of RaySearch's strategy and operations  and the company is working actively to become a sustainable enterprise. The primary aim of RaySearch's operations is to help cancer clinics improve and save the lives of cancer patients. Through innovative software solutions  the company is continuously striving to improve and streamline workflows in clinical environments and to improve treatment outcomes for cancer patients.

The company's environmental impact is mainly related to the purchase of goods and services  energy use and transportation. RaySearch aims to contribute to sustainable development and therefore works actively to improve the company's environmental performance wherever this is economically viable.

The accounting policies applied are consistent with those described in the 2021 Annual Report for RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ)  which is available at www.raysearchlabs.com This interim report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act.RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ) is the Parent Company of the RaySearch Group. The Parent Company applies the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities. The Parent Company's operations are consistent with the Group's operations in all material respects.Differences in profitability between the Parent Company and the Group are attributable to the Parent Company accounting for a relatively high proportion of operating expenses  and to the capitalization of development costs being recognized in the Group but not in the Parent Company. The Parent Company was also not affected by IFRS 16  and will continue to recognize lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This reduces operating profit compared with if IFRS 16 had been applied.The Parent Company's current receivables mainly comprise receivables from Group companies and external customers.Note 2 Revenue from contracts with customersRaySearch conducts sales of goods and services in various regions. Revenue from sales of licenses and hardware is recognized in profit or loss at a point in time  while revenue from sales of training and support is recognized over time.AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s JAN-MAR 2022 2021 Change APR 2021-MAR 2022 Full-year 2021 Revenue by type Licenses 111 711 82 605 35.2% 336 244 307 138 Support 76 644 61 937 23.7% 283 233 268 526 Hardware 16 597 15 428 7.6% 52 665 51 496 Training and other 3 197 2 132 50.0% 15 578 14 513 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4% 687 720 641 673 Revenue by geographic market North America 79 993 58 688 36.3% 245 646 224 341 APAC 61 037 41 718 46.3% 192 866 173 547 Europe and rest of the world 67 119 61 696 8.8% 249 208 243 785 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4% 687 720 641 673 Revenue by date for revenue recognition Goods/services transferred at a point in time 128 308 98 033 30.9% 388 909 358 634 Services transferred over time 79 841 64 069 24.6% 298 811 283 039 Total revenue from contracts with customers 208 149 162 102 28.4% 687 720 641 673NOTE 3 EstimatesPreparation of the interim report requires that company management make estimates that affect the carrying amounts. The actual outcome could deviate from these estimates. The critical sources of uncertainty in the estimates are the same as those in the most recent Annual Report.Note 4 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSRaySearch's financial assets and liabilities comprise billed and unbilled receivables  cash and cash equivalents  accrued expenses  accounts payable  bank loans and lease liabilities. Long-term receivables and lease liabilities are discounted  while other financial assets and liabilities have short maturities. Accordingly  the fair values of all financial instruments are deemed to correspond approximately to their carrying amounts.The provision for expected credit losses is a weighted assessment of payment history  reports from external credit rating agencies and other customer-specific information. At the end of March 2022  the credit loss provision amounted to SEK 40.0 M (26.7)  corresponding to 12 percent (8) of total customer receivables. The increased credit loss provision despite lower total receivables was mainly related to a customer in the US. The Group's credit losses have historically been limited and amounted to about 0.7 percent of the company's average customer receivables over the past five years.Note 5 Related-party transactionsThere were no transactions between RaySearch and related parties with any material impact on the company's position and earnings during the period.Note 6 Pledged assets in the Group and Parent CompanyAMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Mar 31  2022 Mar 31  2021 Dec 31  2021 Chattel mortgages 100 000 100 000 100 000 Guarantees 31 314 14 815 31 046The year-on-year increase was largely attributable to bank guarantees issued for the new office premises.group quarterly overview2022 2021 2020 AMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Order intake Total order intake 272 442 345 028 127 853 189 750 145 131 239 125 138 480 177 133 Income statement Net sales 208 149 188 573 136 419 154 579 162 102 159 835 119 130 163 758 Change in sales  % 28.4 18.0 14.5 -5.6 -22.4 -31.8 -17.5 -13.7 Operating profit/loss 29 564 -16 578 -26 561 -22 463 12 261 -14 592 -29 477 -10 954 Operating margin  % 14.2 -8.8 -19.5 -14.5 7.6 -9.1 -24.7 -6.7 Profit/loss for the period 19 298 -15 968 -21 990 -16 467 7 110 -14 164 -26 182 -9 196 Net margin  % 9.3 -8.5 -16.1 -10.7 4.4 -8.9 -22.0 -5.6 Cash flow Operating activities 125 787 28 397 47 356 58 077 104 332 51 505 78 486 135 443 Investing activities -60 551 -60 944 -45 569 -70 843 -60 275 -64 094 -45 372 -55 913 Financing activities -29 916 12 482 -11 875 -61 624 -11 217 -8 909 -11 394 -13 618 Cash flow for the period 35 320 -20 065 -10 088 -74 390 32 840 -21 498 21 720 65 912 Capital structure Equity/assets ratio  % 38.9 37.3 56.7 57.8 52.7 54.0 57.0 56.2 Net debt 397 045 459 742 -52 983 -50 385 -65 952 -22 439 -31 476 206 Debt/equity ratio 0.6 0.7 -0.1 -0.1 -0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Net debt/EBITDA 1.8 2.3 -0.3 -0.3 -0.4 -0.1 -0.1 0.0 Per share data  SEK Earnings/loss per share before dilution 0.56 -0.47 -0.64 -0.48 0.21 -0.41 -0.76 -0.27 Earnings/loss per share after dilution 0.56 -0.47 -0.64 -0.48 0.21 -0.41 -0.76 -0.27 Equity per share 19.52 18.94 19.38 20.00 20.49 20.25 20.71 21.48 Share price at the end of the period 51.70 56.50 61.50 87.40 89.50 82.70 87.50 86.50 Other No. of shares before/after dilution  000s 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 34 282.8 Average no. of employees 399 419 418 414 412 404 399 391Group  rolling 12 monthsAMOUNTS IN SEK 000s Apr 2021- Jan 2021- Oct 2020- Jul 2020- Apr 2020- Jan 2020- Oct 2019- Jul 2019- Mar 2022 Dec 2021 Sep 2021 Jun 2021 Mar 2021 Dec 2020 Sep 2020 Jun 2020 Order intake Total order intake 935 073 807 762 701 859 712 486 699 868 854 755 892 846 951 160 Income statement Net sales 687 720 641 673 612 935 595 646 604 825 651 612 726 276 751 495 Operating profit/loss -36 038 -53 341 -51 355 -54 271 -42 762 -3 466 33 594 56 726 Operating margin  % -5.2 -8.3 -8.4 -9.1 -7.1 -0.5 4.6 7.5 Cash flow Cash flow -69 223 -72 380 -73 136 -41 328 98 972 61 890 91 165 55 970 Cash flow adjusted for repayment of bank loans -47 955 -22 380 -23 136 8 672 98 972 61 890 91 165 55 970definitions of key ratiosThe interim report refers to a number of non-IFRS financial measures that are used to provide investors and company management with additional information to assess the company's operations. The various non-IFRS measures used to complement the IFRS financial statements are described below.Non-IFRS measures Definition Reason for using the measure Order intake The value (transaction price) of all orders received and changes to existing orders during the current period Order intake is an indicator of future revenue and thus a key figure for the management of RaySearch's operations Order backlog The value of orders at the end of the period that the company has yet to deliver and recognize as revenue  meaning remaining performance obligations.

Because the laws of some jurisdictions require certain types of purchasers to take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form  you may encounter difficulties in your ability to own  transfer or pledge beneficial interests in a global security.So long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security  we and the trustee will treat the depositary as the sole owner or holder of the debt securities for purposes of the applicable indenture. Therefore  except as set forth below  you will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in your name or to receive physical delivery of certificates representing the debt securities. Accordingly  you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and the participant in the depositary through whom you hold your beneficial interest in order to exercise any rights of a holder under the indenture. We understand that under existing practices  the depositary would act upon the instructions of a participant or authorize that participant to take any action that a holder is entitled to take.Unless stated otherwise in an accompanying prospectus supplement  you may elect to hold interests in the global securities through either DTC (in the United States) or Clearstream Banking  société anonyme   which we refer to as Clearstream  Luxembourg  or Euroclear Bank  S.A./N.V.  or its successor  as operator of the Euroclear System  which we refer to as Euroclear (outside of the United States)  if you are participants of such systems  or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. Interests held through Clearstream and Euroclear will be recorded on DTC’s books as being held by the U.S. depositary for each of Clearstream and Euroclear  which U.S. depositaries will in turn hold interests on behalf of their participants’ customers’ securities accounts.As long as the debt securities of a series are represented by the global securities  we will pay principal of and interest and premium of  if any  on those securities to or as directed by DTC as the registered holder of the global securities. Payments to DTC will be in immediately available funds by wire transfer. DTC  Clearstream  Luxembourg or Euroclear  as applicable  will credit the relevant accounts of their participants on the applicable date. Neither we nor the trustee will be responsible for making any payments to participants or customers of participants or for maintaining any records relating to the holdings of participants and their customers  and you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and its participants. If an issue of debt securities is denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar  we will make payments of principal and any interest in the foreign currency in which the debt securities are denominated or in U.S. dollars. DTC has elected to have all payments of principal and interest paid in U.S. dollars unless notified by any of its participants through which an interest in the debt securities is held that it elects  in accordance with  and to the extent permitted by  an accompanying prospectus supplement and the relevant debt security  to receive payment of principal or interest in the foreign currency. No fewer than 15 calendar days prior to the regular record date for a payment  a participant will be required to notify DTC of (a) its election to receive all  or the specified portion  of payment in the foreign currency and (b) its instructions for wire transfer of payment to a foreign currency account. DTC will notify the trustee or paying agent on or prior to the fifth business day after the regular record date for any payment of interest  and the tenth business day prior to the payment date for any payment of principal  with the amount of such payment to be received in such foreign currency and the applicable wire transfer instructions. The trustee or paying agent shall use such instructions to pay the participant directly. If DTC does not notify the trustee or paying agent  it is understood that only U.S. dollar payments are to be made in respect of the payment.We have been advised by DTC as follows:•DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

Having already provided clinical validation of the novel  physics-based MoA of NBTXR3 in soft tissue sarcoma  showed the potential survival benefit as a monotherapy in head and neck cancer  replicated the high response rate across multiple cancer types  and reported data suggesting the potential to combine with and expand the benefits of checkpoint inhibitors to more patients  we remain steadfast in our conviction that NBTXR3 has the potential to radically impact the future of cancer care for millions of patients ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder and chairman of the executive board of Nanobiotix. “To ensure this fundamental value as we continue to see unprecedented deterioration in the capital markets  we are taking proactive steps to adjust our cost structure  reduce spend  and focus our operational activities on building a head and neck franchise. We believe that by beginning with single agent approval in locally advanced head and neck cancer and expanding through combinations across treatment modalities will create a model that can be replicated across solid tumor indications  improving patient outcomes and driving significant value to shareholders.”Prioritizing Registration Programs and Reducing Operating ExpensesNanobiotix is pursuing various initiatives to reduce operating costs while maintaining targeted research efforts focused on the continued execution of its pivotal phase III study in LA-HNSCC  the continuation of I/O combination Study 1100  and the development of a registration pathway in I/O combination therapy while leveraging its on-going strategic collaboration with MD Anderson to validate the feasibility of future development opportunities. In prioritizing late-stage programs and strategic collaborations  the company plans to deprioritize direct funding in several areas  including:Modifying or postponing additional company-sponsored clinical trials   including planned amendments to Study 102 reducing follow-up time from 24 to 12 months and postponement of post-marketing studies previously planned in soft tissue sarcoma  including planned amendments to Study 102 reducing follow-up time from 24 to 12 months and postponement of post-marketing studies previously planned in soft tissue sarcoma Reducing on-going and previously planned preclinical research   including development activities related to the Company’s subsidiary  Curadigm  including development activities related to the Company’s subsidiary  Curadigm Adjusting planned manufacturing activities to support revised preclinical and clinical development activitiesAdapting infrastructure  including reducing satellite office facilities and implementing a temporary hiring-freezeThese initiatives are expected to reduce the Company’s cash burn by approximately €12-15 million  which will be reflected in Nanobiotix’ financial outlook for 2022 and 2023.First Quarter Financial UpdatesNanobiotix reported cash  cash equivalents  and short-term investments totaling €70.6 million as of March 31  2022  compared to €83.9M as of December 31  2021. To supplement its financial resources  Nanobiotix has established an equity financing line with Kepler Cheuvreux. This line of financing will provide optionality and create near-term flexibility  if needed  as the company continues efforts to reduce operating expenses and  potentially  restructure its existing debt facilities. Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  Nanobiotix anticipates that the available capital will fund its operations into  at least  the fourth quarter of 2023.Implementing Equity Line Financing to Strengthen Financial FlexibilityIn accordance with the terms of this agreement  Kepler Cheuvreux committed to underwrite up to 5 200 000 shares representing  for information purposes  an issued amount of approximately €25m1  over a maximum timeframe of 24 months  provided the contractual conditions are met. Should Nanobiotix choose to use this facility  the shares will be issued based on the volume-weighted average share price on Euronext: Paris for the two trading days prior to issuance  minus a maximum discount 5.0%. In addition to controlling if and when to access capital  including consideration of current share valuation  Nanobiotix has guaranteed access to capital to fund operations along with control over potential dilution despite any sustained turbulence in the broader market  while retaining the right to suspend the implementation of the equity line or terminate this agreement at any time  free of charge.Agreements have been set up based on and in accordance with the 21st resolution from the annual shareholders meeting of April 28  2021. Should Nanobiotix choose to use this facility  the number of shares issued under this agreement and admitted to trading will be disclosed on the Company’s website. In accordance with the provisions of the General Regulations of the French Financial Markets Authority (“AMF”)  this financial operation will not be subject to a prospectus requiring a visa from the AMF.If this financing line were to be fully used with the issue of 5 200 000 shares  a shareholder holding 1.00% of the capital of Nanobiotix before it is set up  would see their stake reduced to 0.87% of the capital on an undiluted basis and to 0.84% of the capital on a fully diluted basis.This operation was advised and structured by Vester Finance. Kepler Cheuvreux is the sole underwriter of the facility and is not expected to maintain ownership of any shares issued in conjunction with the equity line.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday  May 19  2022  at 2:00 PM CET/8:00 AM EDT  prior to the open of the US market.

The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company is leveraging its proprietary nanoparticle platform  including its lead product candidate  radiotherapy activated NBTXR3  to develop a pipeline of therapeutic options designed to enhance local and systemic control of solid tumors with an initial focus on the treatment of head and neck cancers.For more information about Nanobiotix  visit us at www.nanobiotix.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.DisclaimerThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws  including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

With environmental challenges now a growing  global concern  Thales  the leader in high tech security  has developed solutions for a greener world  recently certified by Mastercard’s Sustainable Card Program. To date  Thales has deployed 30 million eco-friendly payment cards for banks and card issuers that address consumer concerns without compromising the user experience.All eco-friendly cards offered by Thales are made with innovative and sustainable components. For example  one solution is a card made from 85% PLA (polylactic acid)  which is produced from corn. Another innovative approach reduces the amount of new plastic while fighting sea pollution  with a card made of Ocean Plastic® collected by Parley for the Oceans. This innovative material comes from plastic waste collected from coastal clean-up operations  in partnership with “Parley for the Oceans”. Banks can also reduce their first-use plastic with a recycled PVC card that is made entirely with plastic waste from the packaging and printing industries.Thales not only works to minimise the carbon footprint of all its products and services but also offers a carbon offset program to make the cards carbon neutral.By assessing sustainability claims on behalf of the industry  the Mastercard Sustainable Card Program aims to pivot all card selection programs towards eco-friendly solutions  making sustainable choice the norm rather than the exception. This certification demonstrates that Thales solutions have an environmental advantage that is meaningful  verified and sustainable.“A year ago  Findomestic became a pioneer BNP Paribas Personal Finance branch by adopting Thales eco-friendly cards made of PLA  with the goal of removing the use of PVC cards by 2024. This was a significant step to illustrate our commitment to social and environmental responsibility. This common environmental awareness shared with Thales enables us to deliver to our customers secure solutions that are respectful of the environment”. Donatella Ciambellotti  Card Development Officer at Findomestic“The time is right to combine sustainability with the latest payment solutions by focusing on Reduction and Compensation. Indeed  Thales sustainable products and services cover every aspect of a bank card's life. Moving away from plastics isn’t simple when embedding sophisticated technology in the card  such as the contactless chip and antenna. But we are committed to finding new eco-friendly solutions for our customers and making them proud to do business with a responsible and sustainable player.” Sylvie Gibert  VP Payment Cards at Thales.1 Eco-friendly credit cards (2022 update) (thalesgroup.com)About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies  investing in digital and “deep tech” innovations – connectivity  big data  artificial intelligence  cybersecurity and quantum technologies – to build a confident future crucial for the development of our societies.

World's Worry Amid Record Prices,Consumed daily by billions of people around the world in bread and other flour-based products  wheat is a basic food staple  making current record prices for the cereal a global concern.,"Global Wheat Prices: Wheat is the most important cereal for global food security.Consumed daily by billions of people around the world in bread and other flour-based products  wheat is a basic food staple  making current record prices for the cereal a global concern.Low rainfall or droughts in major producing countries were already causing worries before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February sent markets soaring.Since then  wheat-exporting powerhouse Ukraine has struggled to sell and sow its crops  putting consumers in poor countries at risk of poverty and even famineSebastien Abis  head of the Demeter agricultural think tank in Paris and an expert at the Institute for International and Strategic Relations  explains what's at stake:Is it possible to replace wheat with something else?""It's very difficult. Wheat is the most important cereal for global food security: it is eaten by billions of humans in the form of bread  flour or semolina.""Corn is grown in larger quantities but is mostly used for animal feed or for industrial purposes.""Beyond its nutritional qualities  wheat is a very social and democratic product  enabling people to make low-cost food -- and it is often subsidised.""- But prices are putting it beyond the reach of consumers in some countries such as Lebanon or Yemen? -""Yes  because of shortages and because you can't produce it just anywhere. You can grow it in temperate climates  but there are only a dozen countries that produce a lot and can export it  particularly Russia  Ukraine  the United States  Australia.""In recent years  the United States has produced less and less because they are switching to corn and soya . After the Soviet period  the two countries that surged ahead were Ukraine and Russia.""Ukraine accounted for 12-13 percent of global exports in recent years.""- Is the lack of Ukrainian production the reason for the current situation? -""We have at the same time a dreadful geopolitical situation  with multilateralism faltering  to which we must add worrying climatic events  with droughts in the southern Mediterranean basin  worries in the United States and in Europe.""India  which had an exceptional harvest last year and reserves that enabled it to sell more on the markets  has been hit with a terrible drought and will not be able to export.""Prices that were already high before the war are now exploding: wheat reached 440 euros ($463) a tonne on the Euronext market on Monday.""- That came after India announced it would no longer export wheat. Why? -""India had announced a rather ambitious target of exporting 10 million tonnes. It had sold around 3-3.5 million tonnes before it put its export ban in place  so one of the questions is whether it will honour its commitments.""The situation is tense because there's no country that can put more than usual into the export market. Perhaps Russia will if it has a good harvest.""But even if the war stopped  Ukraine's production and exports will not bounce back immediately.""- Have we reached the peak of the crisis  ahead of the harvests in the US and Europe this summer?""We have real long-term risks. We still haven't seen all the shocks  because on global markets for the last two months we've been seeing fulfilments of contracts signed before the Russian invasion. We're now entering the hard part.""What about stocks?""For wheat  we have around 270 million tonnes for a planet that consumes around 800 million a year. Around half are in China which has one year's consumption in reserve. Excluding China  cereal stocks are at their lowest level in 25 years.""We need international solidarity and cooperation.

The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in volumes and prices  was more than offset by the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the mine operations and by a less favorable mix on Oil & Gas International markets.Sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A) at €85 million or 9.3% of revenue (versus 11.0% in Q1 2021) increasing by 10.4%.The normalized level of EBITDA is approximately €130 million. The adjustment refers predominantly to the operations of the iron ore mine.Operating income was negative at €(17) million  compared to €27 million in Q1 2021  resulting mainly from lower EBITDA.Financial income was negative at €(13) million  compared with €(82) million in Q1 2021  reflecting the new balance sheet structure and non-recurring financial expenses in Q1 2021.Income tax expense was €(3) million compared to €(40) million in Q1 2021 reflecting the temporary curtailment of the iron ore mine operations.This resulted in a negative net income  Group share  of €(35) million  compared to €(93) million in Q1 2021.III CASH FLOW & FINANCIAL POSITIONCash flow from operating activitiesIn Q1 2022  cash flow from operating activities was positive at €21 million  compared to €13 million in Q1 2021; the improvement reflected mainly financial expenses  as well as income tax paid.Operating working capital requirementIn Q1 2022  operating working capital requirement increased by €(217) million  versus an increase of €(47) million in Q1 2021  reflecting higher forward volume expectations and raw-material price increases. The net working capital requirement  excluding the impact of IFRS 5  stood at 125 days of sales  compared to 104 days in Q1 2021.CapexCapital expenditure was €(34) million in Q1 2022  compared with €(28) million in Q1 2021.Free cash flowAs a result  in Q1 2022  free cash flow was negative at €(230) million versus €(62) million in Q1 2021.Asset disposals & other itemsIn Q1 2022  asset disposals & other items amounted to €(25) million  compared with €(89) million in Q1 2021.Net debt and liquidityAs of March 31  2022  net debt stood at €1 213 million  compared with €958 million on December 31  2021. As of March 31  2022  gross debt amounted to €1 606 million including €86 million of fair value adjustment under IFRS 9 (which will be reversed over the life of the debt). Long-term debt amounted to €1 383 million and short-term debt totaled €223 million.As of March 31  2022  lease debt stood at €50 million following the application of IFRS 5 standards  compared with €48 million on December 31  2021.The liquidity position was strong at €855 million  with cash amounting to €393 million and an undrawn committed Revolving Credit Facility of €462 million.IV UPDATE ON MINEOn January 8  2022  following the exceptionally heavy rainfall in Minas Gerais State (Brazil)  some material from the waste pile associated with the operations of Vallourec’s Pau Branco mine slid into a rainwater dam (“the Lisa Dam”) causing it to overflow  and resulting in the interruption of traffic on the nearby highway. The structure of the dam was not affected  and there were no casualties. As a result of this incident  the operations of the mine have been temporarily suspended.On May 4  2022  Vallourec partially restarted operations  after having obtained the approval of the mining authorities to resume activities for a period of three months without using the waste pile. Under these temporary conditions  Vallourec is targeting a progressive ramp-up from 70% to full capacity.In parallel  Vallourec is continuing to prepare for a return to normal operations  subject to the validation of the stability of the waste pile by the mining and state environmental authorities.V SUPPORTIVE MARKET ENVIRONMENTAfter several years of underinvestment  a global increase in Exploration and Production (E&P) capital spending is forecasted  driven notably by the tight OCTG market environment in North America. According to IHS Markit data  E&P drilling capex forecasts have been revised upwards by $173 billion in aggregate between the projections made in March 2021 and those issued a year later for the 2022-2025 period.Drilling activity is increasing again globally  with the current rig count up 63% from its Covid-19 trough. This situation reflects a tight OCTG market  particularly in North America  which benefits from a strong price environment. The Middle East region is also seeing high activity  particularly in the UAE and Iraq. North Africa is showing strong growth in its region while market conditions are remaining solid in South America.There nevertheless remains substantially more potential for further volume growth  with current rig count at only 78% of pre-Covid levels.OCTG prices are also recovering on the back of the restart of global demand and the increase of raw-material and energy prices.VI LOOKING AHEAD FOR A NEW VALLOUREC1. Pursue footprint reshapingLaunch closure process of German sitesIn November 2021  Vallourec decided to launch the disposal process of all its German manufacturing assets in order to find a new operator  better positioned to profitably serve the European Industry markets. The disposal process has been carried out and no credible buyer has been identified. As a result  Vallourec is launching the closure process of its German assets which will result in a 685kt reduction in less competitive rolling capacity.The closure process will take place over the next two years and will include the sale of the land and buildings.German rolling activity for Oil & Gas relocated to BrazilThis transfer will require €110 million of capex in our Brazilian operations to support the transition of premium tubular volumes from Europe by end 2023.Impact of the closure of German assets on the other European assetsThe closure of the German assets implies a further rationalization of the other European assets which were finishing tubes rolled in Germany.This rationalization will entail the consolidation of all European threading activities in a single location in Aulnoye in France. The Group will launch the closure process of the heat treatment line of Saint-Saulve in France and of the threading line in Bellshill in Scotland. In addition  Vallourec will complete the divestiture of Vallourec Bearing Tubes.Research & DevelopmentAulnoye Competence Center will lead ‘one R&D’ organization.The completion of this footprint reshape will allow Vallourec to benefit from a lower-cost manufacturing base capable of serving worldwide O&G markets. This reorganization is targeted to generate €130 million of run-rate EBITDA and a €20 million capex reduction. The associated headcount reduction2 should be approximatively 2 400The implementation of these measures is subject to consultation of the employee representatives.2. Streamline corporate structure to better manage a reshaped industrial footprint and a leaner organizationIn addition to the reshape of Vallourec’s footprint  the Group has launched a comprehensive program aiming to streamline global overheads in-line with its new manufacturing footprint  representing a major step to lower the break-even point and create a cycle-proof company that is free cash flow-positive at the bottom of the cycle.These measures encompass the following:A leaner organization in all regions (North America  South America and Eastern Hemisphere): the Group will move its main manufacturing base to Americas.Lower overheads and central costs: the Group will further downsize the headquarter functions which will be primarily focused on strategy and expertise.Higher productivity: the Group will implement process automation for all transactional processes and will consolidate support functions in larger Shared Services Centers to leverage the Company’s scale.Focus on value-creating projects: selective approach to R&D and IT projects with careful return on investment parameters and interface with a broader strategic vision. The Group will create one global R&D organization securing consistency and focusing resources on key strategic developments.Support functions close to production sites: the Group targets to locate more than 50% of its support functions in the Americas. The Industrial support will be located in production sites.With this initiative  the Group aims to generate €100 million of additional run-rate EBITDA. The associated headcount reduction3 should be approximatively 550The implementation of these measures is subject to consultation of the employee representatives.Combined  these initiatives will reduce CO2 emissions (the CO2 content of a tube produced in Brazil is 30% lower than of a tube produced in Germany) and lead to €230 million of recurring EBITDA and €250 million ongoing cash up-lift. The execution is expected to be finalized in Q1 2024Preparing the future low-carbon economyAppointment of Ulrika WisingOn May 2  2022  Vallourec announced the appointment of Ulrika Wising as Senior Vice President Energy Transition. Ulrika has a solid energy transition and corporate development background. She reports to Philippe Guillemot and will play a key role in Vallourec's ongoing transformation. She will strengthen the focus and commitments to energy transition and will be responsible for accelerating and developing new profitable business opportunities for the Group.A committed player with a clear roadmapIn 2020  Vallourec announced its ambition to reduce its direct and indirect carbon emissions by 2025  taking 2017 as baseline year. These objectives were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)  and Vallourec became the first company in the Oil & Gas sector to obtain this recognition4. The Group  which is already a low emitter of greenhouse gases  is committed to:reducing its direct emissions by 20% (Scopes 1 & 2);reducing both direct and indirect emissions by 25% (Scopes 1  2 & 3).In December 2021  Vallourec announced that it was again part of the ""A List"" compiled by the CDP. This accomplishment serves as a recognition for the Company's transparency and leadership on climate issues.Concretely  in terms of ton of CO2 emitted to produce a tube  Vallourec is clearly a best-in-class actor. The Group consumes 1.796 ton of CO2 per ton of tube produced versus 2 tons on average for peers5.Investment in Closed Loop Geothermal Company GreenFire EnergyOn May 3  2022  Vallourec announced an investment in GreenFire Energy Inc.  an American start-up developing Advanced Geothermal Systems based on its innovative technology called GreenFire’s GreenLoop™. This transaction was carried out alongside other major investors  Baker Hughes and Helmerich & Payne.Vallourec and GreenFire Energy have been working together since 2019 on several successful Closed- Loop Geothermal demonstrators in various fields. Vallourec THERMOCASE® Vacuum Insulated Tubing (VIT) is a key enabler of closed loop geothermal systems: these thermally insulated pipes allow the harvesting of underground heat and bring it to the surface (as hot water or steam) with minimal losses. Thanks to its leading edge in VIT with its THERMOCASE® product range  Vallourec will be able to support GFE by designing and manufacturing bespoke solutions for their downhole heat exchanger. While conventional geothermal systems rely on the exploitation of geothermal resources in very specific areas  Advanced Geothermal Systems – such as the one developed by GreenFire Energy - could unlock the possibility of producing energy virtually anywhere.New steps in the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Hydrogen fieldsFor the injection of super critical CO2 into carbon storage wells  VAM Top® connections have been tested for specific conditions requiring low temperature (-80°C) and a very sudden temperature drop under severe loading conditions  with full-scale samples. This has been validated by customers including Oil & Gas technology leaders.Due to the small size and low viscosity of the molecule  hydrogen is known to be a difficult gas to contain. Vallourec is the first company to have tested and validated full leak-tightness of the VAM® 21 connection with 100% hydrogen content up to 560 bar that are even more stringent than those required for future storage wells.VII 2022 OUTLOOKOil & GasIn North America  the very favorable market conditions should continue and even improve in H2 2022  in both price and volume terms.In EA-MEA  volumes are expected to significantly recover from Q2 onward; cost increases to be passed on to customers.In South America  volumes are expected to increase leading to margin increase throughout the year.Industry & OtherIn Europe  prices are expected to increase to fully offset cost inflation.In Brazil  volumes are expected to increase slightly  with price increases fully offsetting cost inflation. Vallourec has partially restarted mining operations  while H2 activity depends on validation of waste pile stability by the authorities. FY 2022 consensus estimates for iron ore average prices c.$130/MT6.Based on these market trends and assumptions  particularly related to the operations of the iron ore mine  EBITDA is now expected to increase significantly for FY 2022 compared to prior year.OtherCapex is expected to be slightly above €200 million  including approximately €50 million for the preparation of the transfer of operations from Germany to Brazil.Information and Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release may include forward-looking statements.

Since then  wheat-exporting powerhouse Ukraine has struggled to sell and sow its crops  putting consumers …,"Consumed daily by billions of people around the world in bread and other flour-based products  wheat is a basic food staple  making current record prices for the cereal a global concern.Low rainfall or droughts in major producing countries were already causing worries before Russia 's invasion of Ukraine in February sent markets soaring.Since then  wheat-exporting powerhouse Ukraine has struggled to sell and sow its crops  putting consumers in poor countries at risk of poverty and even famine.Sebastien Abis  head of the Demeter agricultural think tank in Paris and an expert at the Institute for International and Strategic Relations  explains what's at stake:""It's very difficult. Wheat is the most important cereal for global food security: it is eaten by billions of humans in the form of bread  flour or semolina.""Corn is grown in larger quantities but is mostly used for animal feed or for industrial purposes.""Beyond its nutritional qualities  wheat is a very social and democratic product  enabling people to make low-cost food -- and it is often subsidised.""""Yes  because of shortages and because you can't produce it just anywhere. You can grow it in temperate climates  but there are only a dozen countries that produce a lot and can export it  particularly Russia  Ukraine  the United States   Australia.""In recent years  the United States has produced less and less because they are switching to corn and soya . After the Soviet period  the two countries that surged ahead were Ukraine and Russia.""Ukraine accounted for 12-13 percent of global exports in recent years.""""We have at the same time a dreadful geopolitical situation  with multilateralism faltering  to which we must add worrying climatic events  with droughts in the southern Mediterranean basin   worries in the United States and in Europe.""India  which had an exceptional harvest last year and reserves that enabled it to sell more on the markets  has been hit with a terrible drought and will not be able to export.""Prices that were already high before the war are now exploding: wheat reached 440 euros ($463) a tonne on the Euronext market on Monday.""""India had announced a rather ambitious target of exporting 10 million tonnes. It had sold around 3-3.5 million tonnes before it put its export ban in place  so one of the questions is whether it will honour its commitments.""The situation is tense because there's no country that can put more than usual into the export market. Perhaps Russia will if it has a good harvest.""But even if the war stopped  Ukraine's production and exports will not bounce back immediately.""Have we reached the peak of the crisis  ahead of the harvests in the US and Europe this summer?""We have real long-term risks. We still haven't seen all the shocks  because on global markets for the last two months we've been seeing fulfilments of contracts signed before the Russian invasion. We're now entering the hard part.""""For wheat  we have around 270 million tonnes for a planet that consumes around 800 million a year. Around half are in China which has one year's consumption in reserve. Excluding China  cereal stocks are at their lowest level in 25 years.""We need international solidarity and cooperation. We can't leave countries to struggle on their own for food security but at the same time you can't be surprised that some countries are looking out for themselves first and foremost.""We need to produce everywhere where we can produce  notably in Africa.

Euronext (OTCPK:EUXTF)  along with London Stock Exchange Group (OTCPK:LDNXF  OTCPK:LNSTY)  was our top pick for a more volatile environment. After the Russian invasion and the subsequent market turmoil  we decide to reiterate our positive view on Euronext based on:Better than expected synergies from the Borsa Italiana Group integration; Italian IPO acceleration; Strong cash flow has led to a DPS increase at €1.93 per share.Q1 ResultsAt the cost of being repetitive  once again we were looking in the right direction.Euronext Q1 ResultsBorsa Italiana's integration into Euronext continues and drives the positive results within the company's quarterly report. The group which brings together the lists of Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Oslo  Paris  and Milan  delivered revenues of €395.7 million  an increase of 58.8% for Q1 2022. This was a record quarter. In a pro forma comparison (the Italian stock exchange was only consolidated for eight months in the previous year)  this increase was 6%. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter grew by 66.8% reaching €252.2 million and 11.4% on a pro forma basis  thanks to volume growth combined with cost discipline. As a consequence  net profit increased by 50.3% to €164.4 million  accompanied by a 7.3% increase in adjusted earnings per share to €1.54.Euronext Q1 Results (Q1 Press Release)Euronext has updated the guidance on costs for 2022  which now foresees €10 million less in underlying costs (for a total of 612 million) and €10 million less in implementation costs (now €150 million).Euronext Cost Synergy Update (Q1 Results)In the first three months  as we were forecasting (using the VIX as a proxy)  revenue growth is linked to trading  with exchanges ""above average"" confirmed by the CFO Giorgio Modica and further explained as ""driven by the high volatility"" recorded on the markets. In April  the average value of cash transactions was up by 5.7% compared to the same period last year.

In accordance with Article 135 of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) the adoption of the resolution also required that at least 51 per cent of the nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue be represented at the meeting. As this requirement was not met  the Board has convened an extraordinary general meeting to take a fresh vote on this proposal in accordance with the rules set out in Article 135(1)(b) of the Companies Act (Cap.386 of the Laws of Malta).At this EGM the resolution may be passed by shareholder / holder of SDRs having the right to attend and vote at the meeting holding in the aggregate not less than 75 per cent in nominal value of the shares/SDRs represented and entitled to vote at the meeting. However  if more than half in nominal value of all the shares/SDRs having the right to vote at the meeting is represented at that meeting  a simple majority in nominal value of such shares/SDRs so represented shall suffice.The Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition of shares/SDRs shall take place on NasdaqStockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares/SDRs to all shareholders. The purchases may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on actual market price and terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts.The objective of the purchase is to achieve added value for the Company's shareholders (includingthrough the implementation of the share buy-back program previously announced) and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure.Following the purchase  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or issue to employees under a Share Option programme or Share Performance Scheme.Once purchased under the Maltese Companies Act further shareholder approval will be required before those shares could be cancelled only. Shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to the Company's share buyback program will be cancelled (refer to Agenda item 8). A separate authorisation for such cancellation is being recommended pursuant to Resolution (2);If used as consideration for an acquisition  the intention would be that the actual Shares/SDRs would be offered to any potential transferor.Information about proposals related to Agenda item 8Share cancellationThe Board of Directors has already submitted this proposal for the consideration of the AGM.At the AGM  36.70 per cent in nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue were represented at the meeting and 99.99 per cent of those represented (36.69 per cent of the total shares/SDRs in issue) voted in favour of granting such authorisation. In accordance with Article 135 of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) the adoption of the resolution also required that at least 51 per cent of the nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue be represented at the meeting. As this requirement was not met  the Board has convened an extraordinary general meeting to take a fresh vote on this proposal in accordance with the rules set out in Article 135(1)(b) of the Companies Act (Cap.386 of the Laws of Malta).At this EGM the resolution may be passed by shareholder / holder of SDRs having the right to attend and vote at the meeting holding in the aggregate not less than 75 per cent in nominal value of the shares/SDRs represented and entitled to vote at the meeting. However  if more than half in nominal value of all the shares/SDRs having the right to vote at the meeting is represented at that meeting  a simple majority in nominal value of such shares/SDRs so represented shall suffice.The directors may decide to cancel all or some of shares/SDRs acquired pursuant to the buy-back program.The Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) stipulates that an extraordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company is required in order to approve the reduction in the issued share capital of the Company.Such resolution needs to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in Malta  who will publish details of such reduction. Creditors of the Company will then have a period of three months in which they can contest the reduction in capital. Upon the lapse of the three-month period  assuming that no contestations are received  the reduction in share capital can become effective.In order to reflect the changes in the issued share capital  a revised memorandum of association of the Company indicating the reduced number of shares then in issue in the capital of the Company will need to be submitted to the Registrar of Companies.The reduction in issued share capital will take place at such intervals and in such amounts (subject to the maximum amount of GBP 14 375) as the directors shall determine from time to time.Information about proposals related to Agenda item 9Share issueThe Board of Directors has already submitted this proposal for the consideration of the AGM.At the AGM  36.70 per cent in nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue were represented at the meeting and 100 per cent of those represented (36.70 per cent of the total shares/SDRs in issue) voted in favour of granting such authorisation. In accordance with Article 135 of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) the adoption of the resolution also required that at least 51 per cent of the nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue be represented at the meeting.

However  if more than half in nominal value of all the shares/SDRs having the right to vote at the meeting is represented at that meeting  a simple majority in nominal value of such shares/SDRs so represented shall suffice.The objectives of the authorisation to be granted in terms of this resolution are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares/SDRs on each issue date that will be used in determining the price at which shares/SDRs will be issued  should be the same as the market value of the shares/SDRs listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. A cap of 23 million ordinary shares/SDRs in the Company is being requested in connection with this authorisation. The cap will be reduced by the amount of any shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to Resolution (1) (but excluding shares / SDRs not already bought back by the Company on the date of the adoption of the resolution).For information on how personal data is processed please seehttps://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfBy order of the BoardKindred Group plcMalta  13 May 2022CONTACT:For more information:Johan Wilsby  Chief Financial Officerjohan.wilsby@kindredgroup.comThis information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/kindred-group/r/notice-to-extraordinary-general-meeting-of-kindred-group-plc c3570587The following files are available for download:https://mb.cision.com/Main/824/3570587/1582026.pdf Kindred - Notice EGM 2022SOURCE Kindred Group",neutral,0.03,0.92,0.05,neutral,0.03,0.9,0.07,True,English,"['Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Kindred Group plc', 'Notice', 'Swedish Depository Receipts', 'actual market price', 'two person(s', '2023 Annual General Meeting', 'Euroclear Sweden AB', 'Kindred Group plc', 'EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING', 'GBP 0.000625 Ordinary Shares/SDRs', 'minimum price', 'maximum price', 'Companies Act', 'voting rights', 'custodian bank', 'supporting documentation', 'voting procedure', 'support purposes', 'voting list', 'inter alia', 'minimum consideration', 'multiple occasions', 'Friday 10 June', 'Wednesday 1 June', 'Friday 3 June', 'regular mail', 'extraordinary resolution', 'following business', 'following resolutions', 'Record Date', '10:00AM CEST', 'SDR holder', 'maximum number', ""Directors' meeting"", 'share capital', 'VALLETTA', 'Malta', 'NOTICE', 'EGM', 'Company', 'terms', 'article', 'Laws', 'office', 'Regeringsgatan', 'Stockholm', 'holders', 'register', '23:59PM', 'votes', 'link', 'anmalan', 'vpc', 'euroclearproxy', 'BankID', 'behalf', 'someone', 'access', 'printing', 'kindredgroup', 'courier', 'Box', 'Requirement', 'holding', 'name', 'nominee', 'brokerage', 'authority', 'Power', 'Attorney', 'original', 'people', 'event', 'assistance', 'questions', 'generalmeetingservice', 'telephone', 'channels', 'conversions', '27 May', 'Agenda', '1 Opening', '2 Election', 'Chairman', 'approval', '5 Election', 'minutes', '6 Determination', 'Board', '9 March', 'buyback', 'added', 'value', 'Cap.', 'subscription', 'authorisation', 'conditions', 'acquisitions', 'duration', 'period', 'purchases', '1 SEK', 'tax', '300 SEK', 'place', 'completion', 'means', 'cancellation']",2022-05-19,2022-05-19,prnewswire.co.uk

My name is Jess and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. For the duration of the call  your lines will be on listen-only. However  there will be the opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]I will now hand you over to your host  Stéphane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext to begin today’s call. Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahGood morning everybody and thank you for joining us this morning for Euronext first quarter 2022 results conference call and webcast. I am Stéphane Boujnah CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  and I will start with the highlights of the first quarter before handing over to Giorgio Modica  Euronext CFO who will then further develop the main business and financial highlights of the quarter.Moving to slide 4. Before the discussing our first quarter performance  I would like to say a few words on the current situation in Europe. This quarter was marked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And while our exposure to Ukraine  Russia  Belarus is negligible  our European roots are the core DNA of the Euronext project. And as the leading pan-European market infrastructure  we remain extremely concerned by this situation. Clearly this crisis has generated strong volatility across European markets  yet we have continued to provide fair and transparent markets at all times and we have demonstrated the resilience of our business model in those circumstances. We continue to monitor closely the situation notably with regard to the implementation of the sanctions on Russia and Belarus. However  as I just said our exposure to the situation is negligible.Moving now to the presentation of our first quarter results. Euronext reported a very strong performance in the first quarter of 2022 with revenue reaching €395.7 million. This is the highest quarterly revenue we have ever disclosed at Euronext. During the first quarter of 2022  revenue increased by more than 50%. Adjusted EBITDA increased by more than 50% and adjusted net income increased by more than 50%. This is not only due to the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group. Our results were also up year-on-year on a pro forma basis. In other words  including Borsa Italiana Group as if we were owners of these assets in Q1 2021.On that pro forma basis  Euronext reported plus 6% growth in the first quarter revenue this year and plus 11.4% growth in adjusted EBITDA. And this strong performance results from several drivers. On the one hand  both non-volume related revenue and trading activities reported a very strong performance. On the other hand  we benefited from our continued cost discipline combined with the successful ongoing integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and the delivery of the related expected synergies.On the revenue side  our trading activities were driven by the volatile environment at the end of the first quarter of this year. In the meantime non-volume related activities proved also to be resilient. All together  non-volume-related revenue accounted for 55% of total revenue and covered 151% of underlying operating expenses including D&A. And on the cost side  the reported increase for sure in underlying expenses excluding D&A reflects the consolidating costs from the Borsa Italiana Group.But I would like to emphasize that both on a like-for-like basis and on a pro forma basis  the underlying expenses excluding D&A were down compared to last year. This is the result of our continued tight cost control combined with the successful ongoing integration of the Borsa Italiana Group that is enabling us to deliver on the targeted EBITDA synergies.Overall  these numbers translated into a plus 11.4% increase in pro forma adjusted EBITDA to €252.2 million resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of plus 3.1 points to 63.7%. Bottom line  we delivered in the first quarter of 2022  a plus -- sorry a plus 7.3% increase in adjusted EPS at €1.54 per share. On a reported basis  net income was up plus 46.5% to €143.8 million.Giorgio will further detail this financial performance  but our strong performance in Q1 improved our leverage position. It provides us with additional strategic flexibility  as recently recognized by S&P  which confirmed our rating at BBB and improved the outlook from stable to positive.During this third -- first quarter  we pursued the strong momentum around delivery of the integration plan and the delivery of synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group and we pursued the development of the first key migration -- the migration of Core Data Centre which will occur in just a few weeks.With regards to the targeted synergies  we have reached 15.2 million of cumulative run rate EBITDA synergies at the end of this quarter  just 11 months after the closing of the acquisition.Another key achievement is the confirmed go-live of our new green Core Data Centre near Bergamo. Euronext will become the operator of its own Core Data Centre next month. From 6 June 2022  our new Core Data Centre will be live unlocking the first batch of identified business development synergy.And this migration will be the first major milestones within our growth for Impact 2024 strategic plan that will pave the way for the migration of the Italian cash equities and derivatives markets and to the Optiq trading platform in 2023.And I would like to thank our teams and to thank the teams of our clients for this successful migration project that will benefit more broadly the world financial ecosystem and that will help all our clients reduce their carbon footprint.As a result of our progress in the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and as a result of continued cost control in the first quarter  we are today very pleased to upgrade our 2022 cost guidance  expecting €10 million less of underlying costs and €10 million less of implementation costs.This translates into expected underlying costs for 2022 of €612 million  down from the €622 million previously announced in February this year. In addition  we now expect €150 million of non-recurring implementation costs by 2024  down from €160 million initially announced in November 2021.Moving to the next slide. Allow me to highlight some recent developments in our ESG strategy. As you know  we believe that Euronext must play a critical role to promote the transition of companies to more sustainable business models. We also continued to advance on the different pillars of our FIT for 1.5-degree commitment during this first quarter of 2022.We pursued the development of our ESG offering  as we continue to strengthen the ESG franchise of our national flagship indices. We have welcomed additional issuers of sustainability-linked bonds on our markets.Alongside  the enhancement of our ESG offering  we continue to act as a partner of choice for our clients  publishing or guide for ESG reporting target 1.5 degree and performing the sustainable training initiatives to support our clients in their ESG journey.From internal Euronext corporate perspective  we're also starting to deliver on our own ambitious ESG commitment. As I mentioned  before the migration of our new Core Data Centre near Bergamo  we present a massive milestone towards our FIT four 1.5-degree commitment.Furthermore  we continue to empower our people for example by launching for the third year in a row our 10 shares for all employees program as well as training our employees on climate issues. But for the past few years already 100% of the Euronext employees are shareholders in Euronext.Lastly  as you may have seen in our universal registration document  we have disclosed our first set of targets in line with science-based target initiatives. These targets notably include an expected reduction by at least 42% of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions by 2030 compared to 2020 as well as a reduction of at least 42.6% of our Scope 3 travel carbon emissions by 2030  compared to 2019.So  the assessment to further reduce our emissions is being finalized and we are able -- we will be able to publish our final targets by June 2022.So  I now hand over to Giorgio Modica for the review of our first quarter performance.Giorgio ModicaThank you  Stéphane and good morning everyone. I am now on slide nine. In the first quarter of 2022  Euronext's consolidated revenue and income grew 6% pro forma for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.On a reported basis  revenue and income grew 58.8% to €395.7 million  representing an increase of €146.6 million. These strong results were driven by the growth of both loan volume-related activities and trading and the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group.On a like-for-like basis and at currencies  i.e. mainly excluding Borsa Italiana Group consolidation that started in the first quarter of 2021  Euronext's consolidated revenue was up 6.9% compared to the first quarter of 2021.We recorded good performance across different business lines. Trading revenue increased €150.8 million  up 9.9% pro forma and 57.2% on a reported basis  resulting from strong trading activity across all asset classes and products.Post trade revenue increased 3.1% pro forma and 51.7% on a reported basis to €95.8 million  driven by the continued strong activity. Clearing revenue profited from the highly volatile environment  while custody investment revenue was stable.Advanced data service revenue increased 3.4% pro forma and 43.9% on a reported basis to €52.6 million due to a solid core data business performance. Listing revenue grew 12.4% pro forma and 42.9% on a reported basis to €55.4 million. The listing activity was resilient and Euronext confirmed its leading position as the leading venue for equity and ETF listings in Europe and for bond listings worldwide.In terms of revenue mix in the first quarter of 2022  non-volume-related revenue accounted for 55% of total group revenue versus 58% pro forma in the first quarter 2021 as a result of the increasing relevance of our non-volume-related revenue in our business mix even during periods of high trading activity.I would like to highlight that to better reflect the segmentation of our revenue mix between volume-related and non-volume-related revenues from this quarter  we include within our non-volume-related revenue part of the revenue of clearing such as the net treasury income and membership fees. Lastly  non-volume-related revenues covered 151% of our underlying operating costs excluding D&A compared to 147% pro forma last year.Moving to the next slide for listing. I'm on slide 10. Listing revenue was €55.4 million  an increase of 12.4% on a pro forma basis and 42.9% on a reported basis compared to the first quarter of 2021. To better understand this trend  I would like to highlight that according to the principles of IFRS 15  admission revenues are recognized over a period of time  which for Euronext mostly ranges between three and five years. As a result  in the first quarter of 2022  we benefited from the exceptional listing activity of 2021  offsetting a softer IPO environment this quarter.In detail  during the first quarter of 2022  Euronext was able to confirm its leading position in Europe for primary equity listing counting 22 new listing despite the recent headwinds to the listing activity.Euronext also recorded the three largest IPO in Europe in terms of money raised and continue to demonstrate its activity as a spark hub. In the first quarter of 2022  €2.2 billion was raised on Euronext primary market  which represents 73% of the total money raised on primary markets all over Europe.As far as secondary issues are concerned  €2.6 billion were raised in the first quarter of 2022. The deal pipeline remains strong  but market conditions have worsened with several issues postponing the execution of deals. If current market conditions  persists  next quarter might not be as strong as the first quarter.Moving to ETF  once again  we confirm in the first quarter of 2022 our position as the number one listing venue for ETF with 3 679 ETFs listed at the end of March 2022. Euronext also reinforced its position as the leading venue for bond listing worldwide with over 52 000 bonds listed across all Euronext markets and continue to grow its ESG bond listing franchise.In the first quarter of 2022  €320.5 billion in debt was raised on Euronext's markets. Overall this brings us to a total of €325.2 billion  raised in equity and debt on Euronext market in the first quarter of 2022.Lastly  Euronext Corporate Services reported a record quarter in terms of revenues at €10.5 million. The plus 15.7% increase on year  results from a strong performance across services and increasing commercial traction in Italy.Like-for-like listing and corporate service revenues increased 12.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. In summary  this quarter demonstrates the strength of our equity and debt listing businesses in highly volatile market conditions.Let's move to our trading business  next on slide 11  and start with cash trading. On a pro forma basis including Borsa Italiana  ADV increased 19.8% to €15.5 billion  representing the second strongest quarter ever recorded on Euronext equity markets  after the first quarter of 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.Average revenue capture over the quarter was at 0.47 basis points and the market share averaged 68.1%  including Borsa Italiana. This level of average fee is impacted by the dilution coming from the consolidation of Borsa Italiana and the normalization of market behaviors and the average size of orders. Excluding Borsa Italiana  the average fee remains above 0.50 basis points. Cash trading revenues increased 11.1% pro forma and 35.7% on a reported basis to €94 million.Moving on to derivative trading  derivative trading revenue was up 9.3% pro forma and 37.5% on a reported basis to €16.1 million in this quarter. Pro forma average daily volumes on financial derivatives was up  6.1% from the first quarter of 2021  reflecting the high volatility environment for equity derivatives. Commodities reported another record quarter  while average daily volumes were up 6.1% compared to an already strong quarter in the first quarter of 2021. The average revenue capture over the quarter for derivative trading was €0.30 per lot.Lastly  fixed income trading  fixed income trading reported revenue at €24.4 million  primarily resulting from the consolidation of MTS. On a pro forma basis  fixed income revenue increased 4.7%. In the first quarter 2022  MTS cash generated $16.9 million of revenues and MTS repo generated €5.2 million in revenue. Repo trading saw a strong traction this quarter with terms ADV  up 25% to €347.9 billion. MTS cash maintained a robust performance in market dominated by raising interest rates with ADV volumes down only 1.6% versus the exceptional Q1 2021 to €22.7 billion.Let's continue with trading on slide 12  and let's start with the FX business. The first quarter of 2022 was the second best quarter ever for Euronext FX  after the first quarter of 2020  both in terms of revenue and average daily volumes. Thanks to the positive impact of volatility. Euronext reported average spot FX trading volumes of $24.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022  up 14.4% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Spot effect sterling revenues increased 18%  compared to the first quarter of 2021 at €7.2 million.Power Trading reported €9.1 million in revenue this quarter  a solid growth of 8.4% compared to the first quarter of 2021  as a result of a larger footprint in Central Europe and a solid performance in the UK and in the Nordics. In the first quarter of 2022  average daily day ahead power trader was 3.15 terawatt hour  with a 6.3% increase compared to the same quarter last year and average daily intraday power traded was at 0.08 terawatt hour  up 25.9% compared to the first quarter of 2021.Moving to slide 13. Revenue from our posted activity including net treasury income increased €72.9 million to €109.2 million. Clearing revenue was up 87.2% and 11.2% on a pro forma basis to €51.9 million. As a result of higher clearing revenue both at Euronext clearing and LCH SA  reflecting higher trading activity. On a like-for-like basis  at current currencies  clearing revenue was up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2021.Net treasury income through CCP business of Euronext cleaning was €13.4 million. Custody and settlement and post-trade revenue encompassing the activity of the four CSP we operate under the Euronext Security brand was up 38.6% to €63.9 million on a reported basis. The performance was organically driven by increased number of accounts in Euronext security Oslo  in Euronext Security Copenhagen. On a pro forma basis  revenue was stable year-on-year. On a like-for-like basis and at current currencies  custody and settlement and other post-trade revenue slightly decreased 2.5% compared to the first quarter of 2021  mainly related to lower settlement activity versus the first quarter of 2021.I'm now on slide 14. Advanced Data Services  revenue was up 43.9% to €52.6 million. This represents a 3.4% increase on a pro forma basis  compared to the first quarter of 2021  driven by strong performance of our market data business  resulting from higher number of users and sustained growth of the data solution offering. Investor Services revenue was at €2.2 million this quarter  down on a pro forma basis  driven by a change in scope up 7.4% on a like-for-like basis.Lastly  Technology Solutions  revenue was up 94.5% compared to Q1 2021 to €23.1 million as a result of the consolidation of Borsa Italiana Group technology business including Gatelab and X2 [ph]. On a pro forma basis  Technology Solutions revenue decreased slightly by 2.9%  mainly due to a seasonal decline in client activity.Moving to slide 16. For the financial highlights of the quarter  let's start with the EBITDA bridge. As announced  with the last publication  from the first quarter of 2022  we do not have any more a separate line below EBITDA to capture exceptional items. From this quarter  all costs are included by nature in the different lines of our P&L. This means that our EBITDA includes exceptional costs as well. However  we now publish an adjusted EBITDA which correspond to revenues minus non-underlying cost -- underlying costs excluding D&A  which highlights the underlying performance of Euronext. The definition of non-underlying items include integration costs  double run of significant projects  operating exceptional items  amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions  non-operating exceptional items and tax on the non-underlying items that I just described. Euronext adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 66.8% to €252.2 million. On a pro forma basis  adjusted EBITDA grew 11.4% demonstrating Euronext ability to capture value in a volatile environment and its trademark cost discipline. This result is also impacted by the release of approximately €4.5 million of bonus accruals in the first quarter of 2022.The adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 63.7% this quarter from 60.7% in the first quarter of 2021. On a like-for-like basis  EBITDA margin was at 64% this quarter  up 2.9 points and adjusted EBITDA increased 12%. Finally  non-underlying costs excluding D&A were €5.5 million and were mostly related to the Borsa Italiana integration bringing the EBITDA of the group to €246.7 million.Moving to Slide 9 for the bridge of net income. The net income increased this quarter 46.5% to €143.8 million. On a pro forma basis  net income increased 10.9% resulting from the following elements. D&A slightly increased €2.5 million reflecting the impact of the new data center and higher tangible and intangible fixed asset D&A. The result from equity investments decreased €8.6 million as -- this year this line only reflects the contribution of our 11% stake in LCH SA whereas last year Euronext received a one-off interim dividend from Euroclear.I would like to highlight that the €20.6 million of non-underlying costs in the bridge are mainly represented by D&A namely the PPA amortization of our acquisitions. Lastly  income tax for the first quarter of 2022 was €52 million. This translates into an effective tax rate for the quarter of 26.1%. For 2022  we expect a stable tax rate at around 27%. Adjusted for non-underlying costs  adjusted net income was €164.4 million translating into an adjusted EPS increase of 7.3% to €1.54 per share this quarter.I'm now moving to Slide 18 for the cash flow generation and leverage. Net operating cash flow amounted to €368.6 million. Excluding the CCP activities impact of Nord Pool and Euronext clearing on the change in working capital  84% of our adjusted EBITDA was converted into post-tax operating cash flow. Our strong cash flow generation capability enable us to significantly deleverage to 2.3 times net debt to EBITDA at the end of this quarter. This compares to 2.6 times at the end of the fourth quarter 2021 and 3.2 times following the closing of the Borsa Italiana acquisition. This improved leverage provide us with additional strategic flexibility  as recently recognized by S&P which confirmed our rating at BBB  but improved the outlook from stable to positive.Moving to Slide 19 for the evolution of our liquidity position over the quarter. As illustrated  our liquidity position remains strong above €1.5 billion including the undrawn RCF revolving credit facility of €600 million  while excluding the cash currently in transit at Nord Pool.With this  I would like to give back the floor to Stéphane Boujnah.Stéphane BoujnahThank you  Giorgio. And happy to take your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Mike Werner from UBS. Please go ahead.Mike WernerThank you very much. And thanks for the presentation. Two questions  please. First  on the $4.5 million release of the bonus accrual in Q1  can you just provide a little bit of color as to what drove that? Also  whether that's something that was – is probably considered one-off and non-recurring? And then second  on the Technology Solutions business you indicated kind of just lower client activity in Q1  but the Q1 revenue run rate was about 9% lower than the run rate that we saw in the second half of last year. So I was just wondering  yeah  is this something that's maybe seasonal one-off? Is this kind of really client related and activity related  or is this kind of a more appropriate run rate going forward given the change in the markets? Thank you.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much for your question. So starting from the €4.5 million – so this is an adjustment that we had when we had to finalize the decision on variable payments. So this can be considered in one sense one-off  because clearly this is something that is going to happen only in the first quarter of 2022. However  embedded in the number  you see already a lower accrual that will last throughout 2022. So  there is a part  which is recurring and a part which is one-off. And the €4.5 million  specifically this is the one-off component. When it comes to the Technology Solutions  a part of our activity is client-related. And what we have seen is a seasonal slowdown in the first quarter that we think is going to be recovered in the next quarter – quarters of 2022.Mike WernerThank you. And just a quick follow-up please. In terms of the release on the bonus accrual €4.5 million should we assume that accounts for about half of the lower cost guidance the €10 million cost that you guided for 2022?Giorgio ModicaI mean  as the cost target is going to be benchmark against the actual number for 2022. Clearly  any decrease in cost in the first quarter is included in that number.Mike WernerOkay. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Bruce HamiltonThanks. Good morning  and thanks for taking my questions. I've got three. Firstly  obviously  you've given us an update on the time line for the initial return on revenue synergies linked to the migration of the data center. But could you give us any color on sort of time frame and potential quantum around the opportunity linked to internationalization of MTS? Is that just a sort of gradual process  or how should we sort of think about that?Secondly  in terms of the importance of retail activity  could you give any sense of how much of your cash trading relates to retail and where we are – where that is versus history just to give a sense of any sort of further risk of normalization and similarly in the kind of post trade business? And then  finally  in terms of balance sheet flexibility obviously great that your net debt EBITDA is coming down quite quickly. Can you remind us  what sort of levels the credit rating agencies are now comfortable with? I assume that  may have gone up a little bit in terms of where you could sort of run without putting at risk your rating. So maybe just give us an update on that. Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahSo I will take the question on the revenue synergies  and Giorgio will answer the questions on the retail activities  and all the balance sheet in relation to the perception by rating agencies. Let's be clear  we had announced in November that  we – in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana  we would extract €45 million of cost synergies €15 million of revenue synergies. And we announced in February that  in addition to those €60 million we will – I guess  to €100 million through EBITDA expansion  we'd make sure of cost synergies and revenue synergies in relation to various projects  one of them being the migration of the Core Data Centre. So as of today  we have extracted in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group  in Italy the Borsa Italiana Group €15 million of run rate cost synergies.So it's about one-third of the €45 million cost synergies that we had announced or targeted for the end of 24 in November 2021. So €15 million part of €45 million all costs. For the first time  with the migration of the Core Data Centre to Bergamo where we will start invoicing directly colocation services we will stop generating revenue synergies. So going forward starting next quarter  we will have a contribution of revenue synergies to -- in the mix of synergy extracted in relation to this  -- the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.As far as the MTS revenue synergies are concerned  they are part of the bigger pocket of revenue synergies and they take longer than a few quarters to be extracted. So we have various progress -- projects that are ongoing  but they are not -- the international MTS revenues are not going to materialize in a material -- in a significant manner immediately. They are part of all the revenue synergies.Some of them are more or less one-off related  like the -- not one-off  but milestone-related like the development of the revenues to be extracted from the Core Data Centre in Bergamo. So you will see them in a recurrent manner  after the implementation of the migration of six June. Others are ramping up with the penetration of clients  with the international and MTS business in the Euronext countries. And that's more a project that we'll develop across 2023 and 2024. Giorgio?Giorgio ModicaYes  absolutely. So when it comes to the retail activity  what we have seen  is that the participation in this volatile environment is slightly different from what it was one year ago. And we see less participation for this new crisis linked to the war in Ukraine  with respect to what we have seen at the time of the pandemic. So the retail participation remains mid-single digits. So we're talking of 3% 4%  where it used to peak to 6% 7% at the peak of the pandemic.Then when it comes to your second question on -- with respect to leverage and rating  in the note from S&P clearly highlights some targets for the end of 2023 and seems to hint  that if we will go and if we remain in that trajectory  we might have further improved clearly before the end of 2023. So the objective for the trajectory points at the FFO to net debt of 30% and a net debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times.So as long as we will remain in the trajectory  I believe without waiting the end of 2023  we might be open to good surprises. On the lower side  however  I wanted to remind you in terms of flexibility that the BBB rating band ranges between 4.5 and 3.5 times net debt to EBITDA in terms of leverage  and between 18% and 23% in terms of FFO to net debt.Bruce HamiltonWell then  thank youOperatorThe next question comes from the line of Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.Haley TamGood morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. If I can have a few follow-ups please. Just with the Data Centre migration could you confirm that all your clients  you currently colocate with you in London  are moving with you to the Ponte San Pietro Data Centre? And I apologize if I missed it  but have you actually quantified  how much of the additional €40 million synergies will be coming from this move versus perhaps Euronext clearing in the longer term?And then if I can  I'd like to ask a question just about Euroclear and the 9.8% ICE stake that is now being sold to the French and Belgian government investment firms  who are also referenced shareholders of Euronext. Could you give us any color on what this means  if anything from a strategic perspective for you? Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahOkay. On the core data center  you have a questions on operations and a question on revenues. So I can confirm that all our clients are ready or about to be ready and there will be further testing and rehearsals between now and the 6 June with our clients. And if we confirm today the time table for the migration of the core data center  this is because as seasoned operational professionals we have reached the conclusion that together with all clients  the teams in the Aruba facilities near Bergamo across our various clients and within Euronext already for that migration.We do not disclose the granular breakdown of EBITDA contributions to the additional revenues to be generated by this quarter but next quarter we will be in a position to be more specific because by then you will see the contribution to the run rate revenue synergies of the revenue generated by the co-location services charged directly to the core data center in Bergamo.On the Euroclear situation  we have noticed the fact that SSPI and Euroclear have acquired the stake that was sold by ICE. We are familiar with SPI and with Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations  who are both referenced shareholders of Euronext. By the way  Euroclear is also a reference shareholder of Euronext. So we know each other extremely well. This the fact that there is a common interest by SFTI and by Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations for both Euronext  which is the leading pan-European market infrastructure in particular in terms of trading and post-trade and for Euroclear  which is the leading ICSD in Europe is shows the consistency of the strategy of Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations and FPI but it doesn't mean anything else that we have two strong shareholders of Euronext  who have a strong interest for market infrastructures in Europe across the value chain.Haley TamThank you.OperatorThe Next question comes from the line of Philip Middleton from Bank of America. Please go ahead.Philip MiddletonGood morning and thanks for taking my questions. First of all on costs. Could you talk a little bit about what the revised guidance for this year potentially means for years further out? So are we looking at some of the cost savings  which are one-off  so you don't read that through  or do you feel that the lower level of bonuses is sometimes sustainable and that therefore the €10 million may endure through further years?And secondly  I wonder if you could tell us a little bit more about the economics of the clearing and settlement business. So how much of this roughly the revenues come from asset-based revenues compared to the settlement revenues? Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahOkay. So Giorgio will answer your first questions on the inertia in the revised guidance. And Anthony  who is the Head of Post Trade  will answer your questions on the revenue model about the clearing business of Euronext clearing formerly known as CC&G. Over to you  Giorgio.Giorgio ModicaYes. So when it comes to cost  let's first focus ourselves on 2022. So what is going to happen this year is the following. So you should expect in the next quarter clearly the one-off elements not to be there anymore. And we will have to a certain extent the seasonal inflation coming from the increase of salary kicking in from the second quarter this year.And then it's difficult for me to be more granular when it comes to the phasing. Of course  rather than reiterating the new target is €622 million because we will have many projects completing and many projects starting  which gives to a certain extent a complex phasing of the cost through 2022.Then when we move to 2023  again it's very early I believe given the situation we are having at the moment to anticipate what is going to be the target and revenues from -- for next year. So clearly we are analyzing the situation with the objective of maximizing revenues and minimizing cost. I appreciate this might seem high level but this is exactly what we are trying to achieve. So to make the long story short  12% is what we see for 2022  you will see a slight increase in the second quarter coming from one-off elements that are not going to be there anymore plus some inflation on salary cost. And then we see a rather steady state for the remainder of the year.Anthony AttiaGood morning. This is Anthony. Thank you for your question. So across our core CSD  the split of revenue is quite similar. We have roughly 50% linked to custody activity  and so exposed to the valuation of assets. And the remaining 50% are linked to settlement and issuance businesses. What I want to note is that we also are developing services on top of this type of revenue. So it's a new business and it's growing and I want to take the example of tax reporting services in Norway or data services. And this is the part of the CSD business that is new and growing. Thank you.Philip MiddletonThank you. That’s helpful.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtHi  good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. CBOE has been rolling out  its competing equity index  derivatives  products across Europe. I know it's very early days there  but are you seeing any evidence of end customer activity migrating away? And could you comment on whether you expect to make any potential changes to pricing there  or if you feel comfortable with the competitive positioning of those products?And my second question is on the M&A environment  as you've stated previously you've delevered significantly at 2.3 times net leverage now. I guess given the volatility we're seeing at least in public market valuations and given the uncertain macro environment  can you just talk a bit about the M&A environment and whether you're still seeing potentially attractive opportunities in this type of environment?Stéphane BoujnahI will answer the M&A question and Giorgio will answer the question about the competitive environment particularly in relation to the CBOE initiatives. The way Euronext has approached or has been approaching M&A since the IPO is extremely consistent and disciplined.We do believe that external growth is a fundamental component of the growth ambitions of Euronext for two reasons  to expand our European footprint in situations  or in infrastructures where there are fundamental compelling synergies to be extracted by the expansion of the single liquidity pool  single order book  single technology platform  and to diversify the revenue streams of Euronext to be less dependent on volatility in particular in volatility related to equity markets.In order to pursue those two objectives in particular the ones of diversification  we have an investment committee of -- four hours that meets every four weeks. No matter the level of leverage  no matter the stock price of Euronext  no matter the competitive environment  no matter whether LSE is trying to merge with Deutsche Börse or is not merging with LSE and whether Citi [ph] is buying DME or not  we do have systematically a framework where we monitor opportunities.The other framework we have is that we are very disciplined in terms of return of capital employed.We believe that our purpose is to extract synergy through consolidation of assets. And therefore  we don't overpay for assets. That's why  for example  after very long debate we decided not to bid for the acquisition of BME and to let fixed paid -- the price they have paid for that acquisition at that time because we felt that we could not justify value creation for that particular asset.So we are extremely disciplined in terms of how much we are willing to pay. Sometimes we take both decisions like paying €4.4 billion for the acquisition of Borsa Italiana because we feel on the basis of our experience that business is going to perform better than the market felt and that we could extract more synergies than the market believed. And for the moment that has proved to be the right path.Going forward one of the new development exactly as you articulated it is the fact that to a certain extent valuation in particular of technology-driven assets SaaS assets  data assets are starting in certain sub-segments of those two domains to go down or to cool down. Some private equity owners who are considering selling those assets are becoming more reasonable in their expectations. So this is happening.Anyone who was on M&A in his life knows that this phase of adjustment of -- this phase of cooling down of seller's expectations can take a few months. It's just the beginning of the process. In that environment  it's true that some assets that were not within our reach in terms of multiple because we could not justify this type of valuations of a few quarters ago are slowing -- are slowly reaching a territory where we could justify those valuations  but that's just one component of an overall environment.So we are not going to buy things because they are cheap  just as we were not buying them because they were expensive. We will buy them because we believe that they create synergies. We can extract value and they make sense in terms of the strategic fit with the rest of the product portfolio.Sorry for this long answer  but you gave me the opportunity to frame the overall approach of M&A and the way we will use the new balance sheet flexibility that we have regained by strong operating performance and strong cash flow generation. Over to you Giorgio on the CBOE initiatives.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much  Stéphane. Clearly CBOE is a very strong and reputable competitor and we are looking carefully at the moves. However at the moment  we are convinced that the quality of execution of our market does not need -- does not justify any price decrease in order to compete on that market. So again  Euronext is about overall quality of trading and we still are the venue that sets and define the best execution and this is our competitive leverage against competition. So this is the first point.The second point is about client traction. And again what Stéphane said on the data center is i.e. that clients are with us and ready to migrate in the [indiscernible] at the 6 of June is a testament to the fact that what we are trying to achieve in Europe is fully supported. We are asking a lot from our clients because we want to give a lot to our clients and the payoff is positive. So again  what we are seeing is a strong support from our client base in a moment of high transformation. And we believe that even before having delivered all the benefits that we're trying to achieve with this transformation the quality of our execution is sufficient to maintain and strengthen position as a leading venue in Europe.Kyle VoigtI appreciate all the detail. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Arnaud Giblat from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.Arnaud GiblatYes. Good morning. I've got two questions left please. Firstly  can I ask with regards to the normalization of retail activity. You mentioned that on the trading side I'm wondering on the settlements and custom side how things are going. I mean some of the retail brokers in the Nordics have reported a slowdown in activity. I think your revenues are more geared into a number of accounts at more than anything else. So -- what's the outlook there? Should we expect a continuation of the strength and we're seeing in the Nordics  or do you expect the accounts to remain open or should we expect some degree of normalization with activity coming down?And my second question is on annual fees and investing  that's up 15% quarter-on-quarter. Could you run maybe through some of the drivers behind that and whether or not it's sustainable?Stéphane BoujnahSo  I'll let Anthony to answer your question as Head of Primary Markets and listing -- expert on listing fees and also on the nature of the development of our Post Trade business or CSD business in the Nordic.Anthony AttiaThank you  Stéphane. So  concerning the retail activity on our CSDs  it's about as Stéphane said  the Nordic activity the sin Copenhagen and Oslo. Well  we don't -- what we have observed in the last quarter is a normalization or stabilization of the number of retail accounts  which is still high from a historical perspective. And nevertheless the number of settlement instruction has normalized and we observe a drop compared to the peak that we had last year.Concerning the annual fees on equity listings  we have different adjustments in front of inflation compared to our listing venues or countries but we decided for this year to increase the yearly fees on our large cap issuers  which is an increase that was long overdue. This is a one-off increase  but we are obviously monitoring the effects of inflation across the board on our different fees. Thank you.Arnaud GiblatThanks.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Martin Price from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Martin PriceGood morning and thanks for taking my questions. Most of my questions have actually been asked  but maybe just on the revenue growth target of 3% to 4% per annum through to 2024  which you detailed at the Capital Markets Day last year.Within this  I wonder if you could just provide an update on your assumptions around volume growth and revenue capture for the core cash trading business and whether market development since the Capital Markets Day may have prompted any form of reevaluation? Thank you.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much for your question which is a fairly legitimate one. So  clearly  we are assessing reassessing the market environment on a daily basis. So  we feel that at the moment the market environment is more volatile than what we had expected at the Investor Day. And this might trigger at some point the decision  but we really feel that it's too early five  six months after the Investor Day to change the target. So  we're doing a step at the time  delivering the key milestone of the project and clearly we will ask ourselves in the next question in the next quarter the question on whether it is appropriate and timely a potential change of the targets for 2024.So  again  to make a long story short  we don't feel it's appropriate moment to change the target for 2024  but we are assessing the situation. And in this quarter in the next quarter  we will clearly look at that.Martin PriceUnderstood. That’s very helpful. Thanks Giorgio.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Johannes Thormann from HSBC. Please go ahead.Johannes ThormannGood morning everybody. Three questions please. First of all  you previously said when the year [indiscernible] was at 50 bps that this is not sustainable. Now  we have 47  is this more of a good run rate  or what's your view on that?Secondly  just on the Nordic CSD business  a follow-up question. I'm sorry if I missed it  but the number of accounts why did it increase? If the retail trading activity has normalized  what has been the driver for the increased number of accounts?And last but not least  on the Euroclear stake sale recently  you argue that you look for -- take it to a strategic fit. You own a stake in Euroclear and you have already leveraged below the 2.5 level. Why haven't you bought a stake yourself to position yourself at a better moment? Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahI will -- thank you for your questions. I will answer Euroclear question  and Anthony will answer the question on the Nordic retail accounts  and Giorgio will answer your first question.On the European situation  it's very simple. When the process of the sale of the disposal of the ICE stake started before the summer  we were approached and we looked at it very carefully. We decided not to deploy the capital of our shareholders in this transaction for two reasons. We believe that the best use of Euronext capital is to try whenever it's possible to control -- to buy controlling stakes in order to extract synergies  because we are an industrial player and to consolidate assets.We believe that we are not big enough to deploy several hundreds of millions just to deploy capital through a minority stake in a non-liquid company. So as a principle  we are not huge enough to do multi-hundred millions stakes for minority stakes in an illiquid company.The second reason which is more important is that we already have what we need to protect the optionality of being relatable if one day the situation when Europe is becoming actionable. We are -- we own directly and indirectly approximately 5% of the equity in Euroclear  and we are a Board member of Euroclear.So increasing our stake in Euroclear will not have materially change our position. We would not have had a second Board member and we would have just moved our stake from  let's say  5% to close to that -- and for assuming that we would have bought 50% of the ICE stake.So we believe that this type of progress in the optionality of one day doing something with Euroclear if and when the Euroclear situation is actionable was not justifying the deployment of in this particular case approximately for the sake of the argument of 5% or 4%  let's say  €350 million. And we believe in other words that the capital of our shareholders is better deployed in due course to a situation where we can extract synergies.That was the rationale of not bidding for the stake. And that's an illustration of the sort of very strong M&A discipline that I described earlier on when -- in the previous question of one of your colleagues.Johannes ThormannPerfect. Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahI'll give the floor to Anthony for your questions on the CSD accounts.Anthony AttiaThank you Stéphane. So on the -- on our four synergies  as you might know we have two different accounts management models. One is the one in Italy and in Portugal where we have omnibus accounts and it's the custodians on clients who are managing the relationship with the retail. And in Denmark and in Norway  the CSDs have the direct management of the retail account  that's a different revenue stream.Last year  we observed a significant return of the retail investors on the equity market on the stock exchange  which had a consequence to increase the number of accounts opened in the CSD. So we had new accounts that have been opened and also the increase of the settlement instruction processed by the CSD as a consequence of the trading on exchange.In Q1 this year  as I said  we have a stabilization of the number of accounts. So  we -- very few accounts were closed  and so we see a normalization of the number of accounts. And as Giorgio explained  a drop in retail activity  which has the consequence to have a drop in settlement activities as well.Giorgio ModicaYes. So in other words people kept their accounts and traded less. So this -- to a certain extent  the number of accounts is the stock and the settlement instruction is a flow that comes from the stock. So  coming to your question about the revenue capture  -- so the first element and I believe that your question deserves a complete answer.So the first element that I wanted to highlight is when -- two years ago  we were highlighting that 0.50 was a run rate and we were anticipating a reduction of the revenue capture. That was not including Borsa Italiana  whereas the 0.47 does include Borsa Italiana. And when we take into consideration Euronext alone  we are still above the 0.50 that we guided the market to be a sustainable long-term target.So what is happening and why the average fee  have trended down. So there are a couple of key drivers. The first one is that the revenue capture of Borsa Italiana is more sensible to the average size of trade  which means that it benefits from a lower average size and get diluted when the average size increases. So this is one of the reasons why you have seen the average revenue capture trending down.And the second element is the behavior of our clients within the order book. Now we have more and more liquidity providers  which are able to comply with the highest standard in terms of execution and therefore  they are having access as they had in the past to fee segments  which are lower than the average one.So the combination of these two trends explained the 0.47  which we believe is sustainable overall into the new market conditions. But again  the 0.47 shall not be compared to the target we gave to the market of 0.50  because that one was excluding Borsa Italiana  which today on average has lower average fees with respect to the rest of the Euronext markets.Johannes ThormannPerfect. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Reg Watson from ING. Please go ahead.Reg WatsonGiorgio  apologies if this has already been asked and answered  but as well as improving your guidance for the underlying cost for this year  you also improved your guidance for the one-off costs out to 2024. Have you changed the €50 million guidance for one-off costs for 2022? And if not why not? So perhaps a little bit of color on the phasing there.And then second question for Stéphane. The strategic flexibility that you mentioned  there are other forces in Europe  which are of acquiring or consolidating platform businesses. Do you find that attractive as a strategic option for Euronext as well? Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahOkay. First of all  let me apologize  because that will have to be the last set of questions  because we have to run to the Annual General Meeting in a few minutes  so apologies for the ones who could not ask questions. On your strategic question  yes  there are still single country or several countries exchange or market infrastructures in Europe.As I said on many occasions  the Euronext federal model is an open model. We are happy to welcome within our open federal governance or open federal supervision or open single liquidity pool single order book enabled by a single technology platform  exchanges that we want to address the issues of scalability attractiveness of the local market exchanges that want to combine the continuity of their relatively autonomy and identity while being part of something that is scalable.And we have from time-to-time dialogues with exchanges  who need to decide what they want to do. But in Europe  there are all sorts of situations. There are large market infrastructures that are very local in terms of culture and very diversified and where the exchange part has become a minimal part of the business.You have other exchanges that are very focused on the historical core exchange business and want to remain independent  because they don't mind the weaknesses of the drawbacks of being relatively small and the others who are really thinking about consolidation.But it's a game of consenting adults and things happen when everyone is ready to accept or to find the mutual benefits and the compromise that go with mergers and with consolidation.So we monitor very  very precisely in details  every situation in Europe whether they are actionable or not  because this is our core mission to build the leading pan-European market infrastructure in Europe. And to make sure that we build the backbone of the capital market vision. So this is at the core of our attention. Giorgio  …Giorgio ModicaYeah.Stéphane Boujnah…on the guidance?Giorgio ModicaSo the very fair question. So the point is that  we made a reassessment of the overall integration costs  as well taking into account that the big part to a certain extent is going to be delivered on the 6th of June. And we came up with the conclusion that  150 is good enough for us to deliver. However  the reason why we didn't change the €50 million is that  we don't want to put ourselves in the position to miss a target potentially  if we accelerate delivery. As you know  many times acceleration means acceleration of cost as well.So when it comes to the phasing we kept the previous phasing and again  not because we are shy  but because we know that sometimes acceleration and strategic flexibility we need to capture the opportunity we will have in the next quarter might trigger anticipating some cost or moving costs from one quarter to the other. So this is the reason  why we decided to be less specific on non-underlying costs than we have been on underlying costs.Reg WatsonOkay. Perfect and thank you.OperatorThere are no further questions in the queue. So I will hand the call back to your host  for some closing remarks.Stéphane BoujnahThank you very much.

The AGM's resolution is valid only if it has been supported by shareholders representing not less than nine tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the shareholders' meeting. Item 11 Kanoka Invest AS (""Kanoka"")  representing approximately 2 4 per cent of the shares in the Company  proposes that the AGM resolves on the adoption of a long- term incentive program to the Company's current chairman of the board of directors through a directed issue of warrants.

5176,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.smallcapnews.co.uk/sweden-and-finland-take-a-historic-step-by-applying-to-join-nato/,Sweden and Finland take a “historic step” by applying to join NATO,1 day ago,The ambassadors of Sweden and Finland to NATO submitted their applications to join the alliance on Wednesday at the headquarters of the Transatlantic Organization.in Brussels  where they met the Secretary-General of the Allies  Jens Stoltenberg  who described the move as “historic”.The law was passed today after the Finnish parliament approved joining the alliance and the Swedish government informed of its decision to apply to join that organisation. Finnish diplomat Klaus Korhonen and Swedish diplomat Axel Wernhoff hand-delivered their countries’ applications to join NATO to Stoltenberg  with the Allies Secretary-General later describing the requests as a “historic step”.“Today’s applications are a historic step ” Stoltenberg said. He added that todayGood day at a critical time for our safety.” He thanked both countries for submitting admission applications. “Every nation has the right to choose its own path ” he said in a brief statement. “Both of you made a choice after rigorous democratic processes  and I warmly welcome the applications of Finland and Sweden to join NATO.”He stressed that Helsinki and Stockholm are the “closest partners” of the alliance  adding that their entry into the transatlantic organization “will increase our common security.” “Allies will now consider the next steps on your path to NATO. The security interests of all allies must be taken into account and we are determined to solve all problems and reach quick conclusions ” he said.Turkey  a member of NATO  announced its opposition To the entry of Sweden and Finland into the alliance because it believes that both countries maintain a policy of welcoming Kurdish militants. The accession of new members to the alliance is a decision taken unanimously by the countries of the transatlantic organization  so Ankara’s approval is required. In any case  The United States has already expressed confidence that Turkey can finally give the green light to enter the Scandinavian countries.Stoltenberg noted that in recent days there have been announcements from NATO members that they pledge to protect the security of Finland and Sweden. These announcements respond to concerns about a hypothetical attack by Russia against these countries between when they apply to join the alliance until they become full members.“NATO is already vigilant in the Baltic region and NATO and allied forces will continue to adapt as needed. All Allies agree on the importance of NATO expansion. We all agree that we must stay together and that this is a historic moment  and we must take advantage of it ” said Stoltenberg.The Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Finland and Sweden to apply to join the alliance  thus abandoning their traditional neutrality.accelerated processAfter submitting applications for Finnish and Swedish membership  the North Atlantic Council  NATO’s highest decision-making body  which includes member states  will meet to discuss Helsinki and Stockholm’s requests. This meeting is likely to take place today.Depending on how talks develop between allies in the North Atlantic Council  Finland and Sweden will be invited to start accession negotiations at NATO headquarters.These negotiations are meetings between representatives of NATO  Finland and Sweden on the two countries’ ability to meet the requirements for membership in the transatlantic organization.If today’s North Atlantic Council meeting goes well  accession talks could start on Thursday or Friday and continue for a day or two.After these negotiations  it was time for NATO members to sign and ratify the protocols for joining the Finland-Sweden alliance.The processes for ratification of accession protocols differ from country to country. While the US requires the approval of two-thirds of its members of the Senate  a formal vote in Parliament in the UK is not necessary.After the allies’ endorsement  the NATO Secretary General invited potential new members to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  from which the alliance was born.The invited countries then join NATO according to their national procedures  and once Finland and Sweden deposit their accession documents with the US State Department  they officially become members of NATO.Although it is not known how long the whole process will take in the case of Finland and Sweden  the intention is for both Nordic countries to become full members of NATO quickly.Russia says it can repay the debt in rublesRussia will pay its foreign debt in rubles  if the exception of the United States allowing it to do so in dollars is not renewed until the 25th and does not intend to declare any suspension of payments.Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said today.“We will not announce any suspension of payments. We have money ” the minister was quoted by Interfax as saying at the “New Knowledge” educational conference.“On May 25  our license for the right to pay foreign debts (in dollars) expires. On the 26th they will say that we do not have this right  and after that they will say that Russia has not paid its debts ” he said.He stressed that “we will pay foreign investors in rubles if they shut down our Western infrastructure” to do so in dollars.Bloomberg reported that the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) The United States will likely allow the exemption license that was approved shortly after the imposition of US sanctions on Russia over its military intervention in Ukraine to expire..This permission allowed Russia to pay interest and avoid defaulting on its government debt.So far  it has managed to avoid a suspension of payments after at the end of April it managed to pay two Eurobond coupons due in 2022 and 2024 for 649.2 million US dollars at the last minute after resorting to its reserves in this currency.He first tried to pay the interest in rubles through the Russian depository entity NSD  which was rejected by the international depository Euroclear.As of February 1  the country’s total external public debt was $59.5 billion  including $38.97 billion for foreign loans in bonds.In total  Russia currently has 15 active bonds with maturities from 2022 to 2047.,neutral,0.03,0.75,0.21,mixed,0.13,0.2,0.67,True,English,"['historic step', 'Sweden', 'Finland', 'NATO', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'New Knowledge” educational conference', 'Swedish diplomat Axel Wernhoff', 'North Atlantic Treaty Organization', 'North Atlantic Council meeting', 'highest decision-making body', 'rigorous democratic processes', 'US State Department', 'potential new members', 'The United States', 'two countries’ ability', 'NATO Secretary General', 'Russian invasion', 'Finnish diplomat', 'Swedish government', 'Transatlantic Organization', 'Swedish membership', 'Klaus Korhonen', 'historic step', 'brief statement', 'closest partners', 'next steps', 'quick conclusions', 'Kurdish militants', 'green light', 'recent days', 'hypothetical attack', 'Baltic region', 'allied forces', 'historic moment', 'traditional neutrality', 'formal vote', 'national procedures', 'full members', 'member states', 'accession documents', 'common security', 'security interests', 'all allies', 'allies’ endorsement', 'Scandinavian countries', 'Nordic countries', 'critical time', 'accelerated process', 'foreign debt', 'NATO expansion', 'admission applications', 'accession talks', 'accession protocols', 'NATO members', 'Jens Stoltenberg', 'Finnish parliament', 'accession negotiations', 'Finland-Sweden alliance', 'Allies Secretary-General', 'countries’ applications', 'NATO headquarters', 'debts', 'ambassadors', 'Wednesday', 'Brussels', 'move', 'law', 'organisation', 'requests', 'safety', 'right', 'path', 'choice', 'Helsinki', 'Stockholm', 'entry', 'account', 'problems', 'Turkey', 'opposition', 'policy', 'Ankara', 'approval', 'case', 'confidence', 'announcements', 'concerns', 'importance', 'advantage', 'Ukraine', 'place', 'meetings', 'representatives', 'requirements', 'today', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'ratification', 'country', 'two-thirds', 'Senate', 'intention', 'rubles', 'exception', 'dollars', '25th', 'suspension', 'payments', 'money', 'Interfax', 'May', 'license', '26th']",2022-05-18,2022-05-19,smallcapnews.co.uk

In accordance with Article 135 of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) the adoption of the resolution also required that at least 51 per cent of the nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue be represented at the meeting. As this requirement was not met  the Board has convened an extraordinary general meeting to take a fresh vote on this proposal in accordance with the rules set out in Article 135(1)(b) of the Companies Act (Cap.386 of the Laws of Malta).At this EGM the resolution may be passed by shareholder / holder of SDRs having the right to attend and vote at the meeting holding in the aggregate not less than 75 per cent in nominal value of the shares/SDRs represented and entitled to vote at the meeting. However  if more than half in nominal value of all the shares/SDRs having the right to vote at the meeting is represented at that meeting  a simple majority in nominal value of such shares/SDRs so represented shall suffice.The Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition of shares/SDRs shall take place on NasdaqStockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares/SDRs to all shareholders. The purchases may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on actual market price and terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts.The objective of the purchase is to achieve added value for the Company's shareholders (includingthrough the implementation of the share buy-back program previously announced) and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure.Following the purchase  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or issue to employees under a Share Option programme or Share Performance Scheme.Once purchased under the Maltese Companies Act further shareholder approval will be required before those shares could be cancelled only. Shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to the Company's share buyback program will be cancelled (refer to Agenda item 8). A separate authorisation for such cancellation is being recommended pursuant to Resolution (2);If used as consideration for an acquisition  the intention would be that the actual Shares/SDRs would be offered to any potential transferor.Information about proposals related to Agenda item 8Share cancellationThe Board of Directors has already submitted this proposal for the consideration of the AGM.At the AGM  36.70 per cent in nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue were represented at the meeting and 99.99 per cent of those represented (36.69 per cent of the total shares/SDRs in issue) voted in favour of granting such authorisation. In accordance with Article 135 of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) the adoption of the resolution also required that at least 51 per cent of the nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue be represented at the meeting. As this requirement was not met  the Board has convened an extraordinary general meeting to take a fresh vote on this proposal in accordance with the rules set out in Article 135(1)(b) of the Companies Act (Cap.386 of the Laws of Malta).At this EGM the resolution may be passed by shareholder / holder of SDRs having the right to attend and vote at the meeting holding in the aggregate not less than 75 per cent in nominal value of the shares/SDRs represented and entitled to vote at the meeting. However  if more than half in nominal value of all the shares/SDRs having the right to vote at the meeting is represented at that meeting  a simple majority in nominal value of such shares/SDRs so represented shall suffice.The directors may decide to cancel all or some of shares/SDRs acquired pursuant to the buy-back program.The Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) stipulates that an extraordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company is required in order to approve the reduction in the issued share capital of the Company.Such resolution needs to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in Malta  who will publish details of such reduction. Creditors of the Company will then have a period of three months in which they can contest the reduction in capital. Upon the lapse of the three-month period  assuming that no contestations are received  the reduction in share capital can become effective.In order to reflect the changes in the issued share capital  a revised memorandum of association of the Company indicating the reduced number of shares then in issue in the capital of the Company will need to be submitted to the Registrar of Companies.The reduction in issued share capital will take place at such intervals and in such amounts (subject to the maximum amount of GBP 14 375) as the directors shall determine from time to time.Information about proposals related to Agenda item 9Share issueThe Board of Directors has already submitted this proposal for the consideration of the AGM.At the AGM  36.70 per cent in nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue were represented at the meeting and 100 per cent of those represented (36.70 per cent of the total shares/SDRs in issue) voted in favour of granting such authorisation.

However  if more than half in nominal value of all the shares/SDRs having the right to vote at the meeting is represented at that meeting  a simple majority in nominal value of such shares/SDRs so represented shall suffice.The objectives of the authorisation to be granted in terms of this resolution are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares/SDRs on each issue date that will be used in determining the price at which shares/SDRs will be issued  should be the same as the market value of the shares/SDRs listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. A cap of 23 million ordinary shares/SDRs in the Company is being requested in connection with this authorisation. The cap will be reduced by the amount of any shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to Resolution (1) (but excluding shares / SDRs not already bought back by the Company on the date of the adoption of the resolution).For information on how personal data is processed please seehttps://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfBy order of the BoardKindred Group plcMalta  13 May 2022CONTACT:For more information:Johan Wilsby  Chief Financial Officerjohan.wilsby@kindredgroup.comThis information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/kindred-group/r/notice-to-extraordinary-general-meeting-of-kindred-group-plc c3570587The following files are available for download:",neutral,0.03,0.92,0.05,positive,0.56,0.36,0.08,True,English,"['Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Kindred Group plc', 'Notice', 'Swedish Depository Receipts', 'actual market price', '2023 Annual General Meeting', 'Euroclear Sweden AB', 'Kindred Group plc', 'EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING', 'GBP 0.000625 Ordinary Shares/SDRs', 'minimum price', 'maximum price', 'Companies Act', 'voting rights', 'custodian bank', 'supporting documentation', 'voting procedure', 'support purposes', 'voting list', 'inter alia', 'minimum consideration', 'multiple occasions', 'Friday 10 June', 'Wednesday 1 June', 'Friday 3 June', 'regular mail', 'extraordinary resolution', 'following business', 'following resolutions', 'Record Date', '10:00AM CEST', 'SDR holder', 'maximum number', 'two person', ""Directors' meeting"", 'share capital', 'VALLETTA', 'Malta', 'NOTICE', 'EGM', 'Company', 'terms', 'article', 'Laws', 'office', 'Regeringsgatan', 'Stockholm', 'holders', 'register', '23:59PM', 'votes', 'link', 'anmalan', 'vpc', 'euroclearproxy', 'BankID', 'behalf', 'someone', 'access', 'printing', 'kindredgroup', 'courier', 'Box', 'Requirement', 'holding', 'name', 'nominee', 'brokerage', 'authority', 'Power', 'Attorney', 'original', 'Story', 'people', 'event', 'assistance', 'questions', 'generalmeetingservice', 'telephone', 'channels', 'conversions', '27 May', 'Agenda', '1 Opening', '2 Election', 'Chairman', 'approval', '5 Election', 'minutes', '6 Determination', 'Board', '9 March', 'buyback', 'added', 'value', 'Cap.', 'subscription', 'authorisation', 'conditions', 'acquisitions', 'duration', 'period', 'purchases', '1 SEK', 'tax', '300 SEK', 'place', 'completion', 'means', 'cancellation']",2022-05-19,2022-05-19,finance.yahoo.com

The study was featured in a paper published on the journal’s website last month titled  “The Impact of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy on the Quality of Life of Patients and Their Relatives: A Qualitative Study”. It is the first of its kind to explore this condition and its impact for patients and relatives in four different countries.The study determined that the impact of LHON extends beyond vision-related activity limitations  while addressing its psychosocial impact. It concluded that helping patients and their relatives adapt and cope with vision loss is vital. An accurate and timely diagnosis for patients is also crucial to address these issues and also to allow for early intervention.“This study is the first to describe the impact of LHON on the families of affected individuals. Partners and families of affected individuals take on many responsibilities and shoulder some of the burden of LHON. The impact that LHON has on partners and families has not been reported previously and it is vital that we acknowledge the support and care that they provide ” explained Patrick Yu-Wai-Man  MD  PhD  Moorfields Eye Hospital and Department of Clinical Neurosciences  University of Cambridge  United Kingdom.Participants reported feeling devastated by the diagnosis of LHON after a lengthy and worrisome diagnostic journey. They were also frustrated by the loss of autonomy that affected their relatives. Participants described challenges across several domains: physical capabilities  emotional well-being  interpersonal relationships  work and studies  finances  and recreational activities.Additionally  the study determined that despite residing in different countries  LHON patients and their relatives described similar experiences in the four areas of focus in this study. These areas include (1) experience leading to the point of diagnosis; (2) impact of their condition on various aspects of life; (3) perceptions about treatment; and (4) expectations toward future therapies.“This study confirms what we have known all along in the eye clinic - that LHON impacts every aspect of quality of life  not just activities that rely on vision. Understanding how LHON affects individuals who develop vision loss enables doctors to intervene early and provide care that will improve the quality of life of affected individuals ” commented Benson Chen  MD  Department of Clinical Neurosciences  University of Cambridge  United Kingdom. “This might include different kinds of assessments in the eye clinic that measure the emotional and psychological impact of LHON or developing the referral pathways that enable affected individuals to access psychological support and work or skills re-training ” he added.LHON is an inherited mitochondrial disease characterized by severe bilateral vision loss and chronic visual impairment. The objective of this study was to comprehensively explore the impact of LHON on the lives of patients and their relatives at the time of diagnosis and now.The qualitative study design encompassed eight focus group interviews conducted in France  Germany  the United Kingdom  and the United States  involving 17 individuals with m.11778G>A mutation and their relatives. Separate focus groups for patients and their relatives were facilitated by a moderator in French  German  or English. Neuro-ophthalmologists in the four countries who participated helped to identify additional patients who fulfilled under-represented sampling criteria. The four countries were selected because all have established networks of individuals with LHON and were places where previous LHON studies have been conducted.Focus group interviews were conducted as part of a market research study sponsored by GenSight Biologics  and independently designed and conducted by groupH  a health care market research and analytics firm. The design and conduct of the study complied with the European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association and British Healthcare Business Intelligence Association guidelines.“We  at GenSight  have long been convinced that by providing an innovative therapeutic solution for LHON we would offer much more than an improved vision. Documenting the impact of LHON experienced by all study participants highlights the fact that we could empower patients and improve their ability to enjoy a fulfilling life  while easing the demands on their loved ones. This is precisely why we are dedicated to developing a long-lasting therapeutic solution for patients with LHON ” explained Magali Taiel  Chief Medical Officer of GenSight. “We are hopeful that we may one day help patients to recover not only their vision  but also their sense of autonomy and well-being ” she added.Full text versions of this article are available on the journal’s website: https://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/Abstract/9900/The_Impact_of_Leber_Hereditary_Optic_Neuropathy_on.77.aspx.*About the paper:The Impact of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy on the Quality of Life of Patients and Their Relatives: A Qualitative StudyAuthors: Benson S.

GenSight Biologics’ pipeline leverages two core technology platforms  the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) and optogenetics  to help preserve or restore vision in patients suffering from blinding retinal diseases. GenSight Biologics’ lead product candidate  LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)  has been submitted for marketing approval in Europe for the treatment of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)  a rare mitochondrial disease affecting primarily teens and young adults that leads to irreversible blindness. Using its gene therapy-based approach  GenSight Biologics’ product candidates are designed to be administered in a single treatment to each eye by intravitreal injection to offer patients a sustainable functional visual recovery.About Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease  characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells that results in brutal and irreversible vision loss that can lead to legal blindness  and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. LHON is associated with painless  sudden loss of central vision in the 1st eye  with the 2nd eye sequentially impaired.

Guided by mentors from Dassault Systèmes and supported by the company’s 3DEXPERIENCE Edu – whose programs help seven million students each year develop in-demand industry skills on Dassault Systèmes solutions – the teams quickly adopted the same integrated modelling  simulation  information intelligence and collaboration applications used by industry globally  and created scientifically accurate  data-enriched virtual twins of the sites that open up a new understanding of their structure.The virtual twins represent both the visible and the invisible  revealing insights into each structure’s design  what was partially lost  totally lost or damaged over time  how this design achievement has impacted history  and how it can influence future designs. Empowered with new technical knowledge and know-how gained during the program  the students can apply their skills once they enter the workforce  while the virtual twins can be used by others to teach  study and learn.“Dassault Systèmes is a science-based and purpose-driven company. We’ve been a catalyst for human progress for 40 years. Our passion and creativity have enabled the virtual world to improve and extend the real world  sparking conversations that build bridges between the generations that made past achievements possible and those that will imagine future ones ” said Victoire de Margerie  Vice President  Corporate Equity  Marketing & Communications  Dassault Systèmes. “‘Living Heritage’ is a celebration of this shared heritage. It invites us to explore how today’s solutions can give us a greater understanding of the past – unlocking learning opportunities and helping the next generation map our way to a better future. We’ve been a strong partner of the academic world for four decades. We are always amazed by the creativity of the students who use our 3DEXPERIENCE platform.”Teams will showcase their “Living Heritage” projects at the Cité de la Réussite in Paris June 25-26  including a virtual reality experience that enables anyone to discover the sites in an interactive way. The projects can also be viewed on Dassault Systèmes’ website.Launched in 2020  “The Only Progress is Human” features a series of “acts” aimed to increase awareness of societal and environmental challenges and inspire the use of virtual worlds to drive sustainable innovations. In addition to “Living Heritage ” these acts have included “Virtual Harmony ” a unique musical and visual experience demonstrating how virtual worlds can change the way we experience emotions  and “Water for Life ” a set of initiatives to help industry consume smarter and protect the world’s most precious resource.###FOR MORE INFORMATIONDassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform  3D design software  3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions: http://www.3ds.comSHARE THIS ON TWITTER#LivingHeritage  the next #progressishuman act from @Dassault3DS recreates six historic sites in the virtual world #3DEXPERIENCE for future generationsConnect with Dassault Systèmes onTwitter Facebook LinkedIn YoutubeABOUT DASSAULT SYSTÈMESDassault Systèmes  the 3DEXPERIENCE Company  is a catalyst for human progress.

The translational data  “FcRn Antagonism Leads to a Decrease of Desmoglein-Specific B Cells: Secondary Analysis of a Phase 2 Study of Efgartigimod in Pemphigus Vulgaris and Pemphigus Foliaceus” were published in the journal Frontiers of Immunology.The novel translational data  along with previously published translational data in Cells  will also be presented in a symposium today at the Society for Investigative Dermatology (SID) Annual Meeting at 7:30am PT. The complete results from the Phase 2 study of efgartigimod for the treatment of pemphigus were published in the British Journal of Dermatology.“The publication today highlights the value of our collaborative research model with leading academic centers of excellence  revealing an exciting set of new translational data on the pathophysiology of autoimmune skin blistering diseases and the therapeutic rationale of FcRn blockade in pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid ” said Hans de Haard  Ph.D.  Chief Scientific Officer of argenx. “We believe the secondary analysis of our Phase 2 study shows the potential role of FcRn blockade to extend beyond IgG antibody reduction to include an immunomodulatory effect on autoantigen-specific B-cells  which may account for the durable responses observed in the study. We understand the serious unmet need of people living with pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid and are committed to continuing this research on their behalf to bring forward an innovative new treatment option.”Story continuesHighlights from Published Translational Data:Pemphigus and BP are IgG-mediated autoimmune skin blistering diseases In pemphigus  IgG autoantibodies against Dsg-1 and Dsg-3 cause acantholysis or disruption of keratinocyte adhesion; new data suggest role of additional non-desmoglein IgG autoantibodies in pemphigus pathophysiology In BP  IgG autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins (BP180 and BP230) at the dermal-epidermal junction drive pathophysiology of diseaseIn a secondary analysis of a subset of patients in the Phase 2 study of efgartigimod in pemphigus : Efgartigimod treatment resulted in sustained reduction of antigen - specific B - cells in participants with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and foliaceus  maintained following treatment cessation  and which correlated with sustained clinical improvement while total IgG returned to near baseline levels Median CD19+ B- cells remained within normal limits at all timepoints measured  and no new safety signals were detected N o observed effect on total leukocytes  neutrophils  monocytes  or lymphocytes in patients treated with long-term efgartigimod therapy  however frequency of CD19+ B-cells in circulation was observed to decrease following efgartigimod treatmentEfgartigimod was shown to efficiently rescue the loss of keratinocyte adhesion upon anti-Dsg-3 antibodies (anti-Dsg3) and PV IgG treatment  indicating that stabilization of keratinocyte adhesion may present a novel treatment paradigm for pemphigusAbout EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases.About PemphigusPemphigus is a rare group of chronic blistering autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes  and are characterized by painful blisters  erosions and acantholysis  or disruption of keratinocyte adhesion. Blisters often break open  causing serious pain and increased risk of infection. Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceous are the most common forms of pemphigus.About Bullous Pemphigoid (BP)BP is a severe  rare  chronic and recurrent autoimmune disorder characterized by fluid-filled blisters  itching  and redness of the skin. It is the most common subepidermal autoimmune blistering disease. In severe cases with widespread blistering  risk of infection can be life-threatening. Fear of infection and the unpredictable nature of flare ups often has a significant impact on quality of life and psychological well-being.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first-and-only approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S. and Japan. The Company is evaluating efgartigimod in multiple serious autoimmune diseases and advancing several earlier stage experimental medicines within its therapeutic franchises.

Having already provided clinical validation of the novel  physics-based MoA of NBTXR3 in soft tissue sarcoma  showed the potential survival benefit as a monotherapy in head and neck cancer  replicated the high response rate across multiple cancer types  and reported data suggesting the potential to combine with and expand the benefits of checkpoint inhibitors to more patients  we remain steadfast in our conviction that NBTXR3 has the potential to radically impact the future of cancer care for millions of patients ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder and chairman of the executive board of Nanobiotix. “To ensure this fundamental value as we continue to see unprecedented deterioration in the capital markets  we are taking proactive steps to adjust our cost structure  reduce spend  and focus our operational activities on building a head and neck franchise. We believe that by beginning with single agent approval in locally advanced head and neck cancer and expanding through combinations across treatment modalities will create a model that can be replicated across solid tumor indications  improving patient outcomes and driving significant value to shareholders.”Prioritizing Registration Programs and Reducing Operating ExpensesNanobiotix is pursuing various initiatives to reduce operating costs while maintaining targeted research efforts focused on the continued execution of its pivotal phase III study in LA-HNSCC  the continuation of I/O combination Study 1100  and the development of a registration pathway in I/O combination therapy while leveraging its on-going strategic collaboration with MD Anderson to validate the feasibility of future development opportunities. In prioritizing late-stage programs and strategic collaborations  the company plans to deprioritize direct funding in several areas  including:Modifying or postponing additional company-sponsored clinical trials   including planned amendments to Study 102 reducing follow-up time from 24 to 12 months and postponement of post-marketing studies previously planned in soft tissue sarcoma  including planned amendments to Study 102 reducing follow-up time from 24 to 12 months and postponement of post-marketing studies previously planned in soft tissue sarcoma Reducing on-going and previously planned preclinical research   including development activities related to the Company’s subsidiary  Curadigm  including development activities related to the Company’s subsidiary  Curadigm Adjusting planned manufacturing activities to support revised preclinical and clinical development activitiesAdapting infrastructure  including reducing satellite office facilities and implementing a temporary hiring-freezeThese initiatives are expected to reduce the Company’s cash burn by approximately €12-15 million  which will be reflected in Nanobiotix’ financial outlook for 2022 and 2023.First Quarter Financial UpdatesNanobiotix reported cash  cash equivalents  and short-term investments totaling €70.6 million as of March 31  2022  compared to €83.9M as of December 31  2021. To supplement its financial resources  Nanobiotix has established an equity financing line with Kepler Cheuvreux. This line of financing will provide optionality and create near-term flexibility  if needed  as the company continues efforts to reduce operating expenses and  potentially  restructure its existing debt facilities. Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  Nanobiotix anticipates that the available capital will fund its operations into  at least  the fourth quarter of 2023.Implementing Equity Line Financing to Strengthen Financial FlexibilityIn accordance with the terms of this agreement  Kepler Cheuvreux committed to underwrite up to 5 200 000 shares representing  for information purposes  an issued amount of approximately €25m1  over a maximum timeframe of 24 months  provided the contractual conditions are met. Should Nanobiotix choose to use this facility  the shares will be issued based on the volume-weighted average share price on Euronext: Paris for the two trading days prior to issuance  minus a maximum discount 5.0%. In addition to controlling if and when to access capital  including consideration of current share valuation  Nanobiotix has guaranteed access to capital to fund operations along with control over potential dilution despite any sustained turbulence in the broader market  while retaining the right to suspend the implementation of the equity line or terminate this agreement at any time  free of charge.Agreements have been set up based on and in accordance with the 21st resolution from the annual shareholders meeting of April 28  2021. Should Nanobiotix choose to use this facility  the number of shares issued under this agreement and admitted to trading will be disclosed on the Company’s website. In accordance with the provisions of the General Regulations of the French Financial Markets Authority (“AMF”)  this financial operation will not be subject to a prospectus requiring a visa from the AMF.If this financing line were to be fully used with the issue of 5 200 000 shares  a shareholder holding 1.00% of the capital of Nanobiotix before it is set up  would see their stake reduced to 0.87% of the capital on an undiluted basis and to 0.84% of the capital on a fully diluted basis.This operation was advised and structured by Vester Finance. Kepler Cheuvreux is the sole underwriter of the facility and is not expected to maintain ownership of any shares issued in conjunction with the equity line.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday  May 19  2022  at 2:00 PM CET/8:00 AM EDT  prior to the open of the US market.

The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company is leveraging its proprietary nanoparticle platform  including its lead product candidate  radiotherapy activated NBTXR3  to develop a pipeline of therapeutic options designed to enhance local and systemic control of solid tumors with an initial focus on the treatment of head and neck cancers.For more information about Nanobiotix  visit us at www.nanobiotix.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.DisclaimerThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws  including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Acceptance of the MAA means VLA2001 is advancing from the rolling review process and beginning the formal review process by the EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP). If the CHMP accepts Valneva’s conditional marketing authorization application  the Company confirms it would expect to receive a positive CHMP opinion in June 2022.If positive opinion is given by the CHMP  the European Commission (EC) will review the recommendation and provide a final decision on the MAA. If granted by the EC  the centralized marketing authorization would be valid in all European Union Member States as well as in Iceland  Liechtenstein  and Norway.ThomasLingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  “The EMA’s acceptance of the filing for VLA2001 is an important step toward product approval. We remain fully committed and dedicated to working jointly with the regulators  the European members states and the European Commission toward making a more traditional and established COVID-19 vaccine technology available to people in Europe.”About VLA2001VLA2001 is currently the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted vaccine candidate in clinical trials against COVID-19 in Europe. It is intended for active immunization of at-risk populations to prevent carriage and symptomatic infection with COVID-19 during the pandemic and for routine vaccination including addressing new variants. VLA2001 may also be suited for boosting  as repeat booster vaccinations have been shown to work well with whole virus inactivated vaccines. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018.

My name is Jess and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. For the duration of the call  your lines will be on listen-only. However  there will be the opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]I will now hand you over to your host  Stéphane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext to begin today’s call. Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahGood morning everybody and thank you for joining us this morning for Euronext first quarter 2022 results conference call and webcast. I am Stéphane Boujnah CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  and I will start with the highlights of the first quarter before handing over to Giorgio Modica  Euronext CFO who will then further develop the main business and financial highlights of the quarter.Moving to slide 4. Before the discussing our first quarter performance  I would like to say a few words on the current situation in Europe. This quarter was marked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And while our exposure to Ukraine  Russia  Belarus is negligible  our European roots are the core DNA of the Euronext project. And as the leading pan-European market infrastructure  we remain extremely concerned by this situation. Clearly this crisis has generated strong volatility across European markets  yet we have continued to provide fair and transparent markets at all times and we have demonstrated the resilience of our business model in those circumstances. We continue to monitor closely the situation notably with regard to the implementation of the sanctions on Russia and Belarus. However  as I just said our exposure to the situation is negligible.Moving now to the presentation of our first quarter results. Euronext reported a very strong performance in the first quarter of 2022 with revenue reaching €395.7 million. This is the highest quarterly revenue we have ever disclosed at Euronext. During the first quarter of 2022  revenue increased by more than 50%. Adjusted EBITDA increased by more than 50% and adjusted net income increased by more than 50%. This is not only due to the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group. Our results were also up year-on-year on a pro forma basis. In other words  including Borsa Italiana Group as if we were owners of these assets in Q1 2021.On that pro forma basis  Euronext reported plus 6% growth in the first quarter revenue this year and plus 11.4% growth in adjusted EBITDA. And this strong performance results from several drivers. On the one hand  both non-volume related revenue and trading activities reported a very strong performance. On the other hand  we benefited from our continued cost discipline combined with the successful ongoing integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and the delivery of the related expected synergies.On the revenue side  our trading activities were driven by the volatile environment at the end of the first quarter of this year. In the meantime non-volume related activities proved also to be resilient. All together  non-volume-related revenue accounted for 55% of total revenue and covered 151% of underlying operating expenses including D&A. And on the cost side  the reported increase for sure in underlying expenses excluding D&A reflects the consolidating costs from the Borsa Italiana Group.But I would like to emphasize that both on a like-for-like basis and on a pro forma basis  the underlying expenses excluding D&A were down compared to last year. This is the result of our continued tight cost control combined with the successful ongoing integration of the Borsa Italiana Group that is enabling us to deliver on the targeted EBITDA synergies.Overall  these numbers translated into a plus 11.4% increase in pro forma adjusted EBITDA to €252.2 million resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of plus 3.1 points to 63.7%. Bottom line  we delivered in the first quarter of 2022  a plus -- sorry a plus 7.3% increase in adjusted EPS at €1.54 per share. On a reported basis  net income was up plus 46.5% to €143.8 million.Giorgio will further detail this financial performance  but our strong performance in Q1 improved our leverage position. It provides us with additional strategic flexibility  as recently recognized by S&P  which confirmed our rating at BBB and improved the outlook from stable to positive.During this third -- first quarter  we pursued the strong momentum around delivery of the integration plan and the delivery of synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group and we pursued the development of the first key migration -- the migration of Core Data Centre which will occur in just a few weeks.With regards to the targeted synergies  we have reached 15.2 million of cumulative run rate EBITDA synergies at the end of this quarter  just 11 months after the closing of the acquisition.Another key achievement is the confirmed go-live of our new green Core Data Centre near Bergamo. Euronext will become the operator of its own Core Data Centre next month. From 6 June 2022  our new Core Data Centre will be live unlocking the first batch of identified business development synergy.And this migration will be the first major milestones within our growth for Impact 2024 strategic plan that will pave the way for the migration of the Italian cash equities and derivatives markets and to the Optiq trading platform in 2023.And I would like to thank our teams and to thank the teams of our clients for this successful migration project that will benefit more broadly the world financial ecosystem and that will help all our clients reduce their carbon footprint.As a result of our progress in the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group and as a result of continued cost control in the first quarter  we are today very pleased to upgrade our 2022 cost guidance  expecting €10 million less of underlying costs and €10 million less of implementation costs.This translates into expected underlying costs for 2022 of €612 million  down from the €622 million previously announced in February this year. In addition  we now expect €150 million of non-recurring implementation costs by 2024  down from €160 million initially announced in November 2021.Moving to the next slide. Allow me to highlight some recent developments in our ESG strategy. As you know  we believe that Euronext must play a critical role to promote the transition of companies to more sustainable business models. We also continued to advance on the different pillars of our FIT for 1.5-degree commitment during this first quarter of 2022.We pursued the development of our ESG offering  as we continue to strengthen the ESG franchise of our national flagship indices. We have welcomed additional issuers of sustainability-linked bonds on our markets.Alongside  the enhancement of our ESG offering  we continue to act as a partner of choice for our clients  publishing or guide for ESG reporting target 1.5 degree and performing the sustainable training initiatives to support our clients in their ESG journey.From internal Euronext corporate perspective  we're also starting to deliver on our own ambitious ESG commitment. As I mentioned  before the migration of our new Core Data Centre near Bergamo  we present a massive milestone towards our FIT four 1.5-degree commitment.Furthermore  we continue to empower our people for example by launching for the third year in a row our 10 shares for all employees program as well as training our employees on climate issues. But for the past few years already 100% of the Euronext employees are shareholders in Euronext.Lastly  as you may have seen in our universal registration document  we have disclosed our first set of targets in line with science-based target initiatives. These targets notably include an expected reduction by at least 42% of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions by 2030 compared to 2020 as well as a reduction of at least 42.6% of our Scope 3 travel carbon emissions by 2030  compared to 2019.So  the assessment to further reduce our emissions is being finalized and we are able -- we will be able to publish our final targets by June 2022.So  I now hand over to Giorgio Modica for the review of our first quarter performance.Giorgio ModicaThank you  Stéphane and good morning everyone. I am now on slide nine. In the first quarter of 2022  Euronext's consolidated revenue and income grew 6% pro forma for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.On a reported basis  revenue and income grew 58.8% to €395.7 million  representing an increase of €146.6 million. These strong results were driven by the growth of both loan volume-related activities and trading and the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group.On a like-for-like basis and at currencies  i.e. mainly excluding Borsa Italiana Group consolidation that started in the first quarter of 2021  Euronext's consolidated revenue was up 6.9% compared to the first quarter of 2021.We recorded good performance across different business lines. Trading revenue increased €150.8 million  up 9.9% pro forma and 57.2% on a reported basis  resulting from strong trading activity across all asset classes and products.Post trade revenue increased 3.1% pro forma and 51.7% on a reported basis to €95.8 million  driven by the continued strong activity. Clearing revenue profited from the highly volatile environment  while custody investment revenue was stable.Advanced data service revenue increased 3.4% pro forma and 43.9% on a reported basis to €52.6 million due to a solid core data business performance. Listing revenue grew 12.4% pro forma and 42.9% on a reported basis to €55.4 million. The listing activity was resilient and Euronext confirmed its leading position as the leading venue for equity and ETF listings in Europe and for bond listings worldwide.In terms of revenue mix in the first quarter of 2022  non-volume-related revenue accounted for 55% of total group revenue versus 58% pro forma in the first quarter 2021 as a result of the increasing relevance of our non-volume-related revenue in our business mix even during periods of high trading activity.I would like to highlight that to better reflect the segmentation of our revenue mix between volume-related and non-volume-related revenues from this quarter  we include within our non-volume-related revenue part of the revenue of clearing such as the net treasury income and membership fees. Lastly  non-volume-related revenues covered 151% of our underlying operating costs excluding D&A compared to 147% pro forma last year.Moving to the next slide for listing. I'm on slide 10. Listing revenue was €55.4 million  an increase of 12.4% on a pro forma basis and 42.9% on a reported basis compared to the first quarter of 2021. To better understand this trend  I would like to highlight that according to the principles of IFRS 15  admission revenues are recognized over a period of time  which for Euronext mostly ranges between three and five years. As a result  in the first quarter of 2022  we benefited from the exceptional listing activity of 2021  offsetting a softer IPO environment this quarter.In detail  during the first quarter of 2022  Euronext was able to confirm its leading position in Europe for primary equity listing counting 22 new listing despite the recent headwinds to the listing activity.Euronext also recorded the three largest IPO in Europe in terms of money raised and continue to demonstrate its activity as a spark hub. In the first quarter of 2022  €2.2 billion was raised on Euronext primary market  which represents 73% of the total money raised on primary markets all over Europe.As far as secondary issues are concerned  €2.6 billion were raised in the first quarter of 2022. The deal pipeline remains strong  but market conditions have worsened with several issues postponing the execution of deals. If current market conditions  persists  next quarter might not be as strong as the first quarter.Moving to ETF  once again  we confirm in the first quarter of 2022 our position as the number one listing venue for ETF with 3 679 ETFs listed at the end of March 2022. Euronext also reinforced its position as the leading venue for bond listing worldwide with over 52 000 bonds listed across all Euronext markets and continue to grow its ESG bond listing franchise.In the first quarter of 2022  €320.5 billion in debt was raised on Euronext's markets. Overall this brings us to a total of €325.2 billion  raised in equity and debt on Euronext market in the first quarter of 2022.Lastly  Euronext Corporate Services reported a record quarter in terms of revenues at €10.5 million. The plus 15.7% increase on year  results from a strong performance across services and increasing commercial traction in Italy.Like-for-like listing and corporate service revenues increased 12.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. In summary  this quarter demonstrates the strength of our equity and debt listing businesses in highly volatile market conditions.Let's move to our trading business  next on slide 11  and start with cash trading. On a pro forma basis including Borsa Italiana  ADV increased 19.8% to €15.5 billion  representing the second strongest quarter ever recorded on Euronext equity markets  after the first quarter of 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.Average revenue capture over the quarter was at 0.47 basis points and the market share averaged 68.1%  including Borsa Italiana. This level of average fee is impacted by the dilution coming from the consolidation of Borsa Italiana and the normalization of market behaviors and the average size of orders. Excluding Borsa Italiana  the average fee remains above 0.50 basis points. Cash trading revenues increased 11.1% pro forma and 35.7% on a reported basis to €94 million.Moving on to derivative trading  derivative trading revenue was up 9.3% pro forma and 37.5% on a reported basis to €16.1 million in this quarter. Pro forma average daily volumes on financial derivatives was up  6.1% from the first quarter of 2021  reflecting the high volatility environment for equity derivatives. Commodities reported another record quarter  while average daily volumes were up 6.1% compared to an already strong quarter in the first quarter of 2021. The average revenue capture over the quarter for derivative trading was €0.30 per lot.Lastly  fixed income trading  fixed income trading reported revenue at €24.4 million  primarily resulting from the consolidation of MTS. On a pro forma basis  fixed income revenue increased 4.7%. In the first quarter 2022  MTS cash generated $16.9 million of revenues and MTS repo generated €5.2 million in revenue. Repo trading saw a strong traction this quarter with terms ADV  up 25% to €347.9 billion. MTS cash maintained a robust performance in market dominated by raising interest rates with ADV volumes down only 1.6% versus the exceptional Q1 2021 to €22.7 billion.Let's continue with trading on slide 12  and let's start with the FX business. The first quarter of 2022 was the second best quarter ever for Euronext FX  after the first quarter of 2020  both in terms of revenue and average daily volumes. Thanks to the positive impact of volatility. Euronext reported average spot FX trading volumes of $24.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022  up 14.4% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Spot effect sterling revenues increased 18%  compared to the first quarter of 2021 at €7.2 million.Power Trading reported €9.1 million in revenue this quarter  a solid growth of 8.4% compared to the first quarter of 2021  as a result of a larger footprint in Central Europe and a solid performance in the UK and in the Nordics. In the first quarter of 2022  average daily day ahead power trader was 3.15 terawatt hour  with a 6.3% increase compared to the same quarter last year and average daily intraday power traded was at 0.08 terawatt hour  up 25.9% compared to the first quarter of 2021.Moving to slide 13. Revenue from our posted activity including net treasury income increased €72.9 million to €109.2 million. Clearing revenue was up 87.2% and 11.2% on a pro forma basis to €51.9 million. As a result of higher clearing revenue both at Euronext clearing and LCH SA  reflecting higher trading activity. On a like-for-like basis  at current currencies  clearing revenue was up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2021.Net treasury income through CCP business of Euronext cleaning was €13.4 million. Custody and settlement and post-trade revenue encompassing the activity of the four CSP we operate under the Euronext Security brand was up 38.6% to €63.9 million on a reported basis. The performance was organically driven by increased number of accounts in Euronext security Oslo  in Euronext Security Copenhagen. On a pro forma basis  revenue was stable year-on-year. On a like-for-like basis and at current currencies  custody and settlement and other post-trade revenue slightly decreased 2.5% compared to the first quarter of 2021  mainly related to lower settlement activity versus the first quarter of 2021.I'm now on slide 14. Advanced Data Services  revenue was up 43.9% to €52.6 million. This represents a 3.4% increase on a pro forma basis  compared to the first quarter of 2021  driven by strong performance of our market data business  resulting from higher number of users and sustained growth of the data solution offering. Investor Services revenue was at €2.2 million this quarter  down on a pro forma basis  driven by a change in scope up 7.4% on a like-for-like basis.Lastly  Technology Solutions  revenue was up 94.5% compared to Q1 2021 to €23.1 million as a result of the consolidation of Borsa Italiana Group technology business including Gatelab and X2 [ph]. On a pro forma basis  Technology Solutions revenue decreased slightly by 2.9%  mainly due to a seasonal decline in client activity.Moving to slide 16. For the financial highlights of the quarter  let's start with the EBITDA bridge. As announced  with the last publication  from the first quarter of 2022  we do not have any more a separate line below EBITDA to capture exceptional items. From this quarter  all costs are included by nature in the different lines of our P&L. This means that our EBITDA includes exceptional costs as well. However  we now publish an adjusted EBITDA which correspond to revenues minus non-underlying cost -- underlying costs excluding D&A  which highlights the underlying performance of Euronext. The definition of non-underlying items include integration costs  double run of significant projects  operating exceptional items  amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions  non-operating exceptional items and tax on the non-underlying items that I just described. Euronext adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 66.8% to €252.2 million. On a pro forma basis  adjusted EBITDA grew 11.4% demonstrating Euronext ability to capture value in a volatile environment and its trademark cost discipline. This result is also impacted by the release of approximately €4.5 million of bonus accruals in the first quarter of 2022.The adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 63.7% this quarter from 60.7% in the first quarter of 2021. On a like-for-like basis  EBITDA margin was at 64% this quarter  up 2.9 points and adjusted EBITDA increased 12%. Finally  non-underlying costs excluding D&A were €5.5 million and were mostly related to the Borsa Italiana integration bringing the EBITDA of the group to €246.7 million.Moving to Slide 9 for the bridge of net income. The net income increased this quarter 46.5% to €143.8 million. On a pro forma basis  net income increased 10.9% resulting from the following elements. D&A slightly increased €2.5 million reflecting the impact of the new data center and higher tangible and intangible fixed asset D&A. The result from equity investments decreased €8.6 million as -- this year this line only reflects the contribution of our 11% stake in LCH SA whereas last year Euronext received a one-off interim dividend from Euroclear.I would like to highlight that the €20.6 million of non-underlying costs in the bridge are mainly represented by D&A namely the PPA amortization of our acquisitions. Lastly  income tax for the first quarter of 2022 was €52 million. This translates into an effective tax rate for the quarter of 26.1%. For 2022  we expect a stable tax rate at around 27%. Adjusted for non-underlying costs  adjusted net income was €164.4 million translating into an adjusted EPS increase of 7.3% to €1.54 per share this quarter.I'm now moving to Slide 18 for the cash flow generation and leverage. Net operating cash flow amounted to €368.6 million. Excluding the CCP activities impact of Nord Pool and Euronext clearing on the change in working capital  84% of our adjusted EBITDA was converted into post-tax operating cash flow. Our strong cash flow generation capability enable us to significantly deleverage to 2.3 times net debt to EBITDA at the end of this quarter. This compares to 2.6 times at the end of the fourth quarter 2021 and 3.2 times following the closing of the Borsa Italiana acquisition. This improved leverage provide us with additional strategic flexibility  as recently recognized by S&P which confirmed our rating at BBB  but improved the outlook from stable to positive.Moving to Slide 19 for the evolution of our liquidity position over the quarter. As illustrated  our liquidity position remains strong above €1.5 billion including the undrawn RCF revolving credit facility of €600 million  while excluding the cash currently in transit at Nord Pool.With this  I would like to give back the floor to Stéphane Boujnah.Stéphane BoujnahThank you  Giorgio. And happy to take your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Mike Werner from UBS. Please go ahead.Mike WernerThank you very much. And thanks for the presentation. Two questions  please. First  on the $4.5 million release of the bonus accrual in Q1  can you just provide a little bit of color as to what drove that? Also  whether that's something that was – is probably considered one-off and non-recurring? And then second  on the Technology Solutions business you indicated kind of just lower client activity in Q1  but the Q1 revenue run rate was about 9% lower than the run rate that we saw in the second half of last year. So I was just wondering  yeah  is this something that's maybe seasonal one-off? Is this kind of really client related and activity related  or is this kind of a more appropriate run rate going forward given the change in the markets? Thank you.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much for your question. So starting from the €4.5 million – so this is an adjustment that we had when we had to finalize the decision on variable payments. So this can be considered in one sense one-off  because clearly this is something that is going to happen only in the first quarter of 2022. However  embedded in the number  you see already a lower accrual that will last throughout 2022. So  there is a part  which is recurring and a part which is one-off. And the €4.5 million  specifically this is the one-off component. When it comes to the Technology Solutions  a part of our activity is client-related. And what we have seen is a seasonal slowdown in the first quarter that we think is going to be recovered in the next quarter – quarters of 2022.Mike WernerThank you. And just a quick follow-up please. In terms of the release on the bonus accrual €4.5 million should we assume that accounts for about half of the lower cost guidance the €10 million cost that you guided for 2022?Giorgio ModicaI mean  as the cost target is going to be benchmark against the actual number for 2022. Clearly  any decrease in cost in the first quarter is included in that number.Mike WernerOkay. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Bruce HamiltonThanks. Good morning  and thanks for taking my questions. I've got three. Firstly  obviously  you've given us an update on the time line for the initial return on revenue synergies linked to the migration of the data center. But could you give us any color on sort of time frame and potential quantum around the opportunity linked to internationalization of MTS? Is that just a sort of gradual process  or how should we sort of think about that?Secondly  in terms of the importance of retail activity  could you give any sense of how much of your cash trading relates to retail and where we are – where that is versus history just to give a sense of any sort of further risk of normalization and similarly in the kind of post trade business? And then  finally  in terms of balance sheet flexibility obviously great that your net debt EBITDA is coming down quite quickly. Can you remind us  what sort of levels the credit rating agencies are now comfortable with? I assume that  may have gone up a little bit in terms of where you could sort of run without putting at risk your rating. So maybe just give us an update on that. Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahSo I will take the question on the revenue synergies  and Giorgio will answer the questions on the retail activities  and all the balance sheet in relation to the perception by rating agencies. Let's be clear  we had announced in November that  we – in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana  we would extract €45 million of cost synergies €15 million of revenue synergies. And we announced in February that  in addition to those €60 million we will – I guess  to €100 million through EBITDA expansion  we'd make sure of cost synergies and revenue synergies in relation to various projects  one of them being the migration of the Core Data Centre. So as of today  we have extracted in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group  in Italy the Borsa Italiana Group €15 million of run rate cost synergies.So it's about one-third of the €45 million cost synergies that we had announced or targeted for the end of 24 in November 2021. So €15 million part of €45 million all costs. For the first time  with the migration of the Core Data Centre to Bergamo where we will start invoicing directly colocation services we will stop generating revenue synergies. So going forward starting next quarter  we will have a contribution of revenue synergies to -- in the mix of synergy extracted in relation to this  -- the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.As far as the MTS revenue synergies are concerned  they are part of the bigger pocket of revenue synergies and they take longer than a few quarters to be extracted. So we have various progress -- projects that are ongoing  but they are not -- the international MTS revenues are not going to materialize in a material -- in a significant manner immediately. They are part of all the revenue synergies.Some of them are more or less one-off related  like the -- not one-off  but milestone-related like the development of the revenues to be extracted from the Core Data Centre in Bergamo. So you will see them in a recurrent manner  after the implementation of the migration of six June. Others are ramping up with the penetration of clients  with the international and MTS business in the Euronext countries. And that's more a project that we'll develop across 2023 and 2024. Giorgio?Giorgio ModicaYes  absolutely. So when it comes to the retail activity  what we have seen  is that the participation in this volatile environment is slightly different from what it was one year ago. And we see less participation for this new crisis linked to the war in Ukraine  with respect to what we have seen at the time of the pandemic. So the retail participation remains mid-single digits. So we're talking of 3% 4%  where it used to peak to 6% 7% at the peak of the pandemic.Then when it comes to your second question on -- with respect to leverage and rating  in the note from S&P clearly highlights some targets for the end of 2023 and seems to hint  that if we will go and if we remain in that trajectory  we might have further improved clearly before the end of 2023. So the objective for the trajectory points at the FFO to net debt of 30% and a net debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times.So as long as we will remain in the trajectory  I believe without waiting the end of 2023  we might be open to good surprises. On the lower side  however  I wanted to remind you in terms of flexibility that the BBB rating band ranges between 4.5 and 3.5 times net debt to EBITDA in terms of leverage  and between 18% and 23% in terms of FFO to net debt.Bruce HamiltonWell then  thank youOperatorThe next question comes from the line of Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.Haley TamGood morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. If I can have a few follow-ups please. Just with the Data Centre migration could you confirm that all your clients  you currently colocate with you in London  are moving with you to the Ponte San Pietro Data Centre? And I apologize if I missed it  but have you actually quantified  how much of the additional €40 million synergies will be coming from this move versus perhaps Euronext clearing in the longer term?And then if I can  I'd like to ask a question just about Euroclear and the 9.8% ICE stake that is now being sold to the French and Belgian government investment firms  who are also referenced shareholders of Euronext. Could you give us any color on what this means  if anything from a strategic perspective for you? Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahOkay. On the core data center  you have a questions on operations and a question on revenues. So I can confirm that all our clients are ready or about to be ready and there will be further testing and rehearsals between now and the 6 June with our clients. And if we confirm today the time table for the migration of the core data center  this is because as seasoned operational professionals we have reached the conclusion that together with all clients  the teams in the Aruba facilities near Bergamo across our various clients and within Euronext already for that migration.We do not disclose the granular breakdown of EBITDA contributions to the additional revenues to be generated by this quarter but next quarter we will be in a position to be more specific because by then you will see the contribution to the run rate revenue synergies of the revenue generated by the co-location services charged directly to the core data center in Bergamo.On the Euroclear situation  we have noticed the fact that SSPI and Euroclear have acquired the stake that was sold by ICE. We are familiar with SPI and with Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations  who are both referenced shareholders of Euronext. By the way  Euroclear is also a reference shareholder of Euronext. So we know each other extremely well. This the fact that there is a common interest by SFTI and by Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations for both Euronext  which is the leading pan-European market infrastructure in particular in terms of trading and post-trade and for Euroclear  which is the leading ICSD in Europe is shows the consistency of the strategy of Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations and FPI but it doesn't mean anything else that we have two strong shareholders of Euronext  who have a strong interest for market infrastructures in Europe across the value chain.Haley TamThank you.OperatorThe Next question comes from the line of Philip Middleton from Bank of America. Please go ahead.Philip MiddletonGood morning and thanks for taking my questions. First of all on costs. Could you talk a little bit about what the revised guidance for this year potentially means for years further out? So are we looking at some of the cost savings  which are one-off  so you don't read that through  or do you feel that the lower level of bonuses is sometimes sustainable and that therefore the €10 million may endure through further years?And secondly  I wonder if you could tell us a little bit more about the economics of the clearing and settlement business. So how much of this roughly the revenues come from asset-based revenues compared to the settlement revenues? Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahOkay. So Giorgio will answer your first questions on the inertia in the revised guidance. And Anthony  who is the Head of Post Trade  will answer your questions on the revenue model about the clearing business of Euronext clearing formerly known as CC&G. Over to you  Giorgio.Giorgio ModicaYes. So when it comes to cost  let's first focus ourselves on 2022. So what is going to happen this year is the following. So you should expect in the next quarter clearly the one-off elements not to be there anymore. And we will have to a certain extent the seasonal inflation coming from the increase of salary kicking in from the second quarter this year.And then it's difficult for me to be more granular when it comes to the phasing. Of course  rather than reiterating the new target is €622 million because we will have many projects completing and many projects starting  which gives to a certain extent a complex phasing of the cost through 2022.Then when we move to 2023  again it's very early I believe given the situation we are having at the moment to anticipate what is going to be the target and revenues from -- for next year. So clearly we are analyzing the situation with the objective of maximizing revenues and minimizing cost. I appreciate this might seem high level but this is exactly what we are trying to achieve. So to make the long story short  12% is what we see for 2022  you will see a slight increase in the second quarter coming from one-off elements that are not going to be there anymore plus some inflation on salary cost. And then we see a rather steady state for the remainder of the year.Anthony AttiaGood morning. This is Anthony. Thank you for your question. So across our core CSD  the split of revenue is quite similar. We have roughly 50% linked to custody activity  and so exposed to the valuation of assets. And the remaining 50% are linked to settlement and issuance businesses. What I want to note is that we also are developing services on top of this type of revenue. So it's a new business and it's growing and I want to take the example of tax reporting services in Norway or data services. And this is the part of the CSD business that is new and growing. Thank you.Philip MiddletonThank you. That’s helpful.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtHi  good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. CBOE has been rolling out  its competing equity index  derivatives  products across Europe. I know it's very early days there  but are you seeing any evidence of end customer activity migrating away? And could you comment on whether you expect to make any potential changes to pricing there  or if you feel comfortable with the competitive positioning of those products?And my second question is on the M&A environment  as you've stated previously you've delevered significantly at 2.3 times net leverage now. I guess given the volatility we're seeing at least in public market valuations and given the uncertain macro environment  can you just talk a bit about the M&A environment and whether you're still seeing potentially attractive opportunities in this type of environment?Stéphane BoujnahI will answer the M&A question and Giorgio will answer the question about the competitive environment particularly in relation to the CBOE initiatives. The way Euronext has approached or has been approaching M&A since the IPO is extremely consistent and disciplined.We do believe that external growth is a fundamental component of the growth ambitions of Euronext for two reasons  to expand our European footprint in situations  or in infrastructures where there are fundamental compelling synergies to be extracted by the expansion of the single liquidity pool  single order book  single technology platform  and to diversify the revenue streams of Euronext to be less dependent on volatility in particular in volatility related to equity markets.In order to pursue those two objectives in particular the ones of diversification  we have an investment committee of -- four hours that meets every four weeks. No matter the level of leverage  no matter the stock price of Euronext  no matter the competitive environment  no matter whether LSE is trying to merge with Deutsche Börse or is not merging with LSE and whether Citi [ph] is buying DME or not  we do have systematically a framework where we monitor opportunities.The other framework we have is that we are very disciplined in terms of return of capital employed.We believe that our purpose is to extract synergy through consolidation of assets. And therefore  we don't overpay for assets. That's why  for example  after very long debate we decided not to bid for the acquisition of BME and to let fixed paid -- the price they have paid for that acquisition at that time because we felt that we could not justify value creation for that particular asset.So we are extremely disciplined in terms of how much we are willing to pay. Sometimes we take both decisions like paying €4.4 billion for the acquisition of Borsa Italiana because we feel on the basis of our experience that business is going to perform better than the market felt and that we could extract more synergies than the market believed. And for the moment that has proved to be the right path.Going forward one of the new development exactly as you articulated it is the fact that to a certain extent valuation in particular of technology-driven assets SaaS assets  data assets are starting in certain sub-segments of those two domains to go down or to cool down. Some private equity owners who are considering selling those assets are becoming more reasonable in their expectations. So this is happening.Anyone who was on M&A in his life knows that this phase of adjustment of -- this phase of cooling down of seller's expectations can take a few months. It's just the beginning of the process. In that environment  it's true that some assets that were not within our reach in terms of multiple because we could not justify this type of valuations of a few quarters ago are slowing -- are slowly reaching a territory where we could justify those valuations  but that's just one component of an overall environment.So we are not going to buy things because they are cheap  just as we were not buying them because they were expensive. We will buy them because we believe that they create synergies. We can extract value and they make sense in terms of the strategic fit with the rest of the product portfolio.Sorry for this long answer  but you gave me the opportunity to frame the overall approach of M&A and the way we will use the new balance sheet flexibility that we have regained by strong operating performance and strong cash flow generation. Over to you Giorgio on the CBOE initiatives.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much  Stéphane. Clearly CBOE is a very strong and reputable competitor and we are looking carefully at the moves. However at the moment  we are convinced that the quality of execution of our market does not need -- does not justify any price decrease in order to compete on that market. So again  Euronext is about overall quality of trading and we still are the venue that sets and define the best execution and this is our competitive leverage against competition. So this is the first point.The second point is about client traction. And again what Stéphane said on the data center is i.e. that clients are with us and ready to migrate in the [indiscernible] at the 6 of June is a testament to the fact that what we are trying to achieve in Europe is fully supported. We are asking a lot from our clients because we want to give a lot to our clients and the payoff is positive. So again  what we are seeing is a strong support from our client base in a moment of high transformation. And we believe that even before having delivered all the benefits that we're trying to achieve with this transformation the quality of our execution is sufficient to maintain and strengthen position as a leading venue in Europe.Kyle VoigtI appreciate all the detail. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Arnaud Giblat from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.Arnaud GiblatYes. Good morning. I've got two questions left please. Firstly  can I ask with regards to the normalization of retail activity. You mentioned that on the trading side I'm wondering on the settlements and custom side how things are going. I mean some of the retail brokers in the Nordics have reported a slowdown in activity. I think your revenues are more geared into a number of accounts at more than anything else. So -- what's the outlook there? Should we expect a continuation of the strength and we're seeing in the Nordics  or do you expect the accounts to remain open or should we expect some degree of normalization with activity coming down?And my second question is on annual fees and investing  that's up 15% quarter-on-quarter. Could you run maybe through some of the drivers behind that and whether or not it's sustainable?Stéphane BoujnahSo  I'll let Anthony to answer your question as Head of Primary Markets and listing -- expert on listing fees and also on the nature of the development of our Post Trade business or CSD business in the Nordic.Anthony AttiaThank you  Stéphane. So  concerning the retail activity on our CSDs  it's about as Stéphane said  the Nordic activity the sin Copenhagen and Oslo. Well  we don't -- what we have observed in the last quarter is a normalization or stabilization of the number of retail accounts  which is still high from a historical perspective. And nevertheless the number of settlement instruction has normalized and we observe a drop compared to the peak that we had last year.Concerning the annual fees on equity listings  we have different adjustments in front of inflation compared to our listing venues or countries but we decided for this year to increase the yearly fees on our large cap issuers  which is an increase that was long overdue. This is a one-off increase  but we are obviously monitoring the effects of inflation across the board on our different fees. Thank you.Arnaud GiblatThanks.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Martin Price from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Martin PriceGood morning and thanks for taking my questions. Most of my questions have actually been asked  but maybe just on the revenue growth target of 3% to 4% per annum through to 2024  which you detailed at the Capital Markets Day last year.Within this  I wonder if you could just provide an update on your assumptions around volume growth and revenue capture for the core cash trading business and whether market development since the Capital Markets Day may have prompted any form of reevaluation? Thank you.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much for your question which is a fairly legitimate one. So  clearly  we are assessing reassessing the market environment on a daily basis. So  we feel that at the moment the market environment is more volatile than what we had expected at the Investor Day. And this might trigger at some point the decision  but we really feel that it's too early five  six months after the Investor Day to change the target. So  we're doing a step at the time  delivering the key milestone of the project and clearly we will ask ourselves in the next question in the next quarter the question on whether it is appropriate and timely a potential change of the targets for 2024.So  again  to make a long story short  we don't feel it's appropriate moment to change the target for 2024  but we are assessing the situation. And in this quarter in the next quarter  we will clearly look at that.Martin PriceUnderstood. That’s very helpful. Thanks Giorgio.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Johannes Thormann from HSBC. Please go ahead.Johannes ThormannGood morning everybody. Three questions please. First of all  you previously said when the year [indiscernible] was at 50 bps that this is not sustainable. Now  we have 47  is this more of a good run rate  or what's your view on that?Secondly  just on the Nordic CSD business  a follow-up question. I'm sorry if I missed it  but the number of accounts why did it increase? If the retail trading activity has normalized  what has been the driver for the increased number of accounts?And last but not least  on the Euroclear stake sale recently  you argue that you look for -- take it to a strategic fit. You own a stake in Euroclear and you have already leveraged below the 2.5 level. Why haven't you bought a stake yourself to position yourself at a better moment? Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahI will -- thank you for your questions. I will answer Euroclear question  and Anthony will answer the question on the Nordic retail accounts  and Giorgio will answer your first question.On the European situation  it's very simple. When the process of the sale of the disposal of the ICE stake started before the summer  we were approached and we looked at it very carefully. We decided not to deploy the capital of our shareholders in this transaction for two reasons. We believe that the best use of Euronext capital is to try whenever it's possible to control -- to buy controlling stakes in order to extract synergies  because we are an industrial player and to consolidate assets.We believe that we are not big enough to deploy several hundreds of millions just to deploy capital through a minority stake in a non-liquid company. So as a principle  we are not huge enough to do multi-hundred millions stakes for minority stakes in an illiquid company.The second reason which is more important is that we already have what we need to protect the optionality of being relatable if one day the situation when Europe is becoming actionable. We are -- we own directly and indirectly approximately 5% of the equity in Euroclear  and we are a Board member of Euroclear.So increasing our stake in Euroclear will not have materially change our position. We would not have had a second Board member and we would have just moved our stake from  let's say  5% to close to that -- and for assuming that we would have bought 50% of the ICE stake.So we believe that this type of progress in the optionality of one day doing something with Euroclear if and when the Euroclear situation is actionable was not justifying the deployment of in this particular case approximately for the sake of the argument of 5% or 4%  let's say  €350 million. And we believe in other words that the capital of our shareholders is better deployed in due course to a situation where we can extract synergies.That was the rationale of not bidding for the stake. And that's an illustration of the sort of very strong M&A discipline that I described earlier on when -- in the previous question of one of your colleagues.Johannes ThormannPerfect. Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahI'll give the floor to Anthony for your questions on the CSD accounts.Anthony AttiaThank you Stéphane. So on the -- on our four synergies  as you might know we have two different accounts management models. One is the one in Italy and in Portugal where we have omnibus accounts and it's the custodians on clients who are managing the relationship with the retail. And in Denmark and in Norway  the CSDs have the direct management of the retail account  that's a different revenue stream.Last year  we observed a significant return of the retail investors on the equity market on the stock exchange  which had a consequence to increase the number of accounts opened in the CSD. So we had new accounts that have been opened and also the increase of the settlement instruction processed by the CSD as a consequence of the trading on exchange.In Q1 this year  as I said  we have a stabilization of the number of accounts. So  we -- very few accounts were closed  and so we see a normalization of the number of accounts. And as Giorgio explained  a drop in retail activity  which has the consequence to have a drop in settlement activities as well.Giorgio ModicaYes. So in other words people kept their accounts and traded less. So this -- to a certain extent  the number of accounts is the stock and the settlement instruction is a flow that comes from the stock. So  coming to your question about the revenue capture  -- so the first element and I believe that your question deserves a complete answer.So the first element that I wanted to highlight is when -- two years ago  we were highlighting that 0.50 was a run rate and we were anticipating a reduction of the revenue capture. That was not including Borsa Italiana  whereas the 0.47 does include Borsa Italiana. And when we take into consideration Euronext alone  we are still above the 0.50 that we guided the market to be a sustainable long-term target.So what is happening and why the average fee  have trended down. So there are a couple of key drivers. The first one is that the revenue capture of Borsa Italiana is more sensible to the average size of trade  which means that it benefits from a lower average size and get diluted when the average size increases. So this is one of the reasons why you have seen the average revenue capture trending down.And the second element is the behavior of our clients within the order book. Now we have more and more liquidity providers  which are able to comply with the highest standard in terms of execution and therefore  they are having access as they had in the past to fee segments  which are lower than the average one.So the combination of these two trends explained the 0.47  which we believe is sustainable overall into the new market conditions. But again  the 0.47 shall not be compared to the target we gave to the market of 0.50  because that one was excluding Borsa Italiana  which today on average has lower average fees with respect to the rest of the Euronext markets.Johannes ThormannPerfect. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Reg Watson from ING. Please go ahead.Reg WatsonGiorgio  apologies if this has already been asked and answered  but as well as improving your guidance for the underlying cost for this year  you also improved your guidance for the one-off costs out to 2024. Have you changed the €50 million guidance for one-off costs for 2022? And if not why not? So perhaps a little bit of color on the phasing there.And then second question for Stéphane. The strategic flexibility that you mentioned  there are other forces in Europe  which are of acquiring or consolidating platform businesses. Do you find that attractive as a strategic option for Euronext as well? Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahOkay. First of all  let me apologize  because that will have to be the last set of questions  because we have to run to the Annual General Meeting in a few minutes  so apologies for the ones who could not ask questions. On your strategic question  yes  there are still single country or several countries exchange or market infrastructures in Europe.As I said on many occasions  the Euronext federal model is an open model. We are happy to welcome within our open federal governance or open federal supervision or open single liquidity pool single order book enabled by a single technology platform  exchanges that we want to address the issues of scalability attractiveness of the local market exchanges that want to combine the continuity of their relatively autonomy and identity while being part of something that is scalable.And we have from time-to-time dialogues with exchanges  who need to decide what they want to do. But in Europe  there are all sorts of situations. There are large market infrastructures that are very local in terms of culture and very diversified and where the exchange part has become a minimal part of the business.You have other exchanges that are very focused on the historical core exchange business and want to remain independent  because they don't mind the weaknesses of the drawbacks of being relatively small and the others who are really thinking about consolidation.But it's a game of consenting adults and things happen when everyone is ready to accept or to find the mutual benefits and the compromise that go with mergers and with consolidation.So we monitor very  very precisely in details  every situation in Europe whether they are actionable or not  because this is our core mission to build the leading pan-European market infrastructure in Europe. And to make sure that we build the backbone of the capital market vision. So this is at the core of our attention. Giorgio  …Giorgio ModicaYeah.Stéphane Boujnah…on the guidance?Giorgio ModicaSo the very fair question. So the point is that  we made a reassessment of the overall integration costs  as well taking into account that the big part to a certain extent is going to be delivered on the 6th of June. And we came up with the conclusion that  150 is good enough for us to deliver. However  the reason why we didn't change the €50 million is that  we don't want to put ourselves in the position to miss a target potentially  if we accelerate delivery. As you know  many times acceleration means acceleration of cost as well.So when it comes to the phasing we kept the previous phasing and again  not because we are shy  but because we know that sometimes acceleration and strategic flexibility we need to capture the opportunity we will have in the next quarter might trigger anticipating some cost or moving costs from one quarter to the other. So this is the reason  why we decided to be less specific on non-underlying costs than we have been on underlying costs.Reg WatsonOkay. Perfect and thank you.OperatorThere are no further questions in the queue. So I will hand the call back to your host  for some closing remarks.Stéphane BoujnahThank you very much.

5224,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.cityam.com/exclusive-why-the-london-stock-exchange-and-euronext-are-moving-their-datacentres-around/,Exclusive: Why the London Stock Exchange and Euronext are moving their datacentres around,5 hours ago,Exclusive: Why the London Stock Exchange and Euronext are moving their datacentres aroundAlastair Watson of TNSDatacentre exchange colocation is on the mind of many key players in the City and beyond at the moment. The idea appeals to a wide group of capital markets participants  and for various reasons.For example  with Euronext migrating from Basildon in Essex to the Aruba Global datacentre IT3 in Bergamo this year and the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) moving trading operations from its current London City location to a new London venue  what why do market players consider such a relocation?Many financial services players seem to opt for a so-called ‘DIY’ approach – versus a managed service model – when it comes to a datacentre move.A DIY approach is when a company arranges the installation  configuration  connectivity and monitoring of their datacentre equipment within the space they lease from the exchange in-house  said Alastair Watson  who is the managing director for Europe  the Middle East and Africa at Transaction Network Services.In an exclusive interview with City A.M. today  Watson explained there are several things to consider when going DIY  including how much space and power is required  network connections  bandwidth  latency  market data feeds and whether there is a need to connect to additional third-party data or services.Connectivity  market data  power and space costs can quickly add up to tens of thousands of pounds per month. On top of these fees are additional capital costs for equipment and staffing for support and maintenance.There is a lot of talk in the City about ‘colocation’  particularly after LSE’s announcement. Why do firms feel that need?Colocation is when a firm locates its computer equipment in a datacentre managed by a third party. Financial markets  exchanges and trading venues make space available within their datacentres for financial institutions and managed services providers to colocate. Originally firms colocated to benefit from ultra-low latency trading  but now drivers have expanded to include achieving deterministic latency  access to accurately time-stamped market data and connectivity to other venues and cloud services.“The main advantage in colocating at a trading venue’s datacentre is gaining direct access and proximity to the venue’s matching engine  trading network and data to reduce latency.” Alastair WatsonLatency is the time taken for a piece of data on a network to travel from one endpoint to another and is measured in fractions of a second. Reducing latency is crucial for traders as it means they can be more responsive to rapidly changing market conditions.So what are the factors to consider when moving a datacentre from one jurisdiction to another?Working with an expert provider that knows the local rules and regulations is paramount when a datacentre moves jurisdiction. Outsourced providers give access to a suite of services from day one of trading in a new location including order routing  market data and the procurement  installation and management of trading infrastructure. They can make the process of moving location less stressful and more efficient  with a single point of contact and 24-hour access to both technical and exchange specialist expertise.What is the impact of exchange or venue migration to cloud on the colocation market and end user’s requirements?The evolution of the exchange datacentre has seen exchanges partnering with cloud providers to migrate their offerings to cloud. Nasdaq has announced a multi-year partnership with AWS  and similarly the CME with Google announced a 10-year partnership to move their exchange to the cloud.“With that in mind where does this leave colocation? Basically  in the same place – market participants will still benefit from colocation  perhaps more so than before.” Alastair WatsonNasdaq has confirmed it will utilise AWS Outposts. ItNasdaq plans to incorporate AWS Outposts directly into its core network to deliver ultra-low-latency edge compute capabilities from its primary datacentre in Carteret  New Jersey.What are datacentres doing to address sustainability?Datacentre power efficiency is measured using a metric called Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)  with a lower PUE indicating greater energy efficiency. Datacentres are in a unique position to positively impact sustainability  as they deliver highly efficient infrastructure that can be backed by renewable energy and integrate new systems such as heat waste recovery.

Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.Trading volume in the forex market has shot up to record levels courtesy of unprecedented volatility caused by the war in Europe  as well as surging inflation. This has led to foreign exchange trading platforms experiencing a significant uptick in terms of both average daily volume (AVD) and revenue over the first quarter of the year.Euronext Reports 58% Jump in Q1 RevenueEuronext  a pan-European bourse that offers trading and post-trade services in various assets including equities  exchange-traded funds (ETFs)  bonds  derivatives  commodities  foreign exchange  and indices  posted a more than 58% jump in its Q1 revenue.The group’s income came in at €395.7 million  which was driven by non-volume related and trading activities growth. The total trading revenue of the group was €150.8 million  a more than 57% increase year-over-year (YOY).Notably  the FX trading demand on Euronext jumped by 18%  bringing €7.2 million in revenue for the group. Moreover  the average daily volume (ADV) with FX trading increased by 14% to a whopping $24.5 billion.Overall  the first quarter of 2022 marked the second-best quarter ever for Euronext FX both in terms of revenue and average daily volumes  thanks to heightened volatility. The first quarter of 2020 was the best quarter for Euronext FX when forex trading brought in €8.0 million in revenue.Join our Telegram group and never miss a breaking digital asset story.FX Trading Volume Up 5% YOYTrading volume in the forex market has hit record levels around the globe. CLS  a multi-currency settlement system for FX transactions  said on Thursday that the average daily FX trading volume in April hit $1.86 trillion  an increase of 5% YOY.In a statement  CLS detailed that there has been a 14% rise in spot trading and a 27% increase in forwards activity. However  the settlement system noted that April volumes were down by 12.5% compared to March.The daily FX trading volume in South Korea has also reached new highs in the first quarter of the year. During the January-March period  the daily FX turnover came to an average of $65.55 billion  up by around 15$ percent from three months earlier  according to central bank data.The increased interest in FX trading  caused by heightened market volatility  comes as the US Federal Reserve tries to stamp out inflation by hiking rates. In mid-March  the central bank announced its first rate hike in more than three years  a 0.25 percentage point move.In early May  the Fed proceeded to increase interest rates by another 0.50% and indicated that it will further raise borrowing costs throughout this year as it tries to fight surging inflation. The Fed also revealed a strategy to shrink its asset holdings  saying that beginning June 1  it will allow up to $47.5 billion a month to roll off its balance sheet.Besides the rate hikes  concerns about the economic consequence of the war in Ukraine have also contributed to additional FX volatility. The war has already adversely impacted Russia’s ruble and the euro  which is now trading hovering just above $1.05  down from around $1.22 last June.Meanwhile  volatility in currencies can also offer arbitrage opportunities for crypto users. For instance  users can trade stablecoins pegged to the US dollar against stablecoins pegged to the euro or other currencies and enjoy the forex market volatility.Finance is changing.
