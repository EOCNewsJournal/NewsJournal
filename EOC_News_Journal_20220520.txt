In accordance with Article 135 of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) the adoption of the resolution also required that at least 51 per cent of the nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue be represented at the meeting. As this requirement was not met  the Board has convened an extraordinary general meeting to take a fresh vote on this proposal in accordance with the rules set out in Article 135(1)(b) of the Companies Act (Cap.386 of the Laws of Malta).At this EGM the resolution may be passed by shareholder / holder of SDRs having the right to attend and vote at the meeting holding in the aggregate not less than 75 per cent in nominal value of the shares/SDRs represented and entitled to vote at the meeting. However  if more than half in nominal value of all the shares/SDRs having the right to vote at the meeting is represented at that meeting  a simple majority in nominal value of such shares/SDRs so represented shall suffice.The Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition of shares/SDRs shall take place on NasdaqStockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares/SDRs to all shareholders. The purchases may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on actual market price and terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts.The objective of the purchase is to achieve added value for the Company's shareholders (includingthrough the implementation of the share buy-back program previously announced) and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure.Following the purchase  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or issue to employees under a Share Option programme or Share Performance Scheme.Once purchased under the Maltese Companies Act further shareholder approval will be required before those shares could be cancelled only. Shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to the Company's share buyback program will be cancelled (refer to Agenda item 8). A separate authorisation for such cancellation is being recommended pursuant to Resolution (2);If used as consideration for an acquisition  the intention would be that the actual Shares/SDRs would be offered to any potential transferor.Information about proposals related to Agenda item 8Share cancellationThe Board of Directors has already submitted this proposal for the consideration of the AGM.At the AGM  36.70 per cent in nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue were represented at the meeting and 99.99 per cent of those represented (36.69 per cent of the total shares/SDRs in issue) voted in favour of granting such authorisation. In accordance with Article 135 of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) the adoption of the resolution also required that at least 51 per cent of the nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue be represented at the meeting. As this requirement was not met  the Board has convened an extraordinary general meeting to take a fresh vote on this proposal in accordance with the rules set out in Article 135(1)(b) of the Companies Act (Cap.386 of the Laws of Malta).At this EGM the resolution may be passed by shareholder / holder of SDRs having the right to attend and vote at the meeting holding in the aggregate not less than 75 per cent in nominal value of the shares/SDRs represented and entitled to vote at the meeting. However  if more than half in nominal value of all the shares/SDRs having the right to vote at the meeting is represented at that meeting  a simple majority in nominal value of such shares/SDRs so represented shall suffice.The directors may decide to cancel all or some of shares/SDRs acquired pursuant to the buy-back program.The Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) stipulates that an extraordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company is required in order to approve the reduction in the issued share capital of the Company.Such resolution needs to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in Malta  who will publish details of such reduction. Creditors of the Company will then have a period of three months in which they can contest the reduction in capital. Upon the lapse of the three-month period  assuming that no contestations are received  the reduction in share capital can become effective.In order to reflect the changes in the issued share capital  a revised memorandum of association of the Company indicating the reduced number of shares then in issue in the capital of the Company will need to be submitted to the Registrar of Companies.The reduction in issued share capital will take place at such intervals and in such amounts (subject to the maximum amount of GBP 14 375) as the directors shall determine from time to time.Information about proposals related to Agenda item 9Share issueThe Board of Directors has already submitted this proposal for the consideration of the AGM.At the AGM  36.70 per cent in nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue were represented at the meeting and 100 per cent of those represented (36.70 per cent of the total shares/SDRs in issue) voted in favour of granting such authorisation. In accordance with Article 135 of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) the adoption of the resolution also required that at least 51 per cent of the nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue be represented at the meeting.

However  if more than half in nominal value of all the shares/SDRs having the right to vote at the meeting is represented at that meeting  a simple majority in nominal value of such shares/SDRs so represented shall suffice.The objectives of the authorisation to be granted in terms of this resolution are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares/SDRs on each issue date that will be used in determining the price at which shares/SDRs will be issued  should be the same as the market value of the shares/SDRs listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. A cap of 23 million ordinary shares/SDRs in the Company is being requested in connection with this authorisation. The cap will be reduced by the amount of any shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to Resolution (1) (but excluding shares / SDRs not already bought back by the Company on the date of the adoption of the resolution).For information on how personal data is processed please seehttps://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfBy order of the BoardKindred Group plcMalta  13 May 2022CONTACT:For more information:Johan Wilsby  Chief Financial Officerjohan.wilsby@kindredgroup.comThis information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/kindred-group/r/notice-to-extraordinary-general-meeting-of-kindred-group-plc c3570587The following files are available for download:https://mb.cision.com/Main/824/3570587/1582026.pdf Kindred - Notice EGM 2022SOURCE Kindred Group",neutral,0.03,0.92,0.05,neutral,0.03,0.9,0.07,True,English,"['Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Kindred Group plc', 'Notice', 'Swedish Depository Receipts', 'actual market price', 'two person(s', '2023 Annual General Meeting', 'Euroclear Sweden AB', 'Kindred Group plc', 'EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING', 'GBP 0.000625 Ordinary Shares/SDRs', 'minimum price', 'maximum price', 'Companies Act', 'voting rights', 'custodian bank', 'supporting documentation', 'voting procedure', 'support purposes', 'voting list', 'inter alia', 'minimum consideration', 'multiple occasions', 'Friday 10 June', 'Wednesday 1 June', 'Friday 3 June', 'regular mail', 'extraordinary resolution', 'following business', 'following resolutions', 'Record Date', '10:00AM CEST', 'SDR holder', 'maximum number', ""Directors' meeting"", 'share capital', 'VALLETTA', 'Malta', 'NOTICE', 'EGM', 'Company', 'terms', 'article', 'Laws', 'office', 'Regeringsgatan', 'Stockholm', 'holders', 'register', '23:59PM', 'votes', 'link', 'anmalan', 'vpc', 'euroclearproxy', 'BankID', 'behalf', 'someone', 'access', 'printing', 'kindredgroup', 'courier', 'Box', 'Requirement', 'holding', 'name', 'nominee', 'brokerage', 'authority', 'Power', 'Attorney', 'original', 'people', 'event', 'assistance', 'questions', 'generalmeetingservice', 'telephone', 'channels', 'conversions', '27 May', 'Agenda', '1 Opening', '2 Election', 'Chairman', 'approval', '5 Election', 'minutes', '6 Determination', 'Board', '9 March', 'buyback', 'added', 'value', 'Cap.', 'subscription', 'authorisation', 'conditions', 'acquisitions', 'duration', 'period', 'purchases', '1 SEK', 'tax', '300 SEK', 'place', 'completion', 'means', 'cancellation']",2022-05-20,2022-05-20,prnewswire.co.uk

The study was featured in a paper published on the journal’s website last month titled  “The Impact of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy on the Quality of Life of Patients and Their Relatives: A Qualitative Study”. It is the first of its kind to explore this condition and its impact for patients and relatives in four different countries.The study determined that the impact of LHON extends beyond vision-related activity limitations  while addressing its psychosocial impact. It concluded that helping patients and their relatives adapt and cope with vision loss is vital. An accurate and timely diagnosis for patients is also crucial to address these issues and also to allow for early intervention.“This study is the first to describe the impact of LHON on the families of affected individuals. Partners and families of affected individuals take on many responsibilities and shoulder some of the burden of LHON. The impact that LHON has on partners and families has not been reported previously and it is vital that we acknowledge the support and care that they provide ” explained Patrick Yu-Wai-Man  MD  PhD  Moorfields Eye Hospital and Department of Clinical Neurosciences  University of Cambridge  United Kingdom.Participants reported feeling devastated by the diagnosis of LHON after a lengthy and worrisome diagnostic journey. They were also frustrated by the loss of autonomy that affected their relatives. Participants described challenges across several domains: physical capabilities  emotional well-being  interpersonal relationships  work and studies  finances  and recreational activities.Additionally  the study determined that despite residing in different countries  LHON patients and their relatives described similar experiences in the four areas of focus in this study. These areas include (1) experience leading to the point of diagnosis; (2) impact of their condition on various aspects of life; (3) perceptions about treatment; and (4) expectations toward future therapies.“This study confirms what we have known all along in the eye clinic - that LHON impacts every aspect of quality of life  not just activities that rely on vision. Understanding how LHON affects individuals who develop vision loss enables doctors to intervene early and provide care that will improve the quality of life of affected individuals ” commented Benson Chen  MD  Department of Clinical Neurosciences  University of Cambridge  United Kingdom. “This might include different kinds of assessments in the eye clinic that measure the emotional and psychological impact of LHON or developing the referral pathways that enable affected individuals to access psychological support and work or skills re-training ” he added.LHON is an inherited mitochondrial disease characterized by severe bilateral vision loss and chronic visual impairment. The objective of this study was to comprehensively explore the impact of LHON on the lives of patients and their relatives at the time of diagnosis and now.The qualitative study design encompassed eight focus group interviews conducted in France  Germany  the United Kingdom  and the United States  involving 17 individuals with m.11778G>A mutation and their relatives. Separate focus groups for patients and their relatives were facilitated by a moderator in French  German  or English. Neuro-ophthalmologists in the four countries who participated helped to identify additional patients who fulfilled under-represented sampling criteria. The four countries were selected because all have established networks of individuals with LHON and were places where previous LHON studies have been conducted.Focus group interviews were conducted as part of a market research study sponsored by GenSight Biologics  and independently designed and conducted by groupH  a health care market research and analytics firm. The design and conduct of the study complied with the European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association and British Healthcare Business Intelligence Association guidelines.“We  at GenSight  have long been convinced that by providing an innovative therapeutic solution for LHON we would offer much more than an improved vision. Documenting the impact of LHON experienced by all study participants highlights the fact that we could empower patients and improve their ability to enjoy a fulfilling life  while easing the demands on their loved ones. This is precisely why we are dedicated to developing a long-lasting therapeutic solution for patients with LHON ” explained Magali Taiel  Chief Medical Officer of GenSight. “We are hopeful that we may one day help patients to recover not only their vision  but also their sense of autonomy and well-being ” she added.Full text versions of this article are available on the journal’s website: https://journals.lww.com/jneuro-ophthalmology/Abstract/9900/The_Impact_of_Leber_Hereditary_Optic_Neuropathy_on.77.aspx.*About the paper:The Impact of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy on the Quality of Life of Patients and Their Relatives: A Qualitative StudyAuthors: Benson S.

GenSight Biologics’ pipeline leverages two core technology platforms  the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) and optogenetics  to help preserve or restore vision in patients suffering from blinding retinal diseases. GenSight Biologics’ lead product candidate  LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)  has been submitted for marketing approval in Europe for the treatment of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)  a rare mitochondrial disease affecting primarily teens and young adults that leads to irreversible blindness. Using its gene therapy-based approach  GenSight Biologics’ product candidates are designed to be administered in a single treatment to each eye by intravitreal injection to offer patients a sustainable functional visual recovery.About Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease  characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells that results in brutal and irreversible vision loss that can lead to legal blindness  and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. LHON is associated with painless  sudden loss of central vision in the 1st eye  with the 2nd eye sequentially impaired. It is a symmetric disease with poor functional visual recovery. 97% of patients have bilateral involvement at less than one year of onset of vision loss  and in 25% of cases  vision loss occurs in both eyes simultaneously. The estimated incidence of LHON is approximately 800-1 200 new patients who lose their sight every year in the United States and the European Union.,neutral,0.01,0.9,0.09,mixed,0.32,0.15,0.53,True,English,"['GenSight Biologics', 'LHON Disease', 'Publication', 'Study', 'Impact', 'Lives', 'Patients', 'Relatives', 'Journal', 'Neuro-Ophthalmology', 'British Healthcare Business Intelligence Association guidelines', 'European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association', 'central nervous system disorders', 'Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy', 'm.11778G>A mutation', 'health care market research', 'eight focus group interviews', 'severe bilateral vision loss', 'market research study', 'retinal neurodegenerative diseases', 'vision-related activity limitations', 'worrisome diagnostic journey', 'chronic visual impairment', 'innovative therapeutic solution', 'lasting therapeutic solution', 'Chief Medical Officer', 'Separate focus groups', 'innovative gene therapies', 'Moorfields Eye Hospital', 'four different countries', 'previous LHON studies', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'qualitative study design', 'future therapies', 'four countries', 'eye clinic', 'different kinds', 'Regulatory News', 'biopharma Company', 'early intervention', 'many responsibilities', 'Patrick Yu-Wai-Man', 'Clinical Neurosciences', 'United Kingdom', 'several domains', 'physical capabilities', 'interpersonal relationships', 'similar experiences', 'various aspects', 'Benson Chen', 'referral pathways', 'mitochondrial disease', 'United States', 'sampling criteria', 'analytics firm', 'loved ones', 'Magali Taiel', 'four areas', 'GenSight Biologics', 'emotional well-being', 'recreational activities', 'psychological support', 'timely diagnosis', 'fulfilling life', 'psychosocial impact', 'psychological impact', 'additional patients', 'study participants', 'affected individuals', 'LHON patients', '17 individuals', 'PARIS', 'Euronext', 'ISIN', 'PEA-PME', 'regarded', 'Journal', 'Neuro-Ophthalmology', 'relatives', 'paper', 'website', 'Quality', 'condition', 'accurate', 'issues', 'families', 'Partners', 'burden', 'MD', 'PhD', 'Department', 'University', 'Cambridge', 'lengthy', 'autonomy', 'challenges', 'work', 'finances', 'point', 'perceptions', 'treatment', 'expectations', 'doctors', 'assessments', 'skills', 'objective', 'lives', 'France', 'Germany', 'moderator', 'French', 'English', 'Neuro-ophthalmologists', 'places', 'groupH', 'conduct', 'improved', 'fact', 'ability', 'demands', 'long']",2022-05-19,2022-05-20,businesswire.com

Guided by mentors from Dassault Systèmes and supported by the company’s 3DEXPERIENCE Edu – whose programs help seven million students each year develop in-demand industry skills on Dassault Systèmes solutions – the teams quickly adopted the same integrated modelling  simulation  information intelligence and collaboration applications used by industry globally  and created scientifically accurate  data-enriched virtual twins of the sites that open up a new understanding of their structure.The virtual twins represent both the visible and the invisible  revealing insights into each structure’s design  what was partially lost  totally lost or damaged over time  how this design achievement has impacted history  and how it can influence future designs. Empowered with new technical knowledge and know-how gained during the program  the students can apply their skills once they enter the workforce  while the virtual twins can be used by others to teach  study and learn.“Dassault Systèmes is a science-based and purpose-driven company. We’ve been a catalyst for human progress for 40 years. Our passion and creativity have enabled the virtual world to improve and extend the real world  sparking conversations that build bridges between the generations that made past achievements possible and those that will imagine future ones ” said Victoire de Margerie  Vice President  Corporate Equity  Marketing & Communications  Dassault Systèmes. “‘Living Heritage’ is a celebration of this shared heritage. It invites us to explore how today’s solutions can give us a greater understanding of the past – unlocking learning opportunities and helping the next generation map our way to a better future. We’ve been a strong partner of the academic world for four decades. We are always amazed by the creativity of the students who use our 3DEXPERIENCE platform.”Teams will showcase their “Living Heritage” projects at the Cité de la Réussite in Paris June 25-26  including a virtual reality experience that enables anyone to discover the sites in an interactive way. The projects can also be viewed on Dassault Systèmes’ website.Launched in 2020  “The Only Progress is Human” features a series of “acts” aimed to increase awareness of societal and environmental challenges and inspire the use of virtual worlds to drive sustainable innovations.

The complete results from the Phase 2 study of efgartigimod for the treatment of pemphigus were published in the British Journal of Dermatology.“The publication today highlights the value of our collaborative research model with leading academic centers of excellence  revealing an exciting set of new translational data on the pathophysiology of autoimmune skin blistering diseases and the therapeutic rationale of FcRn blockade in pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid ” said Hans de Haard  Ph.D.  Chief Scientific Officer of argenx. “We believe the secondary analysis of our Phase 2 study shows the potential role of FcRn blockade to extend beyond IgG antibody reduction to include an immunomodulatory effect on autoantigen-specific B-cells  which may account for the durable responses observed in the study. We understand the serious unmet need of people living with pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid and are committed to continuing this research on their behalf to bring forward an innovative new treatment option.”Story continuesHighlights from Published Translational Data:Pemphigus and BP are IgG-mediated autoimmune skin blistering diseases In pemphigus  IgG autoantibodies against Dsg-1 and Dsg-3 cause acantholysis or disruption of keratinocyte adhesion; new data suggest role of additional non-desmoglein IgG autoantibodies in pemphigus pathophysiology In BP  IgG autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins (BP180 and BP230) at the dermal-epidermal junction drive pathophysiology of diseaseIn a secondary analysis of a subset of patients in the Phase 2 study of efgartigimod in pemphigus : Efgartigimod treatment resulted in sustained reduction of antigen - specific B - cells in participants with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and foliaceus  maintained following treatment cessation  and which correlated with sustained clinical improvement while total IgG returned to near baseline levels Median CD19+ B- cells remained within normal limits at all timepoints measured  and no new safety signals were detected N o observed effect on total leukocytes  neutrophils  monocytes  or lymphocytes in patients treated with long-term efgartigimod therapy  however frequency of CD19+ B-cells in circulation was observed to decrease following efgartigimod treatmentEfgartigimod was shown to efficiently rescue the loss of keratinocyte adhesion upon anti-Dsg-3 antibodies (anti-Dsg3) and PV IgG treatment  indicating that stabilization of keratinocyte adhesion may present a novel treatment paradigm for pemphigusAbout EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases.About PemphigusPemphigus is a rare group of chronic blistering autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes  and are characterized by painful blisters  erosions and acantholysis  or disruption of keratinocyte adhesion. Blisters often break open  causing serious pain and increased risk of infection. Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceous are the most common forms of pemphigus.About Bullous Pemphigoid (BP)BP is a severe  rare  chronic and recurrent autoimmune disorder characterized by fluid-filled blisters  itching  and redness of the skin. It is the most common subepidermal autoimmune blistering disease. In severe cases with widespread blistering  risk of infection can be life-threatening. Fear of infection and the unpredictable nature of flare ups often has a significant impact on quality of life and psychological well-being.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first-and-only approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S. and Japan.

We believe that by beginning with single agent approval in locally advanced head and neck cancer and expanding through combinations across treatment modalities will create a model that can be replicated across solid tumor indications  improving patient outcomes and driving significant value to shareholders.”Prioritizing Registration Programs and Reducing Operating ExpensesNanobiotix is pursuing various initiatives to reduce operating costs while maintaining targeted research efforts focused on the continued execution of its pivotal phase III study in LA-HNSCC  the continuation of I/O combination Study 1100  and the development of a registration pathway in I/O combination therapy while leveraging its on-going strategic collaboration with MD Anderson to validate the feasibility of future development opportunities. In prioritizing late-stage programs and strategic collaborations  the company plans to deprioritize direct funding in several areas  including:Modifying or postponing additional company-sponsored clinical trials   including planned amendments to Study 102 reducing follow-up time from 24 to 12 months and postponement of post-marketing studies previously planned in soft tissue sarcoma  including planned amendments to Study 102 reducing follow-up time from 24 to 12 months and postponement of post-marketing studies previously planned in soft tissue sarcoma Reducing on-going and previously planned preclinical research   including development activities related to the Company’s subsidiary  Curadigm  including development activities related to the Company’s subsidiary  Curadigm Adjusting planned manufacturing activities to support revised preclinical and clinical development activitiesAdapting infrastructure  including reducing satellite office facilities and implementing a temporary hiring-freezeThese initiatives are expected to reduce the Company’s cash burn by approximately €12-15 million  which will be reflected in Nanobiotix’ financial outlook for 2022 and 2023.First Quarter Financial UpdatesNanobiotix reported cash  cash equivalents  and short-term investments totaling €70.6 million as of March 31  2022  compared to €83.9M as of December 31  2021. To supplement its financial resources  Nanobiotix has established an equity financing line with Kepler Cheuvreux. This line of financing will provide optionality and create near-term flexibility  if needed  as the company continues efforts to reduce operating expenses and  potentially  restructure its existing debt facilities. Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  Nanobiotix anticipates that the available capital will fund its operations into  at least  the fourth quarter of 2023.Implementing Equity Line Financing to Strengthen Financial FlexibilityIn accordance with the terms of this agreement  Kepler Cheuvreux committed to underwrite up to 5 200 000 shares representing  for information purposes  an issued amount of approximately €25m1  over a maximum timeframe of 24 months  provided the contractual conditions are met. Should Nanobiotix choose to use this facility  the shares will be issued based on the volume-weighted average share price on Euronext: Paris for the two trading days prior to issuance  minus a maximum discount 5.0%. In addition to controlling if and when to access capital  including consideration of current share valuation  Nanobiotix has guaranteed access to capital to fund operations along with control over potential dilution despite any sustained turbulence in the broader market  while retaining the right to suspend the implementation of the equity line or terminate this agreement at any time  free of charge.Agreements have been set up based on and in accordance with the 21st resolution from the annual shareholders meeting of April 28  2021. Should Nanobiotix choose to use this facility  the number of shares issued under this agreement and admitted to trading will be disclosed on the Company’s website. In accordance with the provisions of the General Regulations of the French Financial Markets Authority (“AMF”)  this financial operation will not be subject to a prospectus requiring a visa from the AMF.If this financing line were to be fully used with the issue of 5 200 000 shares  a shareholder holding 1.00% of the capital of Nanobiotix before it is set up  would see their stake reduced to 0.87% of the capital on an undiluted basis and to 0.84% of the capital on a fully diluted basis.This operation was advised and structured by Vester Finance. Kepler Cheuvreux is the sole underwriter of the facility and is not expected to maintain ownership of any shares issued in conjunction with the equity line.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday  May 19  2022  at 2:00 PM CET/8:00 AM EDT  prior to the open of the US market.

Acceptance of the MAA means VLA2001 is advancing from the rolling review process and beginning the formal review process by the EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP). If the CHMP accepts Valneva’s conditional marketing authorization application  the Company confirms it would expect to receive a positive CHMP opinion in June 2022.If positive opinion is given by the CHMP  the European Commission (EC) will review the recommendation and provide a final decision on the MAA. If granted by the EC  the centralized marketing authorization would be valid in all European Union Member States as well as in Iceland  Liechtenstein  and Norway.ThomasLingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  “The EMA’s acceptance of the filing for VLA2001 is an important step toward product approval. We remain fully committed and dedicated to working jointly with the regulators  the European members states and the European Commission toward making a more traditional and established COVID-19 vaccine technology available to people in Europe.”About VLA2001VLA2001 is currently the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted vaccine candidate in clinical trials against COVID-19 in Europe. It is intended for active immunization of at-risk populations to prevent carriage and symptomatic infection with COVID-19 during the pandemic and for routine vaccination including addressing new variants. VLA2001 may also be suited for boosting  as repeat booster vaccinations have been shown to work well with whole virus inactivated vaccines. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  design  data read-outs  anticipated results and completion of clinical trials of VLA2001 and with respect to possible regulatory approval of VLA2001.

5224,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.cityam.com/exclusive-why-the-london-stock-exchange-and-euronext-are-moving-their-datacentres-around/,Exclusive: Why the London Stock Exchange and Euronext are moving their datacentres around,1 day ago,Exclusive: Why the London Stock Exchange and Euronext are moving their datacentres aroundAlastair Watson of TNSDatacentre exchange colocation is on the mind of many key players in the City and beyond at the moment. The idea appeals to a wide group of capital markets participants  and for various reasons.For example  with Euronext migrating from Basildon in Essex to the Aruba Global datacentre IT3 in Bergamo this year and the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) moving trading operations from its current London City location to a new London venue  why do market players consider such a relocation?Many financial services players seem to opt for a so-called ‘DIY’ approach – versus a managed service model – when it comes to a datacentre move.A DIY approach is when a company arranges the installation  configuration  connectivity and monitoring of their datacentre equipment within the space they lease from the exchange in-house  said Alastair Watson  who is the managing director for Europe  the Middle East and Africa at Transaction Network Services.In an exclusive interview with City A.M. today  Watson explained there are several things to consider when going DIY  including how much space and power is required  network connections  bandwidth  latency  market data feeds and whether there is a need to connect to additional third-party data or services.Connectivity  market data  power and space costs can quickly add up to tens of thousands of pounds per month. On top of these fees are additional capital costs for equipment and staffing for support and maintenance.There is a lot of talk in the City about ‘colocation’  particularly after LSE’s announcement. Why do firms feel that need?Colocation is when a firm locates its computer equipment in a datacentre managed by a third party. Financial markets  exchanges and trading venues make space available within their datacentres for financial institutions and managed services providers to colocate. Originally firms colocated to benefit from ultra-low latency trading  but now drivers have expanded to include achieving deterministic latency  access to accurately time-stamped market data and connectivity to other venues and cloud services.“The main advantage in colocating at a trading venue’s datacentre is gaining direct access and proximity to the venue’s matching engine  trading network and data to reduce latency.” Alastair WatsonLatency is the time taken for a piece of data on a network to travel from one endpoint to another and is measured in fractions of a second. Reducing latency is crucial for traders as it means they can be more responsive to rapidly changing market conditions.So what are the factors to consider when moving a datacentre from one jurisdiction to another?Working with an expert provider that knows the local rules and regulations is paramount when a datacentre moves jurisdiction. Outsourced providers give access to a suite of services from day one of trading in a new location including order routing  market data and the procurement  installation and management of trading infrastructure. They can make the process of moving location less stressful and more efficient  with a single point of contact and 24-hour access to both technical and exchange specialist expertise.What is the impact of exchange or venue migration to cloud on the colocation market and end user’s requirements?The evolution of the exchange datacentre has seen exchanges partnering with cloud providers to migrate their offerings to cloud. Nasdaq has announced a multi-year partnership with AWS  and similarly the CME with Google announced a 10-year partnership to move their exchange to the cloud.“With that in mind where does this leave colocation? Basically  in the same place – market participants will still benefit from colocation  perhaps more so than before.” Alastair WatsonNasdaq has confirmed it will utilise AWS Outposts. Nasdaq plans to incorporate AWS Outposts directly into its core network to deliver ultra-low-latency edge compute capabilities from its primary datacentre in Carteret  New Jersey.What are datacentres doing to address sustainability?Datacentre power efficiency is measured using a metric called Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)  with a lower PUE indicating greater energy efficiency. Datacentres are in a unique position to positively impact sustainability  as they deliver highly efficient infrastructure that can be backed by renewable energy and integrate new systems such as heat waste recovery. By using a combination of the latest hardware that emits less heat  optimising airflow inside the site  as well as moving to clean and renewable energy sources  large multi-tenant datacentres can dramatically improve efficiency and sustainability.,neutral,0.06,0.92,0.03,negative,0.02,0.4,0.58,True,English,"['London Stock Exchange', 'Euronext', 'datacentres', 'ultra-low-latency edge compute capabilities', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'current London City location', 'Many financial services players', 'many key players', 'managed service model', 'additional capital costs', 'heat waste recovery', 'City A.M.', 'exchange specialist expertise', 'renewable energy sources', 'capital markets participants', 'additional third-party data', 'greater energy efficiency', 'Aruba Global datacentre', 'new London venue', 'managed services providers', 'large multi-tenant datacentres', 'Transaction Network Services', 'time-stamped market data', 'ultra-low latency trading', 'Datacentre power efficiency', 'Datacentre exchange colocation', 'Financial markets', 'wide group', 'market players', 'financial institutions', 'new location', 'market participants', 'less heat', 'Outsourced providers', 'New Jersey', 'new systems', 'exchange datacentre', 'various reasons', 'trading operations', 'managing director', 'Middle East', 'exclusive interview', 'several things', 'network connections', 'data feeds', 'third party', 'trading venues', 'other venues', 'main advantage', 'matching engine', 'trading network', 'one endpoint', 'market conditions', 'expert provider', 'local rules', 'order routing', 'trading infrastructure', 'single point', 'venue migration', 'end user', 'multi-year partnership', '10-year partnership', 'same place', 'core network', 'Usage Effectiveness', 'lower PUE', 'unique position', 'efficient infrastructure', 'latest hardware', 'datacentre move', 'primary datacentre', 'cloud services', 'cloud providers', 'Alastair Watson', 'space costs', 'computer equipment', 'deterministic latency', 'Reducing latency', 'AWS Outposts', 'datacentre equipment', 'direct access', 'one jurisdiction', '24-hour access', 'colocation market', 'DIY approach', 'Euronext', 'TNS', 'mind', 'moment', 'idea', 'example', 'Basildon', 'Essex', 'Bergamo', 'LSEG', 'relocation', 'company', 'installation', 'configuration', 'connectivity', 'monitoring', 'house', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'bandwidth', 'need', 'tens', 'thousands', 'pounds', 'month', 'top', 'fees', 'staffing', 'support', 'maintenance', 'lot', 'talk', 'announcement', 'firms', 'exchanges', 'drivers', 'proximity', 'piece', 'fractions', 'second', 'traders', 'changing', 'factors', 'regulations', 'suite', 'day', 'procurement', 'management', 'process', 'contact', 'technical', 'impact', 'requirements', 'evolution', 'offerings', 'Nasdaq', 'CME', 'Google', 'Carteret', 'sustainability', 'metric', 'combination', 'airflow', 'site', 'clean']",2022-05-20,2022-05-20,cityam.com

In mid-March  the central bank announced its first rate hike in more than three years  a 0.25 percentage point move.In early May  the Fed proceeded to increase interest rates by another 0.50% and indicated that it will further raise borrowing costs throughout this year as it tries to fight surging inflation. The Fed also revealed a strategy to shrink its asset holdings  saying that beginning June 1  it will allow up to $47.5 billion a month to roll off its balance sheet.Besides the rate hikes  concerns about the economic consequence of the war in Ukraine have also contributed to additional FX volatility. The war has already adversely impacted Russia’s ruble and the euro  which is now trading hovering just above $1.05  down from around $1.22 last June.Meanwhile  volatility in currencies can also offer arbitrage opportunities for crypto users. For instance  users can trade stablecoins pegged to the US dollar against stablecoins pegged to the euro or other currencies and enjoy the forex market volatility.Finance is changing.

(the ""Subsidiary"") on the principal terms and conditions below  by way of an issue of warrants directed to the Subsidiary and approval of the transfer of warrants from the Subsidiary to certain employees (the ""Incentive Program 2022/2025"").1. The Incentive Program 2022/2025 comprises certain employees of the Subsidiary (the ""Participants"") and is based on warrants issued by the Company. No directors of the Company (apart from the CEO as capacity as an employee) nor its Subsidiaries will be allowed to participate. The incentive program will include approximately 30 Participants in total and the warrants shall be offered in accordance with the following principles:a. The CEO A maximum of 66 720 warrantsb. Senior Management (4 Participants) A maximum of 126 768 warrantsc. Management (7 Participants) A maximum of 90 072 warrantsd. Staff (up to 18 Participants) A maximum of 50 040 warrants2. Allotted warrants are vested for a period of three years  i.e.  one-third each year.3. Vesting requires that the Participant is still employed by the Subsidiary and has not terminated the employment on the day when the respective vesting takes place. In the event that a Participant ceases to be employed or terminate their employment with the Subsidiary before a vesting day  vested warrants may be exercised at the ordinary time for exercise as described below  but further vesting will not take place.4. The warrants are granted free of charge.5. Participants can exercise allotted and vested warrants during a period of 25 days after the release of the Q2 report 2025.6. The warrants shall be regulated in separate agreements with the respective Participant. The agreement shall  inter alia  include provisions regarding good and bad leaver and restriction on transfer of the warrants. The board of directors shall be responsible for the design and management of the incentive program within the framework of the above-mentioned principal terms and conditions.In order to implement the Incentive Program 2022/2025  the board of directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to approve the terms and conditions of the Incentive Program 2022/2025 under this item (A) and that the Meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants to Kollect on Demand Ltd and on approval of transfer of warrants from Kollect on Demand Ltd to the Participants  as proposed under items (B) and (C) below.(B) Resolution on a directed issue of warrants to Kollect on Demand Ltd1. The Company shall issue no more than 333 600 warrants. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share in the Company. If all warrants are subscribed  transferred to and exercised by the Participants for the subscription of new shares  the Company's share capital will increase by SEK 83 400 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with the standard terms and conditions that is to apply in relation to the warrants).2. The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only be subscribed for by Kollect on Demand Ltd   after which they are to be transferred to the Participants in accordance with the resolution adopted by the Meeting and instructions from the Company's board of directors. The reason for the deviation from shareholders’ pre-emptive right is that the warrants may be used within the framework of the Incentive Program 2022/2025.3. Subscription of warrants shall be made by Kollect on Demand Ltd on a subscription list immediately following the Meeting resolution on this issue of warrants. The board of directors shall be entitled to prolong the subscription period.4. Kollect on Demand Ltd is not to pay anything for the warrants.5. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the period commencing on the day the Company releases its Q2 report in 2025 and the following 25 days. Subscription of new shares may not take place during so-called closed periods according to the EU Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in breach of relevant insider rules and regulations (including the Company's internal guidelines in this respect). Warrants that have not been exercised for subscription of shares by the last day of the exercise period shall lapse.6. Each warrant shall entitle the Participants to subscribe for one new share in the Company at a subscription price amounting to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Kollect on Demand Holding AB share traded on Nasdaq First North Growth Market ten trading days before the annual general meeting. Any share premium shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve.7. The warrants shall be transferred to the Participants in accordance with instructions from the Company's board of directors in accordance with the principles set forth below.8. The shares that are added through the exercise of warrants entitle the Participant to dividend from the first record date for dividends that occur after the share has been entered into the Company's share register.9. The warrants shall be subject to additional terms and conditions  including customary recalculation conditions. As a result  the subscription price of the new shares and the number of shares that each warrant entitles to may be subject to recalculation as a result of certain events  e.g.  split  combination and rights issues.10. Upon full exercise of the warrants the shares in the Company will increase by 333 600  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3 30 per cent.(C) Resolution on approval of transfer of warrants to the ParticipantsA resolution to implement the Incentive Program 2022/2025 by way of issuing warrants in accordance with this proposal also includes an approval of transfer of warrants to the Participants. The board of directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to approve of transfer of warrants from Kollect on Demand Ltd to the Participants.Background and reasoningThe reason for the adoption of the Incentive Program 2022/2025 and the deviation from shareholders’ pre-emptive right to subscribe for new warrants is to be able to create opportunities for the Company and its subsidiary to retain competent personnel by offering a long-term ownership commitment for the employees. Such ownership involvement is expected to stimulate employees to increase their interest in the business and the earnings trend and increase the sense of belonging to the Company.Preparation of the proposalThe principles of the Incentive Program 2022/2025 have been developed by the Company's board of directors without the participation of John O’Connor. The proposal has been prepared with support of external advisors and after consultations with shareholders. The board of directors has thereafter decided to submit this proposal to the Meeting. Excluding those who prepared the matter as instructed by the board  no employee who may be covered by the program has participated in the preparation of the proposal’s terms.Costs and effects on key figuresSince the Incentive Program 2022/2025 only includes foreign employees  the board of directors considers that the program will not cause any costs in the form of accounting costs or social security contributions. The Incentive program will however cause certain administrative costs related to the preparation of the proposal  registration  and subscription of new shares with support of the warrants. The Incentive Program is not expected to have any effects on the Company's key figures.Other incentive programsThe Company has one other incentive program adopted by the annual general meeting in 2021.A valid resolution pursuant to this item 11 requires that the resolution be supported by shareholders with at least nine-tenths 9/10 of both the votes cast and the number of shares represented at Meeting.Resolution on amending the articles of association (item 12)The board of directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to introduce a new paragraph 10 in the articles of association to enable participation in general meetings by postal voting and for the Company to collect proxies. The proposed amendment to the articles of association is set out below.Proposed wording § 10 The board of directors may decide that the shareholders may exercise their voting rights by postal voting prior to general meetings in accordance with Chapter 7 Section 4 a of the Companies Act. The board of directors may also collect proxies in accordance with the procedure laid down in Chapter 7 section 4 of the Companies Act.The above proposal for a new wording of the articles of association also entails a change in the numbering as a result of the introduction of a new paragraph 10.A resolution in relation to this item 12 is valid only if supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Meeting.Authorization for the board of directors to resolve on issues of shares  warrants and convertibles (item 13)It is proposed that the Meeting authorizes the board of directors to resolve – at one or several occasions and for the time period until the next annual general meeting – to increase the Company’s share capital by new share issues and to issue warrants and/or convertible bonds  to the extent possible according to the Company’s articles of association  as applicable.New share issues  as well as issues of warrants and convertible bonds  may be made with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions pursuant to Chapter 2 section 5 of the Swedish Companies Act. Pursuant to Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  the Board of Directors may not by virtue of this authorization resolve on issues to board members and/or employees in the Company.The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and the acting scope of the board of directors. Should the board of directors resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason shall be to enable the external raising of capital (through new owners of strategic importance for the Company or otherwise) for the financing of the Company’s business  commercialization and development of the Company’s products and intellectual property rights and/or acquisitions of other companies or businesses.A resolution in relation to this item 13 is valid only if supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Meeting.Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to undertake minor adjustments of the resolutions (item 14)The Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting authorizes the board of directors  the CEO or a person otherwise designated by the board  to undertake such minor adjustments and clarifications of the decisions made at the Meeting to the extent required for registration of the resolutions.Documents and informationPursuant to Chapter 7  Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act  shareholders have the right to request information from the board of directors and the managing director at the Meeting regarding circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda and circumstances which may affect the assessment of the Company’s financial position. The board of directors and the managing director are obliged to provide such information provided that the Board of Directors considers that it will not entail any significant harm to the Company.

The table illustrates the Payment at Maturity of the Notes (including the final Contingent Coupon  if payable) for a hypothetical range of performance for the Reference Stock  assuming the following terms and that the Notes are not automatically called prior to maturity:Hypothetical Initial Stock Price: $100.00* Hypothetical Trigger Price and Coupon Barrier: $70.00  which is 70% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Rate: 10% per annum (or 2.50% per quarter)  which is the midpoint of the Contingent Coupon Rate range set forth above. Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Amount: $25.00 per quarter Observation Dates: Quarterly Principal Amount: $1 000 per Note* The hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $100 used in the examples below has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the expected actual Initial Stock Price. The actual Initial Stock Price will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Prices are shown in the first column on the left. The second column shows the Payment at Maturity for a range of Final Stock Prices on the Valuation Date. The third column shows the amount of cash to be paid on the Notes per $1 000 in principal amount. If the Notes are called prior to maturity  the hypothetical examples below will not be relevant  and you will receive on the applicable Coupon Payment Date  for each $1 000 principal amount  $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Price Payment at Maturity as Percentage of Principal Amount Cash Payment Amount per $1 000 in Principal Amount $180.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $170.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $160.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $150.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $140.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $130.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $120.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $110.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $100.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $90.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $80.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $70.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $69.99 69.99% $699.90 $60.00 60.00% $600.00 $50.00 50.00% $500.00 $40.00 40.00% $400.00 $30.00 30.00% $300.00 $20.00 20.00% $200.00 $10.00 10.00% $100.00 $0.00 0.00% $0.00* Including the final Contingent Coupon  if payable.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesHypothetical Examples of Amounts Payable at MaturityThe following hypothetical examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated  assuming the Notes have not been called.Example 1: The price of the Reference Stock increases by 25% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $125.00. Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 25% appreciation in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 2: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 10% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $90.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 10% decline in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 3: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 60% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $40.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the final Contingent Coupon will not be payable on the Maturity Date  and we will pay only $400.00 for each $1 000 in the principal amount of the Notes  calculated as follows:Principal Amount + (Principal Amount x Reference Stock Return)= $1 000 + ($1 000 x -60.00%) = $1 000 - $600.00 = $400.00* * *The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on theoretical prices of the Reference Stock that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payments at Maturity shown above  and those amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Stock. These risks are explained in more detail in the section “Risk Factors” in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes• You May Lose All or a Portion of the Principal Amount at Maturity — Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the trading price of the Reference Stock between the Trade Date and the Valuation Date. If the Notes are not automatically called and the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price  the amount that you receive at maturity will represent a loss of your principal that is proportionate to the decline in the closing price of the Reference Stock from the Trade Date to the Valuation Date. Any Contingent Coupons received on the Notes prior to the Maturity Date may not be sufficient to compensate for any such loss.• The Notes Are Subject to an Automatic Call — If on any Observation Date beginning in November 2022  the closing price of the Reference Stock is greater than or equal to the Call Stock Price  then the Notes will be automatically called. If the Notes are automatically called  then  on the applicable Call Settlement Date  for each $1 000 in principal amount  you will receive $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the applicable Call Settlement Date. You will not receive any Contingent Coupons after the Call Settlement Date. You may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the automatic call in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been called.• You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupons — We will not necessarily make any coupon payments on the Notes. If the closing price of the Reference Stock on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier  we will not pay you the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date. If the closing price of the Reference Stock is less than the Coupon Barrier on each of the Observation Dates and on the Valuation Date  we will not pay you any Contingent Coupons during the term of  and you will not receive a positive return on your Notes. Generally  this non-payment of the Contingent Coupon coincides with a period of greater risk of principal loss on your Notes. Accordingly  if we do not pay the Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date  you will also incur a loss of principal  because the Final Stock Price will be less than the Trigger Price.• The Call Feature and the Contingent Coupon Feature Limit Your Potential Return — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified Contingent Coupon Rate  regardless of the appreciation of the Reference Stock. In addition  the total return on the Notes will vary based on the number of Observation Dates on which the Contingent Coupon becomes payable prior to maturity or an automatic call. Further  if the Notes are called due to the Call Feature  you will not receive any Contingent Coupons or any other payment in respect of any Observation Dates after the applicable Call Settlement Date. Since the Notes could be called as early as the second Observation Date  the total return on the Notes could be minimal. If the Notes are not called  you may be subject to the full downside performance of the Reference Stock even though your potential return is limited to the Contingent Coupon Rate. As a result  the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in the Reference Stock.• Your Return on the Notes May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity — The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.• Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes — The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of any Contingent Coupons  if payable  and the amount due on any relevant payment date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on the applicable payment dates. This will be the case even if the price of the Reference Stock increases after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at any time during the term of the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesRisks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes• There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes-Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses — There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any other affiliate of ours may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Less than the Price to the Public — The initial estimated value that will be set forth in the final pricing supplement for the Notes does not represent a minimum price at which we  RBCCM or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase the Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity  their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and the initial estimated value. This is due to  among other things  changes in the price of the Reference Stock  the borrowing rate we pay to issue securities of this kind  and the inclusion in the price to the public of the underwriting discount and the estimated costs relating to our hedging of the Notes. These factors  together with various credit  market and economic factors over the term of the Notes  are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell your Notes prior to maturity may be less than your original purchase price  as any such sale price would not be expected to include the underwriting discount and the hedging costs relating to the Notes. In addition to bid-ask spreads  the value of the Notes determined by RBCCM for any secondary market price is expected to be based on the secondary rate rather than the internal funding rate used to price the Notes and determine the initial estimated value. As a result  the secondary price will be less than if the internal funding rate was used. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly  you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes that We Will Provide in the Final Pricing Supplement Will Be an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Are Set — The initial estimated value of the Notes will be based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See “Structuring the Notes” below. Our estimate will be based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.The value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities• Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Stock that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders’ interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the share price of the Reference Stock  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with the Reference Stock Issuer  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could include investment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates’ obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to theAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesReference Stock. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the share price of the Reference Stock  and  therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Stock• Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Reference Stock — The return on your Notes is unlikely to reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned shares of the Reference Stock. For instance  you will not receive or be entitled to receive any dividend payments or other distributions on the Reference Stock during the term of your Notes. As an owner of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or any other rights that holders of the Reference Stock may have. Furthermore  the Reference Stock may appreciate substantially during the term of the Notes  while your potential return will be limited to the applicable Contingent Coupon payments.• There Is No Affiliation Between the Reference Stock Issuer and RBCCM  and RBCCM Is Not Responsible for any Disclosure by the Reference Stock Issuer — We are not affiliated with the Reference Stock Issuer. However  we and our affiliates may currently  or from time to time in the future engage  in business with the Reference Stock Issuer. Nevertheless  neither we nor our affiliates assume any responsibilities for the accuracy or the completeness of any information that any other company prepares. You  as an investor in the Notes  should make your own investigation into the Reference Stock. The Reference Stock Issuer is not involved in this offering and has no obligation of any sort with respect to your Notes. The Reference Stock Issuer has no obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason  including when taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of your Notes.• The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments — The payment at maturity  each Observation Date and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see “General Terms of the Notes—Market Disruption Events” in the product prospectus supplement.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE STOCK ISSUERThe Reference Stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Companies with securities registered under that Act are required to file periodically certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information filed with the SEC can be obtained through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition  information regarding the Reference Stock may be obtained from other sources including  but not limited to  press releases  newspaper articles and other publicly disseminated documents.The following information regarding the Reference Stock Issuer is derived from publicly available information.We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of reports filed by the Reference Stock Issuer with the SEC  information published by it on its website or in any other format  information about it obtained from any other source or the information provided below.We obtained the information regarding the historical performance of the Reference Stock set forth below from Bloomberg Financial Markets.Starbucks CorporationStarbucks Corporation retails  roasts  and provides its own brand of specialty coffee. The company operates retail locations and sells whole bean coffees through its sales group  supermarkets  and on the Internet. The company also produces and sells bottled coffee drinks and a line of ice creams.The company’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “SBUX.”Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesHistorical InformationThe graph below illustrates the performance of the Reference Stock from January 1  2012 to May 18  2022  reflecting a hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $71.28  which was its closing price on May 18  2022. The red line represents a hypothetical Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price of $49.90  which is equal to 70% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price (rounded to two decimal places). The actual Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price will be based on the closing price of the Reference Stock on the Trade Date.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesSUPPLEMENTAL DISCUSSION OFU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCESThe following disclosure supplements  and to the extent inconsistent supersedes  the discussion in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”Under Section 871(m) of the Code  a “dividend equivalent” payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States. Such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (“ELIs”) that are “specified ELIs” may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference  directly or indirectly  an interest in an “underlying security ” which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However  the IRS has issued guidance that states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the effective dates of the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to provide that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1  2023. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments  if any  under the Notes. However  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Reference Stock or the Notes  and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter  or have entered  into other transactions in respect of the Reference Stock or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding  we (or the applicable withholding agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on or about May 31  2022  which is the second (2nd) business day following the Trade Date (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+2”). See “Plan of Distribution” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021. For additional information as to the relationship between us and RBCCM  please see the section “Plan of Distribution—Conflicts of Interest” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021.In the initial offering of the Notes  they will be offered to investors at a purchase price equal to par  except with respect to certain accounts as indicated on the cover page of this document. In addition to the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page  we or one of our affiliates may also pay an expected fee to a broker-dealer that is unaffiliated with us for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.The value of the Notes shown on your account statement may be based on RBCCM’s estimate of the value of the Notes if RBCCM or another of our affiliates were to make a market in the Notes (which it is not obligated to do). That estimate will be based upon the price that RBCCM may pay for the Notes in light of then prevailing market conditions  our creditworthiness and transaction costs. For a period of approximately 6 months after the issue date of the Notes  the value of the Notes that may be shown on your account statement may be higher than RBCCM’s estimated value of the Notes at that time. This is because the estimated value of the Notes will not include the underwriting discount and our hedging costs and profits; however  the value of the Notes shown on your account statement during that period may initially be a higher amount  reflecting the addition of RBCCM's underwriting discount and our estimated costs and profits from hedging the Notes. This excess is expected to decrease over time until the end of this period. After this period  if RBCCM repurchases your Notes  it expects to do so at prices that reflect their estimated value.We may use this terms supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  RBCCM or another of our affiliates may use this terms supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this terms supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.STRUCTURING THE NOTESThe Notes are our debt securities  the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Stock. As is the case for all of our debt securities  including our structured notes  the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition  because structured notes result in increased operational  funding and liability management costs to us  we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity. Using this relatively lower implied borrowing rate rather than the secondary market rate  is a factor that is likely to reduce the initial estimated value of the Notes at the time their terms are set. Unlike the estimated value that will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement  any value of the Notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction may be based on a different funding rate  which may result in a lower value for the Notes than if our initial internal funding rate were used.In order to satisfy our payment obligations under the Notes  we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options  put options or other derivatives) on the issue date with RBCCM or one of our other subsidiaries. The terms of these hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors  including our creditworthiness  interest rate movements  the volatility of the Reference Stock  and the tenor of the Notes. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.The lower implied borrowing rate is a factor that reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you. The initial offering price of the Notes also reflects the underwriting commission and our estimated hedging costs. These factors result in the initial estimated value for the Notes on the Trade Date being less than their public offering price.

5260,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.ledgerinsights.com/swift-in-cross-border-cbdc-interoperability-trial-with-cap-gemini/,SWIFT in cross border CBDC interoperability trial with Cap Gemini,11 hours ago,Yesterday SWIFT  the organization responsible for messaging most cross border payments  has started a new set of CBDC interoperability experiments partnering with Cap Gemini. It’s concerned that without interoperability  individual central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could create new domestic silos  fragmenting the global payment landscape.Last year SWIFT published a report with Accenture sharing work on interoperability between a CBDC and a conventional real-time gross settlement system (RTGS). It’s also conducting experiments for tokenized digital assets with Clearstream  Northern Trust and SETL.This latest work with Cap Gemini is about enabling interoperability between different types of CBDCs  some of which might be centralized  and others might use blockchain.“One (challenge) is that there will be multiple CBDC platforms in development in parallel to the existing traditional payment systems ” said Nick Kerigan  Head of Innovation  SWIFT. “Different systems and different CBDCs will need to be able to efficiently work together  or it will hamper the ability of businesses and consumers to make frictionless cross-border payments using CBDCs.”The tests explore interlinking these disparate systems via the SWIFT platform so that a cross border payment would link the origin CBDC system to SWIFT and from there on to the destination CBDC system.It’s tackling three use cases  CBDC to CBDC  fiat to CBDC  and CBDC to fiat.“If the experiments are successful  it will demonstrate that SWIFT has the capability and technical components to interlink different networks ” said Kerigan. “This would help solve a huge technology and industry challenge facing CBDCs.”A bigger CBDC challenge for cross border paymentsCBDC is being explored for cross border payments in part because of the current slow payments and the need to use intermediaries or correspondent banks. In reality  SWIFT’s messages are very fast  although previously  it was hard to discover why a payment was delayed. Many international payment holdups relate to:inaccurate bank informationthe need to use correspondent banksanti-money laundering queries.So while SWIFT has rightly identified issues with CBDC interoperability  perhaps there are even more fundamental challenges.There are multiple ongoing cross border CBDC experiments that include several central banks. Singapore’s Project Dunbar involving four central banks released findings that raise a key issue. If you don’t want the inefficiencies of using correspondent banks  then the obvious solution is to allow foreign banks to hold a domestic CBDC or have a central bank account. That’s something that many central banks are not keen to do.Otherwise  you will often end up with correspondent banks handling CBDCs for cross border payments with SWIFT in the middle. That seems rather similar to the current status quo. There is one advantage in that the message and money would move together with a CBDC  but will that address the real challenges?,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.08,0.19,0.74,True,English,"['cross border CBDC interoperability trial', 'Cap Gemini', 'SWIFT', 'conventional real-time gross settlement system', 'multiple ongoing cross border CBDC experiments', 'individual central bank digital currencies', 'Many international payment holdups', 'most cross border payments', 'existing traditional payment systems', 'central bank account', 'tokenized digital assets', 'inaccurate bank information', 'multiple CBDC platforms', 'many central banks', 'frictionless cross-border payments', 'current slow payments', 'global payment landscape', 'three use cases', 'anti-money laundering queries', 'current status quo', 'origin CBDC system', 'destination CBDC system', 'several central banks', 'four central banks', 'new domestic silos', 'bigger CBDC challenge', 'CBDC interoperability experiments', 'Different systems', 'disparate systems', 'domestic CBDC', 'new set', 'correspondent banks', 'foreign banks', 'One (challenge', 'industry challenge', 'Cap Gemini', 'Northern Trust', 'different types', 'technical components', 'different networks', 'huge technology', 'fundamental challenges', 'Project Dunbar', 'key issue', 'obvious solution', 'one advantage', 'real challenges', 'latest work', 'Nick Kerigan', 'different CBDCs', 'SWIFT platform', 'organization', 'report', 'Accenture', 'RTGS', 'Clearstream', 'SETL', 'others', 'blockchain', 'development', 'parallel', 'Head', 'Innovation', 'businesses', 'consumers', 'tests', 'fiat', 'capability', 'part', 'need', 'intermediaries', 'reality', 'messages', 'issues', 'Singapore', 'findings', 'inefficiencies', 'something', 'middle']",2022-05-20,2022-05-20,ledgerinsights.com

The table illustrates the Payment at Maturity of the Notes (including the final Contingent Coupon  if payable) for a hypothetical range of performance for the Reference Stock  assuming the following terms and that the Notes are not automatically called prior to maturity:Hypothetical Initial Stock Price: $100.00* Hypothetical Trigger Price and Coupon Barrier: $70.00  which is 70% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Rate: 10% per annum (or 2.50% per quarter)  which is the midpoint of the Contingent Coupon Rate range set forth above. Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Amount: $25.00 per quarter Observation Dates: Quarterly Principal Amount: $1 000 per Note* The hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $100 used in the examples below has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the expected actual Initial Stock Price. The actual Initial Stock Price will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Prices are shown in the first column on the left. The second column shows the Payment at Maturity for a range of Final Stock Prices on the Valuation Date. The third column shows the amount of cash to be paid on the Notes per $1 000 in principal amount. If the Notes are called prior to maturity  the hypothetical examples below will not be relevant  and you will receive on the applicable Coupon Payment Date  for each $1 000 principal amount  $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Price Payment at Maturity as Percentage of Principal Amount Cash Payment Amount per $1 000 in Principal Amount $180.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $170.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $160.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $150.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $140.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $130.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $120.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $110.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $100.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $90.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $80.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $70.00 102.50%* $1 025.00* $69.99 69.99% $699.90 $60.00 60.00% $600.00 $50.00 50.00% $500.00 $40.00 40.00% $400.00 $30.00 30.00% $300.00 $20.00 20.00% $200.00 $10.00 10.00% $100.00 $0.00 0.00% $0.00* Including the final Contingent Coupon  if payable.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesHypothetical Examples of Amounts Payable at MaturityThe following hypothetical examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated  assuming the Notes have not been called.Example 1: The price of the Reference Stock increases by 25% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $125.00. Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 25% appreciation in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 2: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 10% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $90.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 10% decline in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 3: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 60% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $40.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the final Contingent Coupon will not be payable on the Maturity Date  and we will pay only $400.00 for each $1 000 in the principal amount of the Notes  calculated as follows:Principal Amount + (Principal Amount x Reference Stock Return)= $1 000 + ($1 000 x -60.00%) = $1 000 - $600.00 = $400.00* * *The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on theoretical prices of the Reference Stock that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payments at Maturity shown above  and those amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Stock. These risks are explained in more detail in the section “Risk Factors” in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes• You May Lose All or a Portion of the Principal Amount at Maturity — Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the trading price of the Reference Stock between the Trade Date and the Valuation Date. If the Notes are not automatically called and the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price  the amount that you receive at maturity will represent a loss of your principal that is proportionate to the decline in the closing price of the Reference Stock from the Trade Date to the Valuation Date. Any Contingent Coupons received on the Notes prior to the Maturity Date may not be sufficient to compensate for any such loss.• The Notes Are Subject to an Automatic Call — If on any Observation Date beginning in November 2022  the closing price of the Reference Stock is greater than or equal to the Call Stock Price  then the Notes will be automatically called. If the Notes are automatically called  then  on the applicable Call Settlement Date  for each $1 000 in principal amount  you will receive $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the applicable Call Settlement Date. You will not receive any Contingent Coupons after the Call Settlement Date. You may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the automatic call in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been called.• You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupons — We will not necessarily make any coupon payments on the Notes. If the closing price of the Reference Stock on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier  we will not pay you the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date. If the closing price of the Reference Stock is less than the Coupon Barrier on each of the Observation Dates and on the Valuation Date  we will not pay you any Contingent Coupons during the term of  and you will not receive a positive return on your Notes. Generally  this non-payment of the Contingent Coupon coincides with a period of greater risk of principal loss on your Notes. Accordingly  if we do not pay the Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date  you will also incur a loss of principal  because the Final Stock Price will be less than the Trigger Price.• The Call Feature and the Contingent Coupon Feature Limit Your Potential Return — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified Contingent Coupon Rate  regardless of the appreciation of the Reference Stock. In addition  the total return on the Notes will vary based on the number of Observation Dates on which the Contingent Coupon becomes payable prior to maturity or an automatic call. Further  if the Notes are called due to the Call Feature  you will not receive any Contingent Coupons or any other payment in respect of any Observation Dates after the applicable Call Settlement Date. Since the Notes could be called as early as the second Observation Date  the total return on the Notes could be minimal. If the Notes are not called  you may be subject to the full downside performance of the Reference Stock even though your potential return is limited to the Contingent Coupon Rate. As a result  the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in the Reference Stock.• Your Return on the Notes May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity — The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.• Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes — The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of any Contingent Coupons  if payable  and the amount due on any relevant payment date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on the applicable payment dates. This will be the case even if the price of the Reference Stock increases after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at any time during the term of the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesRisks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes• There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes-Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses — There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any other affiliate of ours may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Less than the Price to the Public — The initial estimated value that will be set forth in the final pricing supplement for the Notes does not represent a minimum price at which we  RBCCM or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase the Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity  their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and the initial estimated value. This is due to  among other things  changes in the price of the Reference Stock  the borrowing rate we pay to issue securities of this kind  and the inclusion in the price to the public of the underwriting discount and the estimated costs relating to our hedging of the Notes. These factors  together with various credit  market and economic factors over the term of the Notes  are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell your Notes prior to maturity may be less than your original purchase price  as any such sale price would not be expected to include the underwriting discount and the hedging costs relating to the Notes. In addition to bid-ask spreads  the value of the Notes determined by RBCCM for any secondary market price is expected to be based on the secondary rate rather than the internal funding rate used to price the Notes and determine the initial estimated value. As a result  the secondary price will be less than if the internal funding rate was used. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly  you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes that We Will Provide in the Final Pricing Supplement Will Be an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Are Set — The initial estimated value of the Notes will be based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See “Structuring the Notes” below. Our estimate will be based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.The value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities• Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Stock that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders’ interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the share price of the Reference Stock  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with the Reference Stock Issuer  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could include investment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates’ obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to theAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesReference Stock. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the share price of the Reference Stock  and  therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Stock• Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Reference Stock — The return on your Notes is unlikely to reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned shares of the Reference Stock. For instance  you will not receive or be entitled to receive any dividend payments or other distributions on the Reference Stock during the term of your Notes.

The red line represents a hypothetical Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price of $49.90  which is equal to 70% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price (rounded to two decimal places). The actual Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price will be based on the closing price of the Reference Stock on the Trade Date.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesSUPPLEMENTAL DISCUSSION OFU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCESThe following disclosure supplements  and to the extent inconsistent supersedes  the discussion in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”Under Section 871(m) of the Code  a “dividend equivalent” payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States. Such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (“ELIs”) that are “specified ELIs” may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference  directly or indirectly  an interest in an “underlying security ” which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However  the IRS has issued guidance that states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the effective dates of the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to provide that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1  2023. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments  if any  under the Notes. However  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Reference Stock or the Notes  and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter  or have entered  into other transactions in respect of the Reference Stock or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding  we (or the applicable withholding agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on or about May 31  2022  which is the second (2nd) business day following the Trade Date (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+2”). See “Plan of Distribution” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021. For additional information as to the relationship between us and RBCCM  please see the section “Plan of Distribution—Conflicts of Interest” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021.In the initial offering of the Notes  they will be offered to investors at a purchase price equal to par  except with respect to certain accounts as indicated on the cover page of this document. In addition to the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page  we or one of our affiliates may also pay an expected fee to a broker-dealer that is unaffiliated with us for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.The value of the Notes shown on your account statement may be based on RBCCM’s estimate of the value of the Notes if RBCCM or another of our affiliates were to make a market in the Notes (which it is not obligated to do). That estimate will be based upon the price that RBCCM may pay for the Notes in light of then prevailing market conditions  our creditworthiness and transaction costs. For a period of approximately 6 months after the issue date of the Notes  the value of the Notes that may be shown on your account statement may be higher than RBCCM’s estimated value of the Notes at that time. This is because the estimated value of the Notes will not include the underwriting discount and our hedging costs and profits; however  the value of the Notes shown on your account statement during that period may initially be a higher amount  reflecting the addition of RBCCM's underwriting discount and our estimated costs and profits from hedging the Notes. This excess is expected to decrease over time until the end of this period. After this period  if RBCCM repurchases your Notes  it expects to do so at prices that reflect their estimated value.We may use this terms supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  RBCCM or another of our affiliates may use this terms supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this terms supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.STRUCTURING THE NOTESThe Notes are our debt securities  the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Stock. As is the case for all of our debt securities  including our structured notes  the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition  because structured notes result in increased operational  funding and liability management costs to us  we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity. Using this relatively lower implied borrowing rate rather than the secondary market rate  is a factor that is likely to reduce the initial estimated value of the Notes at the time their terms are set. Unlike the estimated value that will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement  any value of the Notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction may be based on a different funding rate  which may result in a lower value for the Notes than if our initial internal funding rate were used.In order to satisfy our payment obligations under the Notes  we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options  put options or other derivatives) on the issue date with RBCCM or one of our other subsidiaries. The terms of these hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors  including our creditworthiness  interest rate movements  the volatility of the Reference Stock  and the tenor of the Notes. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.The lower implied borrowing rate is a factor that reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you. The initial offering price of the Notes also reflects the underwriting commission and our estimated hedging costs. These factors result in the initial estimated value for the Notes on the Trade Date being less than their public offering price.

5265,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-frge/forge-global-holdings/news/painful-week-for-individual-investors-invested-in-forge-glob,Painful week for individual investors invested in Forge Global Holdings  Inc. (NYSE:FRGE) after 26% drop  institutions also suffered losses,10 hours ago,If you want to know who really controls Forge Global Holdings  Inc. ( )  then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 49% ownership. Put another way  the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Following a 26% decrease in the stock price last week  individual investors suffered the most losses  but institutions who own 23% stock also took a hit.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Forge Global Holdings  beginning with the chart below.NYSE:FRGE Ownership Breakdown May 20th 2022What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Forge Global Holdings?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Forge Global Holdings already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed  they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes  just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Forge Global Holdings  (below). Of course  keep in mind that there are other factors to consider  too.NYSE:FRGE Earnings and Revenue Growth May 20th 2022We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Forge Global Holdings. Our data shows that Deutsche Boerse AG  Asset Management Arm is the largest shareholder with 14% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile  the second and third largest shareholders  hold 8.3% and 6.0%  of the shares outstanding  respectively. Furthermore  CEO Kelly Rodriques is the owner of 3.3% of the company's shares.After doing some more digging  we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company  suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research  it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. We're not picking up on any analyst coverage of the stock at the moment  so the company is unlikely to be widely held.Insider Ownership Of Forge Global HoldingsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders  capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However  it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members  especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However  on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Forge Global Holdings  Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$553m stake in this US$3.6b business. It is good to see this level of investment. You canGeneral Public OwnershipThe general public  who are usually individual investors  hold a 49% stake in Forge Global Holdings. While this group can't necessarily call the shots  it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Equity OwnershipWith a stake of 13%  private equity firms could influence the Forge Global Holdings board. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term  but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight  we need to consider other information  too. Consider risks  for instance. Every company has them  and we've spotted you should know about.Of course this may not be the best stock to buy.

We are still facing important challenges in our electronic component supply chain but up to now we have been able to handle this extra challenge. This provides us sufficient confidence today to confirm our earlier revenue guidance for 2022 of EUR 125 million to EUR 140 million.Our 2 main Market Pillars (Live Service Providers and Live Audience Business) are further showing revenue growth compared to Q1 2021. Our third Market Pillar (Big Event Rental) will also generate the expected ‘big event year’ results in 2022.Our Live Service Providers (LSP) customers are continuing their LiveCeption (our live production replay and highlights solution) upgrade programs  leveraging our new LSM-VIA replay controller designed for IP-based remote production as it has been proven once again during the Superbowl and many other major winter sporting events.Next to this  we continue enjoying strong commercial traction with our Live Audience Business (LAB) customers for their broadcast center modernization projects. Our EVS MediaCeption solution (content management for live productions) currently in operation by several customers is a proof point for the market that EVS is a trusted partner for these challenging transformation journeys.For our Big Event Rental  EVS has supported the live production of a major winter sport event early this year and is planning to support other major sport events organized in the Middle East later this year.Since our largest acquisition ever of Axon in May 2020  it is good to see that next to the successful operational integration  we also enjoy a strong commercial traction that supports our Order Intake growth. The recently announced MediaInfra Strada routing system project for Fox Sports USA  represents our largest-ever Media Infrastructure deal. The integration of MediaInfra Solutions with other EVS products and solutions families offers EVS a much broader footprint and new capabilities to address its customers’ needs while offering new revenue stream perspectives. Thanks to the involvement of many stakeholders  EVS is now proposing a disruptive  future safe and TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) optimized approach for our customers engaging in the modernization of their media infrastructure.To overcome potential shortages of electronic components due to the current market conditions  we have extended our standard delivery times and we continue to proactively secure our inventory.The high and global inflation has an important impact on our remuneration costs. It is our intent to compensate the impact of those increased costs by applying specific price increases.Overall  we feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability and performance of our solutions and services.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said: “Our 2022 secured revenue as of March 31st amounts to EUR 91.0 million (+35 2% compared to last year). Next to a strong secured revenue  our order intake is also continuing the momentum of 2021  with a growth in confirmed orders of +29 0% in the first 3 months of the year. Both trends considerably subscribe our intentions to grow our revenue in 2022. Our revenue guidance remains unchanged in the range of EUR 125 - 140 million  still reflecting potential delivery issues we may face following the shortage on the electronic components market. Our operating expenditure evolves in line with our expectations  though inflation may influence our models towards the high-end of the range provided.”EVS MARKET DYNAMICS & CUSTOMER WINSDuring the first quarter  EVS delivered successfully major winter events  serving the host broadcaster  as well as multiple right holders  including NBC. As every year  EVS also supported its customers (facility companies and broadcasters) delivering the NFL Superbowl: one of the most watched events on earth.For Live Service Providers  2020 is an old souvenir. These players continue to upgrade their portfolio of replay services to leverage the advantages of the combination of XT-VIA and LSM-VIA. Channel partners continue to be successful selling the LiveCeption Pure solution for smaller OB Vans and venues. The new MediaInfra Strada evolutive routing solution also made its entry within IP OB Vans in North America.Our LAB customers continue to upgrade their facilities both with IP Media Infrastructure and with modernized workflows based on EVS VIA platform. EVS continues the deployment of the projects sold during previous quarters.The major multi-million deal announced during NAB about Fox Sports US selecting Media Infrastructure Strada flexible routing solution is an additional proof point of the traction for the new EVS solutions and the success of the Axon integration within EVS.New versions of solutions have been announced during Q1 2022:Neuron supports a new application  called Neuron Protect  which fulfills the increasing demand for more secured solutions: higher level of redundancy on top of IP networks. It proves that EVS considers security as a top priority and provides new solution components to face the challenges faced by the industry. The new “Compress” version of Neuron offers new low-bitrate codec  JPEG-XS compression required for video transport in remote operations.With the addition of the new version of IP Core to Cerebrum  additional routing capabilities are offered making use of SDN to ensure fully secured orchestration of any IP-based video signals.The new version of “MediaCeption signature” offers a comprehensive set of content management applications combining advanced software and Web-based modules for an even richer workflows from ingest to playout.With the RTBF deal announced in February 2022  EVS co-develops a future Flexible Control Room solution build on Cerebrum: the solution - embracing production automation - will support the broadcasters in their transformation to produce more efficiently with dynamic scaling during a production  while proposing an open solution optimized in terms of user experience for operators of all generations.The tensions around availability of electronic components are going on and are even increasing based on the new geopolitical situation. EVS has announced a typical delay of 20 weeks between the order and the delivery to cope with the delays. Until now  all orders have been shipped on time thanks to the huge efforts and the magic talents of several teams  adapting to the different combinations of components while refusing to compromise on quality.Despite the war for talent  EVS is also successfully hiring to strengthen the team and support expected growth  mainly in R&D and Customer Services teams to further develop the solutions and in the US to better support key customers and channel partners in the region.The teams were also very happy to be back at the NAB tradeshow to meet customers face to face  engage into fruitful conversations  and demonstrate for the first time in live situation for some customers the numerous new solutions and features proposed by EVS.The return to NAB was also special since celebrated through the NAB 2022 Best Of Show award for Neuron Protect which is the first NAB award for a Media Infrastructure product inside EVS.At the beginning of this year  EVS also enhanced and extended the leadership team with two new members  Alex Redfern as CTO and Xavier Orri as EVP Operations & Projects  to sustain the growth path engaged by the company. Two US colleagues - James Stellpflug as SVP Customer Success NALA and David Pinkel as SVP Sales North America - have also been promoted to further strengthen and drive the EVS teams in the Americas.OUTLOOKThe 2022 secured revenue on March 31st amounts to EUR 81.8 million compared to EUR 54.1 million last year (YOY +51 2%  excluding Big Event Rental). An additional EUR 9.2 million orders already received for Big Event Rental will be delivered and recognized later in 2022  ensuring an overall secured revenue for 2022 at end of March of EUR 91.0 million.In addition to those 2022 secured revenue numbers  EVS has EUR 15.5 million of orders to be invoiced in 2023 and beyond (excl. Big Event Rental)  a growth of 5 4%.The revenue guidance of EUR 125 – 140 million is maintained  with securec revenue and order intake sustaining growth in 2022.Operational expenses continue in line with the guidance provided (growth between 5-10%) with inflation pushing the growth towards the higher end of the range.CORPORATE CALENDARAugust 25th  2022 : 1H22 resultsNovember 17th  2022 : 3Q22 trading updateFor more information  please contact:Veerle De Wit*  CFOEVS Broadcast Equipment S.A.

Inveniam via Inveniam.io  is the operating system for private market data that drives price discovery and automated waterfall calculations. Rialto Markets’ fully functional alternative trading system (ATS) is unlocking secondary trading in the private securities market for retail and accredited investors.Shari Noonan  Rialto Markets CEO  who is leading this effort  offered  “Trading shares used to be restricted to certain companies that could afford to publicly list on a platform such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq  but a regulated secondary market for private company shares opens up trading and liquidity  and ultimately  price discovery.”The partnership arrives at a critical juncture for private market companies as in the 10 plus years prior to 2019  capital flowing into capital assets grew at 4 times the pace of public markets. After a down year in 2020  2021 saw U.S. private markets establish a new highwater mark for fundraising and as a result  more companies are staying private longer or bypassing going public. Additionally  in 2022  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission laid out a number of proposals including requirements for registered private funds advisors to distribute quarterly statements to private fund investors with a detailed accounting of all fees and expenses during the reporting period. Also in 2021  the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation  announced its Digital Securities Management initiative  a platform that will  subject to regulatory approval  “for the first time  provide an industry-wide solution that offers common market infrastructure and standards across private markets.”Concurrently  JP Morgan has embarked on “Project Bloom ” a platform intended to match start-ups with accredited investors. BlackRock  the world’s largest asset manager  is now advising its clients to consider moving away from the traditional 60/40 portfolio in favor of a 50/30/20 portfolio with 20% going into alternative  private market assets.Pat O’Meara  founder and CEO of Inveniam  commented on the partnership  “In order for there to be more fluid trading of private market securities  an entire ecosystem must be established. As such  today’s agreement with Rialto and Inveniam is an incredible advancement towards building that fully functioning ecosystem. This is great news for middle market companies in search capital and price discovery and is reminiscent of the development of the ECN markets in the ‘90s.”The integration of Rialto into the Inveniam ecosystem will result in Rialto incorporating various components of digital securities data and real-time market data thereby delivering transparency and trust for market participants. Further  having diverse data flow via Ownera  and the industry’s FinP2P open-source routing and settlement protocol that interconnects the private markets seamlessly in a user friendly platform  will give the GPs direct access to better data systems  secondary markets for the exchange of alternative assets  and new novel forms of primary distribution will transform the role of fund administrators. Ownera interconnects asset sources and financial institutions to enable the trade of any digital security  from any source and tokenization platform  using any underlying technology.Tokeny  an enterprise-grade infrastructure provider that allows companies and financial actors to compliantly issue  transfer  and manage assets on blockchain  enabling them to improve asset liquidity  is also a part of the ecosystem.

We are still facing important challenges in our electronic component supply chain but up to now we have been able to handle this extra challenge. This provides us sufficient confidence today to confirm our earlier revenue guidance for 2022 of EUR 125 million to EUR 140 million.Our 2 main Market Pillars (Live Service Providers and Live Audience Business) are further showing revenue growth compared to Q1 2021. Our third Market Pillar (Big Event Rental) will also generate the expected ‘big event year’ results in 2022.Our Live Service Providers (LSP) customers are continuing their LiveCeption (our live production replay and highlights solution) upgrade programs  leveraging our new LSM-VIA replay controller designed for IP-based remote production as it has been proven once again during the Superbowl and many other major winter sporting events.Story continuesNext to this  we continue enjoying strong commercial traction with our Live Audience Business (LAB) customers for their broadcast center modernization projects. Our EVS MediaCeption solution (content management for live productions) currently in operation by several customers is a proof point for the market that EVS is a trusted partner for these challenging transformation journeys.For our Big Event Rental  EVS has supported the live production of a major winter sport event early this year and is planning to support other major sport events organized in the Middle East later this year.Since our largest acquisition ever of Axon in May 2020  it is good to see that next to the successful operational integration  we also enjoy a strong commercial traction that supports our Order Intake growth. The recently announced MediaInfra Strada routing system project for Fox Sports USA  represents our largest-ever Media Infrastructure deal. The integration of MediaInfra Solutions with other EVS products and solutions families offers EVS a much broader footprint and new capabilities to address its customers’ needs while offering new revenue stream perspectives. Thanks to the involvement of many stakeholders  EVS is now proposing a disruptive  future safe and TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) optimized approach for our customers engaging in the modernization of their media infrastructure.To overcome potential shortages of electronic components due to the current market conditions  we have extended our standard delivery times and we continue to proactively secure our inventory.The high and global inflation has an important impact on our remuneration costs. It is our intent to compensate the impact of those increased costs by applying specific price increases.Overall  we feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability and performance of our solutions and services.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said: “Our 2022 secured revenue as of March 31st amounts to EUR 91.0 million (+35 2% compared to last year). Next to a strong secured revenue  our order intake is also continuing the momentum of 2021  with a growth in confirmed orders of +29 0% in the first 3 months of the year. Both trends considerably subscribe our intentions to grow our revenue in 2022. Our revenue guidance remains unchanged in the range of EUR 125 - 140 million  still reflecting potential delivery issues we may face following the shortage on the electronic components market. Our operating expenditure evolves in line with our expectations  though inflation may influence our models towards the high-end of the range provided.”EVS MARKET DYNAMICS & CUSTOMER WINSDuring the first quarter  EVS delivered successfully major winter events  serving the host broadcaster  as well as multiple right holders  including NBC. As every year  EVS also supported its customers (facility companies and broadcasters) delivering the NFL Superbowl: one of the most watched events on earth.For Live Service Providers  2020 is an old souvenir. These players continue to upgrade their portfolio of replay services to leverage the advantages of the combination of XT-VIA and LSM-VIA. Channel partners continue to be successful selling the LiveCeption Pure solution for smaller OB Vans and venues. The new MediaInfra Strada evolutive routing solution also made its entry within IP OB Vans in North America.Our LAB customers continue to upgrade their facilities both with IP Media Infrastructure and with modernized workflows based on EVS VIA platform. EVS continues the deployment of the projects sold during previous quarters.The major multi-million deal announced during NAB about Fox Sports US selecting Media Infrastructure Strada flexible routing solution is an additional proof point of the traction for the new EVS solutions and the success of the Axon integration within EVS.New versions of solutions have been announced during Q1 2022:Neuron supports a new application  called Neuron Protect  which fulfills the increasing demand for more secured solutions: higher level of redundancy on top of IP networks. It proves that EVS considers security as a top priority and provides new solution components to face the challenges faced by the industry. The new “Compress” version of Neuron offers new low-bitrate codec  JPEG-XS compression required for video transport in remote operations.With the addition of the new version of IP Core to Cerebrum  additional routing capabilities are offered making use of SDN to ensure fully secured orchestration of any IP-based video signals.The new version of “MediaCeption signature” offers a comprehensive set of content management applications combining advanced software and Web-based modules for an even richer workflows from ingest to playout.With the RTBF deal announced in February 2022  EVS co-develops a future Flexible Control Room solution build on Cerebrum: the solution - embracing production automation - will support the broadcasters in their transformation to produce more efficiently with dynamic scaling during a production  while proposing an open solution optimized in terms of user experience for operators of all generations.The tensions around availability of electronic components are going on and are even increasing based on the new geopolitical situation. EVS has announced a typical delay of 20 weeks between the order and the delivery to cope with the delays. Until now  all orders have been shipped on time thanks to the huge efforts and the magic talents of several teams  adapting to the different combinations of components while refusing to compromise on quality.Despite the war for talent  EVS is also successfully hiring to strengthen the team and support expected growth  mainly in R&D and Customer Services teams to further develop the solutions and in the US to better support key customers and channel partners in the region.The teams were also very happy to be back at the NAB tradeshow to meet customers face to face  engage into fruitful conversations  and demonstrate for the first time in live situation for some customers the numerous new solutions and features proposed by EVS.The return to NAB was also special since celebrated through the NAB 2022 Best Of Show award for Neuron Protect which is the first NAB award for a Media Infrastructure product inside EVS.At the beginning of this year  EVS also enhanced and extended the leadership team with two new members  Alex Redfern as CTO and Xavier Orri as EVP Operations & Projects  to sustain the growth path engaged by the company. Two US colleagues - James Stellpflug as SVP Customer Success NALA and David Pinkel as SVP Sales North America - have also been promoted to further strengthen and drive the EVS teams in the Americas.OUTLOOKThe 2022 secured revenue on March 31st amounts to EUR 81.8 million compared to EUR 54.1 million last year (YOY +51 2%  excluding Big Event Rental). An additional EUR 9.2 million orders already received for Big Event Rental will be delivered and recognized later in 2022  ensuring an overall secured revenue for 2022 at end of March of EUR 91.0 million.In addition to those 2022 secured revenue numbers  EVS has EUR 15.5 million of orders to be invoiced in 2023 and beyond (excl. Big Event Rental)  a growth of 5 4%.The revenue guidance of EUR 125 – 140 million is maintained  with securec revenue and order intake sustaining growth in 2022.Operational expenses continue in line with the guidance provided (growth between 5-10%) with inflation pushing the growth towards the higher end of the range.CORPORATE CALENDARAugust 25th  2022 : 1H22 resultsNovember 17th  2022 : 3Q22 trading updateFor more information  please contact:Veerle De Wit*  CFOEVS Broadcast Equipment S.A.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly to treat patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg. With this approval  Dupixent becomes the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in the United States. A regulatory filing for EoE is under review by the European Medicines Agency  and submissions to regulatory authorities in additional countries are planned by the end of 2022.""We have waited a long time for an FDA-approved treatment option for eosinophilic esophagitis – an underdiagnosed and misunderstood disease of the esophagus that can make it extremely challenging and uncomfortable to eat and swallow "" said Mary Jo Strobel  Executive Director at the American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders (APFED). ""Before today  there were no approved treatments specifically for eosinophilic esophagitis  resulting in many people needing to maintain a strict diet and live in constant fear of food getting stuck in their throat. We welcome therapeutic options that can provide much-needed relief for these patients.""EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by type 2 inflammation that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. About 160 000 patients are living with EoE in the U.S. These individuals are currently treated with therapies not specifically approved for the disease  of whom approximately 48 000 continue to experience symptoms despite multiple treatments.""It is gratifying that Dupixent  a medicine that we invented in our laboratories  is now approved in yet another disease marked by allergic or type 2 inflammation  namely eosinophilic esophagitis "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Eosinophilic esophagitis can be debilitating for patients by inflaming and damaging the esophagus and limiting the ability to eat normally. Dupixent is the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat eosinophilic esophagitis in the United States  and today's approval marks the fourth disease for which Dupixent is now indicated  reinforcing the promise of targeting IL-4 and IL-13 to effectively treat diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation.""""Eating regularly throughout the day is essential  yet significant difficulty swallowing food is a common symptom for people living with eosinophilic esophagitis. This can be incredibly upsetting and often leads to fear of pain or choking with every meal  every day "" said John Reed  M.D.  Ph.D.  Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. ""A large unmet need exists for treatment options that can provide meaningful symptom relief. Our Phase 3 clinical program showed that Dupixent weekly improved the ability to swallow and reduced inflammation in the esophagus  underscoring the role of type 2 inflammation in this complex disease. This is a landmark FDA approval for patients and their caregivers who now have a new option for treating this devastating disease.""The FDA approval is based on data from a Phase 3 trial with two parts (Part A and Part B) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent 300 mg weekly  compared to placebo  in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE  weighing at least 40 kg. After 24 weeks  patients treated with Dupixent 300 mg weekly experienced the following changes in Part A and Part B  respectively:69% and 64% reduction in disease symptoms from baseline compared to 32% and 41% for placebo. Disease symptoms were measured by the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ)  where patients receiving Dupixent experienced a 21.9- and 23.8-point clinically meaningful improvement compared to 9.6- and 13.9-point improvement for placebo.Approximately 10 times as many patients achieved histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/high power field [hpf]) compared to placebo: 60% and 59% compared to 5% and 6% of patients receiving placebo.The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Pooled adverse events from Parts A and B that were more commonly (≥2%) observed with Dupixent than placebo were injection site reactions (38% Dupixent  33% placebo)  upper respiratory tract infections (18% Dupixent  10% placebo)  arthralgia (2% Dupixent  1% placebo) and herpes viral infections (2% Dupixent  1% placebo).The FDA evaluated the Dupixent application under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. Part A enrolled 81 patients and evaluated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (42 treated with Dupixent and 39 with placebo). Part B enrolled 159 patients and evaluated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (80 with Dupixent and 79 with placebo).At 24 weeks  the co-primary endpoints in Parts A and B assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the DSQ on a 0-84 scale) and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission  defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf).About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  with EoE  Dupixent is administered as a 300 mg dose with a pre-filled syringe or pen every week. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children aged 12 to 17 years  Dupixent should be administered under the supervision of an adult.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent is also approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations in a number of countries around the world  including the U.S.  European Union and Japan. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and InmazebTM (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  hand and foot atopic dermatitis (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  chronic pruritis of unknown origin (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. I NDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.
