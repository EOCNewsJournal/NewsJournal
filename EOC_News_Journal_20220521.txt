5260,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.ledgerinsights.com/swift-in-cross-border-cbdc-interoperability-trial-with-cap-gemini/,SWIFT in cross border CBDC interoperability trial with Cap Gemini,1 day ago,Yesterday SWIFT  the organization responsible for messaging most cross border payments  has started a new set of CBDC interoperability experiments partnering with Cap Gemini. It’s concerned that without interoperability  individual central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could create new domestic silos  fragmenting the global payment landscape.Last year SWIFT published a report with Accenture sharing work on interoperability between a CBDC and a conventional real-time gross settlement system (RTGS). It’s also conducting experiments for tokenized digital assets with Clearstream  Northern Trust and SETL.This latest work with Cap Gemini is about enabling interoperability between different types of CBDCs  some of which might be centralized  and others might use blockchain.“One (challenge) is that there will be multiple CBDC platforms in development in parallel to the existing traditional payment systems ” said Nick Kerigan  Head of Innovation  SWIFT. “Different systems and different CBDCs will need to be able to efficiently work together  or it will hamper the ability of businesses and consumers to make frictionless cross-border payments using CBDCs.”The tests explore interlinking these disparate systems via the SWIFT platform so that a cross border payment would link the origin CBDC system to SWIFT and from there on to the destination CBDC system.It’s tackling three use cases  CBDC to CBDC  fiat to CBDC  and CBDC to fiat.“If the experiments are successful  it will demonstrate that SWIFT has the capability and technical components to interlink different networks ” said Kerigan. “This would help solve a huge technology and industry challenge facing CBDCs.”A bigger CBDC challenge for cross border paymentsCBDC is being explored for cross border payments in part because of the current slow payments and the need to use intermediaries or correspondent banks. In reality  SWIFT’s messages are very fast  although previously  it was hard to discover why a payment was delayed. Many international payment holdups relate to:inaccurate bank informationthe need to use correspondent banksanti-money laundering queries.So while SWIFT has rightly identified issues with CBDC interoperability  perhaps there are even more fundamental challenges.There are multiple ongoing cross border CBDC experiments that include several central banks. Singapore’s Project Dunbar involving four central banks released findings that raise a key issue. If you don’t want the inefficiencies of using correspondent banks  then the obvious solution is to allow foreign banks to hold a domestic CBDC or have a central bank account. That’s something that many central banks are not keen to do.Otherwise  you will often end up with correspondent banks handling CBDCs for cross border payments with SWIFT in the middle. That seems rather similar to the current status quo. There is one advantage in that the message and money would move together with a CBDC  but will that address the real challenges?,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.08,0.19,0.74,True,English,"['cross border CBDC interoperability trial', 'Cap Gemini', 'SWIFT', 'conventional real-time gross settlement system', 'multiple ongoing cross border CBDC experiments', 'individual central bank digital currencies', 'Many international payment holdups', 'most cross border payments', 'existing traditional payment systems', 'central bank account', 'tokenized digital assets', 'inaccurate bank information', 'multiple CBDC platforms', 'many central banks', 'frictionless cross-border payments', 'current slow payments', 'global payment landscape', 'three use cases', 'anti-money laundering queries', 'current status quo', 'origin CBDC system', 'destination CBDC system', 'several central banks', 'four central banks', 'new domestic silos', 'bigger CBDC challenge', 'CBDC interoperability experiments', 'Different systems', 'disparate systems', 'domestic CBDC', 'new set', 'correspondent banks', 'foreign banks', 'One (challenge', 'industry challenge', 'Cap Gemini', 'Northern Trust', 'different types', 'technical components', 'different networks', 'huge technology', 'fundamental challenges', 'Project Dunbar', 'key issue', 'obvious solution', 'one advantage', 'real challenges', 'latest work', 'Nick Kerigan', 'different CBDCs', 'SWIFT platform', 'organization', 'report', 'Accenture', 'RTGS', 'Clearstream', 'SETL', 'others', 'blockchain', 'development', 'parallel', 'Head', 'Innovation', 'businesses', 'consumers', 'tests', 'fiat', 'capability', 'part', 'need', 'intermediaries', 'reality', 'messages', 'issues', 'Singapore', 'findings', 'inefficiencies', 'something', 'middle']",2022-05-20,2022-05-21,ledgerinsights.com

5265,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-frge/forge-global-holdings/news/painful-week-for-individual-investors-invested-in-forge-glob,Painful week for individual investors invested in Forge Global Holdings  Inc. (NYSE:FRGE) after 26% drop  institutions also suffered losses,1 day ago,If you want to know who really controls Forge Global Holdings  Inc. ( )  then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 49% ownership. Put another way  the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Following a 26% decrease in the stock price last week  individual investors suffered the most losses  but institutions who own 23% stock also took a hit.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Forge Global Holdings  beginning with the chart below.NYSE:FRGE Ownership Breakdown May 20th 2022What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Forge Global Holdings?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Forge Global Holdings already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed  they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes  just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Forge Global Holdings  (below). Of course  keep in mind that there are other factors to consider  too.NYSE:FRGE Earnings and Revenue Growth May 20th 2022We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Forge Global Holdings. Our data shows that Deutsche Boerse AG  Asset Management Arm is the largest shareholder with 14% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile  the second and third largest shareholders  hold 8.3% and 6.0%  of the shares outstanding  respectively. Furthermore  CEO Kelly Rodriques is the owner of 3.3% of the company's shares.After doing some more digging  we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company  suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research  it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. We're not picking up on any analyst coverage of the stock at the moment  so the company is unlikely to be widely held.Insider Ownership Of Forge Global HoldingsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders  capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However  it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members  especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However  on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Forge Global Holdings  Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$553m stake in this US$3.6b business. It is good to see this level of investment. You canGeneral Public OwnershipThe general public  who are usually individual investors  hold a 49% stake in Forge Global Holdings. While this group can't necessarily call the shots  it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Equity OwnershipWith a stake of 13%  private equity firms could influence the Forge Global Holdings board. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term  but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight  we need to consider other information  too. Consider risks  for instance. Every company has them  and we've spotted you should know about.Of course this may not be the best stock to buy.

We are still facing important challenges in our electronic component supply chain but up to now we have been able to handle this extra challenge. This provides us sufficient confidence today to confirm our earlier revenue guidance for 2022 of EUR 125 million to EUR 140 million.Our 2 main Market Pillars (Live Service Providers and Live Audience Business) are further showing revenue growth compared to Q1 2021. Our third Market Pillar (Big Event Rental) will also generate the expected ‘big event year’ results in 2022.Our Live Service Providers (LSP) customers are continuing their LiveCeption (our live production replay and highlights solution) upgrade programs  leveraging our new LSM-VIA replay controller designed for IP-based remote production as it has been proven once again during the Superbowl and many other major winter sporting events.Next to this  we continue enjoying strong commercial traction with our Live Audience Business (LAB) customers for their broadcast center modernization projects. Our EVS MediaCeption solution (content management for live productions) currently in operation by several customers is a proof point for the market that EVS is a trusted partner for these challenging transformation journeys.For our Big Event Rental  EVS has supported the live production of a major winter sport event early this year and is planning to support other major sport events organized in the Middle East later this year.Since our largest acquisition ever of Axon in May 2020  it is good to see that next to the successful operational integration  we also enjoy a strong commercial traction that supports our Order Intake growth. The recently announced MediaInfra Strada routing system project for Fox Sports USA  represents our largest-ever Media Infrastructure deal. The integration of MediaInfra Solutions with other EVS products and solutions families offers EVS a much broader footprint and new capabilities to address its customers’ needs while offering new revenue stream perspectives. Thanks to the involvement of many stakeholders  EVS is now proposing a disruptive  future safe and TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) optimized approach for our customers engaging in the modernization of their media infrastructure.To overcome potential shortages of electronic components due to the current market conditions  we have extended our standard delivery times and we continue to proactively secure our inventory.The high and global inflation has an important impact on our remuneration costs. It is our intent to compensate the impact of those increased costs by applying specific price increases.Overall  we feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability and performance of our solutions and services.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said: “Our 2022 secured revenue as of March 31st amounts to EUR 91.0 million (+35 2% compared to last year). Next to a strong secured revenue  our order intake is also continuing the momentum of 2021  with a growth in confirmed orders of +29 0% in the first 3 months of the year. Both trends considerably subscribe our intentions to grow our revenue in 2022. Our revenue guidance remains unchanged in the range of EUR 125 - 140 million  still reflecting potential delivery issues we may face following the shortage on the electronic components market. Our operating expenditure evolves in line with our expectations  though inflation may influence our models towards the high-end of the range provided.”EVS MARKET DYNAMICS & CUSTOMER WINSDuring the first quarter  EVS delivered successfully major winter events  serving the host broadcaster  as well as multiple right holders  including NBC. As every year  EVS also supported its customers (facility companies and broadcasters) delivering the NFL Superbowl: one of the most watched events on earth.For Live Service Providers  2020 is an old souvenir. These players continue to upgrade their portfolio of replay services to leverage the advantages of the combination of XT-VIA and LSM-VIA. Channel partners continue to be successful selling the LiveCeption Pure solution for smaller OB Vans and venues. The new MediaInfra Strada evolutive routing solution also made its entry within IP OB Vans in North America.Our LAB customers continue to upgrade their facilities both with IP Media Infrastructure and with modernized workflows based on EVS VIA platform. EVS continues the deployment of the projects sold during previous quarters.The major multi-million deal announced during NAB about Fox Sports US selecting Media Infrastructure Strada flexible routing solution is an additional proof point of the traction for the new EVS solutions and the success of the Axon integration within EVS.New versions of solutions have been announced during Q1 2022:Neuron supports a new application  called Neuron Protect  which fulfills the increasing demand for more secured solutions: higher level of redundancy on top of IP networks. It proves that EVS considers security as a top priority and provides new solution components to face the challenges faced by the industry. The new “Compress” version of Neuron offers new low-bitrate codec  JPEG-XS compression required for video transport in remote operations.With the addition of the new version of IP Core to Cerebrum  additional routing capabilities are offered making use of SDN to ensure fully secured orchestration of any IP-based video signals.The new version of “MediaCeption signature” offers a comprehensive set of content management applications combining advanced software and Web-based modules for an even richer workflows from ingest to playout.With the RTBF deal announced in February 2022  EVS co-develops a future Flexible Control Room solution build on Cerebrum: the solution - embracing production automation - will support the broadcasters in their transformation to produce more efficiently with dynamic scaling during a production  while proposing an open solution optimized in terms of user experience for operators of all generations.The tensions around availability of electronic components are going on and are even increasing based on the new geopolitical situation. EVS has announced a typical delay of 20 weeks between the order and the delivery to cope with the delays. Until now  all orders have been shipped on time thanks to the huge efforts and the magic talents of several teams  adapting to the different combinations of components while refusing to compromise on quality.Despite the war for talent  EVS is also successfully hiring to strengthen the team and support expected growth  mainly in R&D and Customer Services teams to further develop the solutions and in the US to better support key customers and channel partners in the region.The teams were also very happy to be back at the NAB tradeshow to meet customers face to face  engage into fruitful conversations  and demonstrate for the first time in live situation for some customers the numerous new solutions and features proposed by EVS.The return to NAB was also special since celebrated through the NAB 2022 Best Of Show award for Neuron Protect which is the first NAB award for a Media Infrastructure product inside EVS.At the beginning of this year  EVS also enhanced and extended the leadership team with two new members  Alex Redfern as CTO and Xavier Orri as EVP Operations & Projects  to sustain the growth path engaged by the company. Two US colleagues - James Stellpflug as SVP Customer Success NALA and David Pinkel as SVP Sales North America - have also been promoted to further strengthen and drive the EVS teams in the Americas.OUTLOOKThe 2022 secured revenue on March 31st amounts to EUR 81.8 million compared to EUR 54.1 million last year (YOY +51 2%  excluding Big Event Rental). An additional EUR 9.2 million orders already received for Big Event Rental will be delivered and recognized later in 2022  ensuring an overall secured revenue for 2022 at end of March of EUR 91.0 million.In addition to those 2022 secured revenue numbers  EVS has EUR 15.5 million of orders to be invoiced in 2023 and beyond (excl. Big Event Rental)  a growth of 5 4%.The revenue guidance of EUR 125 – 140 million is maintained  with securec revenue and order intake sustaining growth in 2022.Operational expenses continue in line with the guidance provided (growth between 5-10%) with inflation pushing the growth towards the higher end of the range.CORPORATE CALENDARAugust 25th  2022 : 1H22 resultsNovember 17th  2022 : 3Q22 trading updateFor more information  please contact:Veerle De Wit*  CFOEVS Broadcast Equipment S.A.

Inveniam via Inveniam.io  is the operating system for private market data that drives price discovery and automated waterfall calculations. Rialto Markets’ fully functional alternative trading system (ATS) is unlocking secondary trading in the private securities market for retail and accredited investors.Shari Noonan  Rialto Markets CEO  who is leading this effort  offered  “Trading shares used to be restricted to certain companies that could afford to publicly list on a platform such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq  but a regulated secondary market for private company shares opens up trading and liquidity  and ultimately  price discovery.”The partnership arrives at a critical juncture for private market companies as in the 10 plus years prior to 2019  capital flowing into capital assets grew at 4 times the pace of public markets. After a down year in 2020  2021 saw U.S. private markets establish a new highwater mark for fundraising and as a result  more companies are staying private longer or bypassing going public. Additionally  in 2022  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission laid out a number of proposals including requirements for registered private funds advisors to distribute quarterly statements to private fund investors with a detailed accounting of all fees and expenses during the reporting period. Also in 2021  the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation  announced its Digital Securities Management initiative  a platform that will  subject to regulatory approval  “for the first time  provide an industry-wide solution that offers common market infrastructure and standards across private markets.”Concurrently  JP Morgan has embarked on “Project Bloom ” a platform intended to match start-ups with accredited investors. BlackRock  the world’s largest asset manager  is now advising its clients to consider moving away from the traditional 60/40 portfolio in favor of a 50/30/20 portfolio with 20% going into alternative  private market assets.Pat O’Meara  founder and CEO of Inveniam  commented on the partnership  “In order for there to be more fluid trading of private market securities  an entire ecosystem must be established. As such  today’s agreement with Rialto and Inveniam is an incredible advancement towards building that fully functioning ecosystem. This is great news for middle market companies in search capital and price discovery and is reminiscent of the development of the ECN markets in the ‘90s.”The integration of Rialto into the Inveniam ecosystem will result in Rialto incorporating various components of digital securities data and real-time market data thereby delivering transparency and trust for market participants. Further  having diverse data flow via Ownera  and the industry’s FinP2P open-source routing and settlement protocol that interconnects the private markets seamlessly in a user friendly platform  will give the GPs direct access to better data systems  secondary markets for the exchange of alternative assets  and new novel forms of primary distribution will transform the role of fund administrators. Ownera interconnects asset sources and financial institutions to enable the trade of any digital security  from any source and tokenization platform  using any underlying technology.Tokeny  an enterprise-grade infrastructure provider that allows companies and financial actors to compliantly issue  transfer  and manage assets on blockchain  enabling them to improve asset liquidity  is also a part of the ecosystem. Tokeny’s involvment will allow not only auditable forms of compliance from the security to the investor  but it will also allow real-time surveillance of the underlying assets utilizing Inveniam.io.For further context on this agreement and the formation of this private market trading ecosystem  please visit Pat O’Meara’s Medium post.For parties interested in how they can leverage Rialito and Inveniam for the capital formation and price discovery objectives  please contact:Support@RialtoMarkets.comInfo@Inveniam.ioAbout Rialto MarketsRialto Markets is a trusted ‘go to’ fully regulated broker dealer empowering companies to raise money through our unrivalled expertise in crowdfunding and institutional investment.

We are still facing important challenges in our electronic component supply chain but up to now we have been able to handle this extra challenge. This provides us sufficient confidence today to confirm our earlier revenue guidance for 2022 of EUR 125 million to EUR 140 million.Our 2 main Market Pillars (Live Service Providers and Live Audience Business) are further showing revenue growth compared to Q1 2021. Our third Market Pillar (Big Event Rental) will also generate the expected ‘big event year’ results in 2022.Our Live Service Providers (LSP) customers are continuing their LiveCeption (our live production replay and highlights solution) upgrade programs  leveraging our new LSM-VIA replay controller designed for IP-based remote production as it has been proven once again during the Superbowl and many other major winter sporting events.Story continuesNext to this  we continue enjoying strong commercial traction with our Live Audience Business (LAB) customers for their broadcast center modernization projects. Our EVS MediaCeption solution (content management for live productions) currently in operation by several customers is a proof point for the market that EVS is a trusted partner for these challenging transformation journeys.For our Big Event Rental  EVS has supported the live production of a major winter sport event early this year and is planning to support other major sport events organized in the Middle East later this year.Since our largest acquisition ever of Axon in May 2020  it is good to see that next to the successful operational integration  we also enjoy a strong commercial traction that supports our Order Intake growth. The recently announced MediaInfra Strada routing system project for Fox Sports USA  represents our largest-ever Media Infrastructure deal. The integration of MediaInfra Solutions with other EVS products and solutions families offers EVS a much broader footprint and new capabilities to address its customers’ needs while offering new revenue stream perspectives. Thanks to the involvement of many stakeholders  EVS is now proposing a disruptive  future safe and TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) optimized approach for our customers engaging in the modernization of their media infrastructure.To overcome potential shortages of electronic components due to the current market conditions  we have extended our standard delivery times and we continue to proactively secure our inventory.The high and global inflation has an important impact on our remuneration costs. It is our intent to compensate the impact of those increased costs by applying specific price increases.Overall  we feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability and performance of our solutions and services.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said: “Our 2022 secured revenue as of March 31st amounts to EUR 91.0 million (+35 2% compared to last year). Next to a strong secured revenue  our order intake is also continuing the momentum of 2021  with a growth in confirmed orders of +29 0% in the first 3 months of the year. Both trends considerably subscribe our intentions to grow our revenue in 2022. Our revenue guidance remains unchanged in the range of EUR 125 - 140 million  still reflecting potential delivery issues we may face following the shortage on the electronic components market. Our operating expenditure evolves in line with our expectations  though inflation may influence our models towards the high-end of the range provided.”EVS MARKET DYNAMICS & CUSTOMER WINSDuring the first quarter  EVS delivered successfully major winter events  serving the host broadcaster  as well as multiple right holders  including NBC. As every year  EVS also supported its customers (facility companies and broadcasters) delivering the NFL Superbowl: one of the most watched events on earth.For Live Service Providers  2020 is an old souvenir. These players continue to upgrade their portfolio of replay services to leverage the advantages of the combination of XT-VIA and LSM-VIA. Channel partners continue to be successful selling the LiveCeption Pure solution for smaller OB Vans and venues. The new MediaInfra Strada evolutive routing solution also made its entry within IP OB Vans in North America.Our LAB customers continue to upgrade their facilities both with IP Media Infrastructure and with modernized workflows based on EVS VIA platform. EVS continues the deployment of the projects sold during previous quarters.The major multi-million deal announced during NAB about Fox Sports US selecting Media Infrastructure Strada flexible routing solution is an additional proof point of the traction for the new EVS solutions and the success of the Axon integration within EVS.New versions of solutions have been announced during Q1 2022:Neuron supports a new application  called Neuron Protect  which fulfills the increasing demand for more secured solutions: higher level of redundancy on top of IP networks. It proves that EVS considers security as a top priority and provides new solution components to face the challenges faced by the industry. The new “Compress” version of Neuron offers new low-bitrate codec  JPEG-XS compression required for video transport in remote operations.With the addition of the new version of IP Core to Cerebrum  additional routing capabilities are offered making use of SDN to ensure fully secured orchestration of any IP-based video signals.The new version of “MediaCeption signature” offers a comprehensive set of content management applications combining advanced software and Web-based modules for an even richer workflows from ingest to playout.With the RTBF deal announced in February 2022  EVS co-develops a future Flexible Control Room solution build on Cerebrum: the solution - embracing production automation - will support the broadcasters in their transformation to produce more efficiently with dynamic scaling during a production  while proposing an open solution optimized in terms of user experience for operators of all generations.The tensions around availability of electronic components are going on and are even increasing based on the new geopolitical situation. EVS has announced a typical delay of 20 weeks between the order and the delivery to cope with the delays. Until now  all orders have been shipped on time thanks to the huge efforts and the magic talents of several teams  adapting to the different combinations of components while refusing to compromise on quality.Despite the war for talent  EVS is also successfully hiring to strengthen the team and support expected growth  mainly in R&D and Customer Services teams to further develop the solutions and in the US to better support key customers and channel partners in the region.The teams were also very happy to be back at the NAB tradeshow to meet customers face to face  engage into fruitful conversations  and demonstrate for the first time in live situation for some customers the numerous new solutions and features proposed by EVS.The return to NAB was also special since celebrated through the NAB 2022 Best Of Show award for Neuron Protect which is the first NAB award for a Media Infrastructure product inside EVS.At the beginning of this year  EVS also enhanced and extended the leadership team with two new members  Alex Redfern as CTO and Xavier Orri as EVP Operations & Projects  to sustain the growth path engaged by the company. Two US colleagues - James Stellpflug as SVP Customer Success NALA and David Pinkel as SVP Sales North America - have also been promoted to further strengthen and drive the EVS teams in the Americas.OUTLOOKThe 2022 secured revenue on March 31st amounts to EUR 81.8 million compared to EUR 54.1 million last year (YOY +51 2%  excluding Big Event Rental). An additional EUR 9.2 million orders already received for Big Event Rental will be delivered and recognized later in 2022  ensuring an overall secured revenue for 2022 at end of March of EUR 91.0 million.In addition to those 2022 secured revenue numbers  EVS has EUR 15.5 million of orders to be invoiced in 2023 and beyond (excl. Big Event Rental)  a growth of 5 4%.The revenue guidance of EUR 125 – 140 million is maintained  with securec revenue and order intake sustaining growth in 2022.Operational expenses continue in line with the guidance provided (growth between 5-10%) with inflation pushing the growth towards the higher end of the range.CORPORATE CALENDARAugust 25th  2022 : 1H22 resultsNovember 17th  2022 : 3Q22 trading updateFor more information  please contact:Veerle De Wit*  CFOEVS Broadcast Equipment S.A.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly to treat patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg. With this approval  Dupixent becomes the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in the United States. A regulatory filing for EoE is under review by the European Medicines Agency  and submissions to regulatory authorities in additional countries are planned by the end of 2022.""We have waited a long time for an FDA-approved treatment option for eosinophilic esophagitis – an underdiagnosed and misunderstood disease of the esophagus that can make it extremely challenging and uncomfortable to eat and swallow "" said Mary Jo Strobel  Executive Director at the American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders (APFED). ""Before today  there were no approved treatments specifically for eosinophilic esophagitis  resulting in many people needing to maintain a strict diet and live in constant fear of food getting stuck in their throat. We welcome therapeutic options that can provide much-needed relief for these patients.""EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by type 2 inflammation that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. About 160 000 patients are living with EoE in the U.S. These individuals are currently treated with therapies not specifically approved for the disease  of whom approximately 48 000 continue to experience symptoms despite multiple treatments.""It is gratifying that Dupixent  a medicine that we invented in our laboratories  is now approved in yet another disease marked by allergic or type 2 inflammation  namely eosinophilic esophagitis "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Eosinophilic esophagitis can be debilitating for patients by inflaming and damaging the esophagus and limiting the ability to eat normally. Dupixent is the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat eosinophilic esophagitis in the United States  and today's approval marks the fourth disease for which Dupixent is now indicated  reinforcing the promise of targeting IL-4 and IL-13 to effectively treat diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation.""""Eating regularly throughout the day is essential  yet significant difficulty swallowing food is a common symptom for people living with eosinophilic esophagitis. This can be incredibly upsetting and often leads to fear of pain or choking with every meal  every day "" said John Reed  M.D.  Ph.D.  Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. ""A large unmet need exists for treatment options that can provide meaningful symptom relief. Our Phase 3 clinical program showed that Dupixent weekly improved the ability to swallow and reduced inflammation in the esophagus  underscoring the role of type 2 inflammation in this complex disease. This is a landmark FDA approval for patients and their caregivers who now have a new option for treating this devastating disease.""The FDA approval is based on data from a Phase 3 trial with two parts (Part A and Part B) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent 300 mg weekly  compared to placebo  in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE  weighing at least 40 kg. After 24 weeks  patients treated with Dupixent 300 mg weekly experienced the following changes in Part A and Part B  respectively:69% and 64% reduction in disease symptoms from baseline compared to 32% and 41% for placebo. Disease symptoms were measured by the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ)  where patients receiving Dupixent experienced a 21.9- and 23.8-point clinically meaningful improvement compared to 9.6- and 13.9-point improvement for placebo.Approximately 10 times as many patients achieved histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/high power field [hpf]) compared to placebo: 60% and 59% compared to 5% and 6% of patients receiving placebo.The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Pooled adverse events from Parts A and B that were more commonly (≥2%) observed with Dupixent than placebo were injection site reactions (38% Dupixent  33% placebo)  upper respiratory tract infections (18% Dupixent  10% placebo)  arthralgia (2% Dupixent  1% placebo) and herpes viral infections (2% Dupixent  1% placebo).The FDA evaluated the Dupixent application under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. Part A enrolled 81 patients and evaluated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (42 treated with Dupixent and 39 with placebo). Part B enrolled 159 patients and evaluated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (80 with Dupixent and 79 with placebo).At 24 weeks  the co-primary endpoints in Parts A and B assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the DSQ on a 0-84 scale) and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission  defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf).About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  with EoE  Dupixent is administered as a 300 mg dose with a pre-filled syringe or pen every week. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children aged 12 to 17 years  Dupixent should be administered under the supervision of an adult.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent is also approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations in a number of countries around the world  including the U.S.  European Union and Japan. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and InmazebTM (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  hand and foot atopic dermatitis (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  chronic pruritis of unknown origin (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. I NDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The Nomination Committee is to propose: the chairman of the Annual General Meeting;candidates for the post of chairman and other directors of the Board;fees and other remuneration to each director;fees to members of committees within the Board;election and remuneration of the Company auditor; andprinciples for the Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee shall in its assessment of the evaluation of the Board and in its proposal in particular take into consideration the requirement of diversity and breadth on the Board and strive for equal gender distribution. Regardless of how they have been appointed  the members of the nomination committee are to promote the interests of all shareholders of the Company. Members of the Nomination Committee The Nomination Committee shall consist of four members  of whom three shall be nominated by the Company's three largest shareholders by voting power and the fourth shall be the chairman of the Board. The chairman of the Board shall as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of the third quarter  in an adequate manner  contact the three owner-registered largest shareholders  by voting power  according to the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB at that time and request that they  taken into consideration the circumstances  within reasonable time which cannot exceed 30 days  in writing to the Nomination Committee nominate that person whom the shareholder wishes to appoint as member of the Nomination Committee. If any of the three largest shareholders wish not to exercise their right to appoint a member of the Nomination Committee  the next shareholder in consecutive order shall be entitled to appoint a member of the Nomination Committee. In the case that several shareholders abstain their right to appoint a member of the Nomination Committee  the chairman of the Board shall not be required to contact more than eight shareholders  unless it is necessary in order to obtain a Nomination Committee consisting of a minimum of three members. Unless otherwise agreed between the members  the chairman of the Nomination Committee shall be nominated by the largest shareholder by voting power. The chairman of the Board shall never be the chairman of the Nomination Committee. If a member nominated by a shareholder  during the year ceases to be one of the Company's three largest shareholders by voting powers  the member nominated by such shareholder shall resign from the Nomination Committee. Instead  a new shareholder among the three largest shareholders shall be entitled to independently and in its sole discretion appoint a member of the Nomination Committee.

The Nomination Committee shall in particular explain its proposal against the background of the requirement to strive for an equal gender distribution.

If the committee considers a candidate independent regardless of the existence of such circumstances which  according to the criteria of the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance  may give cause to consider the candidate not independent  the Nomination Committee shall explain its proposal; andin the case of re-election  the year that the person was first elected to the Board. Account of the work of the Nomination Committee All members of the Nomination Committee  where possible  and as a minimum one of the members  shall be present at the Annual General Meeting.

The BOARD OF DIRECTORS' PROPOSALS FOR RESOLUTIONS Item 2 - Preparation and approval of the voting list The proposed voting list is the voting list that has been prepared based on the shareholders present  the share register of the Annual General Meeting  and the postal votes received and that has been checked and proved by the persons elected to verify the minutes. Item 4 - Election of one or two persons to approve the minutes The Board of Directors proposes that Kevin Holmkvist at (Eversheds Sutherland) verify the minutes of the meeting  or  in the event of an impediment to him  whoever the chairman of the Board designates. The task of verifying the minutes also includes controlling the voting register and checking that received postal votes are correctly reproduced in the minutes. Item 7b - Resolution regarding the profit or loss of the Company in accordance with the adopted balance sheet The Board of Directors proposes that all funds available for the Annual General Meeting shall be carried forward. Item 12 - Resolution on implementation of an employee stock option program The Board of Directors proposes that the meeting resolves to implement an employee stock option program for senior executives and other key employees in the Company and its subsidiaries (the ""ESOP 2022/2025""). Delivery of shares under the ESOP 2022/2025 is to be secured by the issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants as set forth in item 14 on the proposed agenda for the meeting. Terms and conditions of the ESOP 2022/2025 The ESOP 2022/2025 is proposed to be governed by the following terms and conditions: Not more than 2 519 890 employee stock options are to be issued. The employee stock options shall be offered senior executives and other key employees in the Company and its subsidiaries subject to the employees not being tax residents in Sweden   in accordance with the following allocation: Category Maximum number of employee stock options per participant Maximum number of employee stock options per category Senior executives 438 000 438 000 Other key employees 100 000 2 081 890 The Board of Directors shall decide upon the allotment within the limits set above. The employee stock options shall be issued without cost. A prerequisite to acquire employee stock options under the ESOP 2022/2025 is that the participants must own shares in the Company. The shares can either be already owned by the participant or be acquired in the market in connection with the application to participate in the ESOP 2022/2025 (the "" Private Investment ""). The Private Investment shall at least amount to the total premium that should have been paid by the participant  had the participant instead acquired warrants through payment of the warrant premium corresponding to the market value of each employee stock option (the warrant premium calculated in accordance with the Black & Scholes evaluation model per the day of transfer multiplied by each employee stock option). Each employee stock option entitles to acquisition of one share in the Company at an exercise price of SEK 20.51   corresponding to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average price for shares in the Company according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market during a period from and including 6 May 2022 to  and including  18 May 2022 . The exercise price and the number of shares that each employee stock option entitles to can be subject to recalculation due to bonus issue  share split  preferential rights issue and similar measures  whereby the terms for recalculation in the complete Terms and Conditions for Warrants 2022/2025 shall be applied. The exercise price shall however at minimum amount to an amount corresponding to the quota value of the share. The employee stock options can be exercised to acquire shares during a period from and including 1 December 2025   to  and including  31 December 2025 . The employee stock options will be possible to exercise earlier in the event of e.g. compulsory redemption of shares  liquidation  takeover or merger. Exercise of employee stock options presupposes  as a rule  that the option holder is still employed in the group  and is neither tax resident in Sweden   at the time of exercise. The employee stock options shall not constitute securities and are non-transferable. Background and reasons for the proposal The purpose of the proposed ESOP 2022/2025 is to create opportunities to retain and increase the motivation for existing members of the Company's management  other key employees within the Company and the group. The Board of Directors finds it to be in the interest of all shareholders that the management  which has been deemed to be important for the future development of the Company  has a long-term interest in the growth of the Company's share price. A long-term commitment from the owners is expected to increase the interest in the daily business  increase the interest for the Company's earnings and financial result as a whole  increasing the motivation of the participants and aims to increase the interest between the participants and the Company's shareholders. Furthermore  the Incentive Program helps to attract competent employees to the Company. Preparation of the proposal The proposal for the ESOP 2022/2025 has been prepared by the Company's Board of Directors in cooperation with external advisors. Dilution Should all the warrants under item 13 on the agenda for the meeting and all employee stock options under item 12 on the agenda for the meeting be exercised  the number of outstanding shares will increase by 2 900 000  which corresponds to a maximum dilution of approximately 3.17 percent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. Outstanding share-related incentive programs At the time of this proposal there are no warrants or share-based incentive programs in the Company. Item 13 - Resolution on implementation of a warrant-based incentive program The Board of Directors proposes that the meeting resolves to implement a warrant-based incentive program  offering senior executives and other key employees to acquire warrants which grants the holder a right to subscribe for newly issued shares in the Company (the ""Warrant Program 2022/2025""). Terms and conditions of the Warrant Program 2022/2025 The Warrant Program 2022/2025 is proposed to be governed by the following terms and conditions: The Warrant Program 2022/2025 shall consist of a maximum of 380 110 warrants of series 2022/2025. Each warrant grants the holder the right to subscribe for one (1) newly issued share in the Company. The warrants shall be offered senior executives and other key employees in the Company and its subsidiaries subject to the employees being Swedish residents and in accordance with the following allocation: Category Maximum number of warrants per participant Maximum number of warrants per category Senior executives 350 870 350 870 Other key employees 29 239 29 239 The proposed terms and conditions for the warrants of series 2022/2025 is set out below under item 14 (Resolution on a) an issue of warrants and b) the approval of transfer of warrants) on the agenda for the meeting. The Company shall subscribe for all the warrants and then transfer the warrants to the participants in accordance with the terms set out in item 14 (Resolution on a) an issue of warrants and b) the approval of transfer of warrants). Background and reasons for the proposal The purpose of the proposed Warrant Program 2022/2025 is to create opportunities to retain and increase the motivation for existing members of the Company's management  other key employees within the Company and the group. The Board of Directors finds it to be in the interest of all shareholders that the management  which has been deemed to be important for the future development of the Company  has a long-term interest in the growth of the Company's share price. A long-term commitment from the owners is expected to increase the interest in the daily business  increase the interest for the Company's earnings and financial result as a whole  increasing the motivation of the participants and aims to increase the interest between the participants and the Company's shareholders. Furthermore  the Incentive Program helps to attract competent employees to the Company. Preparation of the proposal The proposal for the Warrant Program 2022/2025 has been prepared by the Company's Board of Directors in cooperation with external advisors. Dilution Should all the warrants under item 13 on the agenda for the meeting and all employee stock options under item 12 on the agenda for the meeting be exercised  the number of outstanding shares will increase by 2 900 000  which corresponds to a maximum dilution of approximately 3.17 percent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. Valuation According to a preliminary calculation  the warrant premium amounts to SEK 3.03 . The preliminary and the final warrant premium is calculated in accordance with the Black & Scholes evaluation model with the assumption of a risk-free rate of 1.55 per cent and an EGARCH implicit volatility of 39.3 percent and with the assumption that no expected dividend or any other transaction to shareholders will be carried out during the duration of the incentive program. The data and the calculations have been gathered and produced by Escalade Capital in its capacity as an independent valuation institute. Special cash compensation The Company shall make payments of special cash compensation in connection with the Warrant Program 2022/2025 as follows. The payment is based on the number of warrants the participant acquires. The amount shall sum to a total that  net of tax  approximately corresponds to the amount to be paid by the participant in accordance with what is set forth under the heading ""Transfer of warrants under the Warrant Program 2022/2025"" under item 14 on the agenda for the meeting. The payment shall be divided into three instalments in equal parts to be paid by the end of or close to each financial year during the warrant period  or - under certain defined circumstances - earlier. Payment requires that the participant is still employed by the Company at the time of payment. Outstanding share-related incentive programs At the time of this proposal there are no warrants or share-based incentive programs in the Company. Item 14 - Resolution on a) an issue of warrants and b) the approval of transfer of warrants In order to secure the Company's commitments under the ESOP 2022/2025 and the Warrant Program 2022/2025  the Board of Directors proposes that the meeting shall resolve on a directed issue of warrants of series 2022/2025 and approval of the transfer of warrants of series 2022/2025 in accordance with item a) and b) below. Issue of warrants The Board of Directors proposes that the meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants of series 2022/2025 with the following terms: The Company shall issue a maximum of 2 900 000 warrants. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company. With deviation from existing shareholders' pre-emptive right  the warrants shall only be subscribed by the Company with a right and an obligation for the Company to transfer the warrants to the participant under the ESOP 2022/2025 or the Warrant Program 2022/2025. The reason for deviating from the shareholders' pre-emptive right is that the warrants will be used within the framework of the above-mentioned incentive programs. The warrants may be used for subscription of new shares during a period from  and including  1 December 2025   to  and including  31 December 2025 or the earlier day which follows from the complete Terms and Conditions for Warrants 2022/2025. The subscription price for the shares has been set to SEK 20.51 per share  which corresponds to 130 percent of the volume weighted average price for the Company's share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market for the period from and including 6 May 2022 to  and including  18 May 2022 . If the warrants are exercised in full  the issue of shares would increase the Company's share capital with a maximum of SEK 116 000 (subject to potential changes due to any potential recalculation in accordance with the complete Terms and Conditions for Warrants 2022/2025). Any share premium shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve. The warrants shall be subscribed for by the Company without consideration. The warrants shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than three (3) days from the resolution to issue the warrants. The Board of Directors shall have the right to postpone the subscription period. Oversubscription may not occur. Any new shares that are acquired through the exercise of warrants will entitle the holder to receive dividends from the first record date for dividends that occurs after the issue of new shares has been registered with the Swedish Company Registration Office and with Euroclear Sweden AB . The warrants are subject to further terms and conditions in accordance with the complete Terms and Conditions for Warrants 2022/2025  including customary terms for recalculation  meaning that the subscription price  as well as the number of new shares that each warrant may grant  might be recalculated upon the occurrence of certain company events. The Board of Directors shall be authorized to cancel warrants that have been issued and that the Board of Directors considers are not necessary to fulfil the obligations that follows from the ESOP 2022/2025 or the Warrant Program 2022/2025. The Board of Directors  or whoever the board appoints  is authorized to make any minor adjustments to the issue decision that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear Sweden AB . Approval of transfer of warrants The Board of Directors proposes that the meeting resolves to approve that the Company may transfer warrants of series 2022/2025 to the participants in accordance with the allocation set out under item 13 (Resolution on implementation of an employee stock option program) and 14 (Resolution on implementation of a warrant-based inventive program) on the agenda for the meeting and in accordance with the terms below. Transfer of warrants under the Warrant Program 2022/2025 Transfer of warrants under the Warrant Program 2022/2025 shall be made in exchange of a premium calculated in accordance with the Black & Scholes evaluation model per the day of transfer. A preliminary valuation of the warrant premium amounts to SEK 3.03 . A prerequisite to acquire warrants is that the participant has entered into an agreement with the Company according to which the Company  or a person appointed by the Company  under certain circumstances  will have the right to repurchase the warrants from the participant. Such a right to repurchase exists  e.g.  if the participant ceases to be employed by the Company or if the participant intends to transfer the warrants to someone else. Transfer of warrants under the ESOP 2022/2025 Transfer of warrants under the ESOP 2022/2025 shall be made without consideration. A valid resolution in accordance with the proposal requires that the resolution be supported by shareholders with at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes and the shares represented at the meeting. Item 15 - Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issues of shares  warrants and convertibles The Board of Directors proposes that the meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors until the next Annual General Meeting  on one or more occasions  with or without preferential rights for the shareholders  to issue shares  warrants and/or convertibles  with the right to subscribe for and convert into shares in the Company  respectively  corresponding to a maximum of 20 percent of the Company's share capital after dilution based on the number of shares in the Company at the time of the Annual General Meeting  to be paid in cash  through set-off or in kind. The primary purpose of the authorization is for the Board of Directors to be able to resolve to issue new shares  without preferential rights  in order to raise new capital which will increase the Company's flexibility or in connection with acquisitions or as payment for additional considerations in regard to already finalized acquisitions. Issuance of new shares  pursuant of the authorization  shall be carried out in accordance with acquisition agreements or customary terms and conditions under prevailing market conditions. The allocation of shares can  if the Board of Directors finds it appropriate  be with a subscription price corresponding to the share's quota value. The Board of Directors or anyone appointed by the Board of Directors is given the right to make the adjustments necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution at the Swedish Companies Registration Office. A valid resolution in accordance with the proposal requires that the resolution be supported by shareholders with at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes and the shares represented at the meeting. Item 16 - Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to undertake minor adjustments of the resolutions The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board  the CEO or the person otherwise designated by the Board  to undertake minor adjustments and clarifications of the resolutions made by the Annual General Meeting to the extent it is required for registration of the resolutions.

That campus will remain open  the university's spokesperson said.Cases traipse through Luxembourg courts  EU findsThe time it takes Luxembourg courts to resolve civil cases has more than doubled over the past decade  the European Commission has found  underscoring often-heard criticism about the slow pace of the legal system in the world's second-largest fund management centre.It takes up to a year-and-a-half to resolve administrative cases  a new report from the Commission has found  making it the eighth-slowest across the bloc  and more cases are entering the legal system than are being resolved.Last year  Luxembourg prosecutors handed out the first indictments in the Bernard Madoff fraud case after a criminal investigation had been simmering for over 10 years  despite the fact that damages from the Ponzi scheme amounted to €1.5 billion in the Grand Duchy alone. Madoff  who ran a $65 billion (€58 billion) Ponzi scheme  died in jail in America just a month earlier.Transparency International has ranked Luxembourg as having ""little to no enforcement"" of foreign bribery and said no cases had commenced in the three years from 2016  with just one case leading to sanctions.Luxembourg funds down 5% from all-time peakFunds registered in Luxembourg lost €340 billion in value since they reached an all-time peak of more than €5.9 trillion in December  the Association of the Luxembourg Fund Industry (ALFI) said on Tuesday.Assets held were worth short of €5.6 trillion at the end of March  a downturn of more than 5% since December's high watermark  ALFI said in citing figures by industry regulator CSSF.The war in Ukraine caused market volatility  and high inflation and the automatic indexation of wages in Luxembourg also posed a concern to the fund industry  ALFI general director Claude Thommes said in February.He had predicted that Luxembourg funds were likely to continue their losses in the first quarter after the industry registered a drop of €180 billion at the end of January compared to December.However  the March level is still 5.7% higher than it was a year ago  ALFI said.War strains Luxembourg's investment-flows powerhouseRussia’s war against neighbouring Ukraine has meant longer hours  added pressure and intense scrutiny for Luxembourg-based Clearstream  one of the world’s essential securities-trading middlemen.The EU  the US  Japan and others have unleashed round after round of sanctions to weaken Russia’s financial system after the start of the war  leaving Clearstream to find a balance in applying restrictions on the €13 trillion that will flow through its computer systems this year.The company is one of the world’s primary firms ensuring custody and payments for security trades  and it needs to show that its interpretation of sanctions is both accurate and fair  Clearstream Banking CEO Philippe Seyll told the Luxembourg Times. That could include having to go to court.“It's quite stressful for us and the staff ” Seyll said. To cope with the pressure  “we have increased the staffing in those areas that have to deal with the sanctions.

The Euronext Amsterdam stock market is Europe's biggest SPAC ...,By Lucy Raitano(Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Ripplewood said on Tuesday it was planning to list a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in Amsterdam in what will be this year's second listing of a blank cheque vehicle on the Dutch stock exchange.Ripplewood's SPAC  named RA Special Acquisition Corporation  will seek to raise up to $225 million ahead of its market debut on April. 28.RA will focus on financial services targets in Europe and will have 24 months to clinch a deal. That window can be extended by six months if approved by a shareholder vote.Goldman Sachs is handling a two-day bookbuilding process which will conclude on Wednesday.SPACs are investment vehicles that raise money on stock markets to buy private businesses  providing an easy route for the target to go public without going through the more complex process of a traditional initial public offering (IPO).RA's listing ranks as the second SPAC deal on Euronext Amsterdam this year after Luxembourg-based GP Bullhound Acquisition I SE went public in February raising 200 million euros from investors.The Euronext Amsterdam stock market is Europe's biggest SPAC hub  with blank cheque firms including Dutch Star Companies TWO and Odyssey SPAC also recently finalising their deals.Meanwhile London has failed to attract as many SPAC deals in recent years despite adopting new listing rules to step up its SPAC pipeline  with only one listing finalised in November.Along with co-investors  Ripplewood owns 75% of Latvia's Citadele Bank and is also the second largest shareholder in Egypt-based investment bank EFG Hermes  with an 11.7% stake according to Refinitiv data.In 1999 Ripplewood partnered with U.S private equity firm JC Flowers to acquire the predecessor bank of Shinsei after it went bankrupt in Japan's late 1990s banking crisis.
