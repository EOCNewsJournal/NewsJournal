These models simulated the propagation of Covid-19 in the student population  based on contact-tracing matrices.“This made it possible to investigate the importance of actual contacts between individuals in the transmission process  and more generally to estimate the role of the population’s actions  such as gathering in ill-ventilated rooms and the length and type of communication – casual short conversation or longer collaboration – between individuals in the overall spread of the epidemic ” said Bertrand Maury  who along with colleague Sylvain Faure  created the algorithms. “This evaluation clearly showed this IoT-based solution can help building managers in the future to limit the spread of viruses such as Covid-19.”The contact-tracing application in the buildings was paired with air-quality monitoring that included:• CO2 levels in the premises in relation to occupancy rates and hours  and ventilation adjustments • Malfunctions in the ventilation or required maintenance of ventilation equipment  and• Hourly renewal rate (HRR)  or complete renewal of the air in a room  which is a key performance indicator (KPI) monitored by building managers in their day-to-day operations.The contact-tracing matrices were inspired by an algorithm developed by France’s National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and Paris-Saclay University that defines epidemiological models for virus transmission. It also provides a first assessment of the influence of CO2 concentration as an indicator of poor air quality that may accelerate viral transmission  e.g. a CO2 level indicating insufficient indoor air renewal.The pilot project at Kremlin-Bicêtre AP-HP has been validated by the clinical research unit of the Paris-Saclay Faculty of Medicine  while the protection of private data and the identities of the pilot-project participants fully complied with GDPR law.Prof. Olivier Lambotte  vice dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Kremlin-Bicêtre AP-HP  said Covid-19 virus transmission and the desire to develop an “improved-alerting” tool based on epidemiologic models were the initial triggers for this demonstrator project and they have been successfully completed with air-quality monitoring through CO2-level analysis.“After these initial results  the Faculty of Medicine will be able to refine its systems for combatting the spread of epidemics thanks to a better knowledge of the interactions between students and thanks to a mastery of air quality ” he said. “Mathematical modeling of air renewal in a classroom or amphitheater allows us to estimate in advance the maximum number of people who can be present to maintain a CO2 level below a set threshold.”The system used technology jointly developed by Kerlink (AKLK – FR0013156007)  a specialist in solutions dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT)  Microshare  a provider of a leading data-management solutions for the IoT era  and Enless Wireless  a major manufacturer of intelligent self-powered sensors  communicating in radio mode and dedicated to energy performance & comfort applications in buildings.The LoRaWAN-based system used Kerlink Wanesy™ Wave  a multi-purpose powered anchor – combining Wi-Fi  BLE and LoRaWAN®  for contact-tracing data collection from Bluetooth badges – and a Kerlink Wirnet™ iFemtoCell indoor gateway to transmit the data to Microshare’s Universal Contact Tracing® application  which ensures end-to-end security  privacy and reliability for the delivery of critical information where it’s needed.

( ) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend on the 25th of May to €1.93. Although the dividend is now higher  the yield is only 2.4%  which is below the industry average.Euronext's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf it is predictable over a long period  even low dividend yields can be attractive. Prior to this announcement  Euronext's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business  with the aim of fueling growth.Over the next year  EPS is forecast to expand by 2.9%. If the dividend continues on this path  the payout ratio could be 46% by next year  which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.ENXTPA:ENX Historic Dividend May 22nd 2022Euronext Doesn't Have A Long Payment HistoryIt is great to see that Euronext has been paying a stable dividend for a number of years now  however we want to be a bit cautious about whether this will remain true through a full economic cycle. The dividend has gone from €0.84 in 2015 to the most recent annual payment of €1.93. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. Euronext has been growing its dividend quite rapidly  which is exciting. However  the short payment history makes us question whether this performance will persist across a full market cycle.We Could See Euronext's Dividend GrowingInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Euronext has impressed us by growing EPS at 9.2% per year over the past five years. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate  and the payout policy is balanced  we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.We Really Like Euronext's DividendOverall  a dividend increase is always good  and we think that Euronext is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered  we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent  stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile  despite the importance of dividend payments  they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Recent months have seen meaningful progress on the commercial front in particular with the successful commercialization of EUTELSAT QUANTUM. Elsewhere  our global distribution agreement with OneWeb to address key connectivity verticals enhances the competitive position of both companies and represents a first step towards the development of combined GEO/LEO solutions. Overall  revenues at the Nine Month stage are in line with our expectations  and we confirm all our financial objectives.”HIGHLIGHTSThird Quarter operating vertical revenues of €285m  broadly stable (-0.7%) quarter-on-quarter.Improvement in Broadcast revenue trend (-6.8% year-on-year in the Third Quarter after 8.6% in the second quarter) with Third Quarter revenues broadly stable (-0.8%) relative to the Second Quarter.Robust double-digit growth for both Fixed Broadband and Mobile Connectivity in the Third Quarter  at respectively circa plus 30% and plus 25% year-on-year  highlighting the significant potential in Connectivity.Strong progress in the commercialization of EUTELSAT QUANTUM with six beams (out of eight) already sold after six months of operation and the entire capacity expected to be fully sold in the coming months.Global distribution partnership secured with OneWeb to address key connectivity verticals  deepening cooperation and showcasing operational synergies between the two companies.Nine Month Operating Verticals of €853m down 4.0% year-on-year and in line with expectations  enabling us to reiterate our objective for the Full Year of between €1 110 million and €1 130 million 4 .. All other financial objectives also confirmed.THIRD QUARTER REVENUES5Total revenues for the Third Quarter stood at €287 million down 4.8% on a reported basis and by 2.7% like-for-like.Revenues of the five Operating Verticals (ie  excluding ‘Other Revenues’) stood at €285 million. They were down by 3.5% on a like-for-like basis excluding a negative perimeter effect of circa three points from the disposal of Euro Broadband Infrastructure (EBI) on 30 April 2021 and a positive currency effect of circa three points.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues of the five Operating Verticals were down by 0.7% like-for-like.Unless otherwise stated  all variations indicated hereunder are on a like-for-like basis  ie  at constant currency and perimeter.Broadcast (61% of revenues)Third Quarter Broadcast revenues amounted to €173 million  down 6.8% year-on-year  representing an improvement in trend relative to the Second Quarter (-8.6% year-on-year). The revenue decline reflected predominantly the effect of the partial renewal of capacity with Nilesat at 7/8°West  which is not offset by the resale of this capacity  and elsewhere  a slight erosion in the underlying business in Europe. Excluding the 7/8°West impact  Broadcast revenues experienced a low-single-digit decline.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were broadly stable with the slight  -0.8%  erosion reflecting the carryforward effect of the above-mentioned 7/8°West headwind which impacted revenues from mid-October onwards. Revenues were flat excluding this item.Revenues are expected to remain broadly stable in the Fourth Quarter relative to the Third Quarter.Data & Professional Video (14% of revenues)Third Quarter Data & Professional Video revenues stood at €40 million  down by 2.7% year-on-year.In Fixed Data  which represents two thirds of this application  improved volume trends are now offsetting most of the negative impact of competitive pressure.The Professional Video revenues trend saw a slight uptick  reflecting the phasing of a specific contract which is beneficial to the Second Half but neutral over the Full Year  as well as growth of occasional use.Quarter-on-quarter revenues were stable reflecting notably the above-mentioned Professional Video tailwind as well as the broad stabilization of Fixed Data.On the commercial front  a multi-year agreement was signed with Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation for connectivity on the EUTELSAT 172B satellite to support the extension of corporate networks for government offices and businesses of the Tuvalu Islands.We expect this application to decline at a mid-single digit pace over the Full Fiscal Year  consistent with previous indications.Government Services (12% of revenues)Third Quarter Government Services revenues stood at €35 million  down 11.3% year-on-year. This reflected the negative carry-forward effect of US Government renewals  driven by the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan with in particular a renewal rate of only 75% in Fall 2021  as well as the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were down by 8.0% with the full effect of Fall 2021 renewals now in the quarterly base.On the commercial front  as anticipated in February  the latest renewal campaign with the US Government (Spring 2022) resulted in a below-average renewal rate estimated at above 70% reflecting the continued impact of the geopolitical context in the Middle East. Elsewhere  the commercialisation of EUTELSAT QUANTUM made further strong progress with five beams now secured for Government Services  of which three for incremental business and two to favour the renewal of existing business.In the Fourth Quarter  the full effect of Spring 2022 renewals relative to the Third Quarter should be largely offset by the ramp-up of new business on EUTELSAT QUANTUM.Fixed Broadband (6% of revenues)Third Quarter Fixed Broadband revenues stood at €17 million  up 30.2% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. They reflected the contribution from the wholesale agreements with TIM and Hispasat  the strong dynamic of our African operations and the ramp-up of the multi-beam agreement signed on EUTELSAT 65 West A with several Mexican service providers. Conversely  revenues also reflected the erosion of the legacy business of Bigblu Broadband on the KA-SAT satellite.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were up by 7.7%.The favourable momentum in this application is set to continue into the Fourth Quarter.Mobile Connectivity (7% of revenues)Third Quarter Mobile Connectivity revenues stood at €21 million  up 24.5% year-on-year. They reflected the carry-forward effect of the contract signed with Anuvu last year as well as the ongoing strong growth 4 of Maritime  driven by the ramp-up of contracts with service providers signed in recent years and by the agreement inked earlier this year on EUTELSAT QUANTUM with a customer in the Middle East.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were up by 4.5%.On the commercial front  we continue to see a robust pipeline of business for maritime mobility highlighting both the strong demand in this vertical as well as the quality of our in-orbit resources and services.In the Fourth Quarter  growth is expected to decelerate as the comparison base will notably integrate the above-mentioned agreement with Anuvu.Other Revenues‘Other Revenues’ amounted to €2.1 million in the Third Quarter versus €6.9 million a year earlier and €1.0 million in the Second Quarter. They included a negative (€2.8) million impact from hedging operations compared to a positive impact of +€4.3 million last year and a negative impact of (€2) million in the Second Quarter.OPERATIONAL AND UTILIZED TRANSPONDERSThe number of operational transponders as of 31 March 2022 stood at 1 358 down by 22 units quarter-on-quarter  the latter reflecting principally the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A.The number of utilized transponders stood at 961  down 13 units quarter-on-quarter  reflecting principally the same effect as above as well as the Fall 2021 renewal campaign with the US Government.As a result  the fill rate stood at 70.7% compared with 69.5% a year ago and 70.6% at end-December 2021.31 March 2021 31 Dec. 2021 31 March 2022 Operational transponders6 1 366 1 380 1 358 Utilized transponders7 950 974 961 Fill rate 69.5% 70.6% 70.7% Note: Based on 36 MHz-equivalent transponders excluding high throughput capacityBACKLOGThe backlog stood at €4.0 billion as of 31 March 2022 versus €4.5 billion a year ago  and €4.2 billion at end-December 2021  reflecting its natural consumption in the absence of major broadcast renewals this quarter.It was equivalent to 3.3 times 2020-21 revenues  with Broadcast representing 63%.31 March 2021 31 Dec. 2021 31 March 2022 Value of contracts (in billions of euros) 4.5 4.2 4.0 In years of annual revenues 3.5 3.4 3.3 Share of Broadcast 64% 64% 63% Note: The backlog represents future revenues from capacity or service agreements and can include contracts for satellites under procurement.Value of contracts (in billions of euros) 4.5 4.2 4.0 In years of annual revenues 3.5 3.4 3.3 Share of Broadcast 64% 64% 63%NINE MONTH REVENUESRevenues for the first Nine Months of FY 2021-22 stood at €859 million  down by 7.6% on a reported basis and by 4.0% at constant currency and perimeter.Revenues of the five Operating Verticals (excluding ‘Other Revenues’) were down by 6.0% on a reported basis. They were down by 4.0% on a like-for-like basis excluding a positive effect from currency representing circa one point and a negative perimeter effect of circa three points from the disposal of Euro Broadband Infrastructure (EBI) on 30 April 2021 only partly offset by the consolidation of Bigblu Broadband Europe since 1st October 2020.At a 1.20 €/$ rate (rate as per financial objectives) they stood at €840 million.FINANCIAL OUTLOOKOn the back of the performance of the first Nine Months  we confirm our objective for the Full Year of Operating Vertical Revenues of between €1 110 to €1 130 million9.All other elements of the financial outlook are also confirmed:Cash Capex10 not exceeding €400 million per annum for each of the next three fiscal years (FY 2021-22 / FY 2022-23 / FY 2023-24).Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow of between €400 million and €430 million in FY 202122 at a €/$ rate of 1.20. Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow is expected to grow in FY 202223 and in FY 2023-24.The LEAP 2 plan aimed at generating €20-25 million in annual savings by FY 2021-22.Commitment to a sound financial structure to support our solicited investment grade credit ratings targeting a medium-term net debt / EBITDA ratio of around 3x.The policy of a stable to progressive dividend is also reiterated.This outlook is based on the nominal deployment plan outlined below. It assumes no material deterioration of revenues generated from Russian customers.FLEET DEPLOYMENTNominal deployment programSince the last quarterly update in February 2022  there is no change in the nominal deployment program below.Changes in the fleet since 30 June 2021EUTELSAT QUANTUM was launched on 30 July 2021 and entered service in November 2021.The lease agreement for capacity on the YAHSAT 1B and Al Yah 3 satellites was terminated in the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2021-22.EUTELSAT 48E  which was in inclined orbit  terminated its life in October 2021.EUTELSAT 174A is operating in inclined orbit since January 2022.EXPOSURE TO RUSSIAN CRISISAs disclosed in the latest Universal Registration Document  Eutelsat derived circa 6.3% of its revenues from Russian customers in Fiscal Year 2020-21 and has no material revenue exposure to Ukraine. The Group also leases capacity on four satellites owned by the Russian operator  RSCC  serving mostly the above-mentioned Russian customers and representing a net present value (included in Net Financial Debt) of €322 million as of 31 December 2021.Furthermore  the OneWeb low-orbit constellation in which Eutelsat owns a 22.9% stake had to suspend the remaining six upcoming launches which were planned from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Since then  OneWeb entered into agreements with SpaceX and New Space India that will enable to resume satellite launches.Consistent with its Code of Ethics and as a provider of infrastructure globally Eutelsat upholds a commitment to neutrality and is therefore guided by sanctions and by the decisions of its competent regulatory bodies  which it strictly applies. In this context  Eutelsat immediately implemented EU Council Regulation 2022/350  suspending the broadcasting activities of Russian television stations such as Russia Today.Third Quarter 2021-22 revenues conference callA conference call will be held on Thursday  12 May 2022 at 18.30 CET / 17.30 GMT / 12.30 EST To connect to the call  please use the following numbers:– France: +33 (0) 1 76 77 25 07– UK: +44 (0) 330 165 4045– United States: +1 720-543-0214Access code: 5156191#Instant replay will be available from 12 May  22.30 CET to 19 May  22.30 CET on the following numbers:– France: +33 (0) 1 70 48 00 94– UK: + 44 (0) 20 3859 5407– United States: + 1 719 457 0820Access code: 5156191#Financial calendarNote: The financial calendar is provided for information purposes only.

5327,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.bollyinside.com/news/inflation-concerns-push-european-stock-prices-lower,Inflation concerns push European stock prices lower,1 day ago,On Wednesday  European markets fell  led by technology sectors  as fears of inflation and monetary policy tightening dampened optimism about China’s economic rebound  while UniCredit and Commerzbank climbed. After increasing a little more than 3% since Friday  the pan-European STOXX 600 index dipped 1.1 percent. Technology equities fell 2.7 percent  while basic materials sectors were hit by a drop in copper prices. Consumer price inflation in the United Kingdom surpassed 9% in April  the highest level on record  edging closer to the Bank of England’s estimate of above 10% later this year. “Worries about recession reared up again after UK inflation jumped to the highest level in 40 years ” said Susannah Streeter  senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Landsdown. Euro zone inflation held steady at a record high 7.4% in April  driven by soaring fuel and food costs  the EU’s statistics agency said  lowering its estimate from a preliminary 7.5%.A rise in optimism on Tuesday  after falling COVID-19 cases in China drove hopes of more economic activity  proved short-lived. The STOXX 600 is in on course to end lower in May  having marked gains only in March this year. But with a 11% decline year-to-date  the index has still fared better than the S&P 500 and MSCI’s All Country index  which are down more than 14% over the same period.The European Central Bank is set to hike rates shortly after ending its bond-buying programme early in the third quarter  with the potential for further hikes in coming quarters  echoing a strategy similar to the U.S. Federal Reserve. “For the first time overnight index swaps were pricing in that the ECB would hike by more than 100bps by their December meeting ” said Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid.In earnings  Euronext rose 3.9% on record quarterly revenue. Dutch bank ABN Amro topped profit estimates but shares fell 11.9% as it warned about the impact of the war in Ukraine. Siemens Gamesa jumped 12.6%  after sources said Siemens Energy is preparing to buy the remaining stake in the wind turbine maker. The stake is worth 3.14 billion euros ($3.31 billion). Germany’s Commerzbank AG rose 3.1%  while Italy’s UniCredit SpA gained 2% after a report spoke of scheduled merger talks before the potential deal was abandoned because of the Ukraine war.

These models simulated the propagation of Covid-19 in the student population  based on contact-tracing matrices.“This made it possible to investigate the importance of actual contacts between individuals in the transmission process  and more generally to estimate the role of the population’s actions  such as gathering in ill-ventilated rooms and the length and type of communication – casual short conversation or longer collaboration – between individuals in the overall spread of the epidemic ” said Bertrand Maury  who along with colleague Sylvain Faure  created the algorithms. “This evaluation clearly showed this IoT-based solution can help building managers in the future to limit the spread of viruses such as Covid-19.”The contact-tracing application in the buildings was paired with air-quality monitoring that included:• CO2 levels in the premises in relation to occupancy rates and hours  and ventilation adjustments • Malfunctions in the ventilation or required maintenance of ventilation equipment  and• Hourly renewal rate (HRR)  or complete renewal of the air in a room  which is a key performance indicator (KPI) monitored by building managers in their day-to-day operations.The contact-tracing matrices were inspired by an algorithm developed by France’s National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and Paris-Saclay University that defines epidemiological models for virus transmission. It also provides a first assessment of the influence of CO2 concentration as an indicator of poor air quality that may accelerate viral transmission  e.g. a CO2 level indicating insufficient indoor air renewal.The pilot project at Kremlin-Bicêtre AP-HP has been validated by the clinical research unit of the Paris-Saclay Faculty of Medicine  while the protection of private data and the identities of the pilot-project participants fully complied with GDPR law.Prof. Olivier Lambotte  vice dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Kremlin-Bicêtre AP-HP  said Covid-19 virus transmission and the desire to develop an “improved-alerting” tool based on epidemiologic models were the initial triggers for this demonstrator project and they have been successfully completed with air-quality monitoring through CO2-level analysis.“After these initial results  the Faculty of Medicine will be able to refine its systems for combatting the spread of epidemics thanks to a better knowledge of the interactions between students and thanks to a mastery of air quality ” he said. “Mathematical modeling of air renewal in a classroom or amphitheater allows us to estimate in advance the maximum number of people who can be present to maintain a CO2 level below a set threshold.”The system used technology jointly developed by Kerlink (AKLK – FR0013156007)  a specialist in solutions dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT)  Microshare  a provider of a leading data-management solutions for the IoT era  and Enless Wireless  a major manufacturer of intelligent self-powered sensors  communicating in radio mode and dedicated to energy performance & comfort applications in buildings.The LoRaWAN-based system used Kerlink Wanesy™ Wave  a multi-purpose powered anchor – combining Wi-Fi  BLE and LoRaWAN®  for contact-tracing data collection from Bluetooth badges – and a Kerlink Wirnet™ iFemtoCell indoor gateway to transmit the data to Microshare’s Universal Contact Tracing® application  which ensures end-to-end security  privacy and reliability for the delivery of critical information where it’s needed.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly to treat patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg. With this approval  Dupixent becomes the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in the United States. A regulatory filing for EoE is under review by the European Medicines Agency  and submissions to regulatory authorities in additional countries are planned by the end of 2022.""We have waited a long time for an FDA-approved treatment option for eosinophilic esophagitis – an underdiagnosed and misunderstood disease of the esophagus that can make it extremely challenging and uncomfortable to eat and swallow "" said Mary Jo Strobel  Executive Director at the American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders (APFED). ""Before today  there were no approved treatments specifically for eosinophilic esophagitis  resulting in many people needing to maintain a strict diet and live in constant fear of food getting stuck in their throat. We welcome therapeutic options that can provide much-needed relief for these patients.""EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by type 2 inflammation that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. For people with EoE  swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid  a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow  forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases  a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. About 160 000 patients are living with EoE in the U.S. These individuals are currently treated with therapies not specifically approved for the disease  of whom approximately 48 000 continue to experience symptoms despite multiple treatments.""It is gratifying that Dupixent  a medicine that we invented in our laboratories  is now approved in yet another disease marked by allergic or type 2 inflammation  namely eosinophilic esophagitis "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Eosinophilic esophagitis can be debilitating for patients by inflaming and damaging the esophagus and limiting the ability to eat normally. Dupixent is the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat eosinophilic esophagitis in the United States  and today's approval marks the fourth disease for which Dupixent is now indicated  reinforcing the promise of targeting IL-4 and IL-13 to effectively treat diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation.""""Eating regularly throughout the day is essential  yet significant difficulty swallowing food is a common symptom for people living with eosinophilic esophagitis. This can be incredibly upsetting and often leads to fear of pain or choking with every meal  every day "" said John Reed  M.D.  Ph.D.  Global Head of Research and Development at Sanofi. ""A large unmet need exists for treatment options that can provide meaningful symptom relief. Our Phase 3 clinical program showed that Dupixent weekly improved the ability to swallow and reduced inflammation in the esophagus  underscoring the role of type 2 inflammation in this complex disease. This is a landmark FDA approval for patients and their caregivers who now have a new option for treating this devastating disease.""The FDA approval is based on data from a Phase 3 trial with two parts (Part A and Part B) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent 300 mg weekly  compared to placebo  in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE  weighing at least 40 kg. After 24 weeks  patients treated with Dupixent 300 mg weekly experienced the following changes in Part A and Part B  respectively:69% and 64% reduction in disease symptoms from baseline compared to 32% and 41% for placebo. Disease symptoms were measured by the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ)  where patients receiving Dupixent experienced a 21.9- and 23.8-point clinically meaningful improvement compared to 9.6- and 13.9-point improvement for placebo.Approximately 10 times as many patients achieved histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/high power field [hpf]) compared to placebo: 60% and 59% compared to 5% and 6% of patients receiving placebo.The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Pooled adverse events from Parts A and B that were more commonly (≥2%) observed with Dupixent than placebo were injection site reactions (38% Dupixent  33% placebo)  upper respiratory tract infections (18% Dupixent  10% placebo)  arthralgia (2% Dupixent  1% placebo) and herpes viral infections (2% Dupixent  1% placebo).The FDA evaluated the Dupixent application under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.About the Dupixent Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. Part A enrolled 81 patients and evaluated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (42 treated with Dupixent and 39 with placebo). Part B enrolled 159 patients and evaluated Dupixent 300 mg weekly (80 with Dupixent and 79 with placebo).At 24 weeks  the co-primary endpoints in Parts A and B assessed patient-reported measures of difficulty swallowing (change from baseline in the DSQ on a 0-84 scale) and esophageal inflammation (proportion of patients achieving histological disease remission  defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eos/hpf).About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 12 years and older  weighing at least 40 kg  with EoE  Dupixent is administered as a 300 mg dose with a pre-filled syringe or pen every week. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children aged 12 to 17 years  Dupixent should be administered under the supervision of an adult.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent is also approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations in a number of countries around the world  including the U.S.  European Union and Japan. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and InmazebTM (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  hand and foot atopic dermatitis (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  chronic pruritis of unknown origin (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Inveniam via Inveniam.io  is the operating system for private market data that drives price discovery and automated waterfall calculations. Rialto Markets’ fully functional alternative trading system (ATS) is unlocking secondary trading in the private securities market for retail and accredited investors.Shari Noonan  Rialto Markets CEO  who is leading this effort  offered  “Trading shares used to be restricted to certain companies that could afford to publicly list on a platform such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq  but a regulated secondary market for private company shares opens up trading and liquidity  and ultimately  price discovery.”The partnership arrives at a critical juncture for private market companies as in the 10 plus years prior to 2019  capital flowing into capital assets grew at 4 times the pace of public markets. After a down year in 2020  2021 saw U.S. private markets establish a new highwater mark for fundraising and as a result  more companies are staying private longer or bypassing going public. Additionally  in 2022  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission laid out a number of proposals including requirements for registered private funds advisors to distribute quarterly statements to private fund investors with a detailed accounting of all fees and expenses during the reporting period. Also in 2021  the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation  announced its Digital Securities Management initiative  a platform that will  subject to regulatory approval  “for the first time  provide an industry-wide solution that offers common market infrastructure and standards across private markets.”Concurrently  JP Morgan has embarked on “Project Bloom ” a platform intended to match start-ups with accredited investors. BlackRock  the world’s largest asset manager  is now advising its clients to consider moving away from the traditional 60/40 portfolio in favor of a 50/30/20 portfolio with 20% going into alternative  private market assets.Pat O’Meara  founder and CEO of Inveniam  commented on the partnership  “In order for there to be more fluid trading of private market securities  an entire ecosystem must be established. As such  today’s agreement with Rialto and Inveniam is an incredible advancement towards building that fully functioning ecosystem. This is great news for middle market companies in search capital and price discovery and is reminiscent of the development of the ECN markets in the ‘90s.”The integration of Rialto into the Inveniam ecosystem will result in Rialto incorporating various components of digital securities data and real-time market data thereby delivering transparency and trust for market participants. Further  having diverse data flow via Ownera  and the industry’s FinP2P open-source routing and settlement protocol that interconnects the private markets seamlessly in a user friendly platform  will give the GPs direct access to better data systems  secondary markets for the exchange of alternative assets  and new novel forms of primary distribution will transform the role of fund administrators.
