You should not consider these non-IFRS financial measures as substitutes for or superior to revenue  in the case of Total Net Revenue  Like-for-like Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue; Net Profit  in the case of Adjusted EBITDA; and Adjusted Net Profit  or earnings per share  in the case of Adjusted Net Profit per share  each prepared in accordance with IFRS.Furthermore  because these non-IFRS financial measures are not determined in accordance with IFRS  they are susceptible to varying calculations and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. QIWI encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information regarding Total Net Revenue  Like-for-like Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted Net Profit  and Adjusted Net Profit per share  including a quantitative reconciliation of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit to the most directly comparable IFRS financial performance measure  which is revenue in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue and Net Profit in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  see Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results in this earnings release.We define non-IFRS financial measures as follows:“Total Net Revenue” is calculated by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue.“Like-for-like Total Net Revenue” as Revenue minus (1) Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) (2) 1Q 2021 TSUPIS and related acquiring services net revenue of RUB 918 million.“Adjusted EBITDA” as Net profit plus: (1) depreciation and amortization (2) other income and expenses (3) foreign exchange gain/loss (4) share of gain of an associate and a joint venture (5) interest income and expenses (6) income tax expenses (7) share-based payment expenses (8) impairment of non-current assets.“Adjusted Net profit” as Net profit plus: (1) fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization (2) impairment of non-current assets (3) share-based payment expenses (4) effect of taxation of the above items.“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Net Revenue.“Adjusted Net profit Margin” as Adjusted Net profit divided by Total Net Revenue.Total Net Revenue is a key measure used by management to observe our operational profitability since it reflects our portion of the revenue net of fees that we pass through  primarily to our agents and other reload channels providers. In addition  under IFRS  most types of fees are presented on a gross basis whereas certain types of fees are presented on a net basis. Therefore  in order to analyze our two sources of payment processing fees on a comparative basis  management reviews Total Net Revenue. Like-for-like Total Net Revenue indicates net revenue trends for both years on comparable basis  excluding from the previous year revenues of terminated activities  such as TSUPIS & related acquiring services (which terminated since 4Q 2021).Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management  is serves as a supplemental performance measure that facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expenses  net)  changes in foreign exchange rates that impact financial asset and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency (affecting foreign exchange (loss)/gain  net)  tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates)  the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expense)  non-cash charges (affecting share-based payments expenses and impairment of non-current assets)  and certain one-time income and expenses (affecting other income  offering and related expenses  loss from sale of Sovest loan portfolio  etc.). Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other expenses  share in losses of associates and impairment of investment in associates because we believe it is helpful to view the performance of our business excluding the impact of entities that we do not control  and because our share of the net income (loss) of the associate and other expenses includes items that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA (such as finance expenses  net  tax on income and depreciation and amortization). Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use Adjusted EBITDA in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors.Adjusted Net Profit is a key measure used by management to observe the operational profitability of the company. We believe Adjusted Net Profit is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it measures a company’s operating performance without the effect of non-recurring items or items that are not core to our operations. For example  loss on disposals of subsidiaries and the effects of deferred taxation on excluded items do not represent the core operations of the business  and fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization  impairment of non-current assets and share-based payments expenses do not have a substantial cash effect. Nevertheless  such gains and losses can affect our financial performance.Payment Services segment payment volume provides a measure of the overall size and growth of the business  and increasing our payment volumes is essential to growing our profitability.Payment Services segment net revenue yield. We calculate Payment Services segment net revenue yield by dividing Payment Services segment net revenue by Payment Services segment payment volume. Payment Services segment net revenue yield provides a measure of our ability to generate net revenue per unit of volume we process.QIWI presents PS Payment segment breakdown by verticals and we define these measures as follows:PS Payment Net Revenue is the Net Revenue consisting of the merchant and consumer fees collected for the payment transactions. E-commerce payment net revenue consists of fees charged to customers and merchants that buy and sell products and services online  including online games  social networks  betting  online stores  game developers  software producers  coupon websites  tickets and numerous other merchants. Financial Services payment net revenue primarily consists of fees charged for payments accepted on behalf of our bank partners and microfinance companies.

[Photo/Xinhua]After the 2008 global financial crisis  the world seemed ready to undertake meaningful reform of the international monetary system. But the promised structural changes never happened. And the recent spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank indicated that the current bout of global economic upheaval will similarly fail to spur transformation.When the 2008 crisis rocked the global financial system  policymakers took radical action to stabilize it. Beyond government bailouts of distressed banks in the United States  the epicenter of the crisis  liquidity was expanded substantially through large-scale quantitative easing and foreign currency swaps by central banks. And the international monetary system's legitimacy was bolstered by the expansion of decision-making from the G7 to the G20.The obvious next step was regulatory reform  aimed at preventing future crises. To this end  more power was delegated to the Financial Stability Board  an international body focused on identifying and promoting strong regulatory  supervisory and other financial sector policies. The FSB pushed  for example  for higher capital and liquidity requirements for banks and limits on total leverage ratios.But critical reforms－such as the FSB's attempts to expand oversight to cover non-bank financial intermediaries－were thwarted by pushback from the financial community. Similarly  in the US  the tougher regulatory regime put in place after the crisis was subsequently weakened.Meanwhile  the massive monetary expansion that had propped up the global economy generated new risks  with prolonged ultra-low interest rates encouraging short-term speculation and fueling asset bubbles  without increasing long-term productivity. According to the McKinsey Global Institute  total assets tripled from 2000 to 2020  with the value of global financial assets and liabilities now twice as large as that of real assets. At the same time  the financial sector and ownership wealth became far more concentrated.Now  a new set of shocks－from the COVID-19 pandemic  rising inflation and interest rates  and the Ukraine-Russia conflict－are threatening to generate further upheaval. According to the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development  the most pressing challenges include debt distress among emerging-market and developing economies  vaccine equity  the surge in inflation  and growing risks to financial stability.Efforts to address such urgent challenges are largely piecemeal. For example  last August  the IMF approved a general allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs  the IMF's reserve asset) equivalent to $650 billion. This expanded the IMF's resources substantially  but the demands for funding have increased exponentially. As IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva admitted at the recent meetings  60 percent of countries  including at least 20 in Sub-Saharan Africa  have debt burdens exceeding 50 percent of their respective GDPs and are facing or near debt distress.With the Ukraine-Russia conflict generating severe increases in energy and food prices  which are hitting emerging-market and developing economies particularly hard  the situation is set to deteriorate further. Already  Argentina  Egypt  Lebanon and Sri Lanka are in urgent aid talks with the IMF. As for Ukraine  the IMF has provided $1.4 billion in emergency funding  but the country needs at least $5 billion per month to maintain a functioning economy  and that does not even begin to cover post-war reconstruction.More fundamentally  ""urgent"" and ""important"" are not the same thing. And there are some crucial structural-reform questions that the IMF and its most powerful stakeholders have not even begun to answer. Perhaps the most fundamental is whether the current US dollar-based system designed at the end of World War II can continue to provide global public goods.That system has certainly worked well to foster globalization  trade  financialization and overall growth during the largely peaceful post-World War II period  including the tense Cold War era. But it was not designed to deal with the complex challenges posed by climate change  pandemics  rapid technological innovation  rising inequality  long-term demographic changes and escalating geopolitical conflicts. It certainly was not intended to operate within a multipolar world order.The world was promised a neutral international monetary system secured by a stable reserve currency issued by a global hegemon. But  with the US dollar being weaponized through sanctions  it has become all too clear that the current system is far from neutral.Moreover  the US is no longer the global hegemon. The world order now seems destined to split into two blocs  each with their own security structures  supply chains  technologies and financial systems. In any case  as Bernard Snoy et d'Oppuers points out in a forthcoming book  when any national currency functions as a global currency  at least six types of instability ensue: environmental  economic  social  financial  political and ideological.Building a more stable international monetary system demands a shift to a truly global currency. The SDR is the most obvious candidate  backed by the Palais-Royal Initiative in 2011. But the US  which holds the most sway at the IMF  would not agree to turn the IMF into a quasi-central bank with the power to issue a supernational currency that would erode Washington's ""exorbitant privilege"".Even if no national currency is likely to replace the US dollar any time soon  there are two other avenues for reducing the dollar's dominance as a means of payment and store of value: digital currencies and the creation and expansion of non-dollar-based payment systems (replacing Fedwire  Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication  Euroclear  and the like).The existing international monetary system is unsustainable. We can either reform it now or wait for a catastrophic crisis－an emerging market and developing economies' debt crisis on the scale of the Latin American and Asian financial crises in the 1980s and 1990s  a global bout of depression like that seen in the 1930s  or war among major powers－to force our hand.Project SyndicateAndrew Sheng  a distinguished fellow at the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong  is a member of the UNEP Advisory Council on Sustainable Finance; and Xiao Geng  chairman of the Hong Kong Institution for International Finance  is a professor at and director of the Institute of Policy and Practice at the Shenzhen Finance Institute at The Chinese University of Hong Kong  Shenzhen.The views don't necessarily reflect those of China Daily.If you have a specific expertise  or would like to share your thought about our stories  then send us your writings at opinion@chinadaily.com.cn  and comment@chinadaily.com.cn.",negative,0.01,0.02,0.98,mixed,0.06,0.14,0.8,True,English,"['Global monetary system', 'Opinion', 'peaceful post-World War II period', 'tense Cold War era', 'other financial sector policies', 'neutral international monetary system', 'current US dollar-based system', 'International Monetary Fund', 'International Monetary Affairs', 'large-scale quantitative easing', 'obvious next step', 'special drawing rights', 'crucial structural-reform questions', 'rapid technological innovation', 'escalating geopolitical conflicts', 'foreign currency swaps', 'strong regulatory, supervisory', 'tougher regulatory regime', 'McKinsey Global Institute', 'global public goods', 'total leverage ratios', 'urgent aid talks', 'global financial system', 'Financial Stability Board', 'bank financial intermediaries', 'massive monetary expansion', 'stable reserve currency', 'recent spring meetings', 'ultra-low interest rates', 'long-term demographic changes', 'global financial assets', 'global economic upheaval', 'multipolar world order', 'IMF Managing Director', '2008 global financial crisis', 'current system', 'international body', 'recent meetings', 'total assets', 'financial community', 'financial systems', 'current bout', 'regulatory reform', 'global economy', 'global hegemon', 'national currency', 'structural changes', 'World Bank', 'long-term productivity', 'urgent challenges', 'reserve asset', 'real assets', 'United States', 'meaningful reform', 'radical action', 'government bailouts', 'future crises', 'higher capital', 'critical reforms', 'new risks', 'short-term speculation', 'asset bubbles', 'same time', 'ownership wealth', 'new set', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Ukraine-Russia conflict', 'Intergovernmental Group', 'pressing challenges', 'debt distress', 'developing economies', 'vaccine equity', 'growing risks', 'general allocation', 'Kristalina Georgieva', 'Sub-Saharan Africa', 'debt burdens', 'respective GDPs', 'severe increases', 'food prices', 'Sri Lanka', 'functioning economy', 'post-war reconstruction', 'same thing', 'powerful stakeholders', 'overall growth', 'complex challenges', 'climate change', 'rising inequality', 'two blocs', 'security structures', 'supply chains', 'Bernard Snoy', 'forthcoming book', 'distressed banks', 'central banks', 'The FSB', 'liquidity requirements', 'rising inflation', 'emergency funding', 'IMF Headquarters', '2008 crisis', 'Photo', 'April', 'Washington', 'DC', 'transformation', 'policymakers', 'epicenter', 'legitimacy', 'decision-making', 'G7', 'G20', 'end', 'example', 'limits', 'attempts', 'oversight', 'pushback', 'place', 'prolonged', 'value', 'liabilities', 'shocks', 'Twenty', 'Development', 'emerging-market', 'surge', 'Efforts', 'SDRs', 'resources', 'demands', '60 percent', 'countries', '50 percent', 'energy', 'situation', 'Argentina', 'Egypt', 'Lebanon', 'country', 'month', 'globalization', 'trade', 'financialization', 'pandemics', 'sanctions', 'technologies', 'case', 'Oppuers']",2022-05-23,2022-05-23,chinadaily.com.cn

You should not consider these non-IFRS financial measures as substitutes for or superior to revenue  in the case of Total Net Revenue  Like-for-like Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue; Net Profit  in the case of Adjusted EBITDA; and Adjusted Net Profit  or earnings per share  in the case of Adjusted Net Profit per share  each prepared in accordance with IFRS.Furthermore  because these non-IFRS financial measures are not determined in accordance with IFRS  they are susceptible to varying calculations and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. QIWI encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information regarding Total Net Revenue  Like-for-like Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted Net Profit  and Adjusted Net Profit per share  including a quantitative reconciliation of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit to the most directly comparable IFRS financial performance measure  which is revenue in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue and Net Profit in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  see Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results in this earnings release.We define non-IFRS financial measures as follows:“Total Net Revenue” is calculated by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue.“Like-for-like Total Net Revenue” as Revenue minus (1) Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) (2) 1Q 2021 TSUPIS and related acquiring services net revenue of RUB 918 million.“Adjusted EBITDA” as Net profit plus: (1) depreciation and amortization (2) other income and expenses (3) foreign exchange gain/loss (4) share of gain of an associate and a joint venture (5) interest income and expenses (6) income tax expenses (7) share-based payment expenses (8) impairment of non-current assets.“Adjusted Net profit” as Net profit plus: (1) fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization (2) impairment of non-current assets (3) share-based payment expenses (4) effect of taxation of the above items.“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Net Revenue.“Adjusted Net profit Margin” as Adjusted Net profit divided by Total Net Revenue.Total Net Revenue is a key measure used by management to observe our operational profitability since it reflects our portion of the revenue net of fees that we pass through  primarily to our agents and other reload channels providers. In addition  under IFRS  most types of fees are presented on a gross basis whereas certain types of fees are presented on a net basis. Therefore  in order to analyze our two sources of payment processing fees on a comparative basis  management reviews Total Net Revenue. Like-for-like Total Net Revenue indicates net revenue trends for both years on comparable basis  excluding from the previous year revenues of terminated activities  such as TSUPIS & related acquiring services (which terminated since 4Q 2021).Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management  is serves as a supplemental performance measure that facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expenses  net)  changes in foreign exchange rates that impact financial asset and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency (affecting foreign exchange (loss)/gain  net)  tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates)  the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expense)  non-cash charges (affecting share-based payments expenses and impairment of non-current assets)  and certain one-time income and expenses (affecting other income  offering and related expenses  loss from sale of Sovest loan portfolio  etc.). Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other expenses  share in losses of associates and impairment of investment in associates because we believe it is helpful to view the performance of our business excluding the impact of entities that we do not control  and because our share of the net income (loss) of the associate and other expenses includes items that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA (such as finance expenses  net  tax on income and depreciation and amortization). Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use Adjusted EBITDA in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors.Adjusted Net Profit is a key measure used by management to observe the operational profitability of the company. We believe Adjusted Net Profit is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it measures a company’s operating performance without the effect of non-recurring items or items that are not core to our operations. For example  loss on disposals of subsidiaries and the effects of deferred taxation on excluded items do not represent the core operations of the business  and fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization  impairment of non-current assets and share-based payments expenses do not have a substantial cash effect. Nevertheless  such gains and losses can affect our financial performance.Payment Services segment payment volume provides a measure of the overall size and growth of the business  and increasing our payment volumes is essential to growing our profitability.Payment Services segment net revenue yield. We calculate Payment Services segment net revenue yield by dividing Payment Services segment net revenue by Payment Services segment payment volume. Payment Services segment net revenue yield provides a measure of our ability to generate net revenue per unit of volume we process.QIWI presents PS Payment segment breakdown by verticals and we define these measures as follows:PS Payment Net Revenue is the Net Revenue consisting of the merchant and consumer fees collected for the payment transactions. E-commerce payment net revenue consists of fees charged to customers and merchants that buy and sell products and services online  including online games  social networks  betting  online stores  game developers  software producers  coupon websites  tickets and numerous other merchants. Financial Services payment net revenue primarily consists of fees charged for payments accepted on behalf of our bank partners and microfinance companies.

Letter to Owners in Millicom2. Notice on the Offering of Common Shares (Actions) of the Company  Including Common Shares Represented by Swedish Depository ReceiptsItem 1CEO LETTERDear owner in Millicom 7 for 10 Rights Offer at SEK 106.00 per new SDR or USD 10.61 per new Share1. Introduction:On November 12  2021  Millicom announced the acquisition of the remaining 45% equity stake in our joint venture business in Guatemala (“Tigo Guatemala”) for USD 2.2 billion in cash. With this transaction  we now own a 100% equity interest in Tigo Guatemala and have consolidated our position as the leading telecommunication service provider in Central America. At the time of the acquisition  the funding was provided by a group of leading international banks. The bridge funding was intended to be refinanced with approximately USD 1.5 billion of new long-term debt and approximately USD 750 million of new equity  which Millicom is now seeking to raise via a rights offering (the “Rights Offer”).The purpose of this letter is to explain the rationale for launching the Rights Offer and why the Board of Directors and the executive management team1 believe this is in the best interests of Millicom equity holders. The letter also provides details of how you can participate in the Rights Offer.Under the terms of the Rights Offer  Millicom is offering seven new Swedish Depository Receipts (“SDRs”) for every ten SDR rights owned at a subscription price of SEK 106.00 per new SDR  and seven new common shares for every ten common share rights owned at a subscription price of USD 10.61 per common share. As a part of the Rights Offer  equity holders of record on May 23  2022 will receive preferential subscription rights. If you hold SDRs  please refer to the last page in this letter for a description of how to proceed in order to exercise your SDR rights.2. Reasons for the acquisition of Tigo Guatemala:Tigo Guatemala is the most profitable business within the Millicom Group  with an EBITDA2 margin of 53.6% in 2021. The acquisition of the remaining 45% equity interest was in line with our stated inorganic capital allocation strategy  which includes acquisitions of the remaining minority interests owned by third parties in our operations  when we believe those transactions can be executed in an accretive manner. In recent years  Tigo Guatemala has grown to become the biggest contributor to the Group’s cash flow generation.1 However  neither I  the executive management team nor our Board of Directors (nor any committee thereof) has made any recommendation as to whether you should exercise or transfer your rights. You should decide whether to transfer your rights  subscribe for new SDRs or common shares or take no action with respect to your rights based on your own assessment of your best interests.2 EBITDA and operating cash flow (OCF)  which are used throughout this letter  are Non-IFRS measures. Please refer to the end of this letter for non-IFRS disclosures and a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest equivalent IFRS measures. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.CEO LETTEROver the last five years  Tigo Guatemala has proven a strong growth track record with revenue growing at a compounded annual rate of over four percent and EBITDA increasing at a compounded annual growth rate of over six percent. In addition  there has been a sustained growth through the pandemic.The Guatemalan market is an underpenetrated two-player mobile and fixed telecommunications market  where Tigo Guatemala is the number one market player in Mobile and Broadband  and the second largest in Pay TV3. The Guatemalan economy as a whole has shown resiliency and was one of the least impacted economies during the pandemic  and the currency  the Guatemala Quetzal  has been very stable compared to the US dollar for the last 20 years.Finally  the purchase price of the remaining 45% in Tigo Guatemala represented an attractive valuation given the high cash flow profile of the business.3. Financial impact of the acquisition:As a result of the acquisition  Millicom fully consolidates Tigo Guatemala’s results and balance sheet. In 2021  Tigo Guatemala’s revenue grew 6.5% to USD 1.6 billion  EBITDA rose 10.2% to USD 857 million and operating cash flow (“OCF”) increased 10.4% to USD 660 million.44. Shareholder intentions and Board and management indications:Several of our largest institutional shareholders have already informed us of their intentions to fully subscribe for their respective pro rata shares in the Rights Offer. Additionally  I plan to exercise my rights in full  and all our directors and all members of our executive team have indicated that they also plan to exercise their rights in full  except for one director and one member of the executive team who have indicated that they plan to partially exercise their rights.I would like to thank all our equity holders for your trust  and I hope that you will consider exercising your preferential subscription rights to further strengthen Millicom and take part in our continued growth journey.5Mauricio RamosCEO  Millicom3 Pay TV consists of direct-to-home satellite TV and cable TV services.4 EBITDA and OCF are Non-IFRS measures.

The nomination committee is to propose: the chairman of the annual general meeting;candidates for the post of chairman and other directors of the board;fees and other remuneration to each director;fees to members of committees within the board;election and remuneration of the Company auditor; andprinciples for the nomination committee. 1.2 The nomination committee shall in its assessment of the evaluation of the board an in its proposal in particular take into consideration the requirement of diversity and breadth on the board and strive for equal gender distribution. 1.3 The nomination committee shall give proposal regarding election of and remuneration to the auditor. 1.4 Regardless of how they have been appointed  the members of the nomination committee are to promote the interests of all shareholders of the Company. 2. Members of the nomination committee 2.1 The nomination committee shall consist of four members  of whom three shall be nominated by the Company's three largest shareholders by voting power and the fourth shall be the chairman of the board. The chairman of the board shall as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of the third quarter  in an adequate manner  contact the three owner-registered largest shareholders  by voting power  according to the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB at that time and request that they  taken into consideration the circumstances  within reasonable time which cannot exceed 30 days  in writing to the nomination committee nominate that person whom the shareholder wishes to appoint as member of the nomination committee. If any of the three largest shareholders wish not to exercise their right to appoint a member of the nomination committee  the next shareholder in consecutive order shall be entitled to appoint a member of the nomination committee. In the case that several shareholders abstain their right to appoint a member of the nomination committee  the chairman of the board shall not be required to contact more than eight shareholders  unless it is necessary in order to obtain a nomination committee consisting of a minimum of three members. 2.2 Unless otherwise agreed between the members  the chairman of the nomination committee shall be nominated by the largest shareholder by voting power. The chairman of the board shall never be the chairman of the nomination committee. 2.3 If a member nominated by a shareholder  during the year ceases to be one of the Company's three largest shareholders by voting powers  the member nominated by such shareholder shall resign from the nomination committee. Instead  a new shareholder among the three largest shareholders shall be entitled to independently and in its sole discretion appoint a member of the nomination committee. However  no marginal changes in shareholding and no changes in shareholding which occur later than three months prior to the annual general meeting shall lead to a change in the composition of the nomination committee  unless there are exceptional reasons. 2.4 If a member of the nomination committee resigns before the nomination committee has completed its assignment  for reasons other than set out in item 2.3  the shareholder who nominated such member shall be entitled to independently and in its sole discretion appoint a replacement member.

Account of the work of the nomination committee 6.1 All members of the nomination committee  where possible  and as a minimum one of the members  shall be present at the annual general meeting. 6.2 The nomination committee shall at the annual general meeting  or other shareholders' meetings where an election is to be held  give an account of how it has conducted its work and explain its proposals against the background of what is provided about the composition of the board in 5.1.

No other nomination committee member may make statements to the press or otherwise make public statements regarding the Company and the Company group unless the chairman of the board has given permission thereto. Item 12: Resolution regarding guidelines for remuneration to senior executives The board of directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on guidelines for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the below. Who the guidelines include and the applicability of the guidelines These guidelines for remuneration to senior executives include directors  the CEO and persons who report directly to the CEO. The guidelines shall be applied to fixed based salary and variable remuneration agreed upon  and to changes made to such remuneration  after the guidelines have been adopted by the general meeting. The guidelines do not include remuneration resolved by the general meeting or other remuneration paid to senior executives and which is not explicitly stated in these guidelines. The board of directors shall have the right to temporarily deviate  in whole or in part  from the guidelines if in an individual case it is considered that a deviation from the guidelines is commercially justified according to the Board's assessment. The forms of remuneration  etc. Remuneration to senior executives consists of a fixed based salary and variable remuneration (short-term incentives). The general meeting may in addition - and independently of these guidelines - resolve on share or share price-related remuneration. The Company's board of directors must in special cases be able to be remunerated for services within their respective areas of competence  which do not constitute board work. A market fee must be paid for these services  which must be approved by the board of directors and informed at the general meeting. Fixed based salary Fixed based salary for the CEO and other senior executives is reassessed annually. Variable compensation (short-term incentives) The variable remuneration shall consist of two parts. One part is determined by the achievement of certain goals for the Company  while the other part is determined by the achievement of individual goals. The main part of the variable remuneration is linked to the Company's financial targets  while the individual part constitutes a smaller share of the same. Goals for the CEO are proposed by the Remuneration Committee and decided by the Board  while goals for other senior executives are proposed by the CEO and decided by the Remuneration Committee. Goals are decided during the first quarter of each financial year and the fulfillment of goals is measured and payment is made as soon as possible after the annual general meeting has approved the annual report for the year of earnings. The variable remuneration can amount to a maximum of 30 percent of the fixed basic salary for the CEO and CFO and 20 percent of the fixed basic salary for other senior executives. The current employment agreement runs during the notice period. If severance pay were to be paid  no variable compensation is paid for the period after the end of the notice period. The variable remuneration must be pensionable. Long-term incentives Senior executives may be offered incentive programs which are mainly to be share or share price related. Share and share price-related incentive programs must be resolved by the general meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines. Item 13: Resolution for the board to resolve on issuances The board of directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting of the shareholders shall resolves to authorize the board of directors until the next annual general meeting  on one or more occasions  with or without preferential rights for the shareholders  to issue shares  convertibles and/or warrants  with the right to subscribe for and convert into shares in the Company  respectively  corresponding to a maximum of 10 percent of the Company's share capital after dilution based on the number of shares in the Company at the time when the authorization is used for the first time  to be paid in cash  through set-off or in kind. The reason for the authorization and deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable raising capital for expansion through acquisitions of companies or assets and for the business of the Company as well as to adapt the Company's capital and/or ownership structure. If issuances are carried out with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  such issue shall be made in accordance with customary market terms. If the board of directors finds it suitable in order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a share issuance as set out above it may be made at a subscription price corresponding to the shares quota value. The board of directors or anyone appointed by the board of directors is given the right to make the adjustments necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution at the Companies Registration Office. Majority requirements A resolution in accordance with item 13 is valid where supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting. Number of shares and votes The total number of shares and votes in the Company as of the date of the notice amounts to 45 511 751. The Company does not own any shares. Other Copies of accounts  auditor statement and proxy form are available at least three weeks in advance of the annual general meeting. The complete proposals and other documents that shall be available in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act  including the complete proposed articles of association  are available at least two weeks in advance of the meeting.

This description does not contain all of the information that you may find useful. The particular terms of the guarantees of debt securities and related agreements will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to those debt securities to be guaranteed.Each of the guarantors will fully and unconditionally guarantee  jointly and severally  the due and punctual payment of principal of and any premium and interest on the debt securities  and the due and punctual payment of any sinking fund payments  when the same shall become due and payable  whether at maturity  by declaration of acceleration  by call for redemption or otherwise.Each guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable guarantor without rendering the guarantee  as it relates to such guarantor  voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws.Interest and Interest RatesGeneralIn the applicable prospectus supplement  we will designate the debt securities of a series as being either debt securities bearing interest at a fixed rate of interest or debt securities bearing interest at a floating rate of interest. Each debt security will begin to accrue interest from the date on which it is originally issued. Interest on each debt security will be payable in arrears on the interest payment dates set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement and as otherwise described below and at maturity or  if earlier  the redemption date described below. Interest will be payable to the holder of record of the debt securities at the close of business on the record date for each interest payment date  which record dates will be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.As used in the indenture  the term “business day” means  with respect to debt securities of a series  any day  other than a Saturday or Sunday  that is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close in the place where the principal of and premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of that series are payable.Fixed Rate Debt SecuritiesIf the debt securities of a series being offered will bear interest at a fixed rate of interest  the debt securities of that series will bear interest at the annual interest rate specified on the cover page of the applicable prospectus supplement. Interest on those debt securities will be payable semi-annually in arrears on the interest payment dates for those debt securities unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. If the maturity date  the redemption date or an interest payment date is not a business day  we will pay principal  premium  if any  the redemption price  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to but excluding the redemption date  on the next succeeding business day  and no interest will accrue from and after the relevant maturity date  redemption date or interest payment date to the date of that payment. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  interest on the fixed rate debt securities will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.Floating Rate Debt SecuritiesIf the debt securities of a series being offered will bear interest at a floating rate of interest  the debt securities of that series will bear interest during each relevant interest period at the rate determined as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. In the applicable prospectus supplement  we will indicate any spread or spread multiplier to be applied in the interest rate formula to determine the interest rate applicable in any interest period.Payment and Transfer or ExchangePrincipal of and premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of each series will be payable  and the debt securities may be exchanged or transferred  at the office or agency maintained by us for that purpose (which initially7will be the corporate trust office of the trustee). Payment of principal of and premium  if any  and interest on a global security registered in the name of or held by The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee will be made in immediately available funds to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered holder of that global security. If any of the debt securities are no longer represented by a global security  payment of interest on certificated debt securities in definitive form may  at our option  be made by check mailed directly to holders at their registered addresses. See “—Book-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global Securities.”A holder may transfer or exchange any certificated debt securities in definitive form at the corporate trust office of the trustee. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of debt securities  but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.We are not required to transfer or exchange any debt security selected for redemption for a period of 15 days before mailing of a notice of redemption of the debt security to be redeemed.The registered holder of debt securities will be treated as the owner of those debt securities for all purposes.All amounts in respect of principal of and premium  if any  or interest on the debt securities paid by us that remain unclaimed two years after that payment was due and payable will be repaid to us  and the holders of those debt securities will thereafter look solely to us for payment.CovenantsThe applicable prospectus supplement will set forth any covenants that will apply to each series of debt securities to be issued.Events of DefaultThe applicable prospectus supplement will set forth any events of default that will apply to each series of debt securities to be issued.Same-Day Settlement and PaymentUnless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement  the debt securities will trade in the same-day funds settlement system of DTC until maturity or until we issue the debt securities in certificated form. DTC will therefore require secondary market trading activity in the debt securities to settle in immediately available funds. We can give no assurance as to the effect  if any  of settlement in immediately available funds on trading activity in the debt securities.Book-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global SecuritiesUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  the debt securities of each series will be issued in the form of one or more global debt securities  in definitive  fully registered form without interest coupons  each of which we refer to as a “global security.” Each global security will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC in New York  New York for the accounts of participants in DTC.Investors may hold their interests in a global security directly through DTC if they are DTC participants  or indirectly through organizations that are DTC participants. Except in the limited circumstances described below  holders of debt securities represented by interests in a global security will not be entitled to receive their debt securities in fully registered certificated form.DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of institutions that have accounts with DTC (“participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants in those securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s8participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s book-entry system is also available to others  such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant  whether directly or indirectly.Ownership of Beneficial InterestsUpon the issuance of each global security  DTC will credit  on its book-entry registration and transfer system  the respective principal amount of the individual beneficial interests represented by the global security to the accounts of participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be limited to participants or persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be shown on  and the transfer of those ownership interests will be effected only through  records maintained by DTC (with respect to participants’ interests) and those participants (with respect to the owners of beneficial interests in the global security other than participants).So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered holder and owner of a global security  DTC or that nominee  as the case may be  will be considered the sole legal owner of the debt security represented by the global security for all purposes under the indenture  the debt securities and applicable law. Except as set forth below  owners of beneficial interests in a global security will not be entitled to receive certificated debt securities and will not be considered to be the owners or holders of any debt securities represented by the global security. We understand that under existing industry practice  in the event an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any actions that DTC  as the holder of the global security  is entitled to take  DTC would authorize the participants to take that action  and that participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through those participants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. No beneficial owner of an interest in a global security will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures  in addition to those provided for under the indenture. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants  who in turn act on behalf of others  the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a global security to pledge that interest to persons that do not participate in the DTC system  or otherwise to take actions in respect of that interest  may be impaired by the lack of a physical certificate representing that interest.All payments on the debt securities represented by a global security registered in the name of and held by DTC or its nominee will be made to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered owner and holder of the global security.We expect that DTC or its nominee  upon receipt of any payment of principal or premium  if any  or interest in respect of a global security  will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global security as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the global security held through those participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is now the case with securities held for accounts for customers registered in the names of nominees for those customers. These payments  however  will be the responsibility of those participants and indirect participants  and none of we  the trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to  or payments made on account of  beneficial ownership interests in any global security or for maintaining  supervising or reviewing any records relating to those beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and its participants or the relationship between those participants and the owners of beneficial interests in a global security.Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for certificated debt securities  each global security may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds.We expect that DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of debt securities only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in a global security are credited and only in respect of that portion of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities as to which that participant or participants has or have given that direction. However  if there is an event of default under the debt securities  DTC will exchange each global security for certificated debt securities  which it will distribute to its participants.9Although we expect that DTC will agree to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in each global security among participants of DTC  DTC is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures  and those procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance or nonperformance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.The indenture provides that the global securities will be exchanged for debt securities in certificated form of like tenor and of an equal principal amount  in authorized denominations in the following limited circumstances:(1) DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository or if DTC ceases to be eligible under the indenture and we do not appoint a successor depository within 90 days;(2) we determine that the debt securities will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver to the trustee an order to that effect; or(3) an event of default with respect to the debt securities has occurred and is continuing.These certificated debt securities will be registered in the name or names as DTC instructs the trustee. It is expected that those instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in global securities.The information in this section of this prospectus concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable.Euroclear and ClearstreamIf the depositary for a global security is DTC  you may hold interests in the global security through Clearstream Banking  société anonyme  which we refer to as “Clearstream ” or Euroclear Bank SA/ NV  as operator of the Euroclear System  which we refer to as “Euroclear ” in each case  as a participant in DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests  in each case  on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in the names of Euroclear and Clearstream on the books of their respective depositaries  which in turn will hold those interests in customers’ securities in the depositaries’ names on DTC’s books.Payments  deliveries  transfers  exchanges  notices and other matters relating to the debt securities made through Euroclear or Clearstream must comply with the rules and procedures of those systems. Those systems could change their rules and procedures at any time. We have no control over those systems or their participants  and we take no responsibility for their activities. Transactions between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream  on one hand  and other participants in DTC  on the other hand  would also be subject to DTC’s rules and procedures.Investors will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and Clearstream payments  deliveries  transfers  exchanges  notices and other transactions involving any securities held through those systems only on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks  brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.In addition  because of time-zone differences  U.S. investors who hold their interests in the debt securities through these systems and wish on a particular day  to transfer their interests  or to receive or make a payment or delivery or exercise any other right with respect to their interests  may find that the transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels  as applicable. Thus  investors who wish to exercise rights that expire on a particular day may need to act before the expiration date. In addition  investors who hold their interests through both DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream may need to make special arrangements to finance any purchase or sales of their interests between the U.S. and European clearing systems  and those transactions may settle later than transactions within one clearing system.Governing LawThe indenture and the debt securities will be governed by  and construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York.10Regarding the TrusteeWilmington Trust  National Association is the trustee under the indenture.

For more information  you should review the relevant form of deposit agreement and relevant form of depositary receipts  which are or will be filed with the SEC.GeneralWe may elect to have shares represented by depositary shares. The shares underlying the depositary shares will be deposited under a separate deposit agreement between us and a bank or trust company we select. The prospectus supplement relating to a series of depositary shares will set forth the name and address of this share depositary. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement  each owner of a depositary share will be entitled  proportionately  to all the rights  preferences and privileges of the share represented by such depositary share (including dividend  voting  redemption  conversion  exchange and liquidation rights).The depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts issued pursuant to the deposit agreement  each of which will represent the applicable interest in a number of shares  or fraction thereof  as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.A holder of depositary shares will be entitled to receive the shares (but only in whole shares) underlying those depositary shares. If the depositary receipts delivered by the holder evidence a number of depositary shares in excess of the whole number of shares to be withdrawn  the depositary will deliver to that holder at the same time a new depositary receipt for the excess number of depositary shares.Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  the depositary agreement  the depositary shares and the depositary receipts will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York.Dividends and Other DistributionsThe share depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions in respect of the shares to the record holders of depositary receipts in proportion  insofar as possible  to the number of depositary shares owned by those holders.If there is a distribution other than in cash in respect of the shares  the share depositary will distribute property received by it to the record holders of depositary receipts in proportion  insofar as possible  to the number of depositary shares owned by those holders  unless the share depositary determines that it is not feasible to make such a distribution. In that case  the share depositary may  with our approval  adopt any method that it deems equitable and practicable to effect the distribution  including a public or private sale of the property and distribution of the net proceeds from the sale to the holders.The amount distributed in any of the above cases will be reduced by any amount we or the share depositary are required to withhold on account of taxes.Conversion and ExchangeIf any share underlying the depositary shares is subject to provisions relating to its conversion or exchange as set forth in an applicable prospectus supplement  each record holder of depositary shares will have the right or obligation to convert or exchange those depositary shares pursuant to those provisions.Redemption of Depositary SharesWhenever we redeem a share held by the share depositary  the share depositary will redeem as of the same redemption date a proportionate number of depositary shares representing the shares that were redeemed. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to the aggregate redemption price payable with respect to the15number of shares underlying the depositary shares. If fewer than all the depositary shares are to be redeemed  the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by lot or proportionately as we may determine.After the date fixed for redemption  the depositary shares called for redemption will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of the depositary shares will cease  except the right to receive the redemption price.VotingUpon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of any shares underlying the depositary shares are entitled to vote  the share depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary receipts.

ExhibitsSee the attached Exhibit Index  which is incorporated herein by reference.Item 17. UndertakingsThe undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:(a) (1) To file  during any period in which offers or sales are being made  a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:(i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which  individually or in the aggregate  represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing  any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if  in the aggregate  the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and(iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;provided  however  that paragraphs (i)  (ii) and (iii) do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement  or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.(2) That  for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933  each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein  and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.(4) That  for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:(i) Each prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and(ii) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2)  (b)(5) or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i)  (vii) or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B  for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter  such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which the prospectus relates  and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.II-2Provided  however  that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will  as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date  supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.(5) That  for the purpose of determining liability of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities  the undersigned Registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned Registrant pursuant to this registration statement  regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser  if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications  the undersigned Registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned Registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned Registrant;(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned Registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant; and(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned Registrant to the purchaser.(b) That  for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933  each filing of the Registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and  where applicable  each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein  and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.(c) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the trustee to act under subsection (a) of Section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the “Trust Indenture Act”) in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission under Section 305(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act.Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors  officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions  or otherwise  the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is  therefore  unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director  officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action  suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director  officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered  the Registrant will  unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent  submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.II-3EXHIBIT INDEX** To be filed by amendment or as an exhibit to a document to be incorporated by reference herein in connection with an offering of securities.II-4SIGNATURESPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933  the Registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing on Form S-3 and has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned  thereunto duly authorized  in the State of Delaware  on the 23rd day of May  2022.Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.

FREELINE THERAPEUTICS HOLDINGS PLC - NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2 Letter from the Chairman of Freeline Therapeutics Holdings plc (Registered and incorporated in England and Wales with Company number 12546479) Registered Office: Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst  Gunnels Wood Road  Stevenage  SG1 2FX United Kingdom 23 May 2022 Directors Amit C. Nathwani Chris Hollowood Colin A. Love Jeffrey A. Chodakewitz Julia P. Gregory Martin Andrews Michael J. Parini Dear Shareholder  Notice of 2022 Annual General Meeting 1. Introduction The purpose of this document is to provide you with details of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (the ""AGM"") of the Company to be held on 28 June 2022 at 2 p.m. (London time) and convened by the formal Notice of AGM set out on pages 7 to 13 of this document. In addition to highlighting the usual business to be transacted at the AGM  this letter explains the background to the resolutions which will be considered at the AGM  why the Directors consider the resolutions to be in the best interests of shareholders of the Company as a whole and why they recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions. It also contains important information about the arrangements for the administration of the AGM. 3. Attendance and voting While it is currently anticipated that there will be no U.K. government restrictions on public gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of the AGM  the health and safety of our shareholders and colleagues is our priority. Shareholders should carefully consider whether or not it is appropriate to attend the AGM and are invited to attend and participate in the AGM online or to appoint the Chairman as their proxy in advance of the AGM to vote on their behalf. Attendees in person will be required to provide a health affirmation and proof of full vaccination or a negative test taken within 48 hours of arrival in order to gain access to the venue and are encouraged to wear face masks at all times while in the venue. Shareholders are asked not to attend the AGM if they have recently tested positive for COVID-19  are displaying any symptoms of COVID-19 or have recently been in contact with anyone who has tested positive. FREELINE THERAPEUTICS HOLDINGS PLC - NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 3 The Company has made arrangements for you to be able to participate online. Details of the online arrangements  including how to join the AGM  vote and ask questions during the meeting  are set out in the notes on pages 9 to 13 and the guide on page 14 of this document. On behalf of the Board  I hope that you will be able to join us either in person or virtually on 28 June 2022. We continue to monitor the evolving pandemic situation and the potential impact on the AGM. Any material changes to the AGM arrangements will be posted on our website (www.freeline.life/investors) and I encourage shareholders to check regularly for updates. I encourage all shareholders to exercise their right to vote on the resolutions being put to the AGM in advance of the meeting by submitting a proxy vote  either by completing and returning the Form of Proxy posted to shareholders or by providing voting instructions electronically through www.investorcentre.co.uk/eproxy. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy via the CREST electronic proxy appointment services should refer to the notes on pages 9 to 13. As the pandemic situation and associated U.K. government guidance remain changeable  shareholders voting in advance of the meeting are encouraged to appoint the Chairman of the AGM as their proxy  rather than any named person  to ensure they can exercise their vote and be represented at the AGM. Further details on how to register a proxy vote are set out on the notes on pages 9 to 13. All resolutions will be voted on by way of a poll and will reflect all proxy instructions duly received. 3. Resolutions The business to be conducted at the AGM consists of consideration of the following resolutions. Resolutions 1 to 12 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions. This means that for each of those resolutions to be passed  more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution. Resolution 13 will be proposed as a special resolution. This means that for resolution 13 to be passed  at least three-quarters of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution. Resolution 1 - Annual Report and Accounts The Directors are obliged to present the annual financial statements  the strategic report  the directors' report and the independent auditor's report (the ""U.K. Annual Report and Accounts"") to shareholders at the AGM. Resolution 2 - Directors' Remuneration Report In accordance with the U.K. Companies Act 2006  we are required to seek an annual non-binding advisory vote from our shareholders to approve the Directors' Remuneration Report and we are therefore seeking shareholders' approval  on an advisory basis  of the Directors' Remuneration Report. The approval sought does not include the U.K. Directors' Remuneration Policy  which was approved by shareholders by way of binding vote at the Company's AGM on 28 June 2021 and remains valid for a period of three financial years without the need for new shareholder approval  unless changes are proposed. The report sets out the remuneration that has been paid to each person who has served as a Director at any time during the financial year ended 31 December 2021. We encourage shareholders to read the U.K. Directors' Remuneration Report  which can be found in our U.K. Annual Report and Accounts. FREELINE THERAPEUTICS HOLDINGS PLC - NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 4 As this vote is advisory and not binding on our Board of Directors or our remuneration committee  a vote against this proposal will not overrule any decisions made by our Board of Directors or our remuneration committee  or require our Board of Directors or our remuneration committee to take any action with respect to the remuneration decisions set out therein. However  our remuneration committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future compensation decisions. Resolutions 3 and 4 - Appointment and remuneration of Deloitte LLP The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general meeting at which accounts are presented to shareholders to hold office until the next such meeting. Resolution 3 proposes the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditors of the Company. Resolution 4 authorises the Directors to determine Deloitte LLP's remuneration. You are asked to authorise the Directors to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as auditors and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration. Deloitte LLP have indicated that they are willing to continue to act as the Company's auditors for a further year. Resolutions 5 to 11 (inclusive) - Re-appointment and appointment of Directors In accordance with the Company's Articles of Association  each of the Directors who has held office since last year's AGM will retire and stand for re-appointment. Resolutions 5 to 10 (inclusive) propose their re-appointment by the Company's shareholders. Michael J. Parini is standing for appointment as a Director by the Company's shareholders for the first time  having been appointed by the Board on 15 August 2021. Resolution 11 proposes his appointment by the Company's shareholders. Biographical details of each of the Directors can be found on the Company's Investor Relations website (www.freeline.life/investors) to enable shareholders to take an informed decision on their re-appointment or appointment. Each of the Directors are recommended by the Board for re-appointment or appointment. Resolution 12 - Authority to allot shares Pursuant to the U.K. Companies Act 2006  the Directors may only allot shares or other equity securities in the Company (or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares) if authorised to do so by the Company's shareholders. Accordingly  resolution 12 seeks shareholder approval to renew the Directors' authority to allot shares or other equity securities (or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares) in the Company with an aggregate nominal amount of up to £4 000. If resolution 12 is passed  the authority sought will expire on 27 June 2027  being not more than five years from the date of the AGM  and will replace any existing authority. The Directors consider it appropriate to maintain the flexibility that this authority provides in order to manage the Company's capital resources  respond to market developments and enable allotments to take place as the business need arises. Resolution 13 - Disapplication of pre-emption rights If the Directors wish to allot new shares or other equity securities for cash (other than in connection with an employee share scheme)  the U.K. Companies Act 2006 requires that these shares are offered first to the Company's shareholders  in proportion to their existing holdings. There may be occasions  however  where the Directors need the flexibility to issue shares without a pre-emptive offer to existing shareholders in order to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. FREELINE THERAPEUTICS HOLDINGS PLC - NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 5 Accordingly  resolution 13 seeks shareholder approval for the Directors to allot shares or other equity securities in the Company for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of £4 000  without the shares first being offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. If resolution 13 is passed  the authority sought will expire on 27 June 2027  being not more than five years from the date of the AGM. Resolution 13 will be proposed as a special resolution 4. Action to be taken You will find a Form of Proxy enclosed with this document for use in connection with the AGM. Whether or not you intend to be present at the AGM  you are requested to complete and return the Form of Proxy in accordance with the instructions printed thereon as soon as possible. To be valid  forms of proxy must be completed and received by the Company's registrars  Computershare Investor Services PLC  at the Pavilions  Bridgwater Road  Bristol  BS99 6ZY  United Kingdom not later than 2 p.m. (London time) on 24 June 2022  being 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the AGM (without taking account of any part of a day that is not a working day) or completed electronically in accordance with the notes to this document. Completion of the Form of Proxy will not preclude you from attending the AGM and voting in person if you so wish. 5. Recommendation The Directors consider that the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and are likely to promote the success of the Company. The Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of the proposed resolutions as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.

Details of how to appoint the Chairman of the AGM or another person as your proxy using the Form of Proxy are set out in the notes to the Form of Proxy. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the AGM you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to them. 9.

Nominated persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered shareholder who holds the shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively  if nominated persons do not have such a right  or do not wish to exercise it  they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.

The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy  must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the Company's agent  Computershare Investor Services PLC (ID: 3RA50)  by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments specified in these notes. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. 19. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST proxy instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this regard  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. 20. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST proxy instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. Appointment of proxy by joint holders 21. In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in FREELINE THERAPEUTICS HOLDINGS PLC - NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 11 which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).

Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy Form of Proxy and would like to change the instructions using another hard-copy Form of Proxy  please contact Computershare Investor Services PLC to request a form. 24. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment  the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will supersede all previous instructions.

This description does not contain all of the information that you may find useful. The particular terms of the guarantees of debt securities and related agreements will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to those debt securities to be guaranteed.Each of the guarantors will fully and unconditionally guarantee  jointly and severally  the due and punctual payment of principal of and any premium and interest on the debt securities  and the due and punctual payment of any sinking fund payments  when the same shall become due and payable  whether at maturity  by declaration of acceleration  by call for redemption or otherwise.Each guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable guarantor without rendering the guarantee  as it relates to such guarantor  voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws.Interest and Interest RatesGeneralIn the applicable prospectus supplement  we will designate the debt securities of a series as being either debt securities bearing interest at a fixed rate of interest or debt securities bearing interest at a floating rate of interest. Each debt security will begin to accrue interest from the date on which it is originally issued. Interest on each debt security will be payable in arrears on the interest payment dates set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement and as otherwise described below and at maturity or  if earlier  the redemption date described below. Interest will be payable to the holder of record of the debt securities at the close of business on the record date for each interest payment date  which record dates will be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.As used in the indenture  the term “business day” means  with respect to debt securities of a series  any day  other than a Saturday or Sunday  that is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close in the place where the principal of and premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of that series are payable.Fixed Rate Debt SecuritiesIf the debt securities of a series being offered will bear interest at a fixed rate of interest  the debt securities of that series will bear interest at the annual interest rate specified on the cover page of the applicable prospectus supplement. Interest on those debt securities will be payable semi-annually in arrears on the interest payment dates for those debt securities unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. If the maturity date  the redemption date or an interest payment date is not a business day  we will pay principal  premium  if any  the redemption price  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to but excluding the redemption date  on the next succeeding business day  and no interest will accrue from and after the relevant maturity date  redemption date or interest payment date to the date of that payment. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  interest on the fixed rate debt securities will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.Floating Rate Debt SecuritiesIf the debt securities of a series being offered will bear interest at a floating rate of interest  the debt securities of that series will bear interest during each relevant interest period at the rate determined as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. In the applicable prospectus supplement  we will indicate any spread or spread multiplier to be applied in the interest rate formula to determine the interest rate applicable in any interest period.Payment and Transfer or ExchangePrincipal of and premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of each series will be payable  and the debt securities may be exchanged or transferred  at the office or agency maintained by us for that purpose (which initially7will be the corporate trust office of the trustee). Payment of principal of and premium  if any  and interest on a global security registered in the name of or held by The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee will be made in immediately available funds to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered holder of that global security. If any of the debt securities are no longer represented by a global security  payment of interest on certificated debt securities in definitive form may  at our option  be made by check mailed directly to holders at their registered addresses. See “—Book-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global Securities.”A holder may transfer or exchange any certificated debt securities in definitive form at the corporate trust office of the trustee. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of debt securities  but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.We are not required to transfer or exchange any debt security selected for redemption for a period of 15 days before mailing of a notice of redemption of the debt security to be redeemed.The registered holder of debt securities will be treated as the owner of those debt securities for all purposes.All amounts in respect of principal of and premium  if any  or interest on the debt securities paid by us that remain unclaimed two years after that payment was due and payable will be repaid to us  and the holders of those debt securities will thereafter look solely to us for payment.CovenantsThe applicable prospectus supplement will set forth any covenants that will apply to each series of debt securities to be issued.Events of DefaultThe applicable prospectus supplement will set forth any events of default that will apply to each series of debt securities to be issued.Same-Day Settlement and PaymentUnless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement  the debt securities will trade in the same-day funds settlement system of DTC until maturity or until we issue the debt securities in certificated form. DTC will therefore require secondary market trading activity in the debt securities to settle in immediately available funds. We can give no assurance as to the effect  if any  of settlement in immediately available funds on trading activity in the debt securities.Book-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global SecuritiesUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  the debt securities of each series will be issued in the form of one or more global debt securities  in definitive  fully registered form without interest coupons  each of which we refer to as a “global security.” Each global security will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC in New York  New York for the accounts of participants in DTC.Investors may hold their interests in a global security directly through DTC if they are DTC participants  or indirectly through organizations that are DTC participants. Except in the limited circumstances described below  holders of debt securities represented by interests in a global security will not be entitled to receive their debt securities in fully registered certificated form.DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of institutions that have accounts with DTC (“participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants in those securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s8participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s book-entry system is also available to others  such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant  whether directly or indirectly.Ownership of Beneficial InterestsUpon the issuance of each global security  DTC will credit  on its book-entry registration and transfer system  the respective principal amount of the individual beneficial interests represented by the global security to the accounts of participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be limited to participants or persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be shown on  and the transfer of those ownership interests will be effected only through  records maintained by DTC (with respect to participants’ interests) and those participants (with respect to the owners of beneficial interests in the global security other than participants).So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered holder and owner of a global security  DTC or that nominee  as the case may be  will be considered the sole legal owner of the debt security represented by the global security for all purposes under the indenture  the debt securities and applicable law. Except as set forth below  owners of beneficial interests in a global security will not be entitled to receive certificated debt securities and will not be considered to be the owners or holders of any debt securities represented by the global security. We understand that under existing industry practice  in the event an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any actions that DTC  as the holder of the global security  is entitled to take  DTC would authorize the participants to take that action  and that participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through those participants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. No beneficial owner of an interest in a global security will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s applicable procedures  in addition to those provided for under the indenture. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants  who in turn act on behalf of others  the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a global security to pledge that interest to persons that do not participate in the DTC system  or otherwise to take actions in respect of that interest  may be impaired by the lack of a physical certificate representing that interest.All payments on the debt securities represented by a global security registered in the name of and held by DTC or its nominee will be made to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered owner and holder of the global security.We expect that DTC or its nominee  upon receipt of any payment of principal or premium  if any  or interest in respect of a global security  will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global security as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the global security held through those participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is now the case with securities held for accounts for customers registered in the names of nominees for those customers. These payments  however  will be the responsibility of those participants and indirect participants  and none of we  the trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to  or payments made on account of  beneficial ownership interests in any global security or for maintaining  supervising or reviewing any records relating to those beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and its participants or the relationship between those participants and the owners of beneficial interests in a global security.Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for certificated debt securities  each global security may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds.We expect that DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of debt securities only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in a global security are credited and only in respect of that portion of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities as to which that participant or participants has or have given that direction. However  if there is an event of default under the debt securities  DTC will exchange each global security for certificated debt securities  which it will distribute to its participants.9Although we expect that DTC will agree to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in each global security among participants of DTC  DTC is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures  and those procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance or nonperformance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.The indenture provides that the global securities will be exchanged for debt securities in certificated form of like tenor and of an equal principal amount  in authorized denominations in the following limited circumstances:(1) DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository or if DTC ceases to be eligible under the indenture and we do not appoint a successor depository within 90 days;(2) we determine that the debt securities will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver to the trustee an order to that effect; or(3) an event of default with respect to the debt securities has occurred and is continuing.These certificated debt securities will be registered in the name or names as DTC instructs the trustee. It is expected that those instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in global securities.The information in this section of this prospectus concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable.Euroclear and ClearstreamIf the depositary for a global security is DTC  you may hold interests in the global security through Clearstream Banking  société anonyme  which we refer to as “Clearstream ” or Euroclear Bank SA/ NV  as operator of the Euroclear System  which we refer to as “Euroclear ” in each case  as a participant in DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests  in each case  on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in the names of Euroclear and Clearstream on the books of their respective depositaries  which in turn will hold those interests in customers’ securities in the depositaries’ names on DTC’s books.Payments  deliveries  transfers  exchanges  notices and other matters relating to the debt securities made through Euroclear or Clearstream must comply with the rules and procedures of those systems. Those systems could change their rules and procedures at any time. We have no control over those systems or their participants  and we take no responsibility for their activities. Transactions between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream  on one hand  and other participants in DTC  on the other hand  would also be subject to DTC’s rules and procedures.Investors will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and Clearstream payments  deliveries  transfers  exchanges  notices and other transactions involving any securities held through those systems only on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks  brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.In addition  because of time-zone differences  U.S. investors who hold their interests in the debt securities through these systems and wish on a particular day  to transfer their interests  or to receive or make a payment or delivery or exercise any other right with respect to their interests  may find that the transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels  as applicable. Thus  investors who wish to exercise rights that expire on a particular day may need to act before the expiration date. In addition  investors who hold their interests through both DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream may need to make special arrangements to finance any purchase or sales of their interests between the U.S. and European clearing systems  and those transactions may settle later than transactions within one clearing system.Governing LawThe indenture and the debt securities will be governed by  and construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York.10Regarding the TrusteeWilmington Trust  National Association is the trustee under the indenture.

For more information  you should review the relevant form of deposit agreement and relevant form of depositary receipts  which are or will be filed with the SEC.GeneralWe may elect to have shares represented by depositary shares. The shares underlying the depositary shares will be deposited under a separate deposit agreement between us and a bank or trust company we select. The prospectus supplement relating to a series of depositary shares will set forth the name and address of this share depositary. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement  each owner of a depositary share will be entitled  proportionately  to all the rights  preferences and privileges of the share represented by such depositary share (including dividend  voting  redemption  conversion  exchange and liquidation rights).The depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts issued pursuant to the deposit agreement  each of which will represent the applicable interest in a number of shares  or fraction thereof  as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.A holder of depositary shares will be entitled to receive the shares (but only in whole shares) underlying those depositary shares. If the depositary receipts delivered by the holder evidence a number of depositary shares in excess of the whole number of shares to be withdrawn  the depositary will deliver to that holder at the same time a new depositary receipt for the excess number of depositary shares.Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  the depositary agreement  the depositary shares and the depositary receipts will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York.Dividends and Other DistributionsThe share depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions in respect of the shares to the record holders of depositary receipts in proportion  insofar as possible  to the number of depositary shares owned by those holders.If there is a distribution other than in cash in respect of the shares  the share depositary will distribute property received by it to the record holders of depositary receipts in proportion  insofar as possible  to the number of depositary shares owned by those holders  unless the share depositary determines that it is not feasible to make such a distribution. In that case  the share depositary may  with our approval  adopt any method that it deems equitable and practicable to effect the distribution  including a public or private sale of the property and distribution of the net proceeds from the sale to the holders.The amount distributed in any of the above cases will be reduced by any amount we or the share depositary are required to withhold on account of taxes.Conversion and ExchangeIf any share underlying the depositary shares is subject to provisions relating to its conversion or exchange as set forth in an applicable prospectus supplement  each record holder of depositary shares will have the right or obligation to convert or exchange those depositary shares pursuant to those provisions.Redemption of Depositary SharesWhenever we redeem a share held by the share depositary  the share depositary will redeem as of the same redemption date a proportionate number of depositary shares representing the shares that were redeemed. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to the aggregate redemption price payable with respect to the15number of shares underlying the depositary shares. If fewer than all the depositary shares are to be redeemed  the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by lot or proportionately as we may determine.After the date fixed for redemption  the depositary shares called for redemption will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of the depositary shares will cease  except the right to receive the redemption price.VotingUpon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of any shares underlying the depositary shares are entitled to vote  the share depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary receipts.

The share depositary will try to vote the number of shares underlying the depositary shares in accordance with the instructions  and we will agree to take all reasonable action which the share depositary deems necessary to enable the share depositary to do so.

Notwithstanding the foregoing  any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if  in the aggregate  the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and(iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;provided  however  that paragraphs (i)  (ii) and (iii) do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement  or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.(2) That  for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933  each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein  and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.(4) That  for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:(i) Each prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and(ii) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2)  (b)(5) or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i)  (vii) or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B  for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter  such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which the prospectus relates  and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.II-2Provided  however  that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will  as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date  supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.(5) That  for the purpose of determining liability of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities  the undersigned Registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned Registrant pursuant to this registration statement  regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser  if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications  the undersigned Registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned Registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned Registrant;(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned Registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant; and(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned Registrant to the purchaser.(b) That  for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933  each filing of the Registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and  where applicable  each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein  and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.(c) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the trustee to act under subsection (a) of Section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the “Trust Indenture Act”) in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission under Section 305(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act.Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors  officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions  or otherwise  the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is  therefore  unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director  officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action  suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director  officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered  the Registrant will  unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent  submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.II-3EXHIBIT INDEX** To be filed by amendment or as an exhibit to a document to be incorporated by reference herein in connection with an offering of securities.II-4SIGNATURESPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933  the Registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing on Form S-3 and has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned  thereunto duly authorized  in the State of Delaware  on the 23rd day of May  2022.Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.

Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements 2021,Amsterdam  23 May 2022 – Azerion has published the annual report and audited financial results for the full year 2021 of Azerion Holding B.V. (Annual Report)...,Amsterdam  23 May 2022 – Azerion has published the annual report and audited financial results for the full year 2021 of Azerion Holding B.V. (Annual Report). The Annual Report can be found at azerion.com/investorsCo-CEO Atilla Aytekin said: “Publishing our Annual Report is an important milestone for Azerion  following our listing at Euronext Amsterdam earlier in 2022. We look forward to continuing the engagements with the capital markets on the back of our Annual Report and our first quarter 2022 results announcement  planned for the end of May.”The Annual Report includes updated financial statements as compared to the preliminary unaudited financial results full year 2021 published on 28 February 2022. The updates to the figures are mainly associated with acquisition accounting  following the completion of the acquisition audits  as well as the accounting treatment of the business combination with European FinTech IPO Company 1 (EFIC1) that was completed on 1 February 2022  tax and the refinancing of the Company’s bonds in 2021.In the income statement  operating profit was lower by approximately EUR 9.2 million as compared to the preliminary results 2021  while EBITDA increased by some EUR 1.8 million  mainly driven by higher depreciation and amortisation  as well as lower gains from currency translation effects. As a result  the loss after tax for the year was higher by approximately EUR 9.1 million  as compared to the preliminary results 2021.The balance sheet’s assets increased by approximately EUR 15.8 million  mainly related to the completion of purchase price allocation of acquisitions. In addition  there was a reclassification of EUR 8.8 million associated with share appreciation rights related to acquisitions  from equity to other liabilities.The cash flow statement was updated with reclassifications totalling some EUR 8.2 million comprising the pay-out of contingent consideration from cash flow from operating activities to cash flow from investing activities and the repayment of borrowings to former owners of acquired companies from cash flow from financing activities to cash flow from investing activities. In addition  there was a reclassification of approximately EUR 10.5 million associated with costs of early settlement of bonds from cash flow from operating activities to cash flow from financing activities.Story continuesThe annual report and full year results of Azerion Holding B.V. cover the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 and therefore relate to a period prior to the completion of the business combination between EFIC1 and Azerion Holding B.V. on 1 February 2022. The annual report and full year results 2021 for Azerion Holding B.V. do therefore not comprise any accounts or results of Azerion Group N.V. for 2021.

Results show that bimekizumab addressed the debilitating joint symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis  while also providing high levels of skin clearance compared to placebo "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB. ""Importantly  the consistent findings seen across populations suggest that bimekizumab can provide a similar clinical response in patients that have an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF inhibitors  and in patients that are new to biologics.""""Today's findings from the BE OPTIMAL and BE COMPLETE studies provide clear evidence supporting the potential of bimekizumab  a dual IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor  in the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis. This painful  chronic condition can greatly impact patients' lives. Achieving minimal disease activity is an important goal of treatment  that can ultimately lead to improved quality of life for people with psoriatic arthritis "" said Joseph F. Merola  MD  MMSc  Associate Professor  Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.Data from BE COMPLETE (16-week analysis) and BE OPTIMAL (24-week interim analysis)Joint Symptoms: In both studies  patients treated with bimekizumab (160 mg every four weeks [Q4W]) achieved statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint of at least 50 percent or greater improvement from baseline in the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR50) at week 16  compared with placebo.1 2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  43.9 percent (n=189/431) of biologic naïve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 versus 10.0 percent (n=28/281) of patients on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  43.4 percent (n=116/267) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 versus 6.8 percent (n=9/133) of patients on placebo; p<0.001.2Skin Symptoms: In both studies  patients treated with bimekizumab achieved statistically significant improvements in levels of skin clearance  as measured by the ranked secondary endpoint of at least a 90 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI90) at week 16  compared with placebo.1.2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  61.3 percent (n=133/217) of biologic naïve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved PASI90 versus 2.9 percent (n=4/140) on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  68.8 percent (n=121/176) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved PASI90 versus 6.8 percent (n=6/88) on placebo; p<0.001.2Minimal Disease Activity: In both studies  a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved the ranked secondary endpoint of Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) response  compared with placebo at week 16.1 2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  45.0 percent (n=194/431) of biologic-naïve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA versus 13.2 (n=37/281) percent on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  44.2 percent (n=118/267) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA versus 6.0 percent (n=8/133) on placebo; p<0.001.2""In the BE OPTIMAL and BE COMPLETE studies  bimekizumab demonstrated clinically relevant improvements in musculoskeletal and skin outcomes for people with psoriatic arthritis compared with placebo. In addition  results from the BE OPTIMAL study show that treatment with bimekizumab was associated with inhibition of structural joint damage progression by week 16 "" said Iain McInnes  Professor  Vice Principal and Head of College  University of Glasgow  Scotland.Additional OutcomesIn BE OPTIMAL  treatment with bimekizumab compared with placebo was associated with a statistically significant inhibition of progression of structural joint damage at week 16  as measured by mean change from baseline in the van der Heijde modified Total Sharp Score (vdHmTSS)  a ranked secondary endpoint. 1The clinical response in both studies was rapid  with separation from placebo observed from week two in BE OPTIMAL (ACR20; p<0.001  nominal  not controlled for multiplicity) and week four in BE COMPLETE (ACR50; p<0.001  nominal  not controlled for multiplicity). 1 2In BE OPTIMAL  response rates continued to improve to week 24: 45.5 percent (n=196/431) of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 and 35.9 percent (n=101/281) of patients switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved ACR50  following an eight week treatment duration; 72.8 percent (n=158/217) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved PASI90 and 61.4 percent (n=86/140) of patients switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved PASI90; 48.5 percent (n=209/431) of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA and 37.7 percent (n=106/281) switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved MDA. 1An active reference arm of adalimumab was included in the BE OPTIMAL study. The study was not powered for statistical comparisons with the bimekizumab treatment group or placebo. At week 16  45.7 percent (n=64/140)  41.2 percent (n=28/68) and 45.0 percent (n=63/140) of patients treated with adalimumab achieved ACR50  PASI90 and MDA  respectively.1In BE OPTIMAL  over 16 weeks  59.9 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab had ≥ one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) versus 49.5 percent of patients on placebo and 59.3 percent on adalimumab.1 The three most frequent TEAEs (≥5 percent in any treatment arm) were nasopharyngitis (9.3 percent for bimekizumab; 4.6 percent for placebo and 5.0 percent for adalimumab)  upper respiratory tract infection (4.9 percent for bimekizumab; 6.4 percent for placebo and 2.1 percent for adalimumab) and increased alanine aminotransferase (0.7 percent for bimekizumab; 0.7 percent for placebo and 5.0 percent for adalimumab).1 Candida infections were reported in 2.6 percent of bimekizumab-treated patients  0.7 percent on placebo and 0 percent on adalimumab.1 The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was low: 1.6 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab versus 1.1 percent on placebo and 1.4 percent on adalimumab.1 No cases of systemic candidiasis  inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or uveitis were reported.1In BE COMPLETE  over 16 weeks  40.1 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab had ≥ one TEAE versus 33.3 percent of patients on placebo.2 The three most frequent TEAEs for patients treated with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis (3.7 percent; 0.8 percent for placebo)  oral candidiasis (2.6 percent; 0.0 percent for placebo)  and upper respiratory tract infection (2.2 percent; 1.5 percent for placebo).2 Two patients on bimekizumab discontinued treatment due to a TEAE (0.7 percent). The incidence of SAEs was low: 1.9 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab versus 0 percent on placebo  and none led to discontinuation.2 No cases of systemic candidiasis  IBD  MACE  venous thromboembolism (VTE)  or uveitis were reported.2About BE OPTIMALBE OPTIMAL is a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  active reference (adalimumab)  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis  who are biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug naïve.3 The study is ongoing with 24-week interim analysis presented above.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

Bimekizumab is not approved for use in nr-axSpA or AS by any regulatory authority worldwide. The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in nr-axSpA and AS have not been established.""We are pleased to share the first detailed data from our Phase 3 clinical program of bimekizumab in non-radiographic axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis  which showcase the clinical potential of bimekizumab to improve patient outcomes across the full spectrum of this debilitating disease "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB. ""People with axSpA often live with the condition for many years before diagnosis  with limited options available today to treat non-radiographic axSpA. We are driven to bring differentiated solutions that address unmet needs  and these results are an important step in our mission  setting the foundation for future regulatory discussions.""Story continuesBE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2: Phase 3 Study Results (24 weeks)1 2 In BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2  patients treated with bimekizumab (160 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]) achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the signs and symptoms of axSpA  as defined by the primary endpoint measure of Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) at week 16 compared to placebo.1 2 Response rates increased to week 24  and a rapid achievement of ASAS40 response was seen for patients switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16.1 2BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA): At week 16  47.7 percent (n=61/128) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS40 versus 21.4 percent (n=27/126) with placebo (p<0.001). 1BE MOBILE 2 (AS): At week 16  44.8 percent (n=99/221) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS40 versus 22.5 percent (n=25/111) with placebo (p<0.001).2""Today's findings from the BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 studies provide clear evidence supporting the potential of bimekizumab in both nr-axSpA and AS  and highlight the meaningful clinical outcomes that can be achieved by targeting IL-17F in addition to IL-17A. Patients with nr-axSpA and AS have a similar burden of disease and a treatment that could potentially show consistent outcomes across the full spectrum of disease is encouraging "" said Professor Atul Deodhar  MD  MRCP  Professor of Medicine  Division of Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases  Oregon Health & Science University.In both studies  at week 16  patients treated with bimekizumab achieved statistically significant improvements in all ranked secondary endpoints compared with placebo  including ASAS partial remission (ASAS-PR)  disease activity as measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)  physical function as measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)  and quality of life as measured by Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) questionnaire.1 2BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA):At week 16  25.8 percent (n=33/128) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS-PR versus 7.1 percent (n=9/126) of patients with placebo (p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASDAI (-3.1 bimekizumab versus -1.5 placebo  p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASFI (-2.5 bimekizumab versus -1.0 placebo  p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in ASQoL (-5.2 bimekizumab versus -2.5 placebo  p<0.001).1BE MOBILE 2 (AS):At week 16  24.0 percent (n=53/221) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS-PR versus 7.2 percent (n=8/111) of patients with placebo (p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASDAI (-2.9 bimekizumab versus -1.9 placebo  p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASFI (-2.2 bimekizumab versus -1.1 placebo  p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in ASQoL (-4.9 bimekizumab versus -3.2 placebo  p<0.001).2Other efficacy outcomes assessed in BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 included changes in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) states and changes in inflammation in the sacroiliac joints and spine as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).1 2 At the start of both studies  almost all patients (>97 percent) had high or very high disease activity.1 2 At week 24  in both studies  approximately half of the patients treated with bimekizumab from the start of each study achieved ASDAS low disease activity defined as ASDAS<2.1.1 2 Treatment with bimekizumab also resulted in substantial reductions in inflammation in the sacroiliac joints and spine for both AS and nr-axSpA patients at week 16.1 2Professor Désirée van der Heijde  Professor of Rheumatology  Leiden University Medical Center  Leiden  the Netherlands  said  ""Patients with axSpA live with a range of debilitating symptoms including chronic back pain and difficulties performing everyday tasks. These interim results from the BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 studies are encouraging  showing that treatment with bimekizumab versus placebo improved signs and symptoms  reduced disease activity and inflammation  and improved physical function. We look forward to the 52-week results from these studies expected later this year.""In BE MOBILE 1  the most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) over 16 weeks with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis (9.4 percent)  upper respiratory tract infection (7.0 percent) and oral candidiasis (3.1 percent).1 In BE MOBILE 2  the most common TEAEs over 16 weeks were nasopharyngitis (7.7 percent)  headache (4.1 percent) and oral candidiasis (4.1 percent).2 Up to 16 weeks  the incidence of serious adverse events was low with bimekizumab in both studies (0 percent in BE MOBILE 1 and 1.8 percent in BE MOBILE 2).1 2 In BE MOBILE 1  no cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were reported with patients taking bimekizumab.1 In BE MOBILE 2  two IBD cases (0.9 percent) occurred in patients treated with bimekizumab.2BE AGILE Phase 2b Open-Label Extension: 3 Year Study Results3Post-hoc analyses of the Phase 2b BE AGILE study and its open-label extension showed that treatment with bimekizumab (160 mg Q4W) provided maintenance of clinical responses over three years (156 weeks) in patients with active AS who initially responded at week 12  irrespective of the initial dosing regimen (160 mg Q4W  [N=60] or 320 mg Q4W  [N=61]).3 At week 12  40.3 percent of patients had achieved low disease activity (ASDAS<2.1)  and 89.2 percent of these patients maintained this low level of disease activity at week 156.3 Clinical response as measured by ASAS40 response was also sustained over three years  with 47.1 percent of patients having achieved ASAS40 at week 12  64.9 percent at week 48  and 71.9 percent at week 156.3About BE MOBILE 1BE MOBILE 1 is a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adult patients with active nr-axSpA.1 The study is ongoing with 24-week results presented above.

For additional details  visit BE AGILE 2 on clinicaltrials.gov.7About Axial SpondyloarthritisNon-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) falls under the umbrella of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  which also includes ankylosing spondylitis (AS).8 AxSpA is a painful chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and the joints linking the pelvis and lower spine (sacroiliac joints).8 nr-axSpA is defined clinically by the absence of definitive x-ray evidence of structural damage to the sacroiliac joints.8 The leading symptom of axSpA is inflammatory back pain that improves with exercise  but not with rest.8 Fatigue and stiffness are additional key symptoms. Other common clinical features frequently include acute anterior uveitis (eye inflammation)  enthesitis (inflammation of the points of insertion of tendons and ligaments into bone)  peripheral arthritis  psoriasis  inflammatory bowel disease (chronic inflammation of the digestive tract)  and dactylitis (inflammation of the fingers or toes).8 The overall prevalence of axSpA is 0.2 percent to 1.4 percent of adults in the U.S.9 10 Approximately half of all patients with axSpA are patients with nr-xSpA.8Approximately two-thirds of patients with AS are men  while nr-axSpA is more common among women with the disease.11 AxSpA onset usually occurs before the age of 45  often in the 20s.8 10 to 40 percent of patients with nr-axSpA progress to ankylosing spondylitis over 2 to 10 years.8About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.11 Bimekizumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of active axSpA with 24-week interim analysis results from the BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA) and BE MOBILE 2 (AS) studies to be presented at EULAR 2022.1 2 In addition  bimekizumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis with 24-week interim analysis from the BE OPTIMAL study and 16-week analysis from the BE COMPLETE study to be presented at EULAR 2022.12 13Bimekizumab is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults  and its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comCorporate CommunicationsAlly FunkT +1.678.365.6321email ally.funk@ucb.comBrand CommunicationsEimear O'BrienT +32.2.559.92.71email eimear.obrien@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.ReferencesDeodhar A  van der Heijde D  Gensler LS et al.

Bimekizumab is not approved for use in nr-axSpA or AS by any regulatory authority worldwide. The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in nr-axSpA and AS have not been established.""We are pleased to share the first detailed data from our Phase 3 clinical program of bimekizumab in non-radiographic axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis  which showcase the clinical potential of bimekizumab to improve patient outcomes across the full spectrum of this debilitating disease "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB. ""People with axSpA often live with the condition for many years before diagnosis  with limited options available today to treat non-radiographic axSpA.

BE MOBILE 2 (AS): At week 16  44.8 percent (n=99/221) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS40 versus 22.5 percent (n=25/111) with placebo (p<0.001).2""Today's findings from the BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 studies provide clear evidence supporting the potential of bimekizumab in both nr-axSpA and AS  and highlight the meaningful clinical outcomes that can be achieved by targeting IL-17F in addition to IL-17A. Patients with nr-axSpA and AS have a similar burden of disease and a treatment that could potentially show consistent outcomes across the full spectrum of disease is encouraging "" said Professor Atul Deodhar  MD  MRCP  Professor of Medicine  Division of Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases  Oregon Health & Science University.In both studies  at week 16  patients treated with bimekizumab achieved statistically significant improvements in all ranked secondary endpoints compared with placebo  including ASAS partial remission (ASAS-PR)  disease activity as measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)  physical function as measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)  and quality of life as measured by Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) questionnaire.1 2BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA):At week 16  25.8 percent (n=33/128) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS-PR versus 7.1 percent (n=9/126) of patients with placebo (p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASDAI (-3.1 bimekizumab versus -1.5 placebo  p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASFI (-2.5 bimekizumab versus -1.0 placebo  p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in ASQoL (-5.2 bimekizumab versus -2.5 placebo  p<0.001).1BE MOBILE 2 (AS):At week 16  24.0 percent (n=53/221) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS-PR versus 7.2 percent (n=8/111) of patients with placebo (p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASDAI (-2.9 bimekizumab versus -1.9 placebo  p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASFI (-2.2 bimekizumab versus -1.1 placebo  p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in ASQoL (-4.9 bimekizumab versus -3.2 placebo  p<0.001).2Other efficacy outcomes assessed in BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 included changes in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) states and changes in inflammation in the sacroiliac joints and spine as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).1 2 At the start of both studies  almost all patients (>97 percent) had high or very high disease activity.1 2 At week 24  in both studies  approximately half of the patients treated with bimekizumab from the start of each study achieved ASDAS low disease activity defined as ASDAS<2.1.1 2 Treatment with bimekizumab also resulted in substantial reductions in inflammation in the sacroiliac joints and spine for both AS and nr-axSpA patients at week 16.1 2Professor Désirée van der Heijde  Professor of Rheumatology  Leiden University Medical Center  Leiden  the Netherlands  said  ""Patients with axSpA live with a range of debilitating symptoms including chronic back pain and difficulties performing everyday tasks. These interim results from the BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 studies are encouraging  showing that treatment with bimekizumab versus placebo improved signs and symptoms  reduced disease activity and inflammation  and improved physical function. We look forward to the 52-week results from these studies expected later this year.""In BE MOBILE 1  the most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) over 16 weeks with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis (9.4 percent)  upper respiratory tract infection (7.0 percent) and oral candidiasis (3.1 percent).1 In BE MOBILE 2  the most common TEAEs over 16 weeks were nasopharyngitis (7.7 percent)  headache (4.1 percent) and oral candidiasis (4.1 percent).2 Up to 16 weeks  the incidence of serious adverse events was low with bimekizumab in both studies (0 percent in BE MOBILE 1 and 1.8 percent in BE MOBILE 2).1 2 In BE MOBILE 1  no cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were reported with patients taking bimekizumab.1 In BE MOBILE 2  two IBD cases (0.9 percent) occurred in patients treated with bimekizumab.2BE AGILE Phase 2b Open-Label Extension: 3 Year Study Results3Post-hoc analyses of the Phase 2b BE AGILE study and its open-label extension showed that treatment with bimekizumab (160 mg Q4W) provided maintenance of clinical responses over three years (156 weeks) in patients with active AS who initially responded at week 12  irrespective of the initial dosing regimen (160 mg Q4W  [N=60] or 320 mg Q4W  [N=61]).3 At week 12  40.3 percent of patients had achieved low disease activity (ASDAS<2.1)  and 89.2 percent of these patients maintained this low level of disease activity at week 156.3 Clinical response as measured by ASAS40 response was also sustained over three years  with 47.1 percent of patients having achieved ASAS40 at week 12  64.9 percent at week 48  and 71.9 percent at week 156.3About BE MOBILE 1BE MOBILE 1 is a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adult patients with active nr-axSpA.1 The study is ongoing with 24-week results presented above.

Other common clinical features frequently include acute anterior uveitis (eye inflammation)  enthesitis (inflammation of the points of insertion of tendons and ligaments into bone)  peripheral arthritis  psoriasis  inflammatory bowel disease (chronic inflammation of the digestive tract)  and dactylitis (inflammation of the fingers or toes).8 The overall prevalence of axSpA is 0.2 percent to 1.4 percent of adults in the U.S.9 10 Approximately half of all patients with axSpA are patients with nr-xSpA.8Approximately two-thirds of patients with AS are men  while nr-axSpA is more common among women with the disease.11 AxSpA onset usually occurs before the age of 45  often in the 20s.8 10 to 40 percent of patients with nr-axSpA progress to ankylosing spondylitis over 2 to 10 years.8About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.11 Bimekizumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of active axSpA with 24-week interim analysis results from the BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA) and BE MOBILE 2 (AS) studies to be presented at EULAR 2022.1 2 In addition  bimekizumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis with 24-week interim analysis from the BE OPTIMAL study and 16-week analysis from the BE COMPLETE study to be presented at EULAR 2022.12 13Bimekizumab is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults  and its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email [email protected]Corporate CommunicationsAlly FunkT +1.678.365.6321email [email protected]Brand CommunicationsEimear O'BrienT +32.2.559.92.71email [email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

Achieving minimal disease activity is an important goal of treatment  that can ultimately lead to improved quality of life for people with psoriatic arthritis "" said Joseph F. Merola  MD  MMSc  Associate Professor  Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.Data from BE COMPLETE (16-week analysis) and BE OPTIMAL (24-week interim analysis)Joint Symptoms: In both studies  patients treated with bimekizumab (160 mg every four weeks [Q4W]) achieved statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint of at least 50 percent or greater improvement from baseline in the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR50) at week 16  compared with placebo.1 2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  43.9 percent (n=189/431) of biologic naïve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 versus 10.0 percent (n=28/281) of patients on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  43.4 percent (n=116/267) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 versus 6.8 percent (n=9/133) of patients on placebo; p<0.001.2Skin Symptoms: In both studies  patients treated with bimekizumab achieved statistically significant improvements in levels of skin clearance  as measured by the ranked secondary endpoint of at least a 90 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI90) at week 16  compared with placebo.1.2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  61.3 percent (n=133/217) of biologic naïve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved PASI90 versus 2.9 percent (n=4/140) on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  68.8 percent (n=121/176) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved PASI90 versus 6.8 percent (n=6/88) on placebo; p<0.001.2Minimal Disease Activity: In both studies  a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved the ranked secondary endpoint of Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) response  compared with placebo at week 16.1 2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  45.0 percent (n=194/431) of biologic-naïve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA versus 13.2 (n=37/281) percent on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  44.2 percent (n=118/267) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA versus 6.0 percent (n=8/133) on placebo; p<0.001.2""In the BE OPTIMAL and BE COMPLETE studies  bimekizumab demonstrated clinically relevant improvements in musculoskeletal and skin outcomes for people with psoriatic arthritis compared with placebo. In addition  results from the BE OPTIMAL study show that treatment with bimekizumab was associated with inhibition of structural joint damage progression by week 16 "" said Iain McInnes  Professor  Vice Principal and Head of College  University of Glasgow  Scotland.Additional OutcomesIn BE OPTIMAL  treatment with bimekizumab compared with placebo was associated with a statistically significant inhibition of progression of structural joint damage at week 16  as measured by mean change from baseline in the van der Heijde modified Total Sharp Score (vdHmTSS)  a ranked secondary endpoint. 1The clinical response in both studies was rapid  with separation from placebo observed from week two in BE OPTIMAL (ACR20; p<0.001  nominal  not controlled for multiplicity) and week four in BE COMPLETE (ACR50; p<0.001  nominal  not controlled for multiplicity). 1 2In BE OPTIMAL  response rates continued to improve to week 24: 45.5 percent (n=196/431) of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 and 35.9 percent (n=101/281) of patients switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved ACR50  following an eight week treatment duration; 72.8 percent (n=158/217) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved PASI90 and 61.4 percent (n=86/140) of patients switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved PASI90; 48.5 percent (n=209/431) of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA and 37.7 percent (n=106/281) switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved MDA. 1An active reference arm of adalimumab was included in the BE OPTIMAL study. The study was not powered for statistical comparisons with the bimekizumab treatment group or placebo. At week 16  45.7 percent (n=64/140)  41.2 percent (n=28/68) and 45.0 percent (n=63/140) of patients treated with adalimumab achieved ACR50  PASI90 and MDA  respectively.1In BE OPTIMAL  over 16 weeks  59.9 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab had ≥ one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) versus 49.5 percent of patients on placebo and 59.3 percent on adalimumab.1 The three most frequent TEAEs (≥5 percent in any treatment arm) were nasopharyngitis (9.3 percent for bimekizumab; 4.6 percent for placebo and 5.0 percent for adalimumab)  upper respiratory tract infection (4.9 percent for bimekizumab; 6.4 percent for placebo and 2.1 percent for adalimumab) and increased alanine aminotransferase (0.7 percent for bimekizumab; 0.7 percent for placebo and 5.0 percent for adalimumab).1 Candida infections were reported in 2.6 percent of bimekizumab-treated patients  0.7 percent on placebo and 0 percent on adalimumab.1 The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was low: 1.6 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab versus 1.1 percent on placebo and 1.4 percent on adalimumab.1 No cases of systemic candidiasis  inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or uveitis were reported.1In BE COMPLETE  over 16 weeks  40.1 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab had ≥ one TEAE versus 33.3 percent of patients on placebo.2 The three most frequent TEAEs for patients treated with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis (3.7 percent; 0.8 percent for placebo)  oral candidiasis (2.6 percent; 0.0 percent for placebo)  and upper respiratory tract infection (2.2 percent; 1.5 percent for placebo).2 Two patients on bimekizumab discontinued treatment due to a TEAE (0.7 percent). The incidence of SAEs was low: 1.9 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab versus 0 percent on placebo  and none led to discontinuation.2 No cases of systemic candidiasis  IBD  MACE  venous thromboembolism (VTE)  or uveitis were reported.2About BE OPTIMALBE OPTIMAL is a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  active reference (adalimumab)  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis  who are biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug naïve.3 The study is ongoing with 24-week interim analysis presented above. For additional details on the study  visit BE OPTIMAL on clinicaltrials.gov.3About BE COMPLETEBE COMPLETE was a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFαi) experienced adults with active psoriatic arthritis.4 All enrolled study participants had a history of inadequate response (lack of efficacy after at least three months of therapy at an approved dose) or intolerance to treatment with one or two TNFαi for either psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis.4 For additional details on the study  visit BE COMPLETE on clinicaltrials.gov.4About Psoriatic ArthritisPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a serious  highly heterogeneous  chronic  systemic inflammatory condition affecting both the joints and skin  with a prevalence of 0.06 percent to 0.25 percent of the total U.S. population  and 6 percent to 41 percent of patients with psoriasis.5 Symptoms include joint pain and stiffness  skin plaques  swollen toes and fingers (dactylitis)  and inflammation of the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone (enthesitis).6About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.7 Bimekizumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis with 24-week interim analysis from the BE OPTIMAL study and 16-week analysis from the BE COMPLETE study to be presented at EULAR 2022.1 2 In addition  bimekizumab is in development for the treatment of active axial spondyloarthritis with 24-week interim analysis results from BE MOBILE 1 (non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) and BE MOBILE 2 (ankylosing spondylitis) studies to be presented at EULAR 2022.8 9Bimekizumab is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults  and its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email [email protected]Corporate CommunicationsAlly FunkT +1.678.365.6321email [email protected]Brand CommunicationsEimear O'BrienT +32.2.559.92.71email [email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.References1 McInnes I  Coates L  Landewé R.B.M. et al.

When trialling Orizon on 10 residents at the German nursing home  the time caregivers spent on incontinence care reduced by a total of 3.2 hours a day  and 7 diapers were saved each day. The residents also got at least 8 hours of sleep per night because their diapers no longer required checking for saturation. In nursing homes checking residents through the night is a common routine that means many residents are unnecessarily woken and disturbed during their sleep.Michael Schildt  director of the nursing home  said  ""Orizon has enabled residents to live an even more self-determined life and have a more comfortable daily routine. Especially with incontinence  this is very important for well-being. In addition  colleagues had more time for conversations and encounters - that's also a big advantage.""The gain in time and comfort came from the fact that leakages were avoided  saving approximately 10 minutes of 2 nurses per wet bed  incontinence products only needed to be changed when necessary and residents were no longer unnecessarily disturbed at night. It was also noted that no more products leaked during the day or night  eliminating the need for additional bedding changes.About the field studyBetween February 21 and March 18  2022  Ontex conducted a field study of its Orizon service with the help of 10 nursing home residents and 25 caregivers at the Palmscher Garten nursing home in the town of Deizisau  Germany. The field study helped provide insights into leakage reduction  ease of use and impact on caregivers and residents. The results of the study showed a 100% reduction in daytime and night-time leakage and an overall reduction in the negative impact of leakage  including the elimination of bed linen changes due to urine leakage.Europe-wide market launch at the turn of the yearIn addition to Germany  Ontex has run pilot projects in Belgium and France and will soon start pilot project in Italy and the UK. Ontex plans to launch the digital incontinence management service across Europe in late 2022/early 2023. Ontex launches the service under the new Orizon brand with its incontinence brands Serenity and iD  and will benefit from existing brand recognition and a strong reputation in European nursing homes.Unlike most of Ontex's existing incontinence brands and services  Orizon is based on a monthly fee. With the introduction of Orizon  Ontex aims to optimize the overall cost of continence care by reducing waste  linen costs and staff time spent on continence care.Incontinence: a common condition in the aging populationIncontinence is a very common condition  especially among the elderly in hospitals and nursing homes. Incontinence is one of the most common conditions in elderly care facilities and one of the most important components of facility care costs. Approximately 80% of nursing home residents suffer from some form of incontinence  according to Ontex nursing home order data.According to research by the World Health Organization[1]  between 10% and 36% of people over the age of 60 are affected by incontinence and use incontinence products. Although incontinence is most common in the elderly  all age groups are affected.The 60+ age group is expected to increase from nearly 1 billion people worldwide [2] today to nearly 2.1 billion by 2050 [3]  further straining healthcare systems around the world. Orizon aims to reinvent continence care in partnership with caregivers to make care simpler and easier as the global population ages.[1] Between 9.9% and 36.1% of the population over 60 years of age is reported to suffer from incontinence.

This substantial increase was mainly driven by the accelerated underlying organic growth momentum in recurring digital revenue (+19.3%)  which is at the core of the business of the Company. The continued platform rollout and the growing customer base to more than 850 000 customers (+8.2% in Q1 2022) were the main engines for growth. Moreover  the platform scalability showed promising results with the successful launch of the unique SME-platform Banqup throughout Europe. During the first quarter  Unifiedpost Group launched its inhouse developed payment functionality  a crucial cornerstone of the product  in seven countries and further connected major European banks to the platform.HighlightsGroup revenue grew by 15.7% y/y to €46.2 million in Q1 2022Organic recurring digital revenue up by 19.3% y/y in Q1 2022 (Q1 2021: 6.7%). Organic digital processing revenue +13.9% y/y  correlated to the non-recurring project and licence businessStrong growth of customer base with 8.2% in Q1 compared to YE 2021Successful expansion of new SME-ecosystems and further rollout of payment functionality strengthens high product scalability and demonstrates overall Group’s growth potentialGrowth rates in digital business increasingly supported by European governments’ decisionsManagement guidance for FY2022 and FY2023 confirmedCommenting on the business update  Hans Leybaert  CEO and founder stated: “We are pleased with the progress made during the first three months of the year  which is according to plan. Strong customer development led to 19.3% organic revenue growth of our (recurring) digital platform services (Q1 2021: 6.7%). Moreover  the current pipeline of upcoming project deals is promising  especially due to the regulatory windfall that is to be expected in the short term. More and more European countries are making plans to make e-invoicing compulsory. Consequently  we remain committed to meet our full year management guidance of an organic revenue growth rate in our digital processing business of at least 25% year on year.”Key financial figures (EUR million) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Change (%) Digital processing revenue – organic 27.6 24.21 +13.9% Digital processing revenue – acquired business 2.0 - - Postage & parcel optimisation revenue 16.5 15.6 +5.7% Group revenue 46.2 39.9 +15.7%Key business KPI’s (#) End Q1 2022 End Q4 2021 End Q3 2021 Customers 857 313 792 594 736 653 Companies in business network 1 615 062 1 504 895 1.319 225 Banqup customers 56 000 35 408 30 553 Organic growth (new subscriptions) 5 197 4 855 3 561 Migrated 15 395 - - Banqup customers Belgium (Billtobox) 31 848 28 864 24 324 Banqup customers France (JeFacture) 2 844 2 072 1 300Recurring digital processing revenue grew significantly by 19.3%Consolidated Group revenue in the first quarter of FY2022 increased by 15.7% to €46.2 million  driven mainly by organic growth from digital processing revenue. This core business of Unifiedpost accounted for €29.6 million  an increase of 22.3% y/y. Recurring digital revenue  i.e.  digital platform revenue excluding the project and licence business  showed a strong increase in growth momentum  as its organic growth rate grew significantly by 19.3% y/y compared to its growth rate of 6.7% in Q1 2021. Given the more volatile nature of the non-recurring project and licence business  the organic growth in total digital processing revenue reached 13.9% in Q1 2022 (Q1 2021: 10.1%).Postage & parcel optimisation revenue showed a sound growth rate of 5.7% y/y. Group-wide  due to the lower project business in the first three months of 2022  the share of recurring revenue increased to 96.3% of total revenue (FY2021: 92.8%).Customer base grew substantially by 8.2% in Q1In Q1 2022 Unifiedpost grew its customer base to 857 313 customers (+8.2% compared to YE2021). The consolidated business network expanded to over 1.6 million companies by the end of Q1 2022  representing an estimated 7% of businesses in Europe.The total number of Banqup customers grew to 56 000 (31 December 2021: 35 408). Banqup is Unifiedpost’s core SME-product allowing customers to create and send sales invoices  keep an overview of all (financial) documents and manage administration. A unique payment functionality was added to the product. The customer growth over the last three months includes migration effects  mainly from legacy platforms in the Baltics  amounting to 15 395 customers. Adjusting for such migrated users  the number of Banqup users increased by 5 197 in the three months up to 31 March 2022  supported by a very pleasing organic growth in markets like France  Serbia and in the Benelux.Within the French market  Unifiedpost sees the number of JeFacture customers increasing steadily. Management expects an exponential growth of customers including speeding up run rates. Already today  the number of processed documents broadly doubles every month.Overall average revenue per unit (ARPU) in digital processing business2 reached €24.5. The decline in ARPU compared to FY2021 (€27.9) is predominantly due to two effects. The first one is a negative basis effect from the last quarter as that includes the licence revenue resulting from the project with the Serbian Government. The second one results from the significantly higher revenue contribution from Unifiedpost’s SME business with a structurally lower ARPU.Platform scalability and new ecosystems show promising resultsDuring the first quarter of FY2022  Unifiedpost Group continued to successfully launch its Banqup platform throughout Europe. The payment functionality was launched for the first-time outside Belgium. Unifiedpost laid the foundations for the payment infrastructure by obtaining regulatory approval in already 19 countries today to issue local payment accounts – with own IBAN numbers. Unifiedpost is speeding up the roll-out of its payment services by further connecting major European banks to the platform. As of today  the payment functionality is live in 7 countries.The payment functionality is not only a crucial cornerstone in the unique product offering of Banqup. It will also enable Banqup customers to receive financing via assignment of receivables (factoring) and to improve their cash position. In February 2022  Unifiedpost agreed on a partnership with Izola Bank  allowing Banqup to offer invoice financing to customers in Belgium and in The Netherlands. Funding levels for the invoice finance services within the platform can currently add up to €50 million. There is significant additional potential to further scale up this business model as Banqup will expand this functionality throughout all its European markets.Impact of macro-economic and geopolitical situationUnifiedpost has not been directly impacted by the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The Group has no business Ukraine  nor in Russia. It also has no development centres in these countries. There is no direct revenue from Russia or with Russian customers  as Unifiedpost is compliant with the EU sanctions. In Moldova  where Unifiedpost employs about 90 people  Group management is closely monitoring the situation and different scenarios have already been prepared to secure our local workforce and the business continuity in case of escalation.Financing provides flexibility to secure growth plansOn 7 March 2022  Unifiedpost signed a €100 million five-year loan facility provided by Francisco Partners  a leading global investment firm that specializes in partnering with technology-enabled businesses. Francisco Partners obtained an equity commitment fee of 3% of the share capital of Unifiedpost and the loan bears a 3% cash interest and 8% interest paid in kind. Unifiedpost has drawn €75 million  of which €25 million is being used as a buffer for the potential negative consequences of the macro-economic and geopolitical situation. This leaves the Group with €50 million of which €30 million is required to cover R&D expenditures and €20 million is used for loan repayments.€25 million of the €100 million facility remains today undrawn without costs and remains available for future additional investments. The partnership with Francisco Partners provides Unifiedpost with a high degree of financial flexibility  securing its growth plans in a market environment characterized by high geopolitical uncertainties and rising interest rates.Management guidance confirmedBased on the Q1 2022 results and the Company’s internal forecast for the following quarters  Unifiedpost reiterates its FY2022 and FY2023 guidance  with organic digital processing revenue growth of at least 25% for FY2022  stepping up to at least 30% in FY2023. Management also reaffirms digital processing revenue gross margin guidance of at least 60% by 2023 and an adjusted EBITDA margin expected to reach at least 25% by FY2023. The guidance does not take any further escalation of the war or further repercussions on European energy supply into account.Investors & Media webcast Management will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.

5392,EuroNext,Google API,https://igamingbusiness.com/bet-at-home-q1-revenue/,Bet-at-Home Q1 revenue halved amid regulatory challenges,9 hours ago,Bet-at-Home’s revenue dropped by more than 50% in Q1 of 2022  following regulatory difficulties in Germany  Austria and the Netherlands.Revenue came to €14.0m (£11.9m/$15.0m)  which the operator noted was within expectations for the quarter.However  this total was down 54.1% from Q1 of 2021  due to regulator challenges in many of Bet-at-Home’s core markets.Bet-at-Home withdrew from Austria last year  in a move that led to 65 layoffs  after determining that continuing to do business in the country “would lead to a steadily increasing risk potential that appears indefensible overall”.This followed a legal case in Austria in which a number of players have sought reimbursement for losses made with unlicensed operators. The only licensed operator in the country is Casinos Austria.Meanwhile in the Netherlands  Bet-at-Home was one of a number of operators that stopped accepting Dutch players before the market opened on 1 October of last year  following a change in enforcement policies. The operator noted that it submitted a licence application at the end of Q1  paving the way for a return.Meanwhile in Germany  the business has been affected by the terms of a transitional regime where operators must follow the rules imposed by the country’s Fourth State Treaty on Gambling  including a €1 stake limit for slots. The effects of this  it said  were exacerbated by the fact that operators that do not comply have not yet faced regulatory action  but the business said it expects that fact to change soon.“We expect the relevant authorities to take rigorous action against unlicensed providers in the foreseeable future ” Bet-at-Home’s board said.The business paid €4.4m in personnel expenses  down from €5.0m the year before because of the layoffs announced last year. Marketing expenses also declined  to €3.5m  as the business intends to focus more of its 2022 marketing spend on the end of the year  during the Fifa World Cup.Other operating expenses came to €5.1m.The business reported a loss before interest  profit  depreciation and amortisation of €1.4m  after a €6.9m profit before interest  profit  depreciation and amortisation the year before.The business reiterated its revenue guidance of between €50m and €60m for the full year  as well as its earnings before interest  profit  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) guidance of between a €2m loss and a €2m profit.Bet-at-Home is owned by Betclic Everest  which earlier this month announced plans to go public on Euronext Amsterdam through a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger  alongside television production business Banijay.Betclic Everest will first join with Banijay to create FL Entertainment  a business with an enterprise value of €7.2bn  most of which would be related to Banijay.

The updates to the figures are mainly associated with acquisition accounting  following the completion of the acquisition audits  as well as the accounting treatment of the business combination with European FinTech IPO Company 1 (EFIC1) that was completed on 1 February 2022  tax and the refinancing of the Company’s bonds in 2021. In the income statement  operating profit was lower by approximately EUR 9.2 million as compared to the preliminary results 2021  while EBITDA increased by some EUR 1.8 million  mainly driven by higher depreciation and amortisation  as well as lower gains from currency translation effects. As a result  the loss after tax for the year was higher by approximately EUR 9.1 million  as compared to the preliminary results 2021.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content The balance sheet’s assets increased by approximately EUR 15.8 million  mainly related to the completion of purchase price allocation of acquisitions. In addition  there was a reclassification of EUR 8.8 million associated with share appreciation rights related to acquisitions  from equity to other liabilities.
