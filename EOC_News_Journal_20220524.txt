You should not consider these non-IFRS financial measures as substitutes for or superior to revenue  in the case of Total Net Revenue  Like-for-like Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue; Net Profit  in the case of Adjusted EBITDA; and Adjusted Net Profit  or earnings per share  in the case of Adjusted Net Profit per share  each prepared in accordance with IFRS.Furthermore  because these non-IFRS financial measures are not determined in accordance with IFRS  they are susceptible to varying calculations and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. QIWI encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information regarding Total Net Revenue  Like-for-like Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted Net Profit  and Adjusted Net Profit per share  including a quantitative reconciliation of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit to the most directly comparable IFRS financial performance measure  which is revenue in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue and Net Profit in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  see Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results in this earnings release.We define non-IFRS financial measures as follows:‚ÄúTotal Net Revenue‚Äù is calculated by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue.‚ÄúLike-for-like Total Net Revenue‚Äù as Revenue minus (1) Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) (2) 1Q 2021 TSUPIS and related acquiring services net revenue of RUB 918 million.‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù as Net profit plus: (1) depreciation and amortization (2) other income and expenses (3) foreign exchange gain/loss (4) share of gain of an associate and a joint venture (5) interest income and expenses (6) income tax expenses (7) share-based payment expenses (8) impairment of non-current assets.‚ÄúAdjusted Net profit‚Äù as Net profit plus: (1) fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization (2) impairment of non-current assets (3) share-based payment expenses (4) effect of taxation of the above items.‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA Margin‚Äù as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Net Revenue.‚ÄúAdjusted Net profit Margin‚Äù as Adjusted Net profit divided by Total Net Revenue.Total Net Revenue is a key measure used by management to observe our operational profitability since it reflects our portion of the revenue net of fees that we pass through  primarily to our agents and other reload channels providers. In addition  under IFRS  most types of fees are presented on a gross basis whereas certain types of fees are presented on a net basis. Therefore  in order to analyze our two sources of payment processing fees on a comparative basis  management reviews Total Net Revenue. Like-for-like Total Net Revenue indicates net revenue trends for both years on comparable basis  excluding from the previous year revenues of terminated activities  such as TSUPIS & related acquiring services (which terminated since 4Q 2021).Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management  is serves as a supplemental performance measure that facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expenses  net)  changes in foreign exchange rates that impact financial asset and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency (affecting foreign exchange (loss)/gain  net)  tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates)  the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expense)  non-cash charges (affecting share-based payments expenses and impairment of non-current assets)  and certain one-time income and expenses (affecting other income  offering and related expenses  loss from sale of Sovest loan portfolio  etc.). Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other expenses  share in losses of associates and impairment of investment in associates because we believe it is helpful to view the performance of our business excluding the impact of entities that we do not control  and because our share of the net income (loss) of the associate and other expenses includes items that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA (such as finance expenses  net  tax on income and depreciation and amortization). Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use Adjusted EBITDA in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors.Adjusted Net Profit is a key measure used by management to observe the operational profitability of the company. We believe Adjusted Net Profit is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it measures a company‚Äôs operating performance without the effect of non-recurring items or items that are not core to our operations. For example  loss on disposals of subsidiaries and the effects of deferred taxation on excluded items do not represent the core operations of the business  and fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization  impairment of non-current assets and share-based payments expenses do not have a substantial cash effect. Nevertheless  such gains and losses can affect our financial performance.Payment Services segment payment volume provides a measure of the overall size and growth of the business  and increasing our payment volumes is essential to growing our profitability.Payment Services segment net revenue yield. We calculate Payment Services segment net revenue yield by dividing Payment Services segment net revenue by Payment Services segment payment volume. Payment Services segment net revenue yield provides a measure of our ability to generate net revenue per unit of volume we process.QIWI presents PS Payment segment breakdown by verticals and we define these measures as follows:PS Payment Net Revenue is the Net Revenue consisting of the merchant and consumer fees collected for the payment transactions. E-commerce payment net revenue consists of fees charged to customers and merchants that buy and sell products and services online  including online games  social networks  betting  online stores  game developers  software producers  coupon websites  tickets and numerous other merchants. Financial Services payment net revenue primarily consists of fees charged for payments accepted on behalf of our bank partners and microfinance companies. Money Remittance payment net revenue primarily consists of fees charged for transferring funds via money remittance companies  card-to-card transfers and certain wallet-to-wallet transfers. Telecom payment net revenue primarily consists of fees charged for payments to MNOs  internet services providers and pay television providers.

You should not consider these non-IFRS financial measures as substitutes for or superior to revenue  in the case of Total Net Revenue  Like-for-like Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue; Net Profit  in the case of Adjusted EBITDA; and Adjusted Net Profit  or earnings per share  in the case of Adjusted Net Profit per share  each prepared in accordance with IFRS.Furthermore  because these non-IFRS financial measures are not determined in accordance with IFRS  they are susceptible to varying calculations and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. QIWI encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For more information regarding Total Net Revenue  Like-for-like Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted Net Profit  and Adjusted Net Profit per share  including a quantitative reconciliation of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue  PS Other Net Revenue  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit to the most directly comparable IFRS financial performance measure  which is revenue in the case of Total Net Revenue  PS Payment Net Revenue and PS Other Net Revenue and Net Profit in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Profit  see Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results in this earnings release.We define non-IFRS financial measures as follows:‚ÄúTotal Net Revenue‚Äù is calculated by subtracting cost of revenue from revenue.‚ÄúLike-for-like Total Net Revenue‚Äù as Revenue minus (1) Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) (2) 1Q 2021 TSUPIS and related acquiring services net revenue of RUB 918 million.‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA‚Äù as Net profit plus: (1) depreciation and amortization (2) other income and expenses (3) foreign exchange gain/loss (4) share of gain of an associate and a joint venture (5) interest income and expenses (6) income tax expenses (7) share-based payment expenses (8) impairment of non-current assets.‚ÄúAdjusted Net profit‚Äù as Net profit plus: (1) fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization (2) impairment of non-current assets (3) share-based payment expenses (4) effect of taxation of the above items.‚ÄúAdjusted EBITDA Margin‚Äù as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total Net Revenue.‚ÄúAdjusted Net profit Margin‚Äù as Adjusted Net profit divided by Total Net Revenue.Total Net Revenue is a key measure used by management to observe our operational profitability since it reflects our portion of the revenue net of fees that we pass through  primarily to our agents and other reload channels providers. In addition  under IFRS  most types of fees are presented on a gross basis whereas certain types of fees are presented on a net basis. Therefore  in order to analyze our two sources of payment processing fees on a comparative basis  management reviews Total Net Revenue. Like-for-like Total Net Revenue indicates net revenue trends for both years on comparable basis  excluding from the previous year revenues of terminated activities  such as TSUPIS & related acquiring services (which terminated since 4Q 2021).Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management  is serves as a supplemental performance measure that facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expenses  net)  changes in foreign exchange rates that impact financial asset and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency (affecting foreign exchange (loss)/gain  net)  tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates)  the age and book depreciation of fixed assets (affecting relative depreciation expense)  non-cash charges (affecting share-based payments expenses and impairment of non-current assets)  and certain one-time income and expenses (affecting other income  offering and related expenses  loss from sale of Sovest loan portfolio  etc.). Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other expenses  share in losses of associates and impairment of investment in associates because we believe it is helpful to view the performance of our business excluding the impact of entities that we do not control  and because our share of the net income (loss) of the associate and other expenses includes items that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA (such as finance expenses  net  tax on income and depreciation and amortization). Because Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use Adjusted EBITDA in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors.Adjusted Net Profit is a key measure used by management to observe the operational profitability of the company. We believe Adjusted Net Profit is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it measures a company‚Äôs operating performance without the effect of non-recurring items or items that are not core to our operations. For example  loss on disposals of subsidiaries and the effects of deferred taxation on excluded items do not represent the core operations of the business  and fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization  impairment of non-current assets and share-based payments expenses do not have a substantial cash effect. Nevertheless  such gains and losses can affect our financial performance.Payment Services segment payment volume provides a measure of the overall size and growth of the business  and increasing our payment volumes is essential to growing our profitability.Payment Services segment net revenue yield. We calculate Payment Services segment net revenue yield by dividing Payment Services segment net revenue by Payment Services segment payment volume. Payment Services segment net revenue yield provides a measure of our ability to generate net revenue per unit of volume we process.QIWI presents PS Payment segment breakdown by verticals and we define these measures as follows:PS Payment Net Revenue is the Net Revenue consisting of the merchant and consumer fees collected for the payment transactions. E-commerce payment net revenue consists of fees charged to customers and merchants that buy and sell products and services online  including online games  social networks  betting  online stores  game developers  software producers  coupon websites  tickets and numerous other merchants. Financial Services payment net revenue primarily consists of fees charged for payments accepted on behalf of our bank partners and microfinance companies. Money Remittance payment net revenue primarily consists of fees charged for transferring funds via money remittance companies  card-to-card transfers and certain wallet-to-wallet transfers. Telecom payment net revenue primarily consists of fees charged for payments to MNOs  internet services providers and pay television providers. Other payment net revenue consists of consumer and merchant fees charged for a variety of payments including multi-level-marketing  utility bills  government payments  education services and many others.PS Other Net Revenue primarily consists of revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments  interest revenue  cash and settlement services  fees for issuing bank guarantees and advertising.QIWI plc.Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Operating Results(in millions  except per share data)Three months ended (unaudited) March 31  2021 March 31  2022 March 31  2022 RUB RUB USD Revenue 9 234 9 717 115.6 Minus: Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 4 073 3 412 40.6 Total Net Revenue 5 161 6 305 75.0 Segment Net Revenue Payment Services Segment Revenue 8 547 8 730 103.8 PS Payment Revenue(1) 7 615 6 948 82.6 Minus: Cost of PS Payment Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)(2) 3 547 2 829 33.6 PS Payment Adjusted Net Revenue 4 068 4 119 49.0 PS Other Revenue(3) 932 1 782 21.2 Minus: Cost of PS Other Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)(4) 239 252 3.0 PS Other Adjusted Net Revenue 693 1 530 18.2 Payment Services Segment Net Revenue 4 762 5 649 67.2 Corporate and Other Category Revenue 687 987 11.7 Minus: Cost of CO revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 288 331 3.9 Corporate and Other Category Net Revenue 399 656 7.8 Total Segment Net Revenue 5 161 6 305 75.0 Net Profit 1 954 2 257 26.8 Plus: Depreciation and amortization 286 277 3.3 Other income and expenses  net 8 (21) (0.2) Foreign exchange (gain)/loss  net (8) 441 5.2 Share of gain of an associate and a joint venture (165) - - Interest income and expenses  net 12 (68) (0.8) Income tax expenses 715 801 9.5 Share-based payment expenses 6 - - Impairment of non-current assets 12 - - Adjusted EBITDA 2 820 3 687 43.8 Adjusted EBITDA margin 54.6% 58.5% 58.5% Net profit 1 954 2 257 26.8 Fair value adjustments recorded on business combinations and their amortization(5) 85 83 1.0 Impairment of non-current assets 12 - - Share-based payment expenses 6 - - Effect of taxation of the above items 4 (14) (0.2) Adjusted Net Profit 2 061 2 326 27.7 Adjusted Net Profit per share: Basic 33.02 37.25 0.44 Diluted 33.00 37.25 0.44 Weighted-average number of shares used in computing Adjusted Net Profit per share: Basic 62 411 62 449 62 449 Diluted 62 459 62 449 62 449(1) PS Payment Revenue represents payment processing fees  which primarily consists of the merchant and consumer fees charged for the payment transactions.(2) Cost of PS Payment Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) primarily consists of transaction costs to acquire payments from our customers payable to agents  mobile operators  international payment systems and other parties.(3) PS Other Revenue primarily consists of revenue from fees for inactive accounts and unclaimed payments  interest revenue  cash and settlement services  fees for issuing bank guarantees and advertising.(4) Cost of PS Other Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) primarily consists of direct costs associated with other revenue and other costs  including but not limited to: bank guarantees expenses  interest expenses related to issued bonds  costs of sms notification  advertising commissions.(5) Amortization of fair value adjustments primarily includes the effect of the acquisition of control in CONTACT and Rapida.1 Total Net Revenue  adjusted EBITDA  adjusted EBITDA margin  adjusted Net profit  adjusted Net profit margin  financial results on a like-for-like basis in this release are ‚Äúnon-IFRS financial measures‚Äù.

Letter to Owners in Millicom2. Notice on the Offering of Common Shares (Actions) of the Company  Including Common Shares Represented by Swedish Depository ReceiptsItem 1CEO LETTERDear owner in Millicom 7 for 10 Rights Offer at SEK 106.00 per new SDR or USD 10.61 per new Share1. Introduction:On November 12  2021  Millicom announced the acquisition of the remaining 45% equity stake in our joint venture business in Guatemala (‚ÄúTigo Guatemala‚Äù) for USD 2.2 billion in cash. With this transaction  we now own a 100% equity interest in Tigo Guatemala and have consolidated our position as the leading telecommunication service provider in Central America. At the time of the acquisition  the funding was provided by a group of leading international banks. The bridge funding was intended to be refinanced with approximately USD 1.5 billion of new long-term debt and approximately USD 750 million of new equity  which Millicom is now seeking to raise via a rights offering (the ‚ÄúRights Offer‚Äù).The purpose of this letter is to explain the rationale for launching the Rights Offer and why the Board of Directors and the executive management team1 believe this is in the best interests of Millicom equity holders. The letter also provides details of how you can participate in the Rights Offer.Under the terms of the Rights Offer  Millicom is offering seven new Swedish Depository Receipts (‚ÄúSDRs‚Äù) for every ten SDR rights owned at a subscription price of SEK 106.00 per new SDR  and seven new common shares for every ten common share rights owned at a subscription price of USD 10.61 per common share. As a part of the Rights Offer  equity holders of record on May 23  2022 will receive preferential subscription rights. If you hold SDRs  please refer to the last page in this letter for a description of how to proceed in order to exercise your SDR rights.2. Reasons for the acquisition of Tigo Guatemala:Tigo Guatemala is the most profitable business within the Millicom Group  with an EBITDA2 margin of 53.6% in 2021. The acquisition of the remaining 45% equity interest was in line with our stated inorganic capital allocation strategy  which includes acquisitions of the remaining minority interests owned by third parties in our operations  when we believe those transactions can be executed in an accretive manner. In recent years  Tigo Guatemala has grown to become the biggest contributor to the Group‚Äôs cash flow generation.1 However  neither I  the executive management team nor our Board of Directors (nor any committee thereof) has made any recommendation as to whether you should exercise or transfer your rights. You should decide whether to transfer your rights  subscribe for new SDRs or common shares or take no action with respect to your rights based on your own assessment of your best interests.2 EBITDA and operating cash flow (OCF)  which are used throughout this letter  are Non-IFRS measures. Please refer to the end of this letter for non-IFRS disclosures and a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest equivalent IFRS measures. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.CEO LETTEROver the last five years  Tigo Guatemala has proven a strong growth track record with revenue growing at a compounded annual rate of over four percent and EBITDA increasing at a compounded annual growth rate of over six percent. In addition  there has been a sustained growth through the pandemic.The Guatemalan market is an underpenetrated two-player mobile and fixed telecommunications market  where Tigo Guatemala is the number one market player in Mobile and Broadband  and the second largest in Pay TV3. The Guatemalan economy as a whole has shown resiliency and was one of the least impacted economies during the pandemic  and the currency  the Guatemala Quetzal  has been very stable compared to the US dollar for the last 20 years.Finally  the purchase price of the remaining 45% in Tigo Guatemala represented an attractive valuation given the high cash flow profile of the business.3. Financial impact of the acquisition:As a result of the acquisition  Millicom fully consolidates Tigo Guatemala‚Äôs results and balance sheet. In 2021  Tigo Guatemala‚Äôs revenue grew 6.5% to USD 1.6 billion  EBITDA rose 10.2% to USD 857 million and operating cash flow (‚ÄúOCF‚Äù) increased 10.4% to USD 660 million.44. Shareholder intentions and Board and management indications:Several of our largest institutional shareholders have already informed us of their intentions to fully subscribe for their respective pro rata shares in the Rights Offer. Additionally  I plan to exercise my rights in full  and all our directors and all members of our executive team have indicated that they also plan to exercise their rights in full  except for one director and one member of the executive team who have indicated that they plan to partially exercise their rights.I would like to thank all our equity holders for your trust  and I hope that you will consider exercising your preferential subscription rights to further strengthen Millicom and take part in our continued growth journey.5Mauricio RamosCEO  Millicom3 Pay TV consists of direct-to-home satellite TV and cable TV services.4 EBITDA and OCF are Non-IFRS measures.

Item 12: Resolution regarding guidelines for remuneration to senior executives The board of directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on guidelines for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the below. Who the guidelines include and the applicability of the guidelines These guidelines for remuneration to senior executives include directors  the CEO and persons who report directly to the CEO. The guidelines shall be applied to fixed based salary and variable remuneration agreed upon  and to changes made to such remuneration  after the guidelines have been adopted by the general meeting. The guidelines do not include remuneration resolved by the general meeting or other remuneration paid to senior executives and which is not explicitly stated in these guidelines. The board of directors shall have the right to temporarily deviate  in whole or in part  from the guidelines if in an individual case it is considered that a deviation from the guidelines is commercially justified according to the Board's assessment. The forms of remuneration  etc. Remuneration to senior executives consists of a fixed based salary and variable remuneration (short-term incentives). The general meeting may in addition - and independently of these guidelines - resolve on share or share price-related remuneration. The Company's board of directors must in special cases be able to be remunerated for services within their respective areas of competence  which do not constitute board work. A market fee must be paid for these services  which must be approved by the board of directors and informed at the general meeting. Fixed based salary Fixed based salary for the CEO and other senior executives is reassessed annually. Variable compensation (short-term incentives) The variable remuneration shall consist of two parts. One part is determined by the achievement of certain goals for the Company  while the other part is determined by the achievement of individual goals. The main part of the variable remuneration is linked to the Company's financial targets  while the individual part constitutes a smaller share of the same. Goals for the CEO are proposed by the Remuneration Committee and decided by the Board  while goals for other senior executives are proposed by the CEO and decided by the Remuneration Committee. Goals are decided during the first quarter of each financial year and the fulfillment of goals is measured and payment is made as soon as possible after the annual general meeting has approved the annual report for the year of earnings. The variable remuneration can amount to a maximum of 30 percent of the fixed basic salary for the CEO and CFO and 20 percent of the fixed basic salary for other senior executives. The current employment agreement runs during the notice period. If severance pay were to be paid  no variable compensation is paid for the period after the end of the notice period. The variable remuneration must be pensionable. Long-term incentives Senior executives may be offered incentive programs which are mainly to be share or share price related. Share and share price-related incentive programs must be resolved by the general meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines. Item 13: Resolution for the board to resolve on issuances The board of directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting of the shareholders shall resolves to authorize the board of directors until the next annual general meeting  on one or more occasions  with or without preferential rights for the shareholders  to issue shares  convertibles and/or warrants  with the right to subscribe for and convert into shares in the Company  respectively  corresponding to a maximum of 10 percent of the Company's share capital after dilution based on the number of shares in the Company at the time when the authorization is used for the first time  to be paid in cash  through set-off or in kind. The reason for the authorization and deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable raising capital for expansion through acquisitions of companies or assets and for the business of the Company as well as to adapt the Company's capital and/or ownership structure. If issuances are carried out with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  such issue shall be made in accordance with customary market terms. If the board of directors finds it suitable in order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a share issuance as set out above it may be made at a subscription price corresponding to the shares quota value. The board of directors or anyone appointed by the board of directors is given the right to make the adjustments necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution at the Companies Registration Office. Majority requirements A resolution in accordance with item 13 is valid where supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting. Number of shares and votes The total number of shares and votes in the Company as of the date of the notice amounts to 45 511 751. The Company does not own any shares. Other Copies of accounts  auditor statement and proxy form are available at least three weeks in advance of the annual general meeting. The complete proposals and other documents that shall be available in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act  including the complete proposed articles of association  are available at least two weeks in advance of the meeting.

The particular terms of the guarantees of debt securities and related agreements will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to those debt securities to be guaranteed.Each of the guarantors will fully and unconditionally guarantee  jointly and severally  the due and punctual payment of principal of and any premium and interest on the debt securities  and the due and punctual payment of any sinking fund payments  when the same shall become due and payable  whether at maturity  by declaration of acceleration  by call for redemption or otherwise.Each guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable guarantor without rendering the guarantee  as it relates to such guarantor  voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws.Interest and Interest RatesGeneralIn the applicable prospectus supplement  we will designate the debt securities of a series as being either debt securities bearing interest at a fixed rate of interest or debt securities bearing interest at a floating rate of interest. Each debt security will begin to accrue interest from the date on which it is originally issued. Interest on each debt security will be payable in arrears on the interest payment dates set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement and as otherwise described below and at maturity or  if earlier  the redemption date described below. Interest will be payable to the holder of record of the debt securities at the close of business on the record date for each interest payment date  which record dates will be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.As used in the indenture  the term ‚Äúbusiness day‚Äù means  with respect to debt securities of a series  any day  other than a Saturday or Sunday  that is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close in the place where the principal of and premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of that series are payable.Fixed Rate Debt SecuritiesIf the debt securities of a series being offered will bear interest at a fixed rate of interest  the debt securities of that series will bear interest at the annual interest rate specified on the cover page of the applicable prospectus supplement. Interest on those debt securities will be payable semi-annually in arrears on the interest payment dates for those debt securities unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. If the maturity date  the redemption date or an interest payment date is not a business day  we will pay principal  premium  if any  the redemption price  if any  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to but excluding the redemption date  on the next succeeding business day  and no interest will accrue from and after the relevant maturity date  redemption date or interest payment date to the date of that payment. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  interest on the fixed rate debt securities will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.Floating Rate Debt SecuritiesIf the debt securities of a series being offered will bear interest at a floating rate of interest  the debt securities of that series will bear interest during each relevant interest period at the rate determined as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. In the applicable prospectus supplement  we will indicate any spread or spread multiplier to be applied in the interest rate formula to determine the interest rate applicable in any interest period.Payment and Transfer or ExchangePrincipal of and premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of each series will be payable  and the debt securities may be exchanged or transferred  at the office or agency maintained by us for that purpose (which initially7will be the corporate trust office of the trustee). Payment of principal of and premium  if any  and interest on a global security registered in the name of or held by The Depository Trust Company (‚ÄúDTC‚Äù) or its nominee will be made in immediately available funds to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered holder of that global security. If any of the debt securities are no longer represented by a global security  payment of interest on certificated debt securities in definitive form may  at our option  be made by check mailed directly to holders at their registered addresses. See ‚Äú‚ÄîBook-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global Securities.‚ÄùA holder may transfer or exchange any certificated debt securities in definitive form at the corporate trust office of the trustee. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of debt securities  but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith.We are not required to transfer or exchange any debt security selected for redemption for a period of 15 days before mailing of a notice of redemption of the debt security to be redeemed.The registered holder of debt securities will be treated as the owner of those debt securities for all purposes.All amounts in respect of principal of and premium  if any  or interest on the debt securities paid by us that remain unclaimed two years after that payment was due and payable will be repaid to us  and the holders of those debt securities will thereafter look solely to us for payment.CovenantsThe applicable prospectus supplement will set forth any covenants that will apply to each series of debt securities to be issued.Events of DefaultThe applicable prospectus supplement will set forth any events of default that will apply to each series of debt securities to be issued.Same-Day Settlement and PaymentUnless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement  the debt securities will trade in the same-day funds settlement system of DTC until maturity or until we issue the debt securities in certificated form. DTC will therefore require secondary market trading activity in the debt securities to settle in immediately available funds. We can give no assurance as to the effect  if any  of settlement in immediately available funds on trading activity in the debt securities.Book-Entry; Delivery and Form; Global SecuritiesUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  the debt securities of each series will be issued in the form of one or more global debt securities  in definitive  fully registered form without interest coupons  each of which we refer to as a ‚Äúglobal security.‚Äù Each global security will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC in New York  New York for the accounts of participants in DTC.Investors may hold their interests in a global security directly through DTC if they are DTC participants  or indirectly through organizations that are DTC participants. Except in the limited circumstances described below  holders of debt securities represented by interests in a global security will not be entitled to receive their debt securities in fully registered certificated form.DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law  a ‚Äúbanking organization‚Äù within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a ‚Äúclearing corporation‚Äù within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a ‚Äúclearing agency‚Äù registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of institutions that have accounts with DTC (‚Äúparticipants‚Äù) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants in those securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC‚Äôs8participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC‚Äôs book-entry system is also available to others  such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant  whether directly or indirectly.Ownership of Beneficial InterestsUpon the issuance of each global security  DTC will credit  on its book-entry registration and transfer system  the respective principal amount of the individual beneficial interests represented by the global security to the accounts of participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be limited to participants or persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global security will be shown on  and the transfer of those ownership interests will be effected only through  records maintained by DTC (with respect to participants‚Äô interests) and those participants (with respect to the owners of beneficial interests in the global security other than participants).So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered holder and owner of a global security  DTC or that nominee  as the case may be  will be considered the sole legal owner of the debt security represented by the global security for all purposes under the indenture  the debt securities and applicable law. Except as set forth below  owners of beneficial interests in a global security will not be entitled to receive certificated debt securities and will not be considered to be the owners or holders of any debt securities represented by the global security. We understand that under existing industry practice  in the event an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any actions that DTC  as the holder of the global security  is entitled to take  DTC would authorize the participants to take that action  and that participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through those participants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. No beneficial owner of an interest in a global security will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC‚Äôs applicable procedures  in addition to those provided for under the indenture. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants  who in turn act on behalf of others  the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a global security to pledge that interest to persons that do not participate in the DTC system  or otherwise to take actions in respect of that interest  may be impaired by the lack of a physical certificate representing that interest.All payments on the debt securities represented by a global security registered in the name of and held by DTC or its nominee will be made to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered owner and holder of the global security.We expect that DTC or its nominee  upon receipt of any payment of principal or premium  if any  or interest in respect of a global security  will credit participants‚Äô accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global security as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the global security held through those participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is now the case with securities held for accounts for customers registered in the names of nominees for those customers. These payments  however  will be the responsibility of those participants and indirect participants  and none of we  the trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to  or payments made on account of  beneficial ownership interests in any global security or for maintaining  supervising or reviewing any records relating to those beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and its participants or the relationship between those participants and the owners of beneficial interests in a global security.Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for certificated debt securities  each global security may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds.We expect that DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of debt securities only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in a global security are credited and only in respect of that portion of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities as to which that participant or participants has or have given that direction. However  if there is an event of default under the debt securities  DTC will exchange each global security for certificated debt securities  which it will distribute to its participants.9Although we expect that DTC will agree to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in each global security among participants of DTC  DTC is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures  and those procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance or nonperformance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.The indenture provides that the global securities will be exchanged for debt securities in certificated form of like tenor and of an equal principal amount  in authorized denominations in the following limited circumstances:(1) DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository or if DTC ceases to be eligible under the indenture and we do not appoint a successor depository within 90 days;(2) we determine that the debt securities will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver to the trustee an order to that effect; or(3) an event of default with respect to the debt securities has occurred and is continuing.These certificated debt securities will be registered in the name or names as DTC instructs the trustee. It is expected that those instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in global securities.The information in this section of this prospectus concerning DTC and DTC‚Äôs book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable.Euroclear and ClearstreamIf the depositary for a global security is DTC  you may hold interests in the global security through Clearstream Banking  soci√©t√© anonyme  which we refer to as ‚ÄúClearstream ‚Äù or Euroclear Bank SA/ NV  as operator of the Euroclear System  which we refer to as ‚ÄúEuroclear ‚Äù in each case  as a participant in DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests  in each case  on behalf of their participants through customers‚Äô securities accounts in the names of Euroclear and Clearstream on the books of their respective depositaries  which in turn will hold those interests in customers‚Äô securities in the depositaries‚Äô names on DTC‚Äôs books.Payments  deliveries  transfers  exchanges  notices and other matters relating to the debt securities made through Euroclear or Clearstream must comply with the rules and procedures of those systems. Those systems could change their rules and procedures at any time. We have no control over those systems or their participants  and we take no responsibility for their activities. Transactions between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream  on one hand  and other participants in DTC  on the other hand  would also be subject to DTC‚Äôs rules and procedures.Investors will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and Clearstream payments  deliveries  transfers  exchanges  notices and other transactions involving any securities held through those systems only on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks  brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.In addition  because of time-zone differences  U.S. investors who hold their interests in the debt securities through these systems and wish on a particular day  to transfer their interests  or to receive or make a payment or delivery or exercise any other right with respect to their interests  may find that the transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels  as applicable. Thus  investors who wish to exercise rights that expire on a particular day may need to act before the expiration date. In addition  investors who hold their interests through both DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream may need to make special arrangements to finance any purchase or sales of their interests between the U.S. and European clearing systems  and those transactions may settle later than transactions within one clearing system.Governing LawThe indenture and the debt securities will be governed by  and construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York.10Regarding the TrusteeWilmington Trust  National Association is the trustee under the indenture.

This summary does not contain all of the information that you may find useful. The particular terms of the depositary shares and related agreements and receipts will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to those depositary shares. For more information  you should review the relevant form of deposit agreement and relevant form of depositary receipts  which are or will be filed with the SEC.GeneralWe may elect to have shares represented by depositary shares. The shares underlying the depositary shares will be deposited under a separate deposit agreement between us and a bank or trust company we select. The prospectus supplement relating to a series of depositary shares will set forth the name and address of this share depositary. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement  each owner of a depositary share will be entitled  proportionately  to all the rights  preferences and privileges of the share represented by such depositary share (including dividend  voting  redemption  conversion  exchange and liquidation rights).The depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts issued pursuant to the deposit agreement  each of which will represent the applicable interest in a number of shares  or fraction thereof  as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.A holder of depositary shares will be entitled to receive the shares (but only in whole shares) underlying those depositary shares. If the depositary receipts delivered by the holder evidence a number of depositary shares in excess of the whole number of shares to be withdrawn  the depositary will deliver to that holder at the same time a new depositary receipt for the excess number of depositary shares.Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  the depositary agreement  the depositary shares and the depositary receipts will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York.Dividends and Other DistributionsThe share depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions in respect of the shares to the record holders of depositary receipts in proportion  insofar as possible  to the number of depositary shares owned by those holders.If there is a distribution other than in cash in respect of the shares  the share depositary will distribute property received by it to the record holders of depositary receipts in proportion  insofar as possible  to the number of depositary shares owned by those holders  unless the share depositary determines that it is not feasible to make such a distribution. In that case  the share depositary may  with our approval  adopt any method that it deems equitable and practicable to effect the distribution  including a public or private sale of the property and distribution of the net proceeds from the sale to the holders.The amount distributed in any of the above cases will be reduced by any amount we or the share depositary are required to withhold on account of taxes.Conversion and ExchangeIf any share underlying the depositary shares is subject to provisions relating to its conversion or exchange as set forth in an applicable prospectus supplement  each record holder of depositary shares will have the right or obligation to convert or exchange those depositary shares pursuant to those provisions.Redemption of Depositary SharesWhenever we redeem a share held by the share depositary  the share depositary will redeem as of the same redemption date a proportionate number of depositary shares representing the shares that were redeemed. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to the aggregate redemption price payable with respect to the15number of shares underlying the depositary shares. If fewer than all the depositary shares are to be redeemed  the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by lot or proportionately as we may determine.After the date fixed for redemption  the depositary shares called for redemption will no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of the depositary shares will cease  except the right to receive the redemption price.VotingUpon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of any shares underlying the depositary shares are entitled to vote  the share depositary will mail the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the depositary receipts. Each record holder of the depositary receipts on the record date (which will be the same date as the record date for the shares) may then instruct the share depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the number of shares underlying that holder‚Äôs depositary shares. The share depositary will try to vote the number of shares underlying the depositary shares in accordance with the instructions  and we will agree to take all reasonable action which the share depositary deems necessary to enable the share depositary to do so. The share depositary will abstain from voting the shares to the extent that it does not receive specific written instructions from holders of depositary receipts representing the share.Record DateWhenever¬∑ any cash dividend or other cash distribution becomes payable  any distribution other than cash is made  or any rights  preferences or privileges are offered with respect to the shares; or¬∑ the share depositary receives notice of any meeting at which holders of shares are entitled to vote or of which holders of shares are entitled to notice  or of the mandatory conversion of or any election by us to call for the redemption of any share the share depositary will in each instance fix a record date (which will be the same as the record date for the shares) for the determination of the holders of depositary receipts:¬∑ who will be entitled to receive dividend  distribution  rights  preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of any sale; or¬∑ who will be entitled to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of the meeting or the redemption or conversion  subject to the provisions of the deposit agreement.Amendment and Termination of the Deposit AgreementWe and the share depositary may at any time agree to amend the form of depositary receipt and any provision of the deposit agreement. However  any amendment that materially and adversely alters the rights of holders of depositary shares will not be effective unless the amendment has been approved by the holders of at least a majority of the depositary shares then outstanding. The deposit agreement may be terminated by us or by the share depositary only if all outstanding shares have been redeemed or if a final distribution in respect of the underlying shares has been made to the holders of the depositary shares in connection with the liquidation  dissolution or winding up of us.Charges of Share DepositaryWe will pay all charges of the share depositary including charges in connection with the initial deposit of the shares  the initial issuance of the depositary receipts  the distribution of information to the holders of depositary receipts with respect to matters on which the share is entitled to vote  withdrawals of the share by the holders of depositary receipts or redemption or conversion of the share  except for taxes (including transfer taxes  if any) and other governmental charges and any other charges expressly provided in the deposit agreement to be at the expense of holders of depositary receipts or persons depositing shares.16NoticesThe depositary will forward to holders of depositary receipts all notices  reports and other communications  including proxy solicitation materials received from us  that are delivered to the depositary and that we are required to furnish to the holders of the shares underlying the depositary shares. In addition  the depositary will make available for inspection by holders of depositary receipts at the principal office of the depositary  and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable  any reports and communications we deliver to the depositary as the holder of the shares underlying the depositary shares.MiscellaneousNeither we nor the share depositary will be liable if either of us is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond our control in performing any obligations under the deposit agreement. The obligations of the share depositary under the deposit agreement are limited to performing its duties under the agreement without negligence or bad faith. Our obligations under the deposit agreement are limited to performing our duties in good faith.

As provided in Rule 430B  for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter  such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which the prospectus relates  and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.II-2Provided  however  that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will  as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date  supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.(5) That  for the purpose of determining liability of the Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities  the undersigned Registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned Registrant pursuant to this registration statement  regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser  if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications  the undersigned Registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned Registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned Registrant;(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned Registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant; and(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned Registrant to the purchaser.(b) That  for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933  each filing of the Registrant‚Äôs annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and  where applicable  each filing of an employee benefit plan‚Äôs annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein  and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.(c) The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the trustee to act under subsection (a) of Section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the ‚ÄúTrust Indenture Act‚Äù) in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission under Section 305(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act.Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors  officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions  or otherwise  the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is  therefore  unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director  officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action  suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director  officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered  the Registrant will  unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent  submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.II-3EXHIBIT INDEX** To be filed by amendment or as an exhibit to a document to be incorporated by reference herein in connection with an offering of securities.II-4SIGNATURESPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933  the Registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing on Form S-3 and has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned  thereunto duly authorized  in the State of Delaware  on the 23rd day of May  2022.Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.

The Annual Report can be found at azerion.com/investorsCo-CEO Atilla Aytekin said: ‚ÄúPublishing our Annual Report is an important milestone for Azerion  following our listing at Euronext Amsterdam earlier in 2022. We look forward to continuing the engagements with the capital markets on the back of our Annual Report and our first quarter 2022 results announcement  planned for the end of May.‚ÄùThe Annual Report includes updated financial statements as compared to the preliminary unaudited financial results full year 2021 published on 28 February 2022. The updates to the figures are mainly associated with acquisition accounting  following the completion of the acquisition audits  as well as the accounting treatment of the business combination with European FinTech IPO Company 1 (EFIC1) that was completed on 1 February 2022  tax and the refinancing of the Company‚Äôs bonds in 2021.In the income statement  operating profit was lower by approximately EUR 9.2 million as compared to the preliminary results 2021  while EBITDA increased by some EUR 1.8 million  mainly driven by higher depreciation and amortisation  as well as lower gains from currency translation effects. As a result  the loss after tax for the year was higher by approximately EUR 9.1 million  as compared to the preliminary results 2021.The balance sheet‚Äôs assets increased by approximately EUR 15.8 million  mainly related to the completion of purchase price allocation of acquisitions. In addition  there was a reclassification of EUR 8.8 million associated with share appreciation rights related to acquisitions  from equity to other liabilities.The cash flow statement was updated with reclassifications totalling some EUR 8.2 million comprising the pay-out of contingent consideration from cash flow from operating activities to cash flow from investing activities and the repayment of borrowings to former owners of acquired companies from cash flow from financing activities to cash flow from investing activities. In addition  there was a reclassification of approximately EUR 10.5 million associated with costs of early settlement of bonds from cash flow from operating activities to cash flow from financing activities.Story continuesThe annual report and full year results of Azerion Holding B.V. cover the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 and therefore relate to a period prior to the completion of the business combination between EFIC1 and Azerion Holding B.V. on 1 February 2022. The annual report and full year results 2021 for Azerion Holding B.V. do therefore not comprise any accounts or results of Azerion Group N.V. for 2021.

Results show that bimekizumab addressed the debilitating joint symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis  while also providing high levels of skin clearance compared to placebo "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB. ""Importantly  the consistent findings seen across populations suggest that bimekizumab can provide a similar clinical response in patients that have an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF inhibitors  and in patients that are new to biologics.""""Today's findings from the BE OPTIMAL and BE COMPLETE studies provide clear evidence supporting the potential of bimekizumab  a dual IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor  in the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis. This painful  chronic condition can greatly impact patients' lives. Achieving minimal disease activity is an important goal of treatment  that can ultimately lead to improved quality of life for people with psoriatic arthritis "" said Joseph F. Merola  MD  MMSc  Associate Professor  Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.Data from BE COMPLETE (16-week analysis) and BE OPTIMAL (24-week interim analysis)Joint Symptoms: In both studies  patients treated with bimekizumab (160 mg every four weeks [Q4W]) achieved statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint of at least 50 percent or greater improvement from baseline in the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR50) at week 16  compared with placebo.1 2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  43.9 percent (n=189/431) of biologic na√Øve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 versus 10.0 percent (n=28/281) of patients on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  43.4 percent (n=116/267) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 versus 6.8 percent (n=9/133) of patients on placebo; p<0.001.2Skin Symptoms: In both studies  patients treated with bimekizumab achieved statistically significant improvements in levels of skin clearance  as measured by the ranked secondary endpoint of at least a 90 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI90) at week 16  compared with placebo.1.2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  61.3 percent (n=133/217) of biologic na√Øve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved PASI90 versus 2.9 percent (n=4/140) on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  68.8 percent (n=121/176) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved PASI90 versus 6.8 percent (n=6/88) on placebo; p<0.001.2Minimal Disease Activity: In both studies  a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved the ranked secondary endpoint of Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) response  compared with placebo at week 16.1 2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  45.0 percent (n=194/431) of biologic-na√Øve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA versus 13.2 (n=37/281) percent on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  44.2 percent (n=118/267) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA versus 6.0 percent (n=8/133) on placebo; p<0.001.2""In the BE OPTIMAL and BE COMPLETE studies  bimekizumab demonstrated clinically relevant improvements in musculoskeletal and skin outcomes for people with psoriatic arthritis compared with placebo. In addition  results from the BE OPTIMAL study show that treatment with bimekizumab was associated with inhibition of structural joint damage progression by week 16 "" said Iain McInnes  Professor  Vice Principal and Head of College  University of Glasgow  Scotland.Additional OutcomesIn BE OPTIMAL  treatment with bimekizumab compared with placebo was associated with a statistically significant inhibition of progression of structural joint damage at week 16  as measured by mean change from baseline in the van der Heijde modified Total Sharp Score (vdHmTSS)  a ranked secondary endpoint. 1The clinical response in both studies was rapid  with separation from placebo observed from week two in BE OPTIMAL (ACR20; p<0.001  nominal  not controlled for multiplicity) and week four in BE COMPLETE (ACR50; p<0.001  nominal  not controlled for multiplicity). 1 2In BE OPTIMAL  response rates continued to improve to week 24: 45.5 percent (n=196/431) of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 and 35.9 percent (n=101/281) of patients switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved ACR50  following an eight week treatment duration; 72.8 percent (n=158/217) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved PASI90 and 61.4 percent (n=86/140) of patients switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved PASI90; 48.5 percent (n=209/431) of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA and 37.7 percent (n=106/281) switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved MDA. 1An active reference arm of adalimumab was included in the BE OPTIMAL study. The study was not powered for statistical comparisons with the bimekizumab treatment group or placebo. At week 16  45.7 percent (n=64/140)  41.2 percent (n=28/68) and 45.0 percent (n=63/140) of patients treated with adalimumab achieved ACR50  PASI90 and MDA  respectively.1In BE OPTIMAL  over 16 weeks  59.9 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab had ‚â• one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) versus 49.5 percent of patients on placebo and 59.3 percent on adalimumab.1 The three most frequent TEAEs (‚â•5 percent in any treatment arm) were nasopharyngitis (9.3 percent for bimekizumab; 4.6 percent for placebo and 5.0 percent for adalimumab)  upper respiratory tract infection (4.9 percent for bimekizumab; 6.4 percent for placebo and 2.1 percent for adalimumab) and increased alanine aminotransferase (0.7 percent for bimekizumab; 0.7 percent for placebo and 5.0 percent for adalimumab).1 Candida infections were reported in 2.6 percent of bimekizumab-treated patients  0.7 percent on placebo and 0 percent on adalimumab.1 The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was low: 1.6 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab versus 1.1 percent on placebo and 1.4 percent on adalimumab.1 No cases of systemic candidiasis  inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or uveitis were reported.1In BE COMPLETE  over 16 weeks  40.1 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab had ‚â• one TEAE versus 33.3 percent of patients on placebo.2 The three most frequent TEAEs for patients treated with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis (3.7 percent; 0.8 percent for placebo)  oral candidiasis (2.6 percent; 0.0 percent for placebo)  and upper respiratory tract infection (2.2 percent; 1.5 percent for placebo).2 Two patients on bimekizumab discontinued treatment due to a TEAE (0.7 percent). The incidence of SAEs was low: 1.9 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab versus 0 percent on placebo  and none led to discontinuation.2 No cases of systemic candidiasis  IBD  MACE  venous thromboembolism (VTE)  or uveitis were reported.2About BE OPTIMALBE OPTIMAL is a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  active reference (adalimumab)  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis  who are biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug na√Øve.3 The study is ongoing with 24-week interim analysis presented above.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

Bimekizumab is not approved for use in nr-axSpA or AS by any regulatory authority worldwide. The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in nr-axSpA and AS have not been established.""We are pleased to share the first detailed data from our Phase 3 clinical program of bimekizumab in non-radiographic axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis  which showcase the clinical potential of bimekizumab to improve patient outcomes across the full spectrum of this debilitating disease "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB. ""People with axSpA often live with the condition for many years before diagnosis  with limited options available today to treat non-radiographic axSpA. We are driven to bring differentiated solutions that address unmet needs  and these results are an important step in our mission  setting the foundation for future regulatory discussions.""Story continuesBE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2: Phase 3 Study Results (24 weeks)1 2 In BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2  patients treated with bimekizumab (160 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]) achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the signs and symptoms of axSpA  as defined by the primary endpoint measure of Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) at week 16 compared to placebo.1 2 Response rates increased to week 24  and a rapid achievement of ASAS40 response was seen for patients switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16.1 2BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA): At week 16  47.7 percent (n=61/128) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS40 versus 21.4 percent (n=27/126) with placebo (p<0.001). 1BE MOBILE 2 (AS): At week 16  44.8 percent (n=99/221) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS40 versus 22.5 percent (n=25/111) with placebo (p<0.001).2""Today's findings from the BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 studies provide clear evidence supporting the potential of bimekizumab in both nr-axSpA and AS  and highlight the meaningful clinical outcomes that can be achieved by targeting IL-17F in addition to IL-17A. Patients with nr-axSpA and AS have a similar burden of disease and a treatment that could potentially show consistent outcomes across the full spectrum of disease is encouraging "" said Professor Atul Deodhar  MD  MRCP  Professor of Medicine  Division of Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases  Oregon Health & Science University.In both studies  at week 16  patients treated with bimekizumab achieved statistically significant improvements in all ranked secondary endpoints compared with placebo  including ASAS partial remission (ASAS-PR)  disease activity as measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)  physical function as measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)  and quality of life as measured by Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) questionnaire.1 2BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA):At week 16  25.8 percent (n=33/128) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS-PR versus 7.1 percent (n=9/126) of patients with placebo (p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASDAI (-3.1 bimekizumab versus -1.5 placebo  p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASFI (-2.5 bimekizumab versus -1.0 placebo  p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in ASQoL (-5.2 bimekizumab versus -2.5 placebo  p<0.001).1BE MOBILE 2 (AS):At week 16  24.0 percent (n=53/221) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS-PR versus 7.2 percent (n=8/111) of patients with placebo (p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASDAI (-2.9 bimekizumab versus -1.9 placebo  p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASFI (-2.2 bimekizumab versus -1.1 placebo  p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in ASQoL (-4.9 bimekizumab versus -3.2 placebo  p<0.001).2Other efficacy outcomes assessed in BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 included changes in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) states and changes in inflammation in the sacroiliac joints and spine as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).1 2 At the start of both studies  almost all patients (>97 percent) had high or very high disease activity.1 2 At week 24  in both studies  approximately half of the patients treated with bimekizumab from the start of each study achieved ASDAS low disease activity defined as ASDAS<2.1.1 2 Treatment with bimekizumab also resulted in substantial reductions in inflammation in the sacroiliac joints and spine for both AS and nr-axSpA patients at week 16.1 2Professor D√©sir√©e van der Heijde  Professor of Rheumatology  Leiden University Medical Center  Leiden  the Netherlands  said  ""Patients with axSpA live with a range of debilitating symptoms including chronic back pain and difficulties performing everyday tasks. These interim results from the BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 studies are encouraging  showing that treatment with bimekizumab versus placebo improved signs and symptoms  reduced disease activity and inflammation  and improved physical function. We look forward to the 52-week results from these studies expected later this year.""In BE MOBILE 1  the most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) over 16 weeks with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis (9.4 percent)  upper respiratory tract infection (7.0 percent) and oral candidiasis (3.1 percent).1 In BE MOBILE 2  the most common TEAEs over 16 weeks were nasopharyngitis (7.7 percent)  headache (4.1 percent) and oral candidiasis (4.1 percent).2 Up to 16 weeks  the incidence of serious adverse events was low with bimekizumab in both studies (0 percent in BE MOBILE 1 and 1.8 percent in BE MOBILE 2).1 2 In BE MOBILE 1  no cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were reported with patients taking bimekizumab.1 In BE MOBILE 2  two IBD cases (0.9 percent) occurred in patients treated with bimekizumab.2BE AGILE Phase 2b Open-Label Extension: 3 Year Study Results3Post-hoc analyses of the Phase 2b BE AGILE study and its open-label extension showed that treatment with bimekizumab (160 mg Q4W) provided maintenance of clinical responses over three years (156 weeks) in patients with active AS who initially responded at week 12  irrespective of the initial dosing regimen (160 mg Q4W  [N=60] or 320 mg Q4W  [N=61]).3 At week 12  40.3 percent of patients had achieved low disease activity (ASDAS<2.1)  and 89.2 percent of these patients maintained this low level of disease activity at week 156.3 Clinical response as measured by ASAS40 response was also sustained over three years  with 47.1 percent of patients having achieved ASAS40 at week 12  64.9 percent at week 48  and 71.9 percent at week 156.3About BE MOBILE 1BE MOBILE 1 is a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adult patients with active nr-axSpA.1 The study is ongoing with 24-week results presented above.

For additional details  visit BE AGILE 2 on clinicaltrials.gov.7About Axial SpondyloarthritisNon-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) falls under the umbrella of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  which also includes ankylosing spondylitis (AS).8 AxSpA is a painful chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and the joints linking the pelvis and lower spine (sacroiliac joints).8 nr-axSpA is defined clinically by the absence of definitive x-ray evidence of structural damage to the sacroiliac joints.8 The leading symptom of axSpA is inflammatory back pain that improves with exercise  but not with rest.8 Fatigue and stiffness are additional key symptoms. Other common clinical features frequently include acute anterior uveitis (eye inflammation)  enthesitis (inflammation of the points of insertion of tendons and ligaments into bone)  peripheral arthritis  psoriasis  inflammatory bowel disease (chronic inflammation of the digestive tract)  and dactylitis (inflammation of the fingers or toes).8 The overall prevalence of axSpA is 0.2 percent to 1.4 percent of adults in the U.S.9 10 Approximately half of all patients with axSpA are patients with nr-xSpA.8Approximately two-thirds of patients with AS are men  while nr-axSpA is more common among women with the disease.11 AxSpA onset usually occurs before the age of 45  often in the 20s.8 10 to 40 percent of patients with nr-axSpA progress to ankylosing spondylitis over 2 to 10 years.8About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.11 Bimekizumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of active axSpA with 24-week interim analysis results from the BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA) and BE MOBILE 2 (AS) studies to be presented at EULAR 2022.1 2 In addition  bimekizumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis with 24-week interim analysis from the BE OPTIMAL study and 16-week analysis from the BE COMPLETE study to be presented at EULAR 2022.12 13Bimekizumab is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults  and its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comCorporate CommunicationsAlly FunkT +1.678.365.6321email ally.funk@ucb.comBrand CommunicationsEimear O'BrienT +32.2.559.92.71email eimear.obrien@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

Bimekizumab is not approved for use in nr-axSpA or AS by any regulatory authority worldwide. The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in nr-axSpA and AS have not been established.""We are pleased to share the first detailed data from our Phase 3 clinical program of bimekizumab in non-radiographic axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis  which showcase the clinical potential of bimekizumab to improve patient outcomes across the full spectrum of this debilitating disease "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB. ""People with axSpA often live with the condition for many years before diagnosis  with limited options available today to treat non-radiographic axSpA. We are driven to bring differentiated solutions that address unmet needs  and these results are an important step in our mission  setting the foundation for future regulatory discussions.""BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2: Phase 3 Study Results (24 weeks)1 2 In BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2  patients treated with bimekizumab (160 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]) achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the signs and symptoms of axSpA  as defined by the primary endpoint measure of Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) at week 16 compared to placebo.1 2 Response rates increased to week 24  and a rapid achievement of ASAS40 response was seen for patients switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16.1 2BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA): At week 16  47.7 percent (n=61/128) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS40 versus 21.4 percent (n=27/126) with placebo (p<0.001). 1At week 16  47.7 percent (n=61/128) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS40 versus 21.4 percent (n=27/126) with placebo (p<0.001). BE MOBILE 2 (AS): At week 16  44.8 percent (n=99/221) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS40 versus 22.5 percent (n=25/111) with placebo (p<0.001).2""Today's findings from the BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 studies provide clear evidence supporting the potential of bimekizumab in both nr-axSpA and AS  and highlight the meaningful clinical outcomes that can be achieved by targeting IL-17F in addition to IL-17A. Patients with nr-axSpA and AS have a similar burden of disease and a treatment that could potentially show consistent outcomes across the full spectrum of disease is encouraging "" said Professor Atul Deodhar  MD  MRCP  Professor of Medicine  Division of Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases  Oregon Health & Science University.In both studies  at week 16  patients treated with bimekizumab achieved statistically significant improvements in all ranked secondary endpoints compared with placebo  including ASAS partial remission (ASAS-PR)  disease activity as measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)  physical function as measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)  and quality of life as measured by Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) questionnaire.1 2BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA):At week 16  25.8 percent (n=33/128) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS-PR versus 7.1 percent (n=9/126) of patients with placebo (p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASDAI (-3.1 bimekizumab versus -1.5 placebo  p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASFI (-2.5 bimekizumab versus -1.0 placebo  p<0.001). 1At week 16  mean change from baseline in ASQoL (-5.2 bimekizumab versus -2.5 placebo  p<0.001).1BE MOBILE 2 (AS):At week 16  24.0 percent (n=53/221) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved ASAS-PR versus 7.2 percent (n=8/111) of patients with placebo (p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASDAI (-2.9 bimekizumab versus -1.9 placebo  p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in BASFI (-2.2 bimekizumab versus -1.1 placebo  p<0.001). 2At week 16  mean change from baseline in ASQoL (-4.9 bimekizumab versus -3.2 placebo  p<0.001).2Other efficacy outcomes assessed in BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 included changes in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) states and changes in inflammation in the sacroiliac joints and spine as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).1 2 At the start of both studies  almost all patients (>97 percent) had high or very high disease activity.1 2 At week 24  in both studies  approximately half of the patients treated with bimekizumab from the start of each study achieved ASDAS low disease activity defined as ASDAS<2.1.1 2 Treatment with bimekizumab also resulted in substantial reductions in inflammation in the sacroiliac joints and spine for both AS and nr-axSpA patients at week 16.1 2Professor D√©sir√©e van der Heijde  Professor of Rheumatology  Leiden University Medical Center  Leiden  the Netherlands  said  ""Patients with axSpA live with a range of debilitating symptoms including chronic back pain and difficulties performing everyday tasks. These interim results from the BE MOBILE 1 and BE MOBILE 2 studies are encouraging  showing that treatment with bimekizumab versus placebo improved signs and symptoms  reduced disease activity and inflammation  and improved physical function. We look forward to the 52-week results from these studies expected later this year.""In BE MOBILE 1  the most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) over 16 weeks with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis (9.4 percent)  upper respiratory tract infection (7.0 percent) and oral candidiasis (3.1 percent).1 In BE MOBILE 2  the most common TEAEs over 16 weeks were nasopharyngitis (7.7 percent)  headache (4.1 percent) and oral candidiasis (4.1 percent).2 Up to 16 weeks  the incidence of serious adverse events was low with bimekizumab in both studies (0 percent in BE MOBILE 1 and 1.8 percent in BE MOBILE 2).1 2 In BE MOBILE 1  no cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were reported with patients taking bimekizumab.1 In BE MOBILE 2  two IBD cases (0.9 percent) occurred in patients treated with bimekizumab.2BE AGILE Phase 2b Open-Label Extension: 3 Year Study Results3Post-hoc analyses of the Phase 2b BE AGILE study and its open-label extension showed that treatment with bimekizumab (160 mg Q4W) provided maintenance of clinical responses over three years (156 weeks) in patients with active AS who initially responded at week 12  irrespective of the initial dosing regimen (160 mg Q4W  [N=60] or 320 mg Q4W  [N=61]).3 At week 12  40.3 percent of patients had achieved low disease activity (ASDAS<2.1)  and 89.2 percent of these patients maintained this low level of disease activity at week 156.3 Clinical response as measured by ASAS40 response was also sustained over three years  with 47.1 percent of patients having achieved ASAS40 at week 12  64.9 percent at week 48  and 71.9 percent at week 156.3About BE MOBILE 1BE MOBILE 1 is a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adult patients with active nr-axSpA.1 The study is ongoing with 24-week results presented above.

For additional details  visit BE AGILE 2 on clinicaltrials.gov.7About Axial SpondyloarthritisNon-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) falls under the umbrella of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  which also includes ankylosing spondylitis (AS).8 AxSpA is a painful chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and the joints linking the pelvis and lower spine (sacroiliac joints).8 nr-axSpA is defined clinically by the absence of definitive x-ray evidence of structural damage to the sacroiliac joints.8 The leading symptom of axSpA is inflammatory back pain that improves with exercise  but not with rest.8 Fatigue and stiffness are additional key symptoms. Other common clinical features frequently include acute anterior uveitis (eye inflammation)  enthesitis (inflammation of the points of insertion of tendons and ligaments into bone)  peripheral arthritis  psoriasis  inflammatory bowel disease (chronic inflammation of the digestive tract)  and dactylitis (inflammation of the fingers or toes).8 The overall prevalence of axSpA is 0.2 percent to 1.4 percent of adults in the U.S.9 10 Approximately half of all patients with axSpA are patients with nr-xSpA.8Approximately two-thirds of patients with AS are men  while nr-axSpA is more common among women with the disease.11 AxSpA onset usually occurs before the age of 45  often in the 20s.8 10 to 40 percent of patients with nr-axSpA progress to ankylosing spondylitis over 2 to 10 years.8About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.11 Bimekizumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of active axSpA with 24-week interim analysis results from the BE MOBILE 1 (nr-axSpA) and BE MOBILE 2 (AS) studies to be presented at EULAR 2022.1 2 In addition  bimekizumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis with 24-week interim analysis from the BE OPTIMAL study and 16-week analysis from the BE COMPLETE study to be presented at EULAR 2022.12 13Bimekizumab is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults  and its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email [email protected]Corporate CommunicationsAlly FunkT +1.678.365.6321email [email protected]Brand CommunicationsEimear O'BrienT +32.2.559.92.71email [email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

Results show that bimekizumab addressed the debilitating joint symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis  while also providing high levels of skin clearance compared to placebo "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB. ""Importantly  the consistent findings seen across populations suggest that bimekizumab can provide a similar clinical response in patients that have an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF inhibitors  and in patients that are new to biologics.""""Today's findings from the BE OPTIMAL and BE COMPLETE studies provide clear evidence supporting the potential of bimekizumab  a dual IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor  in the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis. This painful  chronic condition can greatly impact patients' lives. Achieving minimal disease activity is an important goal of treatment  that can ultimately lead to improved quality of life for people with psoriatic arthritis "" said Joseph F. Merola  MD  MMSc  Associate Professor  Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.Data from BE COMPLETE (16-week analysis) and BE OPTIMAL (24-week interim analysis)Joint Symptoms: In both studies  patients treated with bimekizumab (160 mg every four weeks [Q4W]) achieved statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint of at least 50 percent or greater improvement from baseline in the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR50) at week 16  compared with placebo.1 2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  43.9 percent (n=189/431) of biologic na√Øve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 versus 10.0 percent (n=28/281) of patients on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  43.4 percent (n=116/267) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 versus 6.8 percent (n=9/133) of patients on placebo; p<0.001.2Skin Symptoms: In both studies  patients treated with bimekizumab achieved statistically significant improvements in levels of skin clearance  as measured by the ranked secondary endpoint of at least a 90 percent improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI90) at week 16  compared with placebo.1.2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  61.3 percent (n=133/217) of biologic na√Øve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved PASI90 versus 2.9 percent (n=4/140) on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  68.8 percent (n=121/176) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved PASI90 versus 6.8 percent (n=6/88) on placebo; p<0.001.2Minimal Disease Activity: In both studies  a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved the ranked secondary endpoint of Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) response  compared with placebo at week 16.1 2In BE OPTIMAL  at week 16  45.0 percent (n=194/431) of biologic-na√Øve patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA versus 13.2 (n=37/281) percent on placebo; p<0.001. 1In BE COMPLETE  at week 16  44.2 percent (n=118/267) of TNF-inadequate responder patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA versus 6.0 percent (n=8/133) on placebo; p<0.001.2""In the BE OPTIMAL and BE COMPLETE studies  bimekizumab demonstrated clinically relevant improvements in musculoskeletal and skin outcomes for people with psoriatic arthritis compared with placebo. In addition  results from the BE OPTIMAL study show that treatment with bimekizumab was associated with inhibition of structural joint damage progression by week 16 "" said Iain McInnes  Professor  Vice Principal and Head of College  University of Glasgow  Scotland.Additional OutcomesIn BE OPTIMAL  treatment with bimekizumab compared with placebo was associated with a statistically significant inhibition of progression of structural joint damage at week 16  as measured by mean change from baseline in the van der Heijde modified Total Sharp Score (vdHmTSS)  a ranked secondary endpoint. 1The clinical response in both studies was rapid  with separation from placebo observed from week two in BE OPTIMAL (ACR20; p<0.001  nominal  not controlled for multiplicity) and week four in BE COMPLETE (ACR50; p<0.001  nominal  not controlled for multiplicity). 1 2In BE OPTIMAL  response rates continued to improve to week 24: 45.5 percent (n=196/431) of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved ACR50 and 35.9 percent (n=101/281) of patients switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved ACR50  following an eight week treatment duration; 72.8 percent (n=158/217) of bimekizumab-treated patients achieved PASI90 and 61.4 percent (n=86/140) of patients switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved PASI90; 48.5 percent (n=209/431) of patients treated with bimekizumab achieved MDA and 37.7 percent (n=106/281) switching from placebo to bimekizumab at week 16 achieved MDA. 1An active reference arm of adalimumab was included in the BE OPTIMAL study. The study was not powered for statistical comparisons with the bimekizumab treatment group or placebo. At week 16  45.7 percent (n=64/140)  41.2 percent (n=28/68) and 45.0 percent (n=63/140) of patients treated with adalimumab achieved ACR50  PASI90 and MDA  respectively.1In BE OPTIMAL  over 16 weeks  59.9 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab had ‚â• one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) versus 49.5 percent of patients on placebo and 59.3 percent on adalimumab.1 The three most frequent TEAEs (‚â•5 percent in any treatment arm) were nasopharyngitis (9.3 percent for bimekizumab; 4.6 percent for placebo and 5.0 percent for adalimumab)  upper respiratory tract infection (4.9 percent for bimekizumab; 6.4 percent for placebo and 2.1 percent for adalimumab) and increased alanine aminotransferase (0.7 percent for bimekizumab; 0.7 percent for placebo and 5.0 percent for adalimumab).1 Candida infections were reported in 2.6 percent of bimekizumab-treated patients  0.7 percent on placebo and 0 percent on adalimumab.1 The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was low: 1.6 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab versus 1.1 percent on placebo and 1.4 percent on adalimumab.1 No cases of systemic candidiasis  inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or uveitis were reported.1In BE COMPLETE  over 16 weeks  40.1 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab had ‚â• one TEAE versus 33.3 percent of patients on placebo.2 The three most frequent TEAEs for patients treated with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis (3.7 percent; 0.8 percent for placebo)  oral candidiasis (2.6 percent; 0.0 percent for placebo)  and upper respiratory tract infection (2.2 percent; 1.5 percent for placebo).2 Two patients on bimekizumab discontinued treatment due to a TEAE (0.7 percent). The incidence of SAEs was low: 1.9 percent of patients treated with bimekizumab versus 0 percent on placebo  and none led to discontinuation.2 No cases of systemic candidiasis  IBD  MACE  venous thromboembolism (VTE)  or uveitis were reported.2About BE OPTIMALBE OPTIMAL is a randomized  multicenter  double-blind  placebo-controlled  active reference (adalimumab)  parallel-group  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis  who are biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug na√Øve.3 The study is ongoing with 24-week interim analysis presented above.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership.

Any such re-registration would need to be effected by Thursday 9 June 2022. Shareholders should therefore liaise with and instruct their nominees well in advance thereof.To be entitled to attend and vote in person at the Meeting  shareholders must notify Euroclear Sweden AB of their intention to attend the Meeting by Thursday 9 June 2022 and can do so by (i) e-mail to [email protected] com or (ii) mail to: Kambi Group plc  c/o Euroclear Sweden AB  Box 191  SE-101 23 Stockholm  Sweden or (iii) by phone on +46 8 402 9092 during the office hours of Euroclear Sweden AB.

For the purposes of Article 88(7) of the Companies Act  through this resolution the members of the Company are also authorising the Board of Directors to restrict or withdraw the members‚Äô right of pre-emption that would normally entitle members to be offered the newly issued shares in the Company in proportion to their shareholding before such new shares are offered to third parties.Agenda item 8 (Resolution b)The Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition by the Company of its own shares shall take place on First North Growth Market at Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares to all members of the Company.

Notification of any purchase will be made to First North Growth Market at Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company‚Äôs annual report and accounts. Any resolution to repurchase own shares will be publicly disclosed. The objective of the buyback and transfer right is to ensure added value for the Company‚Äôs shareholders and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company‚Äôs capital structure.Following such buybacks  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or transfer to employees under a company share incentive plan. Once repurchased  further shareholder and Bondholder approval would be required before those shares could be cancelled.If used as consideration for an acquisition the intention would be that they would be issued as shares and not sold first.,neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,mixed,0.27,0.23,0.5,True,English,"['Kambi Group Plc Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Notice', 'General Meetings section', 'other supporting documents', 'Kambi Group plc', 'third party representative', 'Euroclear Sweden AB', 'daytime telephone number', 'corporate identification number', 'Aggregated attendance notifications', 'minutes Special Business', 'voting instructions sheet', 'EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING', 'other resolution', 'authorised representative', 'Thursday 30 June', 'H√§lsingegatan', 'Thursday 9 June', 'office hours', 'particular resolution', 'two persons', 'Extraordinary Resolutions', 'voting list', 'signatory right', 'proxy form', 'proxy data', 'Reading Time', 'respective nominee', 'additional information', 'personal data', 'authorised attorney', 'authorised officer', 'original power', 'following Agenda', 'company number', 'Company website', 'email address', 'Shareholders‚Äô right', '6 minutes', 'terms', 'Articles', 'Association', 'NOTICE', '11.00 CEST', 'Stockholm', 'registration', '10.30 CEST', 'purpose', 'determination', 'votes', 'register', 'members', 'shares', 'name', 'order', 'nominees', 'advance', 'intention', 'Box', 'details', 'proxies', 'case', 'stead', 'connection', 'processing', 'behalf', 'individual', 'appointer', 'corporation', 'discretion', 'accordance', 'indication', 'copy', 'manner', 'Board', 'Directors', 'appointment', 'default', 'Opening', 'Election', 'Chairman', 'approval', '113', '+46']",2022-05-24,2022-05-24,europeangaming.eu

Known as ‚Äòblank check companies‚Äô  SPACs are publicly trad‚Ä¶,Special purpose acquisition companies‚Äîknown as SPACs‚Äîhave been all the rage in the world of investment for the last two years  and they‚Äôve made a mark in the media space  but is the trend slowing down?Known as ‚Äòblank check companies‚Äô  SPACs are publicly traded investment vehicles that raise capital solely to acquire existing companies. They are often fronted by a well-known figure and are seen as a simpler alternative to going public via an IPO. They can also provide everyman investors with an opportunity to tap into the high growth that some companies experience in their early years. At the same time  of course  a disappointing debut can register significant losses.In some instances  SPACs will be announced with specific investment targets in mind  like when Virgin Galactic completed a successful SPAC merger in 2019 and launched a trend of similar endeavours across the past two years. On other occasions  the SPAC will launch without disclosing specific targets  instead offering investors insight into its wider strategy.Deadline Disruptors At Cannes: Read Them All HereLast year  former Reliance Entertainment CEO Shibasish Sarkar  one of the biggest names in the Indian media landscape  left the company to launch his own SPAC  International Media Acquisition Corp. The company is targeting major moves in the local entertainment space and had a successful $230 million IPO on the Nasdaq in August. In an interview with Deadline in December  Sarkar said he was targeting acquisitions in three areas and would be closing the first deals ahead of the deadline of July 2022. ‚ÄúWe want to be active in three spaces: production companies‚Äîwhether film  television or animation‚Äîto create the largest content creation company in India; the exhibition space  where the objective is to be a meaningful player in the industry  the third or fourth biggest; and the opportunity of taking a meaningful position in a streaming platform ‚Äù Sarkar says.Iris Knobloch WarnerMediaAlso last year  Iris Knobloch  a former WarnerMedia president in Europe (and the newly announced incoming president of the Cannes Film Festival)  left the company after 25 years to launch a $300 million SPAC via Euronext Paris with backing from French billionaire Fran√ßois-Henri Pinault‚Äôs Artemis. Named I2PO  the company is the first of its kind to target the European entertainment and leisure industries. ‚ÄúEurope is home to many solid companies with high potential in this sector  which  through the contribution of capital  resources and expertise by I2PO  will have the necessary support to take their business to the next level ‚Äù Knobloch said at the time. ‚ÄúI see a huge opportunity to consolidate a fragmented market and to go beyond Europe into other markets.‚ÄùI2PO recently confirmed its first deal: a merger agreement to take French music streaming service Deezer public at a $1.1 billion valuation. Pinault described the move as an opportunity to ‚Äúdevelop Deezer as the leading independent music streaming platform through strong positions in selected key markets‚Äù.However  there have been numerous cautionary tales in the SPAC space in the last 12 months.Former Disney exec pair Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs  along with retired basketball star Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal  raised $350 million for their SPAC Forest Road Acquisition Corp II in March last year  and quickly closed a merger deal to take fitness companies The Beachbody Company and Myx Fitness Holdings public. After an initial bounce  the combined entity has since tumbled 80% in value and is struggling to recover  serving as a warning that these big-capital deals can also go sour.Read the digital edition of Deadline‚Äôs Cannes/Disruptors magazine for 2022 hereDigital media outfit Buzzfeed went public via SPAC merger in December but its share price underperformed. Following an earnings report in Q1 this year that fell short of what the company had promised investors when launching its SPAC  pressure from those who had bought shares led to cuts in Buzzfeed‚Äôs news division  with some reportedly urging CEO Jonah Peretti to close down the Pulitzer Prize-winning news team entirely.In turn  the Buzzfeed example appears to have made several other digital media companies wary of pursuing their own proposed SPACs. Long-standing chatter about both Vox Media and Vice Media going public via SPAC has quieted in the last few months.There may have been some choppy waters for SPACs over the previous year  but the trend looks set to continue. OnlyFans  the social media platform famed for its adult content  has held talks about going public via a SPAC merger  while Asian financing bigwig Jason Wong  known as ‚Äòthe godfather of SPACs‚Äô in Asia  recently predicted that Hong Kong could see at least 40 blank-check investment vehicles launched in the city in 2022.,neutral,0.03,0.71,0.25,mixed,0.08,0.16,0.76,True,English,"['Special Purpose Acquisition Companies', 'Media Space', 'Deadline Disruptors', 'The', 'SPAC Forest Road Acquisition Corp II', 'Asian financing bigwig Jason Wong', 'leading independent music streaming platform', 'several other digital media companies', 'International Media Acquisition Corp', 'Former Disney exec pair', 'Special purpose acquisition companies', 'French music streaming service', 'Pulitzer Prize-winning news team', 'former Reliance Entertainment CEO', 'largest content creation company', 'CEO Jonah Peretti', 'Digital media outfit', 'social media platform', 'former WarnerMedia president', 'Indian media landscape', 'numerous cautionary tales', 'Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal', 'blank check companies', 'many solid companies', 'Myx Fitness Holdings', 'past two years', 'local entertainment space', 'Fran√ßois-Henri Pinault', '40 blank-check investment vehicles', 'The Beachbody Company', 'successful $230 million IPO', 'Iris Knobloch WarnerMedia', 'successful SPAC merger', 'last two years', 'specific investment targets', 'Cannes Film Festival', 'digital edition', 'media space', 'fitness companies', 'other occasions', 'specific targets', 'French billionaire', 'European entertainment', 'other markets', 'news division', 'Vox Media', 'Vice Media', 'adult content', 'existing companies', 'production companies', '$300 million SPAC', 'incoming president', 'SPAC space', 'early years', 'exhibition space', 'merger agreement', 'merger deal', 'simpler alternative', 'high growth', 'disappointing debut', 'significant losses', 'Virgin Galactic', 'similar endeavours', 'wider strategy', 'biggest names', 'major moves', 'three areas', 'first deals', 'three spaces', 'meaningful player', 'meaningful position', 'Euronext Paris', 'leisure industries', 'high potential', 'necessary support', 'next level', 'fragmented market', '$1.1 billion valuation', 'strong positions', 'key markets', 'Kevin Mayer', 'Tom Staggs', 'basketball star', 'March last', 'initial bounce', 'combined entity', 'big-capital deals', 'Cannes/Disruptors magazine', 'share price', 'earnings report', 'Long-standing chatter', 'choppy waters', 'previous year', 'Hong Kong', 'same time', 'Deezer public', 'last 12 months', 'everyman investors', 'Shibasish Sarkar', 'Buzzfeed example', 'Deadline Disruptors', 'huge opportunity', '25 years', 'SPACs', 'rage', 'world', 'trend', 'figure', 'instances', 'mind', 'insight', 'Nasdaq', 'August', 'interview', 'December', 'acquisitions', 'July', 'television', 'animation', 'objective', 'industry', 'backing', 'Artemis', 'kind', 'sector', 'contribution', 'resources', 'expertise', 'I2PO', 'business', 'value', 'warning', 'Q1', 'pressure', 'shares', 'cuts', 'turn', 'proposed', 'OnlyFans', 'talks', 'godfather', 'city', '2022']",2022-05-24,2022-05-24,deadline.com

When trialling Orizon on 10 residents at the German nursing home  the time caregivers spent on incontinence care reduced by a total of 3.2 hours a day  and 7 diapers were saved each day. The residents also got at least 8 hours of sleep per night because their diapers no longer required checking for saturation. In nursing homes checking residents through the night is a common routine that means many residents are unnecessarily woken and disturbed during their sleep.Michael Schildt  director of the nursing home  said  ""Orizon has enabled residents to live an even more self-determined life and have a more comfortable daily routine. Especially with incontinence  this is very important for well-being. In addition  colleagues had more time for conversations and encounters - that's also a big advantage.""The gain in time and comfort came from the fact that leakages were avoided  saving approximately 10 minutes of 2 nurses per wet bed  incontinence products only needed to be changed when necessary and residents were no longer unnecessarily disturbed at night. It was also noted that no more products leaked during the day or night  eliminating the need for additional bedding changes.About the field studyBetween February 21 and March 18  2022  Ontex conducted a field study of its Orizon service with the help of 10 nursing home residents and 25 caregivers at the Palmscher Garten nursing home in the town of Deizisau  Germany. The field study helped provide insights into leakage reduction  ease of use and impact on caregivers and residents. The results of the study showed a 100% reduction in daytime and night-time leakage and an overall reduction in the negative impact of leakage  including the elimination of bed linen changes due to urine leakage.Europe-wide market launch at the turn of the yearIn addition to Germany  Ontex has run pilot projects in Belgium and France and will soon start pilot project in Italy and the UK. Ontex plans to launch the digital incontinence management service across Europe in late 2022/early 2023. Ontex launches the service under the new Orizon brand with its incontinence brands Serenity and iD  and will benefit from existing brand recognition and a strong reputation in European nursing homes.Unlike most of Ontex's existing incontinence brands and services  Orizon is based on a monthly fee. With the introduction of Orizon  Ontex aims to optimize the overall cost of continence care by reducing waste  linen costs and staff time spent on continence care.Incontinence: a common condition in the aging populationIncontinence is a very common condition  especially among the elderly in hospitals and nursing homes. Incontinence is one of the most common conditions in elderly care facilities and one of the most important components of facility care costs. Approximately 80% of nursing home residents suffer from some form of incontinence  according to Ontex nursing home order data.According to research by the World Health Organization[1]  between 10% and 36% of people over the age of 60 are affected by incontinence and use incontinence products. Although incontinence is most common in the elderly  all age groups are affected.The 60+ age group is expected to increase from nearly 1 billion people worldwide [2] today to nearly 2.1 billion by 2050 [3]  further straining healthcare systems around the world. Orizon aims to reinvent continence care in partnership with caregivers to make care simpler and easier as the global population ages.[1] Between 9.9% and 36.1% of the population over 60 years of age is reported to suffer from incontinence.

(‚ÄúAir France-KLM‚Äù  the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) announces today the launch of a capital increase with preferential subscription rights (the ""Rights"") to existing shareholders maintained to raise gross proceeds of ‚Ç¨2.256 billion (the ‚ÄúRights Issue‚Äù) through the issuance of 1 928 million new shares in Air France-KLM (the ‚ÄúNew Shares‚Äù)  to be subscribed in cash and/or by offsetting claims.This transaction  which aims to strengthen the company‚Äôs equity and balance sheet  follows the 2021 capital increase and comes after new recapitalization measures were announced on February 17th.The net proceeds of the issue will be allocated to repaying the deeply subordinated bonds issued in April 2021 and held by the French State as well as strengthening the Company‚Äôs equity. As announced at full-year results on February 17 th 2022  the Company intends to free itself from the conditions set by the European Commission‚Äôs temporary framework and will therefore allocate circa 1.7 billion euros to the repayment of the ""Covid-19 recapitalization aid"" granted in the form of undated subordinated notes (the "" TSS √âtat "") issued in April 2021. The remainder will be allocated to reduce the Company‚Äôs net indebtedness.This operation  together with the other contemplated measures to strengthen the balance sheet and the expected EBITDA recovery  will enable the Company to strengthen its financial trajectory. The Company‚Äôs sound financial liquidity position (‚Ç¨10.8 billion of cash at hand as of March 31 st 2022) in a better oriented operational context for the Company  will enable the Company to further repay the French State Aid over the next quarters. The repayment of the State Aid will also improve the financing costs of the Company.The Company confirms its objective to reduce its Net debt / EBITDA ratio  to reach circa 2.0x to 2.5x by 2023.The French State  Air France-KLM‚Äôs largest shareholder (28.6%)  has informed the Company of its intention to participate in the Rights Issue  so that its post-transaction shareholding remains unchanged. This subscription  should it occur  would be completed through offsetting claims held by the French State in respect of the deeply subordinated notes (TSS Etat) issued in April 2021 for an amount of circa 645 million euro.The Dutch State has informed the Company that it intends to exercise its rights in proportion to its current shareholding in order for its shareholding to remain unchanged post Rights Issue  subject to obtaining the necessary approvals from the Dutch Parliament. In order to receive these necessary approvals in a timely manner  the Dutch State is also dependent on the timetable of the Dutch parliament.The transaction will enable CMA CGM to become a new reference shareholder and an exclusive strategic partner for the cargo business  as announced on May 18 th . CMA CGM has committed to subscribe to the transaction for a maximum amount of ‚Ç¨400 million (including the acquisition of Rights) and in such a way that its total shareholding does not exceed 9% of the Company‚Äôs resulting share capital.China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines have committed to participate in the Rights Issue on a cash neutral basis by subscribing to new shares through the sale of part of their Rights  using the net proceeds from selling Rights to CMA CGM.Story continuesBenjamin Smith  CEO of Air France ‚Äì KLM  has stated that ‚ÄúThe operation we are launching today is the result of the work we have been doing for several months to consolidate our balance sheet  strengthen our financial autonomy and regain strategic and operational flexibility. As the recovery continues and our economic performance recovers  in particular thanks to our ambitious transformation plan and the structural benefits it continues to deliver  we want to be in a position to seize any opportunity in a changing aviation sector and to be able to accelerate our environmental commitments. I would like to thank our main shareholders for their renewed support in this operation  and I am also delighted to welcome CMA CGM to our capital  as a new reference shareholder and industrial partner in our cargo activities.‚ÄùKey terms and rationale of the transaction:Subscription price: ‚Ç¨1.17 per new shareSubscription parity: 3 new shares per 1 existing shareTheoretical value of the preferential subscription right: ‚Ç¨2.345Preferential subscription rights trading period: from 25 May 2022 to 7 June 2022  inclusiveSubscription period: from 27 May 2022 to 9 June 2022  inclusiveSubscription commitments: ‚Ç¨359 923 919 i.e. 15.96% of the total amount of the transaction (excluding the French State and the Dutch State intentions)The Rights Issue will be carried out with preservation of shareholders‚Äô preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the 20th resolution of the combined general meeting of the Company‚Äôs shareholders of 26 May 2021  and will result in the issuance of 1 927 902 102 New Shares at a subscription price of ‚Ç¨1.17 per share (i.e.  a nominal value of ‚Ç¨1  plus an issue premium of ‚Ç¨0.17)  to be fully paid up upon subscription  representing gross proceeds  including the issue premium  of ‚Ç¨2 255 645 459.34.Holders of existing ordinary shares of the Company (the ‚ÄúShares‚Äù) recorded on their accounts as of the end of the accounting day on 24 May 2022 will be entitled to receive Rights which will be detached from the underlying Shares on 25 May 2022. Existing Shares of the Company will therefore trade ex-right from 25 May  2022. Each existing Share of the Company will entitle its holder to receive one (1) Right. 1 Right will entitle their holders to subscribe for 3 New Shares on an irreducible basis (√† titre irr√©ductible)  at a subscription price of ‚Ç¨1.17 per Share.Subscriptions on a reducible basis (√† titre r√©ductible) will be accepted. Any New Shares not subscribed by subscriptions on an irreducible basis (√† titre irr√©ductible) will be distributed and allocated to the holders of the Rights having submitted additional subscription orders on a reducible basis (√† titre r√©ductible) subject to reduction in the event of oversubscription.Based on the closing price of Air France-KLM stock on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris on 20 May 2022  i.e.  ‚Ç¨4.296  the theoretical value of 1 Right is ‚Ç¨2.345 and the theoretical value of the ex-right share is ‚Ç¨1.951.For information purposes  the subscription price for the New Shares of ‚Ç¨1.17 per share reflects a discount of 40% compared to the theoretical value of the Company‚Äôs ex-right share price  calculated on the basis of closing price on 20 May 2022  and a discount of approximately 72.8% to this price.These values do not presume either the value of the Rights during their trading period or the ex-right value of the Company‚Äôs shares as recorded in the market.The Rights Issue will be open to the public in France only.Intentions and subscription commitments of the main shareholders and DirectorsThe French State  Air France-KLM‚Äôs largest shareholder (which holds 28.6% of the Company‚Äôs share capital and 28.1% of the voting rights) as of the date of this press release  has informed the board of directors of Air France ‚Äì KLM of its intention to participate on an irreducible basis up to the totality of its Rights  so that its shareholding after the completion of this Rights Issue remains unchanged. This subscription would be carried out by way of offsetting the deeply subordinated notes (TSS Etat) issued by the Company in April 2021. A part of the TSS Etat will also be reimbursed by a buyback following the completion of the Rights Issue.The Dutch State (which holds 9.3% of the Company‚Äôs share capital and 13.8% of the voting rights) has informed the Company that it intends to fully exercise its rights in proportion to its current shareholding in order for its shareholding post Rights Issue to remain unchanged  subject to obtaining the necessary approvals from the Dutch Parliament. In order to receive these necessary approvals in a timely manner  the Dutch State is also dependent on the timetable of the Dutch parliament.CMA CGM has entered on 22 May 2022 into a rights sale and purchase agreement with Delta Air Lines  China Eastern Airlines and the FCPEs respectively  so as to acquire a total of 70 996 722 Rights  and has committed toward Air France-KLM to (i) exercise these rights and subscribe to the Rights Issue on a irreducible basis for an amount of ‚Ç¨249 198 494.22 and to (ii) place a subscription order on a reducible basis for an additional number of up to 18 358 086 New Shares (or by exercising rights acquired in the market or off the market)  the total corresponding to a maximum of 9% of the share capital after the Rights Issue. This subscription commitment is subject to the condition that the total sum of the subscription price of the aforementioned New Shares increased by the total price of the Rights acquired by CMA CGM does not exceed 400 million euros and with no prejudice of the reduction rate which will be applied to the reducible orders.China Eastern Airlines  which holds 9.6% of the capital and 11.4% of voting rights of the Company  and Delta Air Lines  which holds 5.8% of the capital and 8.6% of the voting rights of the Company  have both committed to participate in the Rights Issue on a cash neutral basis through the sale of part of their Rights to the benefit of CMA CGM in a proportion allowing them to finance the exercise of the balance of their Rights by using the net proceeds of this sale (subject to rounding) for an aggregate amount representing ‚Ç¨110 725 424.55.The subscription commitments of CMA CGM (for the irreducible basis)  Delta Air Lines and China Eastern Airlines described hereabove are referred to as the ‚ÄúSubscription Commitments‚Äù.The FCPEs  which hold 2.4% of the capital and 3.6% of the voting rights of the Company  have notified their intention to participate in the Rights Issue on a cash neutral basis through the sale of part of their Rights to the benefit of CMA CGM in a proportion allowing them to partially finance the exercise of the balance of their Rights by using the net proceeds of this sale.The SPAAK (Stichting Piloten Aandelen Air France - KLM) which holds 1.7% of the capital and 2.5% of the voting rights of the Company  has notified their intention to participate in the Rights Issue on a cash neutral basis through the sale of part of its Rights in a proportion allowing them to finance the exercise of the balance of their Rights by using the net proceeds of this sale.The Subscription Commitments total approximately ‚Ç¨360 million and represent 15.96% of the amount of the Right Issue. The Subscription Commitments will respectively be terminated in the event the underwriting agreement entered into with the Underwriters (as such term is defined below) would itself be terminated. Moreover  the French State and the Dutch State have informed the Company that they intend to subscribe to the rights issue in proportion to their total respective number of Rights  representing an additional 37.94% to the amount of the rights issue.Lock-up commitmentsAir France-KLM has agreed to a lock-up period starting on the date of the signing of the underwriting agreement and expiring 180 calendar days following the settlement and delivery date of the New Shares  subject to certain exceptions.The French State  the Dutch State  China Eastern Airlines and Delta Airlines have entered into a lock-up agreement from the approval of the Prospectus by the AMF and until the expiration of a period of 90 calendar days following the date of settlement and delivery of the New Shares  subject to certain exceptions.CMA CGM has agreed with the Company on a lock-up commitment as from the settlement-delivery of the New Shares until the expiry of a three-year period following this date  being specified that CMA CGM may sell a maximum of 50% of the shares acquired in the context of the Rights Issue during an additional three-year period. This lock-up commitment will be terminated early if a firm and complete cooperation agreement in relation to air cargo is not concluded before December 1st 2022 or if such an agreement is terminated.In addition  CMA CGM committed to a 10-year period to not acquire or subscribe to any shares issued by the Company  unless such acquisition does not lead to an increase of its stake in the share capital of the Company  subject to certain exceptions. The undertaking specifies that at the end of a period of 5 years from the settlement-delivery of the New Shares  the Board of Directors of the Company may modify this undertaking in order to allow CMA CGM to increase its shareholding in the Company.Moreover  the major shareholders of Air France-KLM will support a resolution for the appointment of a representative of CMA CGM to the Board of Directors of Air France-KLM at the general shareholders' meeting to be held today.DilutionFor illustrative purposes only  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company‚Äôs share capital as of 24 May 2022  and not subscribing to the Rights Issue  would hold 0.25% of the Company‚Äôs share capital on a non-diluted basis following the Rights Issue.UnderwritingThe Rights Issue was subject to an underwriting agreement (the ‚ÄúUnderwriting Agreement‚Äù) entered into on 23 May 2022 between the Company and a syndicate of banks including Deutsche Bank  HSBC  Natixis  Cr√©dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale acting as Joint Global Coordinators  Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners (the ‚ÄúJoint Global Coordinators‚Äù)  ABN AMRO Bank N.V.

MUFG Securities (Europe) N.V. and SMBC Bank EU AG acting as co-lead managers (the ‚ÄúCo-Lead Managers‚Äù  and together with the Joint Global Coordinators and the Joint Bookrunners  the ‚ÄúUnderwriters‚Äù). Under the terms of this Underwriting Agreement  the Underwriters have undertaken  jointly and without joint and several liability  to subscribe for New Shares not subscribed for at the end of the subscription period  in such a way that the Capital Increase  after taking into account the Subscription Commitments  (on an irreducible basis only)  in cash up to a total amount of 359 923 918.77 euros  which represent 15.96% of the proposed issuance  is subscribed for in full. This agreement does not constitute a performance guarantee within the meaning of article L.225-145 of the French Commercial Code. This agreement may be terminated by the Global Coordinators on behalf of the Underwriters up to (and including) the settlement-delivery date  subject to certain conditions and in certain circumstances  in particular in the event of inaccuracy of the representations and warranties  failure by the Company to comply with one of its undertakings  non-fulfillment of the usual conditions precedent  a significant unfavorable change in the situation of the Company and its subsidiaries or the occurrence of national or international events.

After extensive validation work  Galapagos is moving selected targets into the next phase of drug development  triggering a milestone payment to Scipher and making Scipher eligible to receive additional payments for the achievement of regulatory and sales milestones.‚ÄúBy partnering with Scipher  we are effectively and efficiently identifying new targets to ultimately develop new therapies to address unmet needs of people with IBD ‚Äù said Richard Janssen  head of Search and Evaluation  at Galapagos.Spectra is fueled by one of the largest patient molecular data lakes in autoimmune diseases and unique artificial intelligence network science-based algorithms. The platform identifies biologically similar patients and drug targets that are specific to those patients to improve response rates.‚ÄúDrug development in autoimmune diseases is entering an era of precision medicine similar to what we have experienced in oncology in the past decade. There is a significant unmet medical need for drugs that target a specific disease population with higher clinical response rates ‚Äù said Alif Saleh  chief executive officer  at Scipher Medicine. ‚ÄúDriven by our access to large patient population molecular data  partnerships like the one with Galapagos can bring new and more effective treatments to diseases with currently low drug response rates or limited treatment options.‚ÄùAbout Scipher MedicineScipher Medicine  a precision immunology company matching each patient with their most effective therapy  believes that patients deserve simple answers to treatment options based on scientific data. Using Spectra‚Ñ¢  our proprietary network medicine platform  we commercialize tests revealing a person‚Äôs unique molecular disease signature and match it to the most effective therapy  ensuring optimal treatment from day one. The patient molecular data generated from our tests further supports the discovery and development of novel and more effective therapeutics.

The BIOFIRE¬Æ BCID2 Panel for rapid molecular diagnostic of bloodstream infection includes several additional pathogens  an expanded list of antimicrobial resistance genes  and many revised targets compared to the existing BIOFIRE¬Æ BCID Panel.Sepsis resulting from bloodstream infection is the 12th leading cause of death in Canadai. Each year  nearly 75 000 patients are diagnosed with a mortality rate of over 40%ii. Time to diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is imperative since for each hour that severe sepsis goes untreated  the average mortality rate increases by 7.6%iii.Julie √âmond  Vice-President & General Manager  bioM√©rieux Canada  said: ""BIOFIRE¬Æ BCID2 is a significant addition to our existing sepsis-related diagnostic offering  enabling clinicians to accelerate sepsis diagnosis and provide the right therapy faster  proven to improve survivorship.""Jessica Blavignac  Director of Scientific & Medical Affairs  bioM√©rieux Canada  added: ""Rapid molecular syndromic testing is literally a game changer. With sepsis  each hour counts. The BIOFIRE¬ÆBCID2 panel empowers small and large laboratories across Canada to shorten time to pathogen identification by up to 70%iv and to the optimal therapy initiation by 33.5 hoursv.

The most striking examples of this shift towards urbanization are the megacities which are home to 10 million-plus city dwellers who spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors  resulting in a profound disconnect from nature. The pandemic has further exacerbated this issue.""People crave a connection to nature  but we're restricted by our daily routines and city living "" said Felipe Ambra  Global Corona Vice President. ""Free Range Humans is a joyful celebration of people reconnecting with nature. To bring this to life  we'll create limited-time oases for city dwellers to experience how even a few minutes with nature can positively impact their physical and mental wellbeing.""In 2019  Corona Studios  a dynamic global content house which operates and markets Corona exclusively outside of the U.S.  launched Free Range Humans. Like the Corona brand  the series embraces nature and the beach and season one received more than 100 million views worldwide.Season two spotlights six new episodes featuring people from around the world who have broken free from daily confines to get closer to nature and have committed their lives to causes they care about.""Season one was based on an insight that people spend 90 percent of their lives indoors.** But only some of us follow the impulse to leave our desk jobs behind  to search for meaning outside "" said Nick Sonderup  of Corona's creative partner  Pereira O'Dell.

Thales  a leader in digital security  and triPica  creator of business support systems and user paths  have developed a mobile application that enables operators to provide their customers with an optimized and secure experience  facilitating  among other things  the management of their account in real time. Bouygues Telecom recently adopted this innovative and flexible solution when it launched its fully digital and responsible offer called ‚Äòsource‚Äô.Security and optimization of the customer journey are at the heart of the challenges of digital transformation. That‚Äôs why Thales has teamed up with triPica to bring the best of mobile technology to a simple and trusted user experience. Thales  with its expertise in identity management ‚Äì both physical and digital ‚Äì has integrated an identity verification step into the triPica end-to-end solution during subscriber registration. Technologically speaking  this involves combining the Thales ‚ÄòTrusted Digital ID‚Äô with triPica‚Äôs digital platform  the digital ‚ÄòBusiness Support System‚Äô.Indeed  any remote service provider that offers a full digital solution must be able to ensure that each new customer is who they claim to be  as soon as they register. The process involves capturing and verifying the authenticity of an official identity document  as well as a selfie to ensure the document matches the person registering.Once this step has been completed  users can freely define the subscription of their choice  manage their options and billing  and check their consumption directly from the mobile application. This is how Bouygues Telecom was able to offer its ‚Äòsource‚Äô package  and make it accessible in just a few clicks to any subscriber who wants to participate in the emergence of a more responsible and supportive digital world. The application  which makes it easy and secure to manage your mobile account  also allows you to financially support the associations of your choice  by accumulating ‚Äòwater droplets‚Äô for any unused gigabyte in your package.‚ÄúIt was important for Bouygues Telecom to offer an innovative and flexible solution. Thales ‚Äì supported by triPica‚Äôs telecom expertise ‚Äì were genuine partners who enabled us to quickly launch our ‚Äòsource‚Äô offer. A unique solution in the telecom market achieved in a very short time-frame and focused on a fully mobile and supportive user experience.‚Äù St√©phane Allaire  Director of Innovation  Bouygues Telecom‚ÄúWe are delighted to be partnering with Thales and to put our expertise in disruptive digital solutions at the service of the accelerated digitalization of operators' offers. Our technological commitment takes on its full meaning with ‚Äòsource‚Äô  a concrete and dedicated example of an innovative and responsible initiative.‚Äù Mathieu Horn  CEO  triPica‚ÄúFor years  Thales has been supporting mobile operators in their transitions  whether related to the development of the network  SIM card or the need for a fully digital solution. The user experience  identity management and the pleasure of using an intuitive and secure application are all key factors that  together with triPica  we place at the core of our innovations. We are particularly proud of the trust placed in us by Bouygues Telecom  who chose us for the launch of ‚Äòsource‚Äô.

Consequently  we remain committed to meet our full year management guidance of an organic revenue growth rate in our digital processing business of at least 25% year on year.‚ÄùKey financial figures (EUR million) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Change (%) Digital processing revenue ‚Äì organic 27.6 24.21 +13.9% Digital processing revenue ‚Äì acquired business 2.0 - - Postage & parcel optimisation revenue 16.5 15.6 +5.7% Group revenue 46.2 39.9 +15.7%Key business KPI‚Äôs (#) End Q1 2022 End Q4 2021 End Q3 2021 Customers 857 313 792 594 736 653 Companies in business network 1 615 062 1 504 895 1.319 225 Banqup customers 56 000 35 408 30 553 Organic growth (new subscriptions) 5 197 4 855 3 561 Migrated 15 395 - - Banqup customers Belgium (Billtobox) 31 848 28 864 24 324 Banqup customers France (JeFacture) 2 844 2 072 1 300Recurring digital processing revenue grew significantly by 19.3%Consolidated Group revenue in the first quarter of FY2022 increased by 15.7% to ‚Ç¨46.2 million  driven mainly by organic growth from digital processing revenue. This core business of Unifiedpost accounted for ‚Ç¨29.6 million  an increase of 22.3% y/y. Recurring digital revenue  i.e.  digital platform revenue excluding the project and licence business  showed a strong increase in growth momentum  as its organic growth rate grew significantly by 19.3% y/y compared to its growth rate of 6.7% in Q1 2021. Given the more volatile nature of the non-recurring project and licence business  the organic growth in total digital processing revenue reached 13.9% in Q1 2022 (Q1 2021: 10.1%).Postage & parcel optimisation revenue showed a sound growth rate of 5.7% y/y. Group-wide  due to the lower project business in the first three months of 2022  the share of recurring revenue increased to 96.3% of total revenue (FY2021: 92.8%).Customer base grew substantially by 8.2% in Q1In Q1 2022 Unifiedpost grew its customer base to 857 313 customers (+8.2% compared to YE2021). The consolidated business network expanded to over 1.6 million companies by the end of Q1 2022  representing an estimated 7% of businesses in Europe.The total number of Banqup customers grew to 56 000 (31 December 2021: 35 408). Banqup is Unifiedpost‚Äôs core SME-product allowing customers to create and send sales invoices  keep an overview of all (financial) documents and manage administration. A unique payment functionality was added to the product. The customer growth over the last three months includes migration effects  mainly from legacy platforms in the Baltics  amounting to 15 395 customers. Adjusting for such migrated users  the number of Banqup users increased by 5 197 in the three months up to 31 March 2022  supported by a very pleasing organic growth in markets like France  Serbia and in the Benelux.Within the French market  Unifiedpost sees the number of JeFacture customers increasing steadily. Management expects an exponential growth of customers including speeding up run rates. Already today  the number of processed documents broadly doubles every month.Overall average revenue per unit (ARPU) in digital processing business2 reached ‚Ç¨24.5. The decline in ARPU compared to FY2021 (‚Ç¨27.9) is predominantly due to two effects. The first one is a negative basis effect from the last quarter as that includes the licence revenue resulting from the project with the Serbian Government. The second one results from the significantly higher revenue contribution from Unifiedpost‚Äôs SME business with a structurally lower ARPU.Platform scalability and new ecosystems show promising resultsDuring the first quarter of FY2022  Unifiedpost Group continued to successfully launch its Banqup platform throughout Europe. The payment functionality was launched for the first-time outside Belgium. Unifiedpost laid the foundations for the payment infrastructure by obtaining regulatory approval in already 19 countries today to issue local payment accounts ‚Äì with own IBAN numbers. Unifiedpost is speeding up the roll-out of its payment services by further connecting major European banks to the platform. As of today  the payment functionality is live in 7 countries.The payment functionality is not only a crucial cornerstone in the unique product offering of Banqup. It will also enable Banqup customers to receive financing via assignment of receivables (factoring) and to improve their cash position. In February 2022  Unifiedpost agreed on a partnership with Izola Bank  allowing Banqup to offer invoice financing to customers in Belgium and in The Netherlands. Funding levels for the invoice finance services within the platform can currently add up to ‚Ç¨50 million. There is significant additional potential to further scale up this business model as Banqup will expand this functionality throughout all its European markets.Impact of macro-economic and geopolitical situationUnifiedpost has not been directly impacted by the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The Group has no business Ukraine  nor in Russia. It also has no development centres in these countries. There is no direct revenue from Russia or with Russian customers  as Unifiedpost is compliant with the EU sanctions. In Moldova  where Unifiedpost employs about 90 people  Group management is closely monitoring the situation and different scenarios have already been prepared to secure our local workforce and the business continuity in case of escalation.Financing provides flexibility to secure growth plansOn 7 March 2022  Unifiedpost signed a ‚Ç¨100 million five-year loan facility provided by Francisco Partners  a leading global investment firm that specializes in partnering with technology-enabled businesses. Francisco Partners obtained an equity commitment fee of 3% of the share capital of Unifiedpost and the loan bears a 3% cash interest and 8% interest paid in kind. Unifiedpost has drawn ‚Ç¨75 million  of which ‚Ç¨25 million is being used as a buffer for the potential negative consequences of the macro-economic and geopolitical situation. This leaves the Group with ‚Ç¨50 million of which ‚Ç¨30 million is required to cover R&D expenditures and ‚Ç¨20 million is used for loan repayments.‚Ç¨25 million of the ‚Ç¨100 million facility remains today undrawn without costs and remains available for future additional investments. The partnership with Francisco Partners provides Unifiedpost with a high degree of financial flexibility  securing its growth plans in a market environment characterized by high geopolitical uncertainties and rising interest rates.Management guidance confirmedBased on the Q1 2022 results and the Company‚Äôs internal forecast for the following quarters  Unifiedpost reiterates its FY2022 and FY2023 guidance  with organic digital processing revenue growth of at least 25% for FY2022  stepping up to at least 30% in FY2023. Management also reaffirms digital processing revenue gross margin guidance of at least 60% by 2023 and an adjusted EBITDA margin expected to reach at least 25% by FY2023. The guidance does not take any further escalation of the war or further repercussions on European energy supply into account.Investors & Media webcast Management will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.

5455,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salmon-evolution-results-first-quarter-051900438.html,Salmon Evolution - Results for the first quarter 2022,First quarter highlights,"OSLO  Norway  May 24  2022 /PRNewswire/ --First quarter highlightsFirst fish tanks and related technical installations at Indre Har√∏y completed and put into operationFirst smolt batch released at Indre Har√∏y late March as per original timeline ‚Äì next smolt release planned in Q2 2022Batch 1 performing in line with expectations ‚Äì stable farm conditions with strong initial feed numbers and low mortality ‚Äì average weight of ~725 grams as of 21 MayPhase 1 construction continuing according to plan ‚Äì phase 1 capex estimate unchangedInitiated phase 2 preparations at Indre Har√∏y ‚Äì signed Heads of Terms with Artec Aqua for phase 2 build-outAvailable liquidity of NOK 1 056 million per 31 March 2022 including committed undrawn credit facilities and adjusted for April 2022 private placementSubsequent eventsCompleted NOK 300 million private placement to partly fund planned Indre Har√∏y phase 2 build out and smolt facility expansionAll 12 fish tanks in phase 1 are now assembled with most of the structures and buildings completed. Following a period of testing and commissioning started in December last year with the first part of the facility commenced operations late March.Capex during the first quarter amounted to 244 million. In addition  NOK 13.5m of internal G&A were capitalized. Q1 2022 saw good progress at the construction site. Together with timing effects as to delivery dates of high value equipment  this contributed to the high Q1 capex.Following an extensive commissioning and testing period commenced already in December  Salmon Evolution took over the first part of the facility on 26 March. The handover included inter alia the water intake station and the first two fish tanks together with connecting infrastructure and technical installations. Later the same day  Salmon Evolution successfully completed its first smolt release consisting of about 100 000 smolt with an average weight of around 300 grams. Following the positive confirmation of the fish transfer process and a customary short adaption period for the fish  initial feeding commenced.Story continuesAlong with the Company's technicians being accustomed with the facility  feeding has been gradually increased. Throughout this process feed waste has been carefully monitored to avoid overfeeding. The Company is very pleased to see that the fish is responding very well to feeding and on 30 April a significant milestone was reached when the daily feeding volume for the first time exceeded 1 ton  which represented more than 2% of the standing biomass. The positive trend has continued in May with average daily feeding exceeding 2% of the biomass.Commenting on the development  CEO H√•kon Andr√© Berg  said:""Since we started construction back in May 2020  the first smolt release has been the moment that we all have been waiting for. I am extremely proud of our organization and the fact that we have been able to adhere to our ambitious timeline  even with the challenges faced us during the pandemic.""At the same time  this is just the beginning. As we now move forward  our number one priority is the biology in our farm. Good biology will improve fish quality and translate into strong growth  which finally will be reflected in the financial performance. With our organization now totaling almost 50 highly skilled employees  I am more confident than ever in our mission - extending the ocean potential.""In addition  on 7 February 2022 Salmon Evolution announced that the company had entered into a Heads of Terms with Artec Aqua for the phase 2 build-out at Indre Har√∏y. Phase 2 is expected to in principle be identical to phase 1 and add a further 7 900 tons HOG of annual production  bringing the total planned production volume to 15 800 tons HOG per annum. The final design and construction agreement will include financing reservations providing Salmon Evolution with the necessary flexibility to align the phase 2 build out with the Company's overall financing plan.Further  on 5 April 2022 Salmon Evolution completed a private placement raising gross proceeds of NOK 300 million at a subscription price of NOK 9.00 per share. The private placement attracted strong interest from Norwegian  Nordic and international high-quality investors and was significantly oversubscribed. The net proceeds from the private placement will be used to (i) partly fund the second phase of the Indre Har√∏y facility  (ii) smolt facility expansion and (iii) for general corporate purposes.Summary and outlookSince Salmon Evolution was listed on Euronext Growth in September 2020  all eyes have been set at our targeted Q1 2022 milestone ‚Äì first smolt release. The Company is very pleased to see that this target was achieved  transforming this ground-breaking building project at Indre Har√∏y into a full-fledged farming operation.Moreover  after nearly two months of production the operating KPIs look very promising. The feeding has increased steadily throughout the period and stabilized at a level in line with the targets set out in our production plan which should yield an annualized production of 7 900 tons HOG for each phase.The organization across the Group now totals nearly 50 skilled employees. The process leading up to the smolt release followed by initial operations have already provided our employees with valuable experience  strongly benefitting the next phase 1 construction milestones and upcoming smolt releases. Furthermore  these experiences will be vital as we move into our planned phase 2 expansion.The Company also aims to utilize these experiences in our international expansion  first in Korea through our K Smart joint venture where initial design and engineering activities continued in the first quarter with K Smart also retaining Billund Aquaculture to assist in this respect.With Salmon Evolution soon entering the operational and commercial phase  the Company is very pleased to see that the market fundamentals for salmon remain very strong. The average Fish Pool salmon price was NOK 80.0/kg in Q1 2022 compared to NOK 54.3/kg in Q1 2021  representing an increase of 47% year over year. Looking at the forward prices for the remainder of 2022  this points to a full year 2022 salmon price of more than NOK 80/kg. In comparison the full year salmon price for 2021 was NOK 58.4/kg. The Company also notes that airfreight costs for in particular the Asian market has been at elevated levels following the pandemic and war in Ukraine  resulting substantially higher salmon prices locally  e.g. in South Korea.Looking at 2022 most analysts now expect neutral or slightly negative global supply growth which should support a scenario with high salmon prices. Salmon Evolution sees a significant demand growth potential for salmon over the coming decade subject to the industry being able to grow the supply side. In this context the Company remains firm in its belief that land-based farming will need to play an important role alongside conventional farming.With our first fish now enjoying its new life at Indre Har√∏y and steadily growing every day  we look forward to first harvest during the fourth quarter and well ahead of year end. Salmon Evolution remains confident that 2022 will be a landmark year for the Company setting the stage for significant growth in the years to come. This in turn will enable Salmon Evolution to take a global frontrunner position in the future development of land-based salmon farming.Results presentationCEO H√•kon Andr√© Berg and CFO Trond H√•kon Schaug-Pettersen will present the results by webcast today  Tuesday 24 May at 08:00 a.m. CEST.The presentation and subsequent Q&A will be held in English.The presentation can be accessed at www.salmonevolution.no  or with the following link: https://streams.eventcdn.net/salmonevolution/2022q1/For further information  please contact:H√•kon Andr√© Berg  CEO  Salmon Evolutionhakon.andre.berg@salmone.no+47 41 19 22 57Trond H√•kon Schaug-Pettersen  CFO  Salmon Evolutionthsp@salmone.no+47 91 19 13 27This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/salmon-evolution/r/salmon-evolution---results-for-the-first-quarter-2022 c3573129The following files are available for download:https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a7a8a817a97ac010.pdf SALME Q1 2022 presentation https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a48ca9b7ce633851.pdf SALME Q1 2022 reportCisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/salmon-evolution--results-for-the-first-quarter-2022-301553459.htmlSOURCE Salmon Evolution",neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.69,0.14,0.16,True,English,"['Salmon Evolution', 'first quarter', 'Results', 'CEO H√•kon Andr√© Berg', 'customary short adaption period', 'total planned production volume', 'strong initial feed numbers', 'Indre Har√∏y facility', 'Indre Har√∏y phase', 'first two fish tanks', 'NOK 300 million private placement', 'process feed waste', 'undrawn credit facilities', 'internal G&A', 'high value equipment', 'water intake station', 'number one priority', '50 highly skilled employees', 'international high-quality investors', 'general corporate purposes', 'ground-breaking building project', 'next smolt release', 'daily feeding volume', 'first smolt release', 'fish transfer process', 'First quarter highlights', 'First fish tanks', 'related technical installations', 'stable farm conditions', 'fledged farming operation', 'overall financing plan', 'First smolt batch', 'average daily feeding', 'high Q1 capex', 'April 2022 private placement', '12 fish tanks', 'initial feeding', 'two months', 'first part', 'first time', 'strong growth', 'strong interest', 'financing reservations', 'average weight', 'fish quality', 'annual production', 'production plan', 'original timeline', 'low mortality', 'Artec Aqua', 'Available liquidity', 'Subsequent events', 'good progress', 'timing effects', 'delivery dates', 'Salmon Evolution', 'positive confirmation', 'significant milestone', 'positive trend', 'ambitious timeline', 'financial performance', 'ocean potential', '7,900 tons HOG', '15,800 tons HOG', 'final design', 'necessary flexibility', 'gross proceeds', 'subscription price', 'Norwegian, Nordic', 'net proceeds', 'Euronext Growth', 'Q1 2022 milestone', 'operating KPIs', 'annualized prod', 'facility expansion', 'construction site', 'construction agreement', 'phase 1 capex', 'phase 2 preparations', 'phase 2 build', 'second phase', 'extensive commissioning', 'testing period', 'standing biomass', 'same time', 'Good biology', 'Phase 1 construction', 'The Company', '100,000 smolt', '30 April', '5 April 2022', 'OSLO', 'Norway', 'PRNewswire', 'Q2', 'expectations', '~725 grams', '21 May', 'Heads', 'Terms', '31 March', 'structures', 'buildings', 'December', 'operations', 'addition', '5m', '26 March', 'handover', 'infrastructure', '300 grams', 'Story', 'technicians', 'overfeeding', '1 ton', 'development', 'moment', 'organization', 'fact', 'challenges', 'pandemic', 'beginning', '7 February 2022', 'principle', 'annum', 'share', 'Summary', 'outlook', 'September', 'eyes', 'target', 'full', 'level']",2022-05-24,2022-05-24,finance.yahoo.com

May 24  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- 437  the swimwear and activewear company  has selected Centric Software¬Æ's Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solution. Ce‚Ä¶,"Based out of Toronto  Canada and founded in 2017 by Hyla Nayeri and Adrien Bettio to satisfy the need for swimwear that flatters more than just the perfect body. 437 has been featured in Forbes  Vogue  The New York Times and Hypebae. In addition  they have a strong social media presence with celebrities such as Kylie Jenner  Gabrielle Union-Wade and others having been spotted in 437's swimwear and recently launched activewear line.Jennifer Ginor  Director of Design at 437 describes how they want to streamline their specifications and have a more consistent fit across all their styles and fabrications. ""Right now  we have everything living on Google Sheets. It's really hard to find our source of truth. We have certain styles that have been living with us from the day of inception and to be able to copy those fits over  can be challenging as those specs are living all over the place.""With suppliers and production scattered around the globe  437 is looking to simplify collaboration with their vendors and reduce the number of errors in tech packs. The company turned to PLM. With respect to the requirements  Ginor says  ""We need something that's easy to use  quick to integrate. And that we can grow with."" 437 considered a few PLM vendors  but after the initial demo that Centric did  they were sold.Ginor notes  ""It's very early for us to be adding PLM‚Äîwe're only 4 years old‚Äîbut you can either hire more people or have a better process. With a better process  we have that one source of truth  fewer errors  streamlined BOMs and the ability to make more data-driven decisions. We're such a marketing-forward company that we want to respond quickly to our customers. Having a system like PLM is going to allow us to integrate into our other platforms to get the right feedback from a sales perspective to offer the products that our customers really do want from us.""Switching gears  Ginor talks about their environmental efforts. ""One of our biggest initiatives for the year is to become more sustainable. We're starting with fabrics and then moving on to production practices."" Being able to see an overview of where their products and resources are facilitates more strategic sourcing instead of leaving it up to each individual factory.""Any new fabrics are going to be made from recycled materials if possible. Where we can't  we would choose those with Fair Trade associations. Sustainability is such a broad spectrum‚Äîthere's a lot of 'greenwashing' out there. So we're trying to be super intentional with our choices and be as transparent as possible with our consumers "" says Ginor. They are looking to be more socially responsible. ""It could mean using a small family run factory where they employ fair working conditions and it directly supports that family.""437 didn't really have any tools that organized the environmental practices that Ginor spoke of. ""We've moved sourcing from the factories to internally. We're mandating mills that align with our eco-goals."" Centric PLM enables the management of the certifications and materials.""One of the most interesting things about working with Centric is we can learn from them. We are a young team and the guidance from Centric has been super helpful thus far. Centric being at the cutting edge of technologies in the industry is beneficial to us as we continue on the sustainability path. We feel that working with Centric will help us reduce unnecessary work.""Chris Groves  President and CEO of Centric Software says  ""I am very pleased that 437 has selected Centric PLM as their digital foundation. It is a smart move to add PLM early in the history of the company  setting them up for continued success as they continue on their growth curve.""Learn more about Centric PLMRequest a DemoAbout 437 (www.shop437.com)We're 437‚Äîa luxe swim and activewear brand driven by a desire to create product that doesn't compromise on style  quality  or fit.Founded in 2017 by best friends Hyla Nayeri and Adrien Bettio  we've been expanding our product offering which started with swimwear but now includes activewear  beachwear  and accessories.

Following a period of testing and commissioning started in December last year with the first part of the facility commenced operations late March.Capex during the first quarter amounted to 244 million. In addition  NOK 13.5m of internal G&A were capitalized. Q1 2022 saw good progress at the construction site. Together with timing effects as to delivery dates of high value equipment  this contributed to the high Q1 capex.Following an extensive commissioning and testing period commenced already in December  Salmon Evolution took over the first part of the facility on 26 March. The handover included inter alia the water intake station and the first two fish tanks together with connecting infrastructure and technical installations. Later the same day  Salmon Evolution successfully completed its first smolt release consisting of about 100 000 smolt with an average weight of around 300 grams. Following the positive confirmation of the fish transfer process and a customary short adaption period for the fish  initial feeding commenced.Along with the Company's technicians being accustomed with the facility  feeding has been gradually increased. Throughout this process feed waste has been carefully monitored to avoid overfeeding. The Company is very pleased to see that the fish is responding very well to feeding and on 30 April a significant milestone was reached when the daily feeding volume for the first time exceeded 1 ton  which represented more than 2% of the standing biomass. The positive trend has continued in May with average daily feeding exceeding 2% of the biomass.Commenting on the development  CEO H√•kon Andr√© Berg  said:""Since we started construction back in May 2020  the first smolt release has been the moment that we all have been waiting for. I am extremely proud of our organization and the fact that we have been able to adhere to our ambitious timeline  even with the challenges faced us during the pandemic.""At the same time  this is just the beginning. As we now move forward  our number one priority is the biology in our farm. Good biology will improve fish quality and translate into strong growth  which finally will be reflected in the financial performance. With our organization now totaling almost 50 highly skilled employees  I am more confident than ever in our mission - extending the ocean potential.""In addition  on 7 February 2022 Salmon Evolution announced that the company had entered into a Heads of Terms with Artec Aqua for the phase 2 build-out at Indre Har√∏y. Phase 2 is expected to in principle be identical to phase 1 and add a further 7 900 tons HOG of annual production  bringing the total planned production volume to 15 800 tons HOG per annum. The final design and construction agreement will include financing reservations providing Salmon Evolution with the necessary flexibility to align the phase 2 build out with the Company's overall financing plan.Further  on 5 April 2022 Salmon Evolution completed a private placement raising gross proceeds of NOK 300 million at a subscription price of NOK 9.00 per share. The private placement attracted strong interest from Norwegian  Nordic and international high-quality investors and was significantly oversubscribed. The net proceeds from the private placement will be used to (i) partly fund the second phase of the Indre Har√∏y facility  (ii) smolt facility expansion and (iii) for general corporate purposes.Summary and outlookSince Salmon Evolution was listed on Euronext Growth in September 2020  all eyes have been set at our targeted Q1 2022 milestone ‚Äì first smolt release. The Company is very pleased to see that this target was achieved  transforming this ground-breaking building project at Indre Har√∏y into a full-fledged farming operation.Moreover  after nearly two months of production the operating KPIs look very promising. The feeding has increased steadily throughout the period and stabilized at a level in line with the targets set out in our production plan which should yield an annualized production of 7 900 tons HOG for each phase.The organization across the Group now totals nearly 50 skilled employees. The process leading up to the smolt release followed by initial operations have already provided our employees with valuable experience  strongly benefitting the next phase 1 construction milestones and upcoming smolt releases. Furthermore  these experiences will be vital as we move into our planned phase 2 expansion.The Company also aims to utilize these experiences in our international expansion  first in Korea through our K Smart joint venture where initial design and engineering activities continued in the first quarter with K Smart also retaining Billund Aquaculture to assist in this respect.With Salmon Evolution soon entering the operational and commercial phase  the Company is very pleased to see that the market fundamentals for salmon remain very strong. The average Fish Pool salmon price was NOK 80.0/kg in Q1 2022 compared to NOK 54.3/kg in Q1 2021  representing an increase of 47% year over year. Looking at the forward prices for the remainder of 2022  this points to a full year 2022 salmon price of more than NOK 80/kg. In comparison the full year salmon price for 2021 was NOK 58.4/kg. The Company also notes that airfreight costs for in particular the Asian market has been at elevated levels following the pandemic and war in Ukraine  resulting substantially higher salmon prices locally  e.g. in South Korea.Looking at 2022 most analysts now expect neutral or slightly negative global supply growth which should support a scenario with high salmon prices. Salmon Evolution sees a significant demand growth potential for salmon over the coming decade subject to the industry being able to grow the supply side. In this context the Company remains firm in its belief that land-based farming will need to play an important role alongside conventional farming.With our first fish now enjoying its new life at Indre Har√∏y and steadily growing every day  we look forward to first harvest during the fourth quarter and well ahead of year end. Salmon Evolution remains confident that 2022 will be a landmark year for the Company setting the stage for significant growth in the years to come. This in turn will enable Salmon Evolution to take a global frontrunner position in the future development of land-based salmon farming.Results presentationCEO H√•kon Andr√© Berg and CFO Trond H√•kon Schaug-Pettersen will present the results by webcast today  Tuesday 24 May at 08:00 a.m. CEST.The presentation and subsequent Q&A will be held in English.The presentation can be accessed at www.salmonevolution.no  or with the following link: https://streams.eventcdn.net/salmonevolution/2022q1/For further information  please contact:H√•kon Andr√© Berg  CEO  Salmon Evolution[email protected]+47 41 19 22 57Trond H√•kon Schaug-Pettersen  CFO  Salmon Evolution[email protected]+47 91 19 13 27This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/salmon-evolution/r/salmon-evolution---results-for-the-first-quarter-2022 c3573129The following files are available for download:https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a7a8a817a97ac010.pdf SALME Q1 2022 presentation https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a48ca9b7ce633851.pdf SALME Q1 2022 reportSOURCE Salmon Evolution",neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.7,0.12,0.17,True,English,"['Salmon Evolution', 'first quarter', 'Results', 'CEO H√•kon Andr√© Berg', 'customary short adaption period', 'total planned production volume', 'strong initial feed numbers', 'Indre Har√∏y facility', 'Indre Har√∏y phase', 'first two fish tanks', 'NOK 300 million private placement', 'process feed waste', 'undrawn credit facilities', 'internal G&A', 'high value equipment', 'water intake station', 'number one priority', '50 highly skilled employees', 'international high-quality investors', 'general corporate purposes', 'ground-breaking building project', 'next smolt release', 'daily feeding volume', 'first smolt release', 'fish transfer process', 'First quarter highlights', 'First fish tanks', 'related technical installations', 'stable farm conditions', 'fledged farming operation', 'overall financing plan', 'First smolt batch', 'average daily feeding', 'high Q1 capex', 'April 2022 private placement', '12 fish tanks', 'initial feeding', 'two months', 'first part', 'first time', 'strong growth', 'strong interest', 'financing reservations', 'average weight', 'fish quality', 'annual production', 'production plan', 'annualized production', 'original timeline', 'low mortality', 'Artec Aqua', 'Available liquidity', 'Subsequent events', 'good progress', 'timing effects', 'delivery dates', 'Salmon Evolution', 'positive confirmation', 'significant milestone', 'positive trend', 'ambitious timeline', 'financial performance', 'ocean potential', '7,900 tons HOG', '15,800 tons HOG', 'final design', 'necessary flexibility', 'gross proceeds', 'subscription price', 'Norwegian, Nordic', 'net proceeds', 'Euronext Growth', 'Q1 2022 milestone', 'operating KPIs', 'facility expansion', 'construction site', 'construction agreement', 'phase 1 capex', 'phase 2 preparations', 'phase 2 build', 'second phase', 'extensive commissioning', 'testing period', 'standing biomass', 'same time', 'Good biology', 'Phase 1 construction', 'The Company', '100,000 smolt', '30 April', '5 April 2022', 'OSLO', 'Norway', 'PRNewswire', 'Q2', 'expectations', '~725 grams', '21 May', 'Heads', 'Terms', '31 March', 'structures', 'buildings', 'December', 'operations', 'addition', '5m', '26 March', 'handover', 'infrastructure', '300 grams', 'technicians', 'overfeeding', '1 ton', 'development', 'moment', 'organization', 'fact', 'challenges', 'pandemic', 'beginning', '7 February 2022', 'principle', 'annum', 'share', 'Summary', 'outlook', 'September', 'eyes', 'target', 'full', 'level']",2022-05-24,2022-05-24,prnewswire.com

5464,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.nbc29.com/prnewswire/2022/05/24/salmon-evolution-results-first-quarter-2022/,Salmon Evolution - Results for the first quarter 2022,,"OSLO  Norway  May 24  2022 /PRNewswire/ --First quarter highlightsFirst fish tanks and related technical installations at Indre Har√∏y completed and put into operationFirst smolt batch released at Indre Har√∏y late March as per original timeline ‚Äì next smolt release planned in Q2 2022Batch 1 performing in line with expectations ‚Äì stable farm conditions with strong initial feed numbers and low mortality ‚Äì average weight of ~725 grams as of 21 MayPhase 1 construction continuing according to plan ‚Äì phase 1 capex estimate unchangedInitiated phase 2 preparations at Indre Har√∏y ‚Äì signed Heads of Terms with Artec Aqua for phase 2 build-outAvailable liquidity of NOK 1 056 million per 31 March 2022 including committed undrawn credit facilities and adjusted for April 2022 private placementSubsequent eventsCompleted NOK 300 million private placement to partly fund planned Indre Har√∏y phase 2 build out and smolt facility expansionAll 12 fish tanks in phase 1 are now assembled with most of the structures and buildings completed. Following a period of testing and commissioning started in December last year with the first part of the facility commenced operations late March.Capex during the first quarter amounted to 244 million. In addition  NOK 13.5m of internal G&A were capitalized. Q1 2022 saw good progress at the construction site. Together with timing effects as to delivery dates of high value equipment  this contributed to the high Q1 capex.Following an extensive commissioning and testing period commenced already in December  Salmon Evolution took over the first part of the facility on 26 March. The handover included inter alia the water intake station and the first two fish tanks together with connecting infrastructure and technical installations. Later the same day  Salmon Evolution successfully completed its first smolt release consisting of about 100 000 smolt with an average weight of around 300 grams. Following the positive confirmation of the fish transfer process and a customary short adaption period for the fish  initial feeding commenced.Along with the Company's technicians being accustomed with the facility  feeding has been gradually increased. Throughout this process feed waste has been carefully monitored to avoid overfeeding. The Company is very pleased to see that the fish is responding very well to feeding and on 30 April a significant milestone was reached when the daily feeding volume for the first time exceeded 1 ton  which represented more than 2% of the standing biomass. The positive trend has continued in May with average daily feeding exceeding 2% of the biomass.Commenting on the development  CEO H√•kon Andr√© Berg  said:""Since we started construction back in May 2020  the first smolt release has been the moment that we all have been waiting for. I am extremely proud of our organization and the fact that we have been able to adhere to our ambitious timeline  even with the challenges faced us during the pandemic.""At the same time  this is just the beginning. As we now move forward  our number one priority is the biology in our farm. Good biology will improve fish quality and translate into strong growth  which finally will be reflected in the financial performance. With our organization now totaling almost 50 highly skilled employees  I am more confident than ever in our mission - extending the ocean potential.""In addition  on 7 February 2022 Salmon Evolution announced that the company had entered into a Heads of Terms with Artec Aqua for the phase 2 build-out at Indre Har√∏y. Phase 2 is expected to in principle be identical to phase 1 and add a further 7 900 tons HOG of annual production  bringing the total planned production volume to 15 800 tons HOG per annum. The final design and construction agreement will include financing reservations providing Salmon Evolution with the necessary flexibility to align the phase 2 build out with the Company's overall financing plan.Further  on 5 April 2022 Salmon Evolution completed a private placement raising gross proceeds of NOK 300 million at a subscription price of NOK 9.00 per share. The private placement attracted strong interest from Norwegian  Nordic and international high-quality investors and was significantly oversubscribed. The net proceeds from the private placement will be used to (i) partly fund the second phase of the Indre Har√∏y facility  (ii) smolt facility expansion and (iii) for general corporate purposes.Summary and outlookSince Salmon Evolution was listed on Euronext Growth in September 2020  all eyes have been set at our targeted Q1 2022 milestone ‚Äì first smolt release. The Company is very pleased to see that this target was achieved  transforming this ground-breaking building project at Indre Har√∏y into a full-fledged farming operation.Moreover  after nearly two months of production the operating KPIs look very promising. The feeding has increased steadily throughout the period and stabilized at a level in line with the targets set out in our production plan which should yield an annualized production of 7 900 tons HOG for each phase.The organization across the Group now totals nearly 50 skilled employees. The process leading up to the smolt release followed by initial operations have already provided our employees with valuable experience  strongly benefitting the next phase 1 construction milestones and upcoming smolt releases. Furthermore  these experiences will be vital as we move into our planned phase 2 expansion.The Company also aims to utilize these experiences in our international expansion  first in Korea through our K Smart joint venture where initial design and engineering activities continued in the first quarter with K Smart also retaining Billund Aquaculture to assist in this respect.With Salmon Evolution soon entering the operational and commercial phase  the Company is very pleased to see that the market fundamentals for salmon remain very strong. The average Fish Pool salmon price was NOK 80.0/kg in Q1 2022 compared to NOK 54.3/kg in Q1 2021  representing an increase of 47% year over year. Looking at the forward prices for the remainder of 2022  this points to a full year 2022 salmon price of more than NOK 80/kg. In comparison the full year salmon price for 2021 was NOK 58.4/kg. The Company also notes that airfreight costs for in particular the Asian market has been at elevated levels following the pandemic and war in Ukraine  resulting substantially higher salmon prices locally  e.g. in South Korea.Looking at 2022 most analysts now expect neutral or slightly negative global supply growth which should support a scenario with high salmon prices. Salmon Evolution sees a significant demand growth potential for salmon over the coming decade subject to the industry being able to grow the supply side. In this context the Company remains firm in its belief that land-based farming will need to play an important role alongside conventional farming.With our first fish now enjoying its new life at Indre Har√∏y and steadily growing every day  we look forward to first harvest during the fourth quarter and well ahead of year end. Salmon Evolution remains confident that 2022 will be a landmark year for the Company setting the stage for significant growth in the years to come. This in turn will enable Salmon Evolution to take a global frontrunner position in the future development of land-based salmon farming.Results presentationCEO H√•kon Andr√© Berg and CFO Trond H√•kon Schaug-Pettersen will present the results by webcast today  Tuesday 24 May at 08:00 a.m. CEST.The presentation and subsequent Q&A will be held in English.The presentation can be accessed at www.salmonevolution.no  or with the following link: https://streams.eventcdn.net/salmonevolution/2022q1/For further information  please contact:H√•kon Andr√© Berg  CEO  Salmon Evolutionhakon.andre.berg@salmone.no+47 41 19 22 57Trond H√•kon Schaug-Pettersen  CFO  Salmon Evolutionthsp@salmone.no+47 91 19 13 27This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comThe following files are available for download:https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a7a8a817a97ac010.pdf SALME Q1 2022 presentation https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a48ca9b7ce633851.pdf SALME Q1 2022 reportView original content:SOURCE Salmon Evolution",neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.7,0.12,0.17,True,English,"['Salmon Evolution', 'first quarter', 'Results', 'CEO H√•kon Andr√© Berg', 'customary short adaption period', 'total planned production volume', 'strong initial feed numbers', 'Indre Har√∏y facility', 'Indre Har√∏y phase', 'first two fish tanks', 'NOK 300 million private placement', 'process feed waste', 'undrawn credit facilities', 'internal G&A', 'high value equipment', 'water intake station', 'number one priority', '50 highly skilled employees', 'international high-quality investors', 'general corporate purposes', 'ground-breaking building project', 'next smolt release', 'daily feeding volume', 'first smolt release', 'fish transfer process', 'First quarter highlights', 'First fish tanks', 'related technical installations', 'stable farm conditions', 'fledged farming operation', 'overall financing plan', 'First smolt batch', 'average daily feeding', 'high Q1 capex', 'April 2022 private placement', '12 fish tanks', 'initial feeding', 'two months', 'first part', 'first time', 'strong growth', 'strong interest', 'financing reservations', 'average weight', 'fish quality', 'annual production', 'production plan', 'annualized production', 'original timeline', 'low mortality', 'Artec Aqua', 'Available liquidity', 'Subsequent events', 'good progress', 'timing effects', 'delivery dates', 'Salmon Evolution', 'positive confirmation', 'significant milestone', 'positive trend', 'ambitious timeline', 'financial performance', 'ocean potential', '7,900 tons HOG', '15,800 tons HOG', 'final design', 'necessary flexibility', 'gross proceeds', 'subscription price', 'Norwegian, Nordic', 'net proceeds', 'Euronext Growth', 'Q1 2022 milestone', 'operating KPIs', 'facility expansion', 'construction site', 'construction agreement', 'phase 1 capex', 'phase 2 preparations', 'phase 2 build', 'second phase', 'extensive commissioning', 'testing period', 'standing biomass', 'same time', 'Good biology', 'Phase 1 construction', 'The Company', '100,000 smolt', '30 April', '5 April 2022', 'OSLO', 'Norway', 'PRNewswire', 'Q2', 'expectations', '~725 grams', '21 May', 'Heads', 'Terms', '31 March', 'structures', 'buildings', 'December', 'operations', 'addition', '5m', '26 March', 'handover', 'infrastructure', '300 grams', 'technicians', 'overfeeding', '1 ton', 'development', 'moment', 'organization', 'fact', 'challenges', 'pandemic', 'beginning', '7 February 2022', 'principle', 'annum', 'share', 'Summary', 'outlook', 'September', 'eyes', 'target', 'full', 'level']",2022-05-24,2022-05-24,nbc29.com
5465,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.edpr.com/en/news/2022/05/24/edpr-enters-agreement-lhyfe-foster-renewable-hydrogen,EDPR enters into agreement with Lhyfe to foster renewable hydrogen | EDP Renov√°veis,10 hours ago,"EDP Renewables (Euronext: EDPR)  the world‚Äôs fourth largest wind energy producer  has entered into an industrial agreement with Lhyfe (Euronext: LHYFE)  a world pioneer and pure player in renewable green hydrogen production  to jointly identify  develop  build and manage projects in this business area.Under said agreement  EDPR will supply renewable electricity to Lhyfe's hydrogen generation projects. In addition  the two companies will identify opportunities for the co-development of projects  with EDPR's shareholding potentially reaching up to 50% of the projects‚Äô capital. The companies will also work together on R&D activities  new project development and equipment procurement.This agreement envisages to create value  leveraging synergies from the complementary skills and capabilities of the two companies  boosting the growth of EDPR's portfolio  especially in France  and contributing to the development of Lhyfe‚Äôs projects all around the world. It also contributes to achieve higher operational and commercial expertise in renewable hydrogen projects.According to Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade  CEO of EDP and EDP Renewables: ""We are pleased to have closed this important agreement with Lhyfe as part of its IPO. We believe that renewable hydrogen can complement the direct electrification as the best means for reducing CO2 emissions and achieving the decarbonization of the economy  including in the hard-to-electrify sectors. With this agreement with Lhyfe  we reinforce our commitment to the acceleration of the energy transition while also taking one step toward the achievement of our growth plans.‚ÄùAccording to Matthieu Guesn√©  founder and CEO of Lhyfe: ""We are very proud to conclude this agreement with one of the world's largest renewable energy producers. The trust placed in us by EDPR allows us to confidently consider the development of our renewable hydrogen worldwide and on a large scale. We look forward to developing our future production sites alongside them  and to immediately decarbonising local mobility and industrial uses  thanks to the pooling of our strengths.‚ÄùThis partnership with Lhyfe reaffirms EDP‚Äôs commitment to the renewable hydrogen sector. The company's ambition is to deploy 1.5 GW of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030. In fact  the group has created the H2 Business Unit (H2BU)  especially dedicated to the development of renewable hydrogen projects and focused on developing opportunities in promising sectors  such as the steel industry  chemicals  refineries  and cement plants  as well as heavy-duty long-distance transport.EDP is at the forefront of this clean energy solution through its leading role in various projects such as the GreenH2Atlantic  a 100 MW renewable hydrogen production project in Sines (Portugal) which is one of the three projects selected by the EU Green Deal Call to demonstrate the viability of green hydrogen production. EDP is also promoting other projects in Spain and in Brazil  under its fair transition plans to transform coal plants into clean technology hubs  leaving no one behind. Additionally  EDP is actively engaging with relevant hydrogen players  leveraging on its significant portfolio of renewable assets  namely in the USA.As for Lhyfe's IPO  its objective is to support the company's development and growth strategy. The firm has a portfolio of more than 4.8 GW of total installed capacity in 93 projects under development in Europe and plans to install 200 MW by 2026 and 3 GW by 2030. Among these 93 projects  20 are at an advanced stage of development  with a total capacity of 380.5 MW expected to come onstream between 2023 and 2026.In September 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the world's first industrial plant directly connected to a wind farm and a seawater supply enabling electrolysis  and since then  it has begun delivering its green hydrogen to fuel mobility uses in the region. Given the size and the maturity of its projects  Lhyfe is one of the world‚Äôs largest and most advanced players in the green hydrogen market.Hydrogen's relevance is explained in the forecast for global demand for hydrogen to increase sixfold between 2020 and 2050  reaching 530 million tons in 2050  driven by economic growth and the multiplication of uses  both in industry and in mobility. The share of renewable hydrogen should represent 60% of total hydrogen demand by 2050.",neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,positive,0.66,0.31,0.02,True,English,"['EDP Renov√°veis', 'renewable hydrogen', 'EDPR', 'agreement', 'Lhyfe', 'fourth largest wind energy producer', '100 MW renewable hydrogen production project', ""Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade"", 'EU Green Deal Call', 'largest renewable energy producers', 'renewable green hydrogen production', 'green hydrogen production capacity', 'future production sites', 'R&D activities', 'clean energy solution', 'green hydrogen market', 'heavy-duty long-distance transport', 'clean technology hubs', 'renewable hydrogen sector', 'H2 Business Unit', 'first industrial plant', 'relevant hydrogen players', 'new project development', 'fair transition plans', 'hydrogen generation projects', 'renewable hydrogen projects', 'total hydrogen demand', 'energy transition', 'wind farm', 'renewable electricity', 'renewable assets', 'business area', 'advanced players', 'global demand', 'total capacity', 'growth plans', 'pure player', 'equipment procurement', 'complementary skills', 'higher operational', 'commercial expertise', 'direct electrification', 'best means', 'CO2 emissions', 'Matthieu Guesn√©', 'large scale', 'industrial uses', 'cement plants', 'leading role', 'coal plants', 'advanced stage', 'seawater supply', '530 million tons', 'projects‚Äô capital', 'various projects', 'three projects', 'other projects', 'growth strategy', 'economic growth', 'industrial agreement', 'two companies', 'local mobility', 'one step', 'promising sectors', 'steel industry', 'mobility uses', 'important agreement', 'significant portfolio', 'EDP Renewables', 'world pioneer', '200 MW', '380.5 MW', '93 projects', 'Euronext', 'EDPR', 'Lhyfe', 'addition', 'opportunities', 'shareholding', 'value', 'synergies', 'capabilities', 'France', 'CEO', 'part', 'IPO', 'decarbonization', 'economy', 'commitment', 'acceleration', 'achievement', 'founder', 'trust', 'pooling', 'strengths', 'company', 'ambition', '1.5 GW', 'fact', 'group', 'H2BU', 'chemicals', 'refineries', 'forefront', 'GreenH2Atlantic', 'Portugal', 'viability', 'Spain', 'Brazil', 'USA', 'objective', 'firm', '4.8 GW', 'Europe', '3 GW', 'September', 'electrolysis', 'region', 'size', 'maturity', 'relevance', 'forecast', 'multiplication']",2022-05-24,2022-05-24,edpr.com
