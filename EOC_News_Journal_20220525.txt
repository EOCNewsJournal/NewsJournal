Any such re-registration would need to be effected by Thursday 9 June 2022. Shareholders should therefore liaise with and instruct their nominees well in advance thereof.To be entitled to attend and vote in person at the Meeting  shareholders must notify Euroclear Sweden AB of their intention to attend the Meeting by Thursday 9 June 2022 and can do so by (i) e-mail to [email protected] com or (ii) mail to: Kambi Group plc  c/o Euroclear Sweden AB  Box 191  SE-101 23 Stockholm  Sweden or (iii) by phone on +46 8 402 9092 during the office hours of Euroclear Sweden AB.

This resolution is being taken in terms and for the purposes of the approvals necessary in terms of the Companies Act and the Articles of Association of the Company. (Resolution a)8. WHEREAS (i) at a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company held on 30 March 2022  the Directors resolved to obtain authority to buy back Ordinary ‘B’ shares in the Company having a nominal value of €0.003 each; and(ii) pursuant to Article 5 of the Articles and Article 106(1) (b) of the Companies Act a company may acquire any of its own shares otherwise than by subscription  provided inter alia authorisation is given by an extraordinary resolution  which resolution will need to determine the terms and conditions of such acquisitions and in particular the maximum number of shares to be acquired  the duration of the period for which the authorisation is given and the maximum and minimum consideration.NOW THEREFORE the members of the Company resolve that the Company be generally authorised to make purchases of Ordinary ‘B’ shares in the Company of a nominal value of €0.003 each in its capital  subject to the following:(a) the maximum number of shares that may be so acquired is 3 106 480 which is equivalent to 10% of total shares as at the date of the notice to the 2022 Annual General Meeting;(b) the minimum price that may be paid for the shares is SEK1 per share;(c) the maximum price that may be paid for the shares is SEK1 000 per share;(d) the maximum aggregate number of shares that can either be i) issued and allotted under Resolution a and  ii) bought back under this Resolution b  shall not exceed 3 106 480; and(e) the authority conferred by this resolution shall expire on the date of the 2023 Annual General Meeting  but in any case shall not exceed the period of 18 months  but not so as to prejudice the completion of a purchase contracted before that date. (Resolution b)9. Closing of the Extraordinary General MeetingInformation about proposals related to Agenda itemsBoth extraordinary Resolutions  Resolutions a and b  were presented in their entirety to the Annual General Meeting held on 17 May  2022 (which resolutions were referred to therein as resolutions m and n respectively)  and obtained one majority of two required in terms of article 135 of the Companies Act (Cap 386)  and in terms of Articles 48B.2(b) of the Articles of Association of the Company. To this end  this Extraordinary General Meeting is being convened within 30 days of the Annual General Meeting  in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of the Companies Act and the Articles  in order to take a fresh vote on the proposed extraordinary resolutions.Agenda item 7 (Resolution a)The objectives of the authorisation are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a directed set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares on each issue date will be used in determining the price at which shares will be issued. For the purposes of Article 88(7) of the Companies Act  through this resolution the members of the Company are also authorising the Board of Directors to restrict or withdraw the members’ right of pre-emption that would normally entitle members to be offered the newly issued shares in the Company in proportion to their shareholding before such new shares are offered to third parties.Agenda item 8 (Resolution b)The Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition by the Company of its own shares shall take place on First North Growth Market at Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares to all members of the Company. Such acquisitions of own shares may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on market terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to First North Growth Market at Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company’s annual report and accounts. Any resolution to repurchase own shares will be publicly disclosed. The objective of the buyback and transfer right is to ensure added value for the Company’s shareholders and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company’s capital structure.Following such buybacks  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or transfer to employees under a company share incentive plan. Once repurchased  further shareholder and Bondholder approval would be required before those shares could be cancelled.If used as consideration for an acquisition the intention would be that they would be issued as shares and not sold first.,neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,mixed,0.27,0.23,0.5,True,English,"['Kambi Group Plc Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Notice', 'General Meetings section', 'other supporting documents', 'Kambi Group plc', 'third party representative', 'Euroclear Sweden AB', 'daytime telephone number', 'corporate identification number', 'Aggregated attendance notifications', 'minutes Special Business', 'voting instructions sheet', 'EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING', 'other resolution', 'authorised representative', 'Thursday 30 June', 'Hälsingegatan', 'Thursday 9 June', 'office hours', 'particular resolution', 'two persons', 'Extraordinary Resolutions', 'voting list', 'signatory right', 'proxy form', 'proxy data', 'Reading Time', 'respective nominee', 'additional information', 'personal data', 'authorised attorney', 'authorised officer', 'original power', 'following Agenda', 'company number', 'Company website', 'email address', 'Shareholders’ right', '6 minutes', 'terms', 'Articles', 'Association', 'NOTICE', '11.00 CEST', 'Stockholm', 'registration', '10.30 CEST', 'purpose', 'determination', 'votes', 'register', 'members', 'shares', 'name', 'order', 'nominees', 'advance', 'intention', 'Box', 'details', 'proxies', 'case', 'stead', 'connection', 'processing', 'behalf', 'individual', 'appointer', 'corporation', 'discretion', 'accordance', 'indication', 'copy', 'manner', 'Board', 'Directors', 'appointment', 'default', 'Opening', 'Election', 'Chairman', 'approval', '113', '+46']",2022-05-24,2022-05-25,europeangaming.eu

Known as ‘blank check companies’  SPACs are publicly trad…,Special purpose acquisition companies—known as SPACs—have been all the rage in the world of investment for the last two years  and they’ve made a mark in the media space  but is the trend slowing down?Known as ‘blank check companies’  SPACs are publicly traded investment vehicles that raise capital solely to acquire existing companies. They are often fronted by a well-known figure and are seen as a simpler alternative to going public via an IPO. They can also provide everyman investors with an opportunity to tap into the high growth that some companies experience in their early years. At the same time  of course  a disappointing debut can register significant losses.In some instances  SPACs will be announced with specific investment targets in mind  like when Virgin Galactic completed a successful SPAC merger in 2019 and launched a trend of similar endeavours across the past two years. On other occasions  the SPAC will launch without disclosing specific targets  instead offering investors insight into its wider strategy.Deadline Disruptors At Cannes: Read Them All HereLast year  former Reliance Entertainment CEO Shibasish Sarkar  one of the biggest names in the Indian media landscape  left the company to launch his own SPAC  International Media Acquisition Corp. The company is targeting major moves in the local entertainment space and had a successful $230 million IPO on the Nasdaq in August. In an interview with Deadline in December  Sarkar said he was targeting acquisitions in three areas and would be closing the first deals ahead of the deadline of July 2022. “We want to be active in three spaces: production companies—whether film  television or animation—to create the largest content creation company in India; the exhibition space  where the objective is to be a meaningful player in the industry  the third or fourth biggest; and the opportunity of taking a meaningful position in a streaming platform ” Sarkar says.Iris Knobloch WarnerMediaAlso last year  Iris Knobloch  a former WarnerMedia president in Europe (and the newly announced incoming president of the Cannes Film Festival)  left the company after 25 years to launch a $300 million SPAC via Euronext Paris with backing from French billionaire François-Henri Pinault’s Artemis. Named I2PO  the company is the first of its kind to target the European entertainment and leisure industries. “Europe is home to many solid companies with high potential in this sector  which  through the contribution of capital  resources and expertise by I2PO  will have the necessary support to take their business to the next level ” Knobloch said at the time. “I see a huge opportunity to consolidate a fragmented market and to go beyond Europe into other markets.”I2PO recently confirmed its first deal: a merger agreement to take French music streaming service Deezer public at a $1.1 billion valuation. Pinault described the move as an opportunity to “develop Deezer as the leading independent music streaming platform through strong positions in selected key markets”.However  there have been numerous cautionary tales in the SPAC space in the last 12 months.Former Disney exec pair Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs  along with retired basketball star Shaquille O’Neal  raised $350 million for their SPAC Forest Road Acquisition Corp II in March last year  and quickly closed a merger deal to take fitness companies The Beachbody Company and Myx Fitness Holdings public. After an initial bounce  the combined entity has since tumbled 80% in value and is struggling to recover  serving as a warning that these big-capital deals can also go sour.Read the digital edition of Deadline’s Cannes/Disruptors magazine for 2022 hereDigital media outfit Buzzfeed went public via SPAC merger in December but its share price underperformed. Following an earnings report in Q1 this year that fell short of what the company had promised investors when launching its SPAC  pressure from those who had bought shares led to cuts in Buzzfeed’s news division  with some reportedly urging CEO Jonah Peretti to close down the Pulitzer Prize-winning news team entirely.In turn  the Buzzfeed example appears to have made several other digital media companies wary of pursuing their own proposed SPACs. Long-standing chatter about both Vox Media and Vice Media going public via SPAC has quieted in the last few months.There may have been some choppy waters for SPACs over the previous year  but the trend looks set to continue.

(“Air France-KLM”  the “Company”) announces today the launch of a capital increase with preferential subscription rights (the ""Rights"") to existing shareholders maintained to raise gross proceeds of €2.256 billion (the “Rights Issue”) through the issuance of 1 928 million new shares in Air France-KLM (the “New Shares”)  to be subscribed in cash and/or by offsetting claims.This transaction  which aims to strengthen the company’s equity and balance sheet  follows the 2021 capital increase and comes after new recapitalization measures were announced on February 17th.The net proceeds of the issue will be allocated to repaying the deeply subordinated bonds issued in April 2021 and held by the French State as well as strengthening the Company’s equity. As announced at full-year results on February 17 th 2022  the Company intends to free itself from the conditions set by the European Commission’s temporary framework and will therefore allocate circa 1.7 billion euros to the repayment of the ""Covid-19 recapitalization aid"" granted in the form of undated subordinated notes (the "" TSS État "") issued in April 2021. The remainder will be allocated to reduce the Company’s net indebtedness.This operation  together with the other contemplated measures to strengthen the balance sheet and the expected EBITDA recovery  will enable the Company to strengthen its financial trajectory. The Company’s sound financial liquidity position (€10.8 billion of cash at hand as of March 31 st 2022) in a better oriented operational context for the Company  will enable the Company to further repay the French State Aid over the next quarters. The repayment of the State Aid will also improve the financing costs of the Company.The Company confirms its objective to reduce its Net debt / EBITDA ratio  to reach circa 2.0x to 2.5x by 2023.The French State  Air France-KLM’s largest shareholder (28.6%)  has informed the Company of its intention to participate in the Rights Issue  so that its post-transaction shareholding remains unchanged. This subscription  should it occur  would be completed through offsetting claims held by the French State in respect of the deeply subordinated notes (TSS Etat) issued in April 2021 for an amount of circa 645 million euro.The Dutch State has informed the Company that it intends to exercise its rights in proportion to its current shareholding in order for its shareholding to remain unchanged post Rights Issue  subject to obtaining the necessary approvals from the Dutch Parliament. In order to receive these necessary approvals in a timely manner  the Dutch State is also dependent on the timetable of the Dutch parliament.The transaction will enable CMA CGM to become a new reference shareholder and an exclusive strategic partner for the cargo business  as announced on May 18 th . CMA CGM has committed to subscribe to the transaction for a maximum amount of €400 million (including the acquisition of Rights) and in such a way that its total shareholding does not exceed 9% of the Company’s resulting share capital.China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines have committed to participate in the Rights Issue on a cash neutral basis by subscribing to new shares through the sale of part of their Rights  using the net proceeds from selling Rights to CMA CGM.Story continuesBenjamin Smith  CEO of Air France – KLM  has stated that “The operation we are launching today is the result of the work we have been doing for several months to consolidate our balance sheet  strengthen our financial autonomy and regain strategic and operational flexibility. As the recovery continues and our economic performance recovers  in particular thanks to our ambitious transformation plan and the structural benefits it continues to deliver  we want to be in a position to seize any opportunity in a changing aviation sector and to be able to accelerate our environmental commitments. I would like to thank our main shareholders for their renewed support in this operation  and I am also delighted to welcome CMA CGM to our capital  as a new reference shareholder and industrial partner in our cargo activities.”Key terms and rationale of the transaction:Subscription price: €1.17 per new shareSubscription parity: 3 new shares per 1 existing shareTheoretical value of the preferential subscription right: €2.345Preferential subscription rights trading period: from 25 May 2022 to 7 June 2022  inclusiveSubscription period: from 27 May 2022 to 9 June 2022  inclusiveSubscription commitments: €359 923 919 i.e. 15.96% of the total amount of the transaction (excluding the French State and the Dutch State intentions)The Rights Issue will be carried out with preservation of shareholders’ preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the 20th resolution of the combined general meeting of the Company’s shareholders of 26 May 2021  and will result in the issuance of 1 927 902 102 New Shares at a subscription price of €1.17 per share (i.e.  a nominal value of €1  plus an issue premium of €0.17)  to be fully paid up upon subscription  representing gross proceeds  including the issue premium  of €2 255 645 459.34.Holders of existing ordinary shares of the Company (the “Shares”) recorded on their accounts as of the end of the accounting day on 24 May 2022 will be entitled to receive Rights which will be detached from the underlying Shares on 25 May 2022. Existing Shares of the Company will therefore trade ex-right from 25 May  2022. Each existing Share of the Company will entitle its holder to receive one (1) Right. 1 Right will entitle their holders to subscribe for 3 New Shares on an irreducible basis (à titre irréductible)  at a subscription price of €1.17 per Share.Subscriptions on a reducible basis (à titre réductible) will be accepted. Any New Shares not subscribed by subscriptions on an irreducible basis (à titre irréductible) will be distributed and allocated to the holders of the Rights having submitted additional subscription orders on a reducible basis (à titre réductible) subject to reduction in the event of oversubscription.Based on the closing price of Air France-KLM stock on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris on 20 May 2022  i.e.  €4.296  the theoretical value of 1 Right is €2.345 and the theoretical value of the ex-right share is €1.951.For information purposes  the subscription price for the New Shares of €1.17 per share reflects a discount of 40% compared to the theoretical value of the Company’s ex-right share price  calculated on the basis of closing price on 20 May 2022  and a discount of approximately 72.8% to this price.These values do not presume either the value of the Rights during their trading period or the ex-right value of the Company’s shares as recorded in the market.The Rights Issue will be open to the public in France only.Intentions and subscription commitments of the main shareholders and DirectorsThe French State  Air France-KLM’s largest shareholder (which holds 28.6% of the Company’s share capital and 28.1% of the voting rights) as of the date of this press release  has informed the board of directors of Air France – KLM of its intention to participate on an irreducible basis up to the totality of its Rights  so that its shareholding after the completion of this Rights Issue remains unchanged. This subscription would be carried out by way of offsetting the deeply subordinated notes (TSS Etat) issued by the Company in April 2021. A part of the TSS Etat will also be reimbursed by a buyback following the completion of the Rights Issue.The Dutch State (which holds 9.3% of the Company’s share capital and 13.8% of the voting rights) has informed the Company that it intends to fully exercise its rights in proportion to its current shareholding in order for its shareholding post Rights Issue to remain unchanged  subject to obtaining the necessary approvals from the Dutch Parliament. In order to receive these necessary approvals in a timely manner  the Dutch State is also dependent on the timetable of the Dutch parliament.CMA CGM has entered on 22 May 2022 into a rights sale and purchase agreement with Delta Air Lines  China Eastern Airlines and the FCPEs respectively  so as to acquire a total of 70 996 722 Rights  and has committed toward Air France-KLM to (i) exercise these rights and subscribe to the Rights Issue on a irreducible basis for an amount of €249 198 494.22 and to (ii) place a subscription order on a reducible basis for an additional number of up to 18 358 086 New Shares (or by exercising rights acquired in the market or off the market)  the total corresponding to a maximum of 9% of the share capital after the Rights Issue. This subscription commitment is subject to the condition that the total sum of the subscription price of the aforementioned New Shares increased by the total price of the Rights acquired by CMA CGM does not exceed 400 million euros and with no prejudice of the reduction rate which will be applied to the reducible orders.China Eastern Airlines  which holds 9.6% of the capital and 11.4% of voting rights of the Company  and Delta Air Lines  which holds 5.8% of the capital and 8.6% of the voting rights of the Company  have both committed to participate in the Rights Issue on a cash neutral basis through the sale of part of their Rights to the benefit of CMA CGM in a proportion allowing them to finance the exercise of the balance of their Rights by using the net proceeds of this sale (subject to rounding) for an aggregate amount representing €110 725 424.55.The subscription commitments of CMA CGM (for the irreducible basis)  Delta Air Lines and China Eastern Airlines described hereabove are referred to as the “Subscription Commitments”.The FCPEs  which hold 2.4% of the capital and 3.6% of the voting rights of the Company  have notified their intention to participate in the Rights Issue on a cash neutral basis through the sale of part of their Rights to the benefit of CMA CGM in a proportion allowing them to partially finance the exercise of the balance of their Rights by using the net proceeds of this sale.The SPAAK (Stichting Piloten Aandelen Air France - KLM) which holds 1.7% of the capital and 2.5% of the voting rights of the Company  has notified their intention to participate in the Rights Issue on a cash neutral basis through the sale of part of its Rights in a proportion allowing them to finance the exercise of the balance of their Rights by using the net proceeds of this sale.The Subscription Commitments total approximately €360 million and represent 15.96% of the amount of the Right Issue. The Subscription Commitments will respectively be terminated in the event the underwriting agreement entered into with the Underwriters (as such term is defined below) would itself be terminated. Moreover  the French State and the Dutch State have informed the Company that they intend to subscribe to the rights issue in proportion to their total respective number of Rights  representing an additional 37.94% to the amount of the rights issue.Lock-up commitmentsAir France-KLM has agreed to a lock-up period starting on the date of the signing of the underwriting agreement and expiring 180 calendar days following the settlement and delivery date of the New Shares  subject to certain exceptions.The French State  the Dutch State  China Eastern Airlines and Delta Airlines have entered into a lock-up agreement from the approval of the Prospectus by the AMF and until the expiration of a period of 90 calendar days following the date of settlement and delivery of the New Shares  subject to certain exceptions.CMA CGM has agreed with the Company on a lock-up commitment as from the settlement-delivery of the New Shares until the expiry of a three-year period following this date  being specified that CMA CGM may sell a maximum of 50% of the shares acquired in the context of the Rights Issue during an additional three-year period. This lock-up commitment will be terminated early if a firm and complete cooperation agreement in relation to air cargo is not concluded before December 1st 2022 or if such an agreement is terminated.In addition  CMA CGM committed to a 10-year period to not acquire or subscribe to any shares issued by the Company  unless such acquisition does not lead to an increase of its stake in the share capital of the Company  subject to certain exceptions. The undertaking specifies that at the end of a period of 5 years from the settlement-delivery of the New Shares  the Board of Directors of the Company may modify this undertaking in order to allow CMA CGM to increase its shareholding in the Company.Moreover  the major shareholders of Air France-KLM will support a resolution for the appointment of a representative of CMA CGM to the Board of Directors of Air France-KLM at the general shareholders' meeting to be held today.DilutionFor illustrative purposes only  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company’s share capital as of 24 May 2022  and not subscribing to the Rights Issue  would hold 0.25% of the Company’s share capital on a non-diluted basis following the Rights Issue.UnderwritingThe Rights Issue was subject to an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) entered into on 23 May 2022 between the Company and a syndicate of banks including Deutsche Bank  HSBC  Natixis  Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Société Générale acting as Joint Global Coordinators  Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners (the “Joint Global Coordinators”)  ABN AMRO Bank N.V.  Banco Santander  S.A.  Citigroup and Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A acting as Joint Bookrunners (the “Joint Bookrunners”)  Crédit Industriel et Commercial S.A.  MUFG Securities (Europe) N.V. and SMBC Bank EU AG acting as co-lead managers (the “Co-Lead Managers”  and together with the Joint Global Coordinators and the Joint Bookrunners  the “Underwriters”). Under the terms of this Underwriting Agreement  the Underwriters have undertaken  jointly and without joint and several liability  to subscribe for New Shares not subscribed for at the end of the subscription period  in such a way that the Capital Increase  after taking into account the Subscription Commitments  (on an irreducible basis only)  in cash up to a total amount of 359 923 918.77 euros  which represent 15.96% of the proposed issuance  is subscribed for in full. This agreement does not constitute a performance guarantee within the meaning of article L.225-145 of the French Commercial Code. This agreement may be terminated by the Global Coordinators on behalf of the Underwriters up to (and including) the settlement-delivery date  subject to certain conditions and in certain circumstances  in particular in the event of inaccuracy of the representations and warranties  failure by the Company to comply with one of its undertakings  non-fulfillment of the usual conditions precedent  a significant unfavorable change in the situation of the Company and its subsidiaries or the occurrence of national or international events. In the event of termination of the Underwriting Agreement in accordance with its provisions  the Rights Issue will then be cancelled.Indicative timetable of the Rights IssueThe Rights will be detached on 25 May 2022 and traded on the regulated markets of Euronext in Paris (“Euronext Paris”) under the ISIN code FR0014008ZE6 from 25 May 2022 until 7 June 2022 inclusive.

After extensive validation work  Galapagos is moving selected targets into the next phase of drug development  triggering a milestone payment to Scipher and making Scipher eligible to receive additional payments for the achievement of regulatory and sales milestones.“By partnering with Scipher  we are effectively and efficiently identifying new targets to ultimately develop new therapies to address unmet needs of people with IBD ” said Richard Janssen  head of Search and Evaluation  at Galapagos.Spectra is fueled by one of the largest patient molecular data lakes in autoimmune diseases and unique artificial intelligence network science-based algorithms. The platform identifies biologically similar patients and drug targets that are specific to those patients to improve response rates.“Drug development in autoimmune diseases is entering an era of precision medicine similar to what we have experienced in oncology in the past decade. There is a significant unmet medical need for drugs that target a specific disease population with higher clinical response rates ” said Alif Saleh  chief executive officer  at Scipher Medicine. “Driven by our access to large patient population molecular data  partnerships like the one with Galapagos can bring new and more effective treatments to diseases with currently low drug response rates or limited treatment options.”About Scipher MedicineScipher Medicine  a precision immunology company matching each patient with their most effective therapy  believes that patients deserve simple answers to treatment options based on scientific data. Using Spectra™  our proprietary network medicine platform  we commercialize tests revealing a person’s unique molecular disease signature and match it to the most effective therapy  ensuring optimal treatment from day one. The patient molecular data generated from our tests further supports the discovery and development of novel and more effective therapeutics. We partner with leading payers  health care providers  and pharmaceutical companies to bring solutions to patients with autoimmune diseases.

The BIOFIRE® BCID2 Panel for rapid molecular diagnostic of bloodstream infection includes several additional pathogens  an expanded list of antimicrobial resistance genes  and many revised targets compared to the existing BIOFIRE® BCID Panel.Sepsis resulting from bloodstream infection is the 12th leading cause of death in Canadai. Each year  nearly 75 000 patients are diagnosed with a mortality rate of over 40%ii. Time to diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is imperative since for each hour that severe sepsis goes untreated  the average mortality rate increases by 7.6%iii.Julie Émond  Vice-President & General Manager  bioMérieux Canada  said: ""BIOFIRE® BCID2 is a significant addition to our existing sepsis-related diagnostic offering  enabling clinicians to accelerate sepsis diagnosis and provide the right therapy faster  proven to improve survivorship.""Jessica Blavignac  Director of Scientific & Medical Affairs  bioMérieux Canada  added: ""Rapid molecular syndromic testing is literally a game changer. With sepsis  each hour counts. The BIOFIRE®BCID2 panel empowers small and large laboratories across Canada to shorten time to pathogen identification by up to 70%iv and to the optimal therapy initiation by 33.5 hoursv. BIOFIRE® BCID2 is also an important ally to Antimicrobial Stewardship.""The BIOFIRE® BCID2 Panel tests for 43 targets associated with bloodstream infections  including gram-negative bacteria  gram-positive bacteria  yeast  and 10 antimicrobial resistance genes — all with one test and with results available in about an hour from positive blood culture. Quickly identifying the cause of bloodstream infections and sepsis may help clinicians more rapidly and appropriately manage therapy. Rapid identification of bloodstream pathogens and relevant antimicrobial resistance genes can help reduce the time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy and may positively impact patient survival.iii ivStory continuesThis BIOFIRE® BCID2 Panel enhances BIOFIRE®'s syndromic offering to a new disease state in addition to the four other syndromes covered by the BIOFIRE® menu  making it the broadest menu of highly multiplex syndromic panels in existence and available to the labs today: Respiratory  Meningitis/Encephalitis and Gastrointestinal.ABOUT BIOMÉRIEUXPioneering DiagnosticsA world leader in the field of in vitro diagnostics since 1963  bioMérieux is present in 44 countries and serves more than 160 countries with the support of a large network of distributors.

The most striking examples of this shift towards urbanization are the megacities which are home to 10 million-plus city dwellers who spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors  resulting in a profound disconnect from nature. The pandemic has further exacerbated this issue.""People crave a connection to nature  but we're restricted by our daily routines and city living "" said Felipe Ambra  Global Corona Vice President. ""Free Range Humans is a joyful celebration of people reconnecting with nature. To bring this to life  we'll create limited-time oases for city dwellers to experience how even a few minutes with nature can positively impact their physical and mental wellbeing.""In 2019  Corona Studios  a dynamic global content house which operates and markets Corona exclusively outside of the U.S.  launched Free Range Humans. Like the Corona brand  the series embraces nature and the beach and season one received more than 100 million views worldwide.Season two spotlights six new episodes featuring people from around the world who have broken free from daily confines to get closer to nature and have committed their lives to causes they care about.""Season one was based on an insight that people spend 90 percent of their lives indoors.** But only some of us follow the impulse to leave our desk jobs behind  to search for meaning outside "" said Nick Sonderup  of Corona's creative partner  Pereira O'Dell. ""Season two follows the journey of six people who decided to venture outdoors and seek more meaningful pursuits.""Story continuesFree Range Humans season two cast members include:Loyiso Dunga (South Africa)  ""The Kelp Keeper"" – Loyiso is a marine biologist in his 11th year maintaining and preserving the underwater kelp forests needed to produce half the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere.Maroitai Tehio (French Polynesia)   ""The Coral Gardener"" – Maroitai is putting ocean coral first by building a network of nurseries with Coral Gardeners   an organization creating a global movement to save the reef. Ocean coral is home to a quarter of all marine life and nearly 50% has died off in the past 30 years.Jessica Hutchinson (Canada)   ""The Ecosystem Guardian"" – Jessica is a restoration ecologist with Redd Fish Restoration Society . Together  they're at the forefront of restoring the habitat loss of the North American Pacific Salmon population.Santiago Figueroa (Chile)   ""The Cacti Padre"" – Santiago is helping keep the desert alive with a focus on Chilean native cacti  half of which are now endangered.Martina Alvarez (Argentina/Mexico)   ""The Shark Advocate"" – Martina ( @oceanomartina ) dives with the ocean's most fearsome predator to combat misperceptions and draw attention to the fact that 100+ million sharks die every year due to illegal fishing.Zenilton ""Tinho"" Pereira (Brazil)  ""The Sea Turtle Protector"" – Tinho is part of Project Tamar   a non-profit committed to protecting endangered sea turtles from extinction in the Brazilian coastline. Only 1 out of 1 000 sea turtles survive birth and nearly all of their species are on the brink of extinction.To celebrate season two of Free Range Humans  Corona will help consumers reconnect with nature by unveiling dynamic natural installations in dense city locales around the world. The immersive urban oasis will invite people to answer the call from nature by following site markers to an enchanting natural oasis where they will be invited to take a pause.Those inspired by the stories of the show's cast members are encouraged to apply for Corona's Free Range Fund. The Free Range Fund will award seven $10 000 grants to serve as seed money for recipients to take the leap and answer their unique call from nature. The Fund will be accepting applications in select markets starting in South Africa on May 25  with one winner per market.Free Range Humans was originally conceived by Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam  developed as a global entertainment platform by Pereira O'Dell and produced by Monsters Children.

The most striking examples of this shift towards urbanization are the megacities which are home to 10 million-plus city dwellers who spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors  resulting in a profound disconnect from nature. The pandemic has further exacerbated this issue.""People crave a connection to nature  but we're restricted by our daily routines and city living "" said Felipe Ambra  Global Corona Vice President. ""Free Range Humans is a joyful celebration of people reconnecting with nature. To bring this to life  we'll create limited-time oases for city dwellers to experience how even a few minutes with nature can positively impact their physical and mental wellbeing.""In 2019  Corona Studios  a dynamic global content house which operates and markets Corona exclusively outside of the U.S.  launched Free Range Humans. Like the Corona brand  the series embraces nature and the beach and season one received more than 100 million views worldwide.Season two spotlights six new episodes featuring people from around the world who have broken free from daily confines to get closer to nature and have committed their lives to causes they care about.""Season one was based on an insight that people spend 90 percent of their lives indoors.** But only some of us follow the impulse to leave our desk jobs behind  to search for meaning outside "" said Nick Sonderup  of Corona's creative partner  Pereira O'Dell. ""Season two follows the journey of six people who decided to venture outdoors and seek more meaningful pursuits.""Story continuesFree Range Humans season two cast members include:Loyiso Dunga (South Africa)  ""The Kelp Keeper"" – Loyiso is a marine biologist in his 11th year maintaining and preserving the underwater kelp forests needed to produce half the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere.Maroitai Tehio (French Polynesia)   ""The Coral Gardener"" – Maroitai is putting ocean coral first by building a network of nurseries with Coral Gardeners   an organization creating a global movement to save the reef. Ocean coral is home to a quarter of all marine life and nearly 50% has died off in the past 30 years.Jessica Hutchinson (Canada)   ""The Ecosystem Guardian"" – Jessica is a restoration ecologist with Redd Fish Restoration Society . Together  they're at the forefront of restoring the habitat loss of the North American Pacific Salmon population.Santiago Figueroa (Chile)   ""The Cacti Padre"" – Santiago is helping keep the desert alive with a focus on Chilean native cacti  half of which are now endangered.Martina Alvarez (Argentina/Mexico)   ""The Shark Advocate"" – Martina ( @oceanomartina ) dives with the ocean's most fearsome predator to combat misperceptions and draw attention to the fact that 100+ million sharks die every year due to illegal fishing.Zenilton ""Tinho"" Pereira (Brazil)  ""The Sea Turtle Protector"" – Tinho is part of Project Tamar   a non-profit committed to protecting endangered sea turtles from extinction in the Brazilian coastline. Only 1 out of 1 000 sea turtles survive birth and nearly all of their species are on the brink of extinction.To celebrate season two of Free Range Humans  Corona will help consumers reconnect with nature by unveiling dynamic natural installations in dense city locales around the world. The immersive urban oasis will invite people to answer the call from nature by following site markers to an enchanting natural oasis where they will be invited to take a pause.Those inspired by the stories of the show's cast members are encouraged to apply for Corona's Free Range Fund.

Thales  a leader in digital security  and triPica  creator of business support systems and user paths  have developed a mobile application that enables operators to provide their customers with an optimized and secure experience  facilitating  among other things  the management of their account in real time. Bouygues Telecom recently adopted this innovative and flexible solution when it launched its fully digital and responsible offer called ‘source’.Security and optimization of the customer journey are at the heart of the challenges of digital transformation. That’s why Thales has teamed up with triPica to bring the best of mobile technology to a simple and trusted user experience. Thales  with its expertise in identity management – both physical and digital – has integrated an identity verification step into the triPica end-to-end solution during subscriber registration. Technologically speaking  this involves combining the Thales ‘Trusted Digital ID’ with triPica’s digital platform  the digital ‘Business Support System’.Indeed  any remote service provider that offers a full digital solution must be able to ensure that each new customer is who they claim to be  as soon as they register. The process involves capturing and verifying the authenticity of an official identity document  as well as a selfie to ensure the document matches the person registering.Once this step has been completed  users can freely define the subscription of their choice  manage their options and billing  and check their consumption directly from the mobile application. This is how Bouygues Telecom was able to offer its ‘source’ package  and make it accessible in just a few clicks to any subscriber who wants to participate in the emergence of a more responsible and supportive digital world. The application  which makes it easy and secure to manage your mobile account  also allows you to financially support the associations of your choice  by accumulating ‘water droplets’ for any unused gigabyte in your package.“It was important for Bouygues Telecom to offer an innovative and flexible solution. Thales – supported by triPica’s telecom expertise – were genuine partners who enabled us to quickly launch our ‘source’ offer. A unique solution in the telecom market achieved in a very short time-frame and focused on a fully mobile and supportive user experience.” Stéphane Allaire  Director of Innovation  Bouygues Telecom“We are delighted to be partnering with Thales and to put our expertise in disruptive digital solutions at the service of the accelerated digitalization of operators' offers. Our technological commitment takes on its full meaning with ‘source’  a concrete and dedicated example of an innovative and responsible initiative.” Mathieu Horn  CEO  triPica“For years  Thales has been supporting mobile operators in their transitions  whether related to the development of the network  SIM card or the need for a fully digital solution. The user experience  identity management and the pleasure of using an intuitive and secure application are all key factors that  together with triPica  we place at the core of our innovations. We are particularly proud of the trust placed in us by Bouygues Telecom  who chose us for the launch of ‘source’.

5455,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salmon-evolution-results-first-quarter-051900438.html,Salmon Evolution - Results for the first quarter 2022,First quarter highlights,"OSLO  Norway  May 24  2022 /PRNewswire/ --First quarter highlightsFirst fish tanks and related technical installations at Indre Harøy completed and put into operationFirst smolt batch released at Indre Harøy late March as per original timeline – next smolt release planned in Q2 2022Batch 1 performing in line with expectations – stable farm conditions with strong initial feed numbers and low mortality – average weight of ~725 grams as of 21 MayPhase 1 construction continuing according to plan – phase 1 capex estimate unchangedInitiated phase 2 preparations at Indre Harøy – signed Heads of Terms with Artec Aqua for phase 2 build-outAvailable liquidity of NOK 1 056 million per 31 March 2022 including committed undrawn credit facilities and adjusted for April 2022 private placementSubsequent eventsCompleted NOK 300 million private placement to partly fund planned Indre Harøy phase 2 build out and smolt facility expansionAll 12 fish tanks in phase 1 are now assembled with most of the structures and buildings completed. Following a period of testing and commissioning started in December last year with the first part of the facility commenced operations late March.Capex during the first quarter amounted to 244 million. In addition  NOK 13.5m of internal G&A were capitalized. Q1 2022 saw good progress at the construction site. Together with timing effects as to delivery dates of high value equipment  this contributed to the high Q1 capex.Following an extensive commissioning and testing period commenced already in December  Salmon Evolution took over the first part of the facility on 26 March. The handover included inter alia the water intake station and the first two fish tanks together with connecting infrastructure and technical installations. Later the same day  Salmon Evolution successfully completed its first smolt release consisting of about 100 000 smolt with an average weight of around 300 grams. Following the positive confirmation of the fish transfer process and a customary short adaption period for the fish  initial feeding commenced.Story continuesAlong with the Company's technicians being accustomed with the facility  feeding has been gradually increased. Throughout this process feed waste has been carefully monitored to avoid overfeeding. The Company is very pleased to see that the fish is responding very well to feeding and on 30 April a significant milestone was reached when the daily feeding volume for the first time exceeded 1 ton  which represented more than 2% of the standing biomass. The positive trend has continued in May with average daily feeding exceeding 2% of the biomass.Commenting on the development  CEO Håkon André Berg  said:""Since we started construction back in May 2020  the first smolt release has been the moment that we all have been waiting for. I am extremely proud of our organization and the fact that we have been able to adhere to our ambitious timeline  even with the challenges faced us during the pandemic.""At the same time  this is just the beginning. As we now move forward  our number one priority is the biology in our farm. Good biology will improve fish quality and translate into strong growth  which finally will be reflected in the financial performance. With our organization now totaling almost 50 highly skilled employees  I am more confident than ever in our mission - extending the ocean potential.""In addition  on 7 February 2022 Salmon Evolution announced that the company had entered into a Heads of Terms with Artec Aqua for the phase 2 build-out at Indre Harøy. Phase 2 is expected to in principle be identical to phase 1 and add a further 7 900 tons HOG of annual production  bringing the total planned production volume to 15 800 tons HOG per annum. The final design and construction agreement will include financing reservations providing Salmon Evolution with the necessary flexibility to align the phase 2 build out with the Company's overall financing plan.Further  on 5 April 2022 Salmon Evolution completed a private placement raising gross proceeds of NOK 300 million at a subscription price of NOK 9.00 per share. The private placement attracted strong interest from Norwegian  Nordic and international high-quality investors and was significantly oversubscribed. The net proceeds from the private placement will be used to (i) partly fund the second phase of the Indre Harøy facility  (ii) smolt facility expansion and (iii) for general corporate purposes.Summary and outlookSince Salmon Evolution was listed on Euronext Growth in September 2020  all eyes have been set at our targeted Q1 2022 milestone – first smolt release. The Company is very pleased to see that this target was achieved  transforming this ground-breaking building project at Indre Harøy into a full-fledged farming operation.Moreover  after nearly two months of production the operating KPIs look very promising. The feeding has increased steadily throughout the period and stabilized at a level in line with the targets set out in our production plan which should yield an annualized production of 7 900 tons HOG for each phase.The organization across the Group now totals nearly 50 skilled employees. The process leading up to the smolt release followed by initial operations have already provided our employees with valuable experience  strongly benefitting the next phase 1 construction milestones and upcoming smolt releases. Furthermore  these experiences will be vital as we move into our planned phase 2 expansion.The Company also aims to utilize these experiences in our international expansion  first in Korea through our K Smart joint venture where initial design and engineering activities continued in the first quarter with K Smart also retaining Billund Aquaculture to assist in this respect.With Salmon Evolution soon entering the operational and commercial phase  the Company is very pleased to see that the market fundamentals for salmon remain very strong. The average Fish Pool salmon price was NOK 80.0/kg in Q1 2022 compared to NOK 54.3/kg in Q1 2021  representing an increase of 47% year over year. Looking at the forward prices for the remainder of 2022  this points to a full year 2022 salmon price of more than NOK 80/kg. In comparison the full year salmon price for 2021 was NOK 58.4/kg. The Company also notes that airfreight costs for in particular the Asian market has been at elevated levels following the pandemic and war in Ukraine  resulting substantially higher salmon prices locally  e.g. in South Korea.Looking at 2022 most analysts now expect neutral or slightly negative global supply growth which should support a scenario with high salmon prices. Salmon Evolution sees a significant demand growth potential for salmon over the coming decade subject to the industry being able to grow the supply side. In this context the Company remains firm in its belief that land-based farming will need to play an important role alongside conventional farming.With our first fish now enjoying its new life at Indre Harøy and steadily growing every day  we look forward to first harvest during the fourth quarter and well ahead of year end. Salmon Evolution remains confident that 2022 will be a landmark year for the Company setting the stage for significant growth in the years to come. This in turn will enable Salmon Evolution to take a global frontrunner position in the future development of land-based salmon farming.Results presentationCEO Håkon André Berg and CFO Trond Håkon Schaug-Pettersen will present the results by webcast today  Tuesday 24 May at 08:00 a.m. CEST.The presentation and subsequent Q&A will be held in English.The presentation can be accessed at www.salmonevolution.no  or with the following link: https://streams.eventcdn.net/salmonevolution/2022q1/For further information  please contact:Håkon André Berg  CEO  Salmon Evolutionhakon.andre.berg@salmone.no+47 41 19 22 57Trond Håkon Schaug-Pettersen  CFO  Salmon Evolutionthsp@salmone.no+47 91 19 13 27This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/salmon-evolution/r/salmon-evolution---results-for-the-first-quarter-2022 c3573129The following files are available for download:https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a7a8a817a97ac010.pdf SALME Q1 2022 presentation https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a48ca9b7ce633851.pdf SALME Q1 2022 reportCisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/salmon-evolution--results-for-the-first-quarter-2022-301553459.htmlSOURCE Salmon Evolution",neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.69,0.14,0.16,True,English,"['Salmon Evolution', 'first quarter', 'Results', 'CEO Håkon André Berg', 'customary short adaption period', 'total planned production volume', 'strong initial feed numbers', 'Indre Harøy facility', 'Indre Harøy phase', 'first two fish tanks', 'NOK 300 million private placement', 'process feed waste', 'undrawn credit facilities', 'internal G&A', 'high value equipment', 'water intake station', 'number one priority', '50 highly skilled employees', 'international high-quality investors', 'general corporate purposes', 'ground-breaking building project', 'next smolt release', 'daily feeding volume', 'first smolt release', 'fish transfer process', 'First quarter highlights', 'First fish tanks', 'related technical installations', 'stable farm conditions', 'fledged farming operation', 'overall financing plan', 'First smolt batch', 'average daily feeding', 'high Q1 capex', 'April 2022 private placement', '12 fish tanks', 'initial feeding', 'two months', 'first part', 'first time', 'strong growth', 'strong interest', 'financing reservations', 'average weight', 'fish quality', 'annual production', 'production plan', 'original timeline', 'low mortality', 'Artec Aqua', 'Available liquidity', 'Subsequent events', 'good progress', 'timing effects', 'delivery dates', 'Salmon Evolution', 'positive confirmation', 'significant milestone', 'positive trend', 'ambitious timeline', 'financial performance', 'ocean potential', '7,900 tons HOG', '15,800 tons HOG', 'final design', 'necessary flexibility', 'gross proceeds', 'subscription price', 'Norwegian, Nordic', 'net proceeds', 'Euronext Growth', 'Q1 2022 milestone', 'operating KPIs', 'annualized prod', 'facility expansion', 'construction site', 'construction agreement', 'phase 1 capex', 'phase 2 preparations', 'phase 2 build', 'second phase', 'extensive commissioning', 'testing period', 'standing biomass', 'same time', 'Good biology', 'Phase 1 construction', 'The Company', '100,000 smolt', '30 April', '5 April 2022', 'OSLO', 'Norway', 'PRNewswire', 'Q2', 'expectations', '~725 grams', '21 May', 'Heads', 'Terms', '31 March', 'structures', 'buildings', 'December', 'operations', 'addition', '5m', '26 March', 'handover', 'infrastructure', '300 grams', 'Story', 'technicians', 'overfeeding', '1 ton', 'development', 'moment', 'organization', 'fact', 'challenges', 'pandemic', 'beginning', '7 February 2022', 'principle', 'annum', 'share', 'Summary', 'outlook', 'September', 'eyes', 'target', 'full', 'level']",2022-05-24,2022-05-25,finance.yahoo.com

May 24  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- 437  the swimwear and activewear company  has selected Centric Software®'s Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solution. Ce…,"Based out of Toronto  Canada and founded in 2017 by Hyla Nayeri and Adrien Bettio to satisfy the need for swimwear that flatters more than just the perfect body. 437 has been featured in Forbes  Vogue  The New York Times and Hypebae. In addition  they have a strong social media presence with celebrities such as Kylie Jenner  Gabrielle Union-Wade and others having been spotted in 437's swimwear and recently launched activewear line.Jennifer Ginor  Director of Design at 437 describes how they want to streamline their specifications and have a more consistent fit across all their styles and fabrications. ""Right now  we have everything living on Google Sheets. It's really hard to find our source of truth. We have certain styles that have been living with us from the day of inception and to be able to copy those fits over  can be challenging as those specs are living all over the place.""With suppliers and production scattered around the globe  437 is looking to simplify collaboration with their vendors and reduce the number of errors in tech packs. The company turned to PLM. With respect to the requirements  Ginor says  ""We need something that's easy to use  quick to integrate. And that we can grow with."" 437 considered a few PLM vendors  but after the initial demo that Centric did  they were sold.Ginor notes  ""It's very early for us to be adding PLM—we're only 4 years old—but you can either hire more people or have a better process. With a better process  we have that one source of truth  fewer errors  streamlined BOMs and the ability to make more data-driven decisions. We're such a marketing-forward company that we want to respond quickly to our customers. Having a system like PLM is going to allow us to integrate into our other platforms to get the right feedback from a sales perspective to offer the products that our customers really do want from us.""Switching gears  Ginor talks about their environmental efforts. ""One of our biggest initiatives for the year is to become more sustainable. We're starting with fabrics and then moving on to production practices."" Being able to see an overview of where their products and resources are facilitates more strategic sourcing instead of leaving it up to each individual factory.""Any new fabrics are going to be made from recycled materials if possible. Where we can't  we would choose those with Fair Trade associations. Sustainability is such a broad spectrum—there's a lot of 'greenwashing' out there. So we're trying to be super intentional with our choices and be as transparent as possible with our consumers "" says Ginor. They are looking to be more socially responsible. ""It could mean using a small family run factory where they employ fair working conditions and it directly supports that family.""437 didn't really have any tools that organized the environmental practices that Ginor spoke of. ""We've moved sourcing from the factories to internally. We're mandating mills that align with our eco-goals."" Centric PLM enables the management of the certifications and materials.""One of the most interesting things about working with Centric is we can learn from them. We are a young team and the guidance from Centric has been super helpful thus far. Centric being at the cutting edge of technologies in the industry is beneficial to us as we continue on the sustainability path. We feel that working with Centric will help us reduce unnecessary work.""Chris Groves  President and CEO of Centric Software says  ""I am very pleased that 437 has selected Centric PLM as their digital foundation. It is a smart move to add PLM early in the history of the company  setting them up for continued success as they continue on their growth curve.""Learn more about Centric PLMRequest a DemoAbout 437 (www.shop437.com)We're 437—a luxe swim and activewear brand driven by a desire to create product that doesn't compromise on style  quality  or fit.Founded in 2017 by best friends Hyla Nayeri and Adrien Bettio  we've been expanding our product offering which started with swimwear but now includes activewear  beachwear  and accessories.

Following a period of testing and commissioning started in December last year with the first part of the facility commenced operations late March.Capex during the first quarter amounted to 244 million. In addition  NOK 13.5m of internal G&A were capitalized. Q1 2022 saw good progress at the construction site. Together with timing effects as to delivery dates of high value equipment  this contributed to the high Q1 capex.Following an extensive commissioning and testing period commenced already in December  Salmon Evolution took over the first part of the facility on 26 March. The handover included inter alia the water intake station and the first two fish tanks together with connecting infrastructure and technical installations. Later the same day  Salmon Evolution successfully completed its first smolt release consisting of about 100 000 smolt with an average weight of around 300 grams. Following the positive confirmation of the fish transfer process and a customary short adaption period for the fish  initial feeding commenced.Along with the Company's technicians being accustomed with the facility  feeding has been gradually increased. Throughout this process feed waste has been carefully monitored to avoid overfeeding. The Company is very pleased to see that the fish is responding very well to feeding and on 30 April a significant milestone was reached when the daily feeding volume for the first time exceeded 1 ton  which represented more than 2% of the standing biomass. The positive trend has continued in May with average daily feeding exceeding 2% of the biomass.Commenting on the development  CEO Håkon André Berg  said:""Since we started construction back in May 2020  the first smolt release has been the moment that we all have been waiting for. I am extremely proud of our organization and the fact that we have been able to adhere to our ambitious timeline  even with the challenges faced us during the pandemic.""At the same time  this is just the beginning. As we now move forward  our number one priority is the biology in our farm. Good biology will improve fish quality and translate into strong growth  which finally will be reflected in the financial performance. With our organization now totaling almost 50 highly skilled employees  I am more confident than ever in our mission - extending the ocean potential.""In addition  on 7 February 2022 Salmon Evolution announced that the company had entered into a Heads of Terms with Artec Aqua for the phase 2 build-out at Indre Harøy. Phase 2 is expected to in principle be identical to phase 1 and add a further 7 900 tons HOG of annual production  bringing the total planned production volume to 15 800 tons HOG per annum. The final design and construction agreement will include financing reservations providing Salmon Evolution with the necessary flexibility to align the phase 2 build out with the Company's overall financing plan.Further  on 5 April 2022 Salmon Evolution completed a private placement raising gross proceeds of NOK 300 million at a subscription price of NOK 9.00 per share. The private placement attracted strong interest from Norwegian  Nordic and international high-quality investors and was significantly oversubscribed. The net proceeds from the private placement will be used to (i) partly fund the second phase of the Indre Harøy facility  (ii) smolt facility expansion and (iii) for general corporate purposes.Summary and outlookSince Salmon Evolution was listed on Euronext Growth in September 2020  all eyes have been set at our targeted Q1 2022 milestone – first smolt release. The Company is very pleased to see that this target was achieved  transforming this ground-breaking building project at Indre Harøy into a full-fledged farming operation.Moreover  after nearly two months of production the operating KPIs look very promising. The feeding has increased steadily throughout the period and stabilized at a level in line with the targets set out in our production plan which should yield an annualized production of 7 900 tons HOG for each phase.The organization across the Group now totals nearly 50 skilled employees. The process leading up to the smolt release followed by initial operations have already provided our employees with valuable experience  strongly benefitting the next phase 1 construction milestones and upcoming smolt releases. Furthermore  these experiences will be vital as we move into our planned phase 2 expansion.The Company also aims to utilize these experiences in our international expansion  first in Korea through our K Smart joint venture where initial design and engineering activities continued in the first quarter with K Smart also retaining Billund Aquaculture to assist in this respect.With Salmon Evolution soon entering the operational and commercial phase  the Company is very pleased to see that the market fundamentals for salmon remain very strong. The average Fish Pool salmon price was NOK 80.0/kg in Q1 2022 compared to NOK 54.3/kg in Q1 2021  representing an increase of 47% year over year. Looking at the forward prices for the remainder of 2022  this points to a full year 2022 salmon price of more than NOK 80/kg. In comparison the full year salmon price for 2021 was NOK 58.4/kg. The Company also notes that airfreight costs for in particular the Asian market has been at elevated levels following the pandemic and war in Ukraine  resulting substantially higher salmon prices locally  e.g. in South Korea.Looking at 2022 most analysts now expect neutral or slightly negative global supply growth which should support a scenario with high salmon prices. Salmon Evolution sees a significant demand growth potential for salmon over the coming decade subject to the industry being able to grow the supply side. In this context the Company remains firm in its belief that land-based farming will need to play an important role alongside conventional farming.With our first fish now enjoying its new life at Indre Harøy and steadily growing every day  we look forward to first harvest during the fourth quarter and well ahead of year end. Salmon Evolution remains confident that 2022 will be a landmark year for the Company setting the stage for significant growth in the years to come. This in turn will enable Salmon Evolution to take a global frontrunner position in the future development of land-based salmon farming.Results presentationCEO Håkon André Berg and CFO Trond Håkon Schaug-Pettersen will present the results by webcast today  Tuesday 24 May at 08:00 a.m. CEST.The presentation and subsequent Q&A will be held in English.The presentation can be accessed at www.salmonevolution.no  or with the following link: https://streams.eventcdn.net/salmonevolution/2022q1/For further information  please contact:Håkon André Berg  CEO  Salmon Evolution[email protected]+47 41 19 22 57Trond Håkon Schaug-Pettersen  CFO  Salmon Evolution[email protected]+47 91 19 13 27This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/salmon-evolution/r/salmon-evolution---results-for-the-first-quarter-2022 c3573129The following files are available for download:https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a7a8a817a97ac010.pdf SALME Q1 2022 presentation https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a48ca9b7ce633851.pdf SALME Q1 2022 reportSOURCE Salmon Evolution",neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.7,0.12,0.17,True,English,"['Salmon Evolution', 'first quarter', 'Results', 'CEO Håkon André Berg', 'customary short adaption period', 'total planned production volume', 'strong initial feed numbers', 'Indre Harøy facility', 'Indre Harøy phase', 'first two fish tanks', 'NOK 300 million private placement', 'process feed waste', 'undrawn credit facilities', 'internal G&A', 'high value equipment', 'water intake station', 'number one priority', '50 highly skilled employees', 'international high-quality investors', 'general corporate purposes', 'ground-breaking building project', 'next smolt release', 'daily feeding volume', 'first smolt release', 'fish transfer process', 'First quarter highlights', 'First fish tanks', 'related technical installations', 'stable farm conditions', 'fledged farming operation', 'overall financing plan', 'First smolt batch', 'average daily feeding', 'high Q1 capex', 'April 2022 private placement', '12 fish tanks', 'initial feeding', 'two months', 'first part', 'first time', 'strong growth', 'strong interest', 'financing reservations', 'average weight', 'fish quality', 'annual production', 'production plan', 'annualized production', 'original timeline', 'low mortality', 'Artec Aqua', 'Available liquidity', 'Subsequent events', 'good progress', 'timing effects', 'delivery dates', 'Salmon Evolution', 'positive confirmation', 'significant milestone', 'positive trend', 'ambitious timeline', 'financial performance', 'ocean potential', '7,900 tons HOG', '15,800 tons HOG', 'final design', 'necessary flexibility', 'gross proceeds', 'subscription price', 'Norwegian, Nordic', 'net proceeds', 'Euronext Growth', 'Q1 2022 milestone', 'operating KPIs', 'facility expansion', 'construction site', 'construction agreement', 'phase 1 capex', 'phase 2 preparations', 'phase 2 build', 'second phase', 'extensive commissioning', 'testing period', 'standing biomass', 'same time', 'Good biology', 'Phase 1 construction', 'The Company', '100,000 smolt', '30 April', '5 April 2022', 'OSLO', 'Norway', 'PRNewswire', 'Q2', 'expectations', '~725 grams', '21 May', 'Heads', 'Terms', '31 March', 'structures', 'buildings', 'December', 'operations', 'addition', '5m', '26 March', 'handover', 'infrastructure', '300 grams', 'technicians', 'overfeeding', '1 ton', 'development', 'moment', 'organization', 'fact', 'challenges', 'pandemic', 'beginning', '7 February 2022', 'principle', 'annum', 'share', 'Summary', 'outlook', 'September', 'eyes', 'target', 'full', 'level']",2022-05-24,2022-05-25,prnewswire.com

In this context the Company remains firm in its belief that land-based farming will need to play an important role alongside conventional farming.With our first fish now enjoying its new life at Indre Harøy and steadily growing every day  we look forward to first harvest during the fourth quarter and well ahead of year end. Salmon Evolution remains confident that 2022 will be a landmark year for the Company setting the stage for significant growth in the years to come. This in turn will enable Salmon Evolution to take a global frontrunner position in the future development of land-based salmon farming.Results presentationCEO Håkon André Berg and CFO Trond Håkon Schaug-Pettersen will present the results by webcast today  Tuesday 24 May at 08:00 a.m. CEST.The presentation and subsequent Q&A will be held in English.The presentation can be accessed at www.salmonevolution.no  or with the following link: https://streams.eventcdn.net/salmonevolution/2022q1/For further information  please contact:Håkon André Berg  CEO  Salmon Evolutionhakon.andre.berg@salmone.no+47 41 19 22 57Trond Håkon Schaug-Pettersen  CFO  Salmon Evolutionthsp@salmone.no+47 91 19 13 27This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comThe following files are available for download:https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a7a8a817a97ac010.pdf SALME Q1 2022 presentation https://mb.cision.com/Public/19899/3573129/a48ca9b7ce633851.pdf SALME Q1 2022 reportView original content:SOURCE Salmon Evolution",neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.7,0.12,0.17,True,English,"['Salmon Evolution', 'first quarter', 'Results', 'CEO Håkon André Berg', 'customary short adaption period', 'total planned production volume', 'strong initial feed numbers', 'Indre Harøy facility', 'Indre Harøy phase', 'first two fish tanks', 'NOK 300 million private placement', 'process feed waste', 'undrawn credit facilities', 'internal G&A', 'high value equipment', 'water intake station', 'number one priority', '50 highly skilled employees', 'international high-quality investors', 'general corporate purposes', 'ground-breaking building project', 'next smolt release', 'daily feeding volume', 'first smolt release', 'fish transfer process', 'First quarter highlights', 'First fish tanks', 'related technical installations', 'stable farm conditions', 'fledged farming operation', 'overall financing plan', 'First smolt batch', 'average daily feeding', 'high Q1 capex', 'April 2022 private placement', '12 fish tanks', 'initial feeding', 'two months', 'first part', 'first time', 'strong growth', 'strong interest', 'financing reservations', 'average weight', 'fish quality', 'annual production', 'production plan', 'annualized production', 'original timeline', 'low mortality', 'Artec Aqua', 'Available liquidity', 'Subsequent events', 'good progress', 'timing effects', 'delivery dates', 'Salmon Evolution', 'positive confirmation', 'significant milestone', 'positive trend', 'ambitious timeline', 'financial performance', 'ocean potential', '7,900 tons HOG', '15,800 tons HOG', 'final design', 'necessary flexibility', 'gross proceeds', 'subscription price', 'Norwegian, Nordic', 'net proceeds', 'Euronext Growth', 'Q1 2022 milestone', 'operating KPIs', 'facility expansion', 'construction site', 'construction agreement', 'phase 1 capex', 'phase 2 preparations', 'phase 2 build', 'second phase', 'extensive commissioning', 'testing period', 'standing biomass', 'same time', 'Good biology', 'Phase 1 construction', 'The Company', '100,000 smolt', '30 April', '5 April 2022', 'OSLO', 'Norway', 'PRNewswire', 'Q2', 'expectations', '~725 grams', '21 May', 'Heads', 'Terms', '31 March', 'structures', 'buildings', 'December', 'operations', 'addition', '5m', '26 March', 'handover', 'infrastructure', '300 grams', 'technicians', 'overfeeding', '1 ton', 'development', 'moment', 'organization', 'fact', 'challenges', 'pandemic', 'beginning', '7 February 2022', 'principle', 'annum', 'share', 'Summary', 'outlook', 'September', 'eyes', 'target', 'full', 'level']",2022-05-24,2022-05-25,nbc29.com

In addition  the two companies will identify opportunities for the co-development of projects  with EDPR's shareholding potentially reaching up to 50% of the projects’ capital. The companies will also work together on R&D activities  new project development and equipment procurement.This agreement envisages to create value  leveraging synergies from the complementary skills and capabilities of the two companies  boosting the growth of EDPR's portfolio  especially in France  and contributing to the development of Lhyfe’s projects all around the world. It also contributes to achieve higher operational and commercial expertise in renewable hydrogen projects.According to Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade  CEO of EDP and EDP Renewables: ""We are pleased to have closed this important agreement with Lhyfe as part of its IPO. We believe that renewable hydrogen can complement the direct electrification as the best means for reducing CO2 emissions and achieving the decarbonization of the economy  including in the hard-to-electrify sectors. With this agreement with Lhyfe  we reinforce our commitment to the acceleration of the energy transition while also taking one step toward the achievement of our growth plans.”According to Matthieu Guesné  founder and CEO of Lhyfe: ""We are very proud to conclude this agreement with one of the world's largest renewable energy producers. The trust placed in us by EDPR allows us to confidently consider the development of our renewable hydrogen worldwide and on a large scale. We look forward to developing our future production sites alongside them  and to immediately decarbonising local mobility and industrial uses  thanks to the pooling of our strengths.”This partnership with Lhyfe reaffirms EDP’s commitment to the renewable hydrogen sector. The company's ambition is to deploy 1.5 GW of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030. In fact  the group has created the H2 Business Unit (H2BU)  especially dedicated to the development of renewable hydrogen projects and focused on developing opportunities in promising sectors  such as the steel industry  chemicals  refineries  and cement plants  as well as heavy-duty long-distance transport.EDP is at the forefront of this clean energy solution through its leading role in various projects such as the GreenH2Atlantic  a 100 MW renewable hydrogen production project in Sines (Portugal) which is one of the three projects selected by the EU Green Deal Call to demonstrate the viability of green hydrogen production. EDP is also promoting other projects in Spain and in Brazil  under its fair transition plans to transform coal plants into clean technology hubs  leaving no one behind. Additionally  EDP is actively engaging with relevant hydrogen players  leveraging on its significant portfolio of renewable assets  namely in the USA.As for Lhyfe's IPO  its objective is to support the company's development and growth strategy. The firm has a portfolio of more than 4.8 GW of total installed capacity in 93 projects under development in Europe and plans to install 200 MW by 2026 and 3 GW by 2030. Among these 93 projects  20 are at an advanced stage of development  with a total capacity of 380.5 MW expected to come onstream between 2023 and 2026.In September 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the world's first industrial plant directly connected to a wind farm and a seawater supply enabling electrolysis  and since then  it has begun delivering its green hydrogen to fuel mobility uses in the region. Given the size and the maturity of its projects  Lhyfe is one of the world’s largest and most advanced players in the green hydrogen market.Hydrogen's relevance is explained in the forecast for global demand for hydrogen to increase sixfold between 2020 and 2050  reaching 530 million tons in 2050  driven by economic growth and the multiplication of uses  both in industry and in mobility. The share of renewable hydrogen should represent 60% of total hydrogen demand by 2050.",neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,positive,0.66,0.31,0.02,True,English,"['EDP Renováveis', 'renewable hydrogen', 'EDPR', 'agreement', 'Lhyfe', 'fourth largest wind energy producer', '100 MW renewable hydrogen production project', ""Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade"", 'EU Green Deal Call', 'largest renewable energy producers', 'renewable green hydrogen production', 'green hydrogen production capacity', 'future production sites', 'R&D activities', 'clean energy solution', 'green hydrogen market', 'heavy-duty long-distance transport', 'clean technology hubs', 'renewable hydrogen sector', 'H2 Business Unit', 'first industrial plant', 'relevant hydrogen players', 'new project development', 'fair transition plans', 'hydrogen generation projects', 'renewable hydrogen projects', 'total hydrogen demand', 'energy transition', 'wind farm', 'renewable electricity', 'renewable assets', 'business area', 'advanced players', 'global demand', 'total capacity', 'growth plans', 'pure player', 'equipment procurement', 'complementary skills', 'higher operational', 'commercial expertise', 'direct electrification', 'best means', 'CO2 emissions', 'Matthieu Guesné', 'large scale', 'industrial uses', 'cement plants', 'leading role', 'coal plants', 'advanced stage', 'seawater supply', '530 million tons', 'projects’ capital', 'various projects', 'three projects', 'other projects', 'growth strategy', 'economic growth', 'industrial agreement', 'two companies', 'local mobility', 'one step', 'promising sectors', 'steel industry', 'mobility uses', 'important agreement', 'significant portfolio', 'EDP Renewables', 'world pioneer', '200 MW', '380.5 MW', '93 projects', 'Euronext', 'EDPR', 'Lhyfe', 'addition', 'opportunities', 'shareholding', 'value', 'synergies', 'capabilities', 'France', 'CEO', 'part', 'IPO', 'decarbonization', 'economy', 'commitment', 'acceleration', 'achievement', 'founder', 'trust', 'pooling', 'strengths', 'company', 'ambition', '1.5 GW', 'fact', 'group', 'H2BU', 'chemicals', 'refineries', 'forefront', 'GreenH2Atlantic', 'Portugal', 'viability', 'Spain', 'Brazil', 'USA', 'objective', 'firm', '4.8 GW', 'Europe', '3 GW', 'September', 'electrolysis', 'region', 'size', 'maturity', 'relevance', 'forecast', 'multiplication']",2022-05-24,2022-05-25,edpr.com

Total remuneration corresponds to a value of SEK 4 807 500 until the end of the Annual General Meeting 2023. The proposed remuneration for ordinary work of the Board of Directors (excluding work in committees and travel allowance) for the period until the end of the Annual General Meeting 2023 corresponds to a total value of SEK 4 200 000.The Nomination Committee considers that it is desirable for the Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting to be shareholders in Oncopeptides in order to strengthen common interests in the company. The Nomination Committee therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2022 resolves that 50 per cent (excluding remuneration for committee work or travel allowances) of the ordinary fixed remuneration consist of Share Awards in Board SHP 2022 in accordance with item 14 below.Remuneration for ordinary work of the of Board of Directors are proposed to be allocated in accordance with the following:SEK 1 500 000 to the Chairman of the Board of Directors (of which 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent in Share Awards); andto the Chairman of the Board of Directors (of which 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent in Share Awards); and SEK 600 000 to each of the other Board members (of which 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent in Share Awards) however  that Per Samuelsson has declined to receive Share Awards and will therefore only receive 50 per cent in cash.The resolution on remuneration in the form of share awards in accordance with this item 9 is conditional on the Annual General Meeting resolving on Board SHP 2022 in accordance with item 14 below. Should the majority requirement for item 14 not be met  the Nomination Committee proposes that the remuneration amounts stated above be paid in full in cash  whereby the Board members are requested to invest 50 per cent of the remuneration amount in shares in the company by buying shares on the market.In addition to the above proposed remuneration for ordinary board work  each of the Board members residing in the United States shall receive an additional amount of SEK 100 000 and each of the Board members residing in Europe  but outside the Nordics  shall receive an additional amount of SEK 50 000.The proposed remuneration for work within the committees of the Board of Directors for the period until the end of the Annual General Meeting 2023 amounts to a total of SEK 357 500 and shall be allocated in accordance with the following:SEK 82 500 to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members;to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and to each of the other two members; SEK 55 000 to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members; andto the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and to each of the other two members; and SEK 55 000 to the Chairman of the Scientific Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members.The Nomination Committee proposes  in accordance with the Audit Committee's recommendation  that the auditor is paid according to approved invoices.Election of members of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors (item 10)The Nomination Committee proposes the re-election of Per Wold-Olsen  Brian Stuglik  Cecilia Daun Wennborg  Jarl Ulf Jungnelius  Per Samuelsson and Jennifer Jackson  with Per Wold-Olsen as Chairman of the Board of Directors.Detailed presentations of the persons proposed by the Nomination Committee for re-election are included as an appendix to the Nomination Committee's statement  available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com.Election of auditor (item 11)The Nomination Committee proposes  in accordance with the Audit Committee's recommendation  the re-election of the charted auditing firm Ernst & Young AB (EY)  with the request that Anna Svanberg is appointed as auditor in charge.Resolution on the introduction of a long-term shareholder program for members of the Board of Directors (item 14)The Nomination Committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term shareholder program for members of the Board of Directors of Oncopeptides (""Board SHP 2022"") in accordance with items 14 (a) – (b) below. The resolutions under items 14 (a) – (b) below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 14 (b) below not be met  the Nomination Committee proposes that Oncopeptides shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 14 (c) below and resolutions under items 14 (a) and 14 (c) shall then be conditional upon each other.Board SHP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted share awards (""Share Awards"") that entitle to ordinary shares in Oncopeptides to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 245 000 ordinary shares. As part of the implementation of Board SHP 2022 it is proposed that the Board of Directors  in order to cover the delivery of shares to the participants  be authorized to resolve on issue and purchase of class C shares and resolution on transfer of ordinary shares in accordance with item 14 (b) below.Proposal for resolution on adoption of a long-term shareholder program for members of the Board of Directors (item 14 (a))The rationale for the proposalThe Nomination Committee considers that it is desirable for Board members to be shareholders in the Company in order to strengthen common interests. Furthermore  an equity based program is a central part of a competitive remuneration in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the Board of Directors. In the opinion of the Nomination Committee the Board SHP 2022 as well as the previous years' Board LTIP will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Oncopeptides' operations  improve Company loyalty and that Board SHP 2022 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Oncopeptides. By having annual board equity programs  an individual board member can over time build a more meaningful equity position that will further incentivize long-term behavior and also honor members that have served and intend to serve the Company for many years. The Nomination Committee requests the Board members to keep their received shares at least as long as the Board member is part of the Board of Directors  with the exception of financing tax as a consequence of this shareholder program.Per Samuelsson  who is associated with the main owner  HealthCap VI L.P  has chosen to refrain from participating in the shareholder program.Conditions for Share AwardsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards:The Share Awards shall be granted to the participants based on a share of the participants' board remuneration in accordance with what follows from item 9 and also the below  as soon as practicable after the Annual General Meeting (the "" Grant Date "")."").The Share Awards shall vest after approximately one year (corresponding to one year of service as a Board member)  corresponding to the earlier of the day before (i ) the Annual General Meeting 2023 or (ii) 1 July 2023 (the "" Vesting Date "")  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Oncopeptides on said date.OncopeptidesEach vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Oncopeptides without any compensation being payable as soon as practicable three years after the Grant Date.The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Oncopeptides ' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Share Awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Oncopeptides group.In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Oncopeptides   the Share Awards will  in certain cases  vest in their entirety upon such transaction.The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board SHP 2022.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount  corresponding to 50 per cent of the remuneration for ordinary board work  for the respective participant divided by the volume weighted average price of the Oncopeptides share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date. The Share Awards granted to each participant are consequently to be seen as an investment of part of the fixed remuneration for ordinary board work in accordance with what follows from the Nomination Committee's proposal in item 9.The Share Awards under Board SHP 2022 shall be awarded in accordance with the following:Share Awards calculated based on SEK 750 000 to the Chairman; andto the Chairman; and Share Awards calculated based on SEK 300 000 to each of Brian Stuglik   Cecilia Daun Wennborg   Jennifer Jackson and Ulf Jungnelius .In any event  Board SHP 2022 will comprise a total of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  entitle to not more than 245 000 shares in Oncopeptides.Preparation of the proposalBoard SHP 2022 has been initiated by the Nomination Committee and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) listed companies.DilutionAssuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10  Board SHP 2022 will comprise not more than 195 000 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.23 per cent on a fully diluted basis. The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Oncopeptides' existing incentive programs can be found in Oncopeptides' annual report for 2021  note 27  which is available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com  and on the Company's website under ""Remuneration"".Scope and costs of the programBoard SHP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10 and an annual increase in the share price of 20 per cent the average annual personnel cost for Board SHP 2022 according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 0.5 million before tax. The average annual social security costs are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 0.1 million  based on the above assumptions and social security costs of 22.2 per cent. The average total annual cost for Board SHP 2022 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security costs  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 0.6 million.The total cost of the Board SHP  including all costs referred to above and social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 1.9 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under Board SHP 2022 and Board LTIP 2021In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board SHP 2022 and Board LTIP 2021  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of class C shares and on repurchase of issued class C shares and resolves on transfer of own ordinary shares in accordance with item (b) below.

With disapplication of the shareholders' preferential rights  a participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares.

The repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. The purchase may be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to ensure the delivery of shares.Resolution on the transfer of own ordinary shares including for fulfilment of obligations under Board SHP 2022 and Board LTIP 2021 (item 14 (b)(iii))The Nomination Committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that class C shares that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase class C shares in accordance with item 14 (b)(ii) above  following reclassification into ordinary shares  may be transferred free of charge to participants in Board SHP 2022 and earlier adopted Board LTIP 2021 in accordance with resolved conditions. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a maximum of 280 000 ordinary shares may be transferred to participants in accordance with the terms of Board SHP 2022 and Board LTIP 2021. The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation as a result of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar events.Equity swap agreement with a third party (item 14 (c))Should the majority requirement for the resolutions under item 14 (b) above not be met  the Nomination Committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2022 resolves that Board SHP 2022 shall instead be hedged so that Oncopeptides can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Oncopeptides to the participants.The Board of Directors' proposed resolutionsAllocation of the Company's profit or loss in accordance with the adopted balance sheet (item 7 (b))The Board of Directors proposes that the loss for the year is carried forward.Presentation of the Board of Directors' remuneration report for approval (item 12)The Board of Directors proposes that the meeting resolves to approve the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2021 that has been prepared by the Board of Directors.Resolution on new Articles of Association (item 13)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to amend the Articles of Association.A new section  § 6  together with an updated wording of § 3 and § 5  is proposed in the Articles of Association. The new § 6  together with the amended § 5  allows for class C shares to be issued  conversion of class C shares into ordinary shares  redemption and regulates preferential rights. Following the insertion of a new section  a renumbering of sections is proposed  whereby the previous § 6 becomes § 7 and so on.Current wording Proposed wording3 § ObjectThe Company shall have as its object to directly or indirectly conduct research and development  manufacture  marketing  sales and licensing of pharmaceuticals for treatment of isolated as well as spread cancer disease and to conduct other business compatible therewith. 3 § ObjectThe Company shall have as its object to directly or indirectly conduct research and development  manufacture  marketing  sales and licensing of pharmaceuticals for treatment of cancer or other cancer-related diseases or conditions and to conduct other business compatible therewith. 5 § The Shares The number of shares shall not be not less than 66 000 000 and not more than 264 000 000 shares. The company shares shall be common shares that entitle to one vote each on general meetings. 5 § The Shares The number of shares shall not be not less than 66 000 000 and not more than 264 000 000 shares.The shares shall be issued in two classes  ordinary shares and class C shares. Ordinary shares shall entitle the holder to one (1) vote per share  whereas class C shares shall entitle the holder to one tenth (1/10) vote per share. Shares of each class may be issued in a quantity corresponding to the entire share capital of the company. Holders of class C shares are not entitled to dividends. Upon the company's liquidation  class C shares carry equivalent right to the company's assets as other shares  however not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share.Where the company resolves to issue new shares by way of a cash issue or a set-off issue  one old share shall entitle the holder to pre-emption rights to one new share of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously owned by the holder (primary pre-emption rights). Shares that are not subscribed for pursuant to primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (subsidiary pre-emption rights).

The resolutions under items 15 (a) – 15 (b) below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 15 (b) below not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that Oncopeptides shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 15 (c) and resolutions under items 15 (a) and 15 (c) shall then be conditional upon each other.Co-worker LTIP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  share awards subject to performance vesting (""Share Awards"") that entitle to ordinary shares in Oncopeptides to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 3 860 849 shares. As part of the implementation of Co-worker LTIP 2022  the Board of Directors is proposed  in order to cover delivery of shares to participants and any related social security costs  to be authorized to resolve on issue  purchase and transfer of class C shares in accordance with item 15 (b) below.Proposal regarding adoption of a long-term performance based incentive program for the Company's employees and consultants (item 15 (a))The rationale for the proposalCo-worker LTIP 2022 is intended for employees and consultants. The Board of Directors of Oncopeptides believes that an equity and performance based incentive program is a vital part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees and consultants in Oncopeptides and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. The proposed program is key for the Company's ability to retain  motivate and possibly attract  qualified key employees in Europe due to the European regulatory registration process and sales preparations. A competitive equity based incentive program will be a key component in order to be able to retain and possibly attract highly skilled and experienced individuals as Oncopeptides continues to develop its organization and business.The Board of Directors of Oncopeptides believes that Co-worker LTIP 2022 will create a strong alignment of the interests of the participants and the interests of the shareholders. Co-worker LTIP 2022 is adapted to the current position and needs of Oncopeptides. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that Co-worker LTIP 2022 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Oncopeptides' operations  improve Company loyalty and that Co-worker LTIP 2022 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Oncopeptides.Conditions for Share AwardsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards:The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants no later than 36 months after the Annual General Meeting  i.e. Co-worker LTIP 2022 is intended to be a multi-year program. Share Awards that fall due according to the terms must be returned and can be granted again within the framework of the mentioned 36-month period.The Share Awards shall vest after three years over the period from the date the Share Awards are allocated ("" Grant Date "") up to and including the third anniversary of the Grant Date (the "" Vesting Date ""). In addition to this timely condition just stated  the Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Oncopeptides share price  in accordance with the vesting conditions below.Oncopeptides The Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Oncopeptides share price from and including the Grant Date up to the Vesting Date. The development of the share price will be measured based on the volume weighted average price of the Oncopeptides share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days immediately prior to the Grant Date and the 10 trading days immediately prior to the Vesting Date. In the event the price of Oncopeptides ' share has thereby increased by more than 60 per cent  100 per cent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 per cent  33 per cent of such Share Awards shall vest. In the event of an increase of the share price of between 20 and 60 per cent  vesting of the Share Awards will occur linearly. Should the increase of the share price be less than 20 per cent  no vesting will occur.Oncopeptides Nasdaq Oncopeptides Shares on vested Share Awards shall be allocated as soon as practically possible after the Vesting Date after decision by the Board of Directors (with certain exceptions where the time of vesting may be accelerated). The earliest point in time at which shares on vested Share Awards can be delivered shall be the day falling immediately following the Vesting Date.Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Oncopeptides without any compensation being payable provided that the holder is still an employee of Oncopeptides at the Vesting Date. With some customary exceptions  vesting can occur even if the participant is no longer employed by Oncopeptides at the Vesting Date.Oncopeptides Oncopeptides The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Oncopeptides ' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Share Awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Oncopeptides group.In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Oncopeptides   the Share Awards will  in certain cases  vest in their entirety upon such transaction  whereupon the performance measures shall be based upon the share price in the public take-over offer.AllocationThe Board of Directors shall resolve upon the allocation of Share Awards no later than 36 months after the Annual General Meeting. Everyone who is employed or a consultant can be granted Share Awards.The principle for allocation is that each participant is granted a yearly allocation as a percentage of the base salary. In preparation of the proposal  market practice for peer companies has been reviewed and based on such review  the proposal in Co-worker LTIP 2022 is that the allocation is limited to not more than 500 per cent for the CEO  not more than 200 per cent to members of global senior management and not more than 100 per cent for other employees and consultants  of the yearly base salary. In addition  market practice for peer companies has shown that the percentage for allocation to newly employed and consultants normally amount to 1.5 to 2.5 times the corresponding allocation to employees and consultants already employed  whereby the proposal in Co-worker LTIP 2022 is that the allocation is limited to 1.5 times the yearly allocation for newly employed and new consultants.The number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal to the yearly allocation described above divided by the volume weighted average price of the Oncopeptides share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the Share AwardsThe Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of Co-worker LTIP 2022  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Oncopeptides based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Oncopeptides or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of Co-worker LTIP 2022 no longer serve their purpose.Preparation of the proposalCo-worker LTIP 2022 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Oncopeptides and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs  market practice for European (including Swedish) listed companies and taking into account also the market practice to be enabling to retain and possibly attract suitable persons due to the European regulatory registration process and sales preparations. Co-worker LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.DilutionAssuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10  Co-worker LTIP 2022 will comprise not more than 3 860 849 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 4.6 per cent on a fully diluted basis.Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to the Company's previously implemented employee option programs Employee Option Program 2016/2023  Co-worker LTIP 2017  Co-worker LTIP 2018  Co-worker LTIP 2019 and Co-worker LTIP 2021 as well as the Company's previously implemented incentive programs Board LTIP 2019  Board LTIP 2020  Board LTIP 2021 and now proposed Board SHP 2022 for certain members of the Board of Directors  including potential realization of financial hedge related to social security costs (""Previously Implemented Programs"")  the total dilution amounts to approximately 10 per cent on a fully diluted basis. The Board's fundamental position regarding allotment according to Co-worker LTIP 2022 is that the number of allotted Share Awards including at any given time outstanding Previously Implemented Programs shall not exceed a dilution corresponding to 10 per cent  calculated on a fully diluted basis  in connection with each resolved allotment under Co-worker LTIP 2022. As stated above  Co-worker LTIP 2022 is also intended to be a multi-year program that is intended to cover the company's needs for up to 36 months.The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information on Oncopeptides' existing incentive programs can be found in Oncopeptides' annual report for 2021  note 27  which is available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com  and on the Company's website under ""Remuneration"".Scope and costs of the programCo-worker LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10  an annual increase in the share price of 20 per cent and that the Share Awards at the Grant Date are valued in accordance with a Monte Carlo simulation  the average annual personnel cost for Co-worker LTIP 2022 according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 10.3 million before tax. The average annual social security costs are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 3.2 million  based on the above assumptions and social security costs of 31.42 per cent. The average total annual cost for Co-worker LTIP 2022 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security costs  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 13.5 million.The total cost of the Co-worker LTIP 2022  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 40.6 million under the above assumptions.The costs associated with Co-worker LTIP 2022 are expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Expenses relating to R&D/operating expenses"".Delivery of shares under Co-worker LTIP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Co-worker LTIP 2022  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of class C shares  repurchase of issued class C shares and on transfer of own ordinary shares in accordance with item (b) below. Should the majority requirement for resolutions pursuant to item 13 or item 15 (b) not be met  the program may be hedged by a resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal in accordance with item 15 (c) below.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on a directed share issue of class C shares  repurchase of issued class C shares  transfer of own ordinary shares to participants in Co-worker LTIP 2022 and in the market (item 15 (b))The resolutions under items 15 (b)(i) - (iii) are proposed to be conditional upon i) that the Annual General Meeting resolves in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal in accordance with item 13 regarding the adoption of a new Articles of Association  and ii) upon each other. It is therefore proposed that the resolutions under items 15 (b)(i) - (iii) are adopted jointly.Authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of new class C shares (item 15 (b)(i))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  at one or several occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 428 983 by the issue of not more than 3 860 849 class C shares  each with a quota value of approximately SEK 0.11. With disapplication of the shareholders' preferential rights  a participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the disapplication of the shareholders' preferential rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares under Co-worker LTIP 2022 as well as to cover any social costs due to Co-worker LTIP 2022.Authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase own class C shares (item 15 (b)(ii))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  at one or several occasions  to repurchase class C shares. The repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. The purchase may be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to ensure the delivery of shares and to cover any social costs due to Co-worker LTIP 2022.Resolution on the transfer of own ordinary shares (item 15 (b)(iii))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that class C shares that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase class C shares in accordance with item 15 (b)(ii) above  following reclassification into ordinary shares  may be transferred free of charge to participants in Co-worker LTIP 2022 in accordance with resolved conditions and transferred to cover any social costs due to Co-worker LTIP 2022.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a maximum of 3 860 849 ordinary shares may be transferred to participants in accordance with the terms of Co-worker LTIP 2022  and that it may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the price range registered at the time  to cover any social security contributions in accordance with the terms of Co-worker LTIP 2022. The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation as a result of an in-between bonus issue  share split  share split  rights issue and/or similar events.Proposal regarding equity swap agreement with a third party (item 15(c))Should the majority requirement for the resolutions under item 15 (b) above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2022 resolves that Co-worker LTIP 2022 shall instead be hedged so that Oncopeptides can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Oncopeptides to the participants.Resolution regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve upon issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles (item 16)Main proposal (item 16 (a))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2022 resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to  until the next Annual General Meeting  on one or more occasions  decide upon issuances of new shares  warrants and/or convertibles. New issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles may occur with or without preferential rights for shareholders of the Company and may be made either in cash and/or by way of set-off or contribution in kind or otherwise on specific terms. The number of shares issued  or number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  may not correspond to a dilution of more than 20 per cent of the total number of shares outstanding at the Annual General Meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  after full exercise of the hereby proposed authorization. The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and the acting scope of the Board of Directors. Should the Board of Directors resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this must be to finance an acquisition of operations or  alternatively  to procure capital to finance project development. Upon such deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the new issue shall be made at market terms and conditions. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments that may be required to register the authorization.Alternative proposal (item 16 (b))If the proposal in item 16 (a) above does not get the required supportive votes from the Annual General Meeting 2022 to be passed  the Board of Directors proposes that it is given an authorization to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertibles corresponding to a dilution of not more than 10 per cent  on the same terms and conditions as stated above in item 16 (a).Resolution on principles for guidelines for remuneration to senior management (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes updated principles for guidelines for remuneration to senior management in accordance with the following.The Board's proposals for new guidelines for remuneration to senior managementThe CEO and the other members of senior management fall within the provisions of these guidelines. The guidelines are forward-looking  i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the AGM 2022. The guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityOncopeptides is a biotech company focused on the development of targeted therapies for difficult-to-treat hematological diseases. Oncopeptides mainly conducts operations from the head office in Stockholm  Sweden. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To this end  it is necessary that the company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the company to offer the members of senior management a competitive total remuneration. Long-term share-based incentive programs have been implemented in the company. Such programs have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. The programs encompass management  Board members  founders and other personnel. For more information about these programs  including the criteria determining outcomes  refer to the Corporate governance report on pages 30-32. Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.Forms of remuneration etc.The remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the general meeting may – irrespective of these guidelines – resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration.The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one year. The variable cash remuneration consists of a target-based variable remuneration corresponding to 25-50 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary with capped at a maximum of 1.5 times the target-based remuneration for the CEO other senior management.For the CEO and other members of senior management  pension benefits  including health insurance  should be defined-contribution. Variable cash remuneration is not pensionable. The pension premium for defined contribution pensions shall amount to not more than 24 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.

The licence expires at the end of today.It was issued in early March by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control  following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Since then  Russia has made a series of payments on its foreign currency bonds to investors. But the sovereign is now on the brink of a default  following Washington's decision to let the licence lapse.""The game of chicken ended with OFAC putting the Russian chicken out of its misery "" said Tim Ash  senior EM sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. ""Only a matter of time now before Russia formally defaults.""Last Friday  Russia's finance ministry accelerated coupon payments on two bonds – its US$3bn 4.75% 2026s and €1bn 2.65% 2036s – that are not due until May 27. By making the payments to its National Settlement Depository  Russia said it had fulfilled its current obligations on the notesIt is not clear if the funds have been already channelled through to bondholders. One investor in Russian debt told IFR earlier in the week his fund had yet to receive the payments  though that was not a surprise as experience had shown there was often a time lag.One analyst said that  even following OFAC's decision  there is chance that bondholders could receive these latest payments. ""In theory  there is a chance that the payment may be processed even if the licence is not extended  since the finance ministry is technically not involved in the further stages of money flow "" he said. ""On the 27th  the NSD will debit Euroclear’s account with the NSD and then Euroclear will either process the payment or not.""Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Even if the monies on the 2026s and 2036s do eventually hit investors' accounts – they both have 30-day grace periods – Russia has further coupon payments due in June  which US investors will not be able to receive.The market is pricing in a default as more likely than not  and sooner rather than later  with the sovereign's foreign currency bonds trading at highly distressed levels.Ash said a default will be a big blow to Russia's pride. ""This will be humiliating for [President] Putin  who made a big thing with [then Chancellor] Schroeder at the time Russia was last on the brink of a Paris Club default that great powers like Russia pay their debts. Russia can no longer pay its debts because of its invasion of Ukraine. Reach your own conclusions on Russian superpower status "" he said.""Russia will lose almost all market access – even to the Chinese – because of this default. It will mean no financing for Russia Inc. except at exorbitant rates of interest. It means no capital  no investment and no growth.""A number of Russia's corporates have already been unable to process payments to their creditors on their foreign currency bonds because of the war. Intermediaries involved in the process have blocked transfers.Russia's state-owned banks – VTB  VEB and Sberbank  which are subject to full blocking sanctions – have made payments on their foreign currency bonds in roubles.",negative,0.01,0.15,0.84,negative,0.01,0.1,0.89,True,English,"['US Treasury decision', 'Russia', 'default', 'senior EM sovereign strategist', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'BlueBay Asset Management', 'National Settlement Depository', '30-day grace periods', 'full blocking sanctions', 'foreign currency bonds', 'foreign currency debt', 'Russian superpower status', 'Paris Club default', 'The US Treasury', 'Russian debt', 'two bonds', 'US citizens', 'early March', 'finance ministry', 'current obligations', 'One investor', 'One analyst', 'further stages', 'money flow', 'US investors', 'distressed levels', 'big blow', 'big thing', 'great powers', 'exorbitant rates', 'state-owned banks', 'Russian chicken', ""investors' accounts"", 'first default', 'Tim Ash', 'market access', 'bond payments', 'coupon payments', 'latest payments', 'time lag', 'special licence', 'Russia Inc.', '100 years', 'end', 'today', 'Office', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'series', 'brink', 'Washington', 'decision', 'game', 'OFAC', 'misery', 'matter', '2026s', '2036s', 'May', 'notes', 'funds', 'bondholders', 'IFR', 'week', 'surprise', 'experience', 'chance', 'theory', '27th', 'NSD', 'Euroclear', 'request', 'comment', 'monies', 'June', 'pride', 'Schroeder', 'debts', 'conclusions', 'Chinese', 'financing', 'interest', 'capital', 'investment', 'growth', 'number', 'corporates', 'creditors', 'war', 'Intermediaries', 'process', 'transfers', 'VTB', 'VEB', 'Sberbank', 'roubles', '75']",2022-05-25,2022-05-25,ifre.com

Should the majority requirement for item 14 not be met  the Nomination Committee proposes that the remuneration amounts stated above be paid in full in cash  whereby the Board members are requested to invest 50 per cent of the remuneration amount in shares in the company by buying shares on the market.In addition to the above proposed remuneration for ordinary board work  each of the Board members residing in the United States shall receive an additional amount of SEK 100 000 and each of the Board members residing in Europe  but outside the Nordics  shall receive an additional amount of SEK 50 000.The proposed remuneration for work within the committees of the Board of Directors for the period until the end of the Annual General Meeting 2023 amounts to a total of SEK 357 500 and shall be allocated in accordance with the following:SEK 82 500 to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members;SEK 55 000 to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members; andSEK 55 000 to the Chairman of the Scientific Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members.The Nomination Committee proposes  in accordance with the Audit Committee's recommendation  that the auditor is paid according to approved invoices.Election of members of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors (item 10)The Nomination Committee proposes the re-election of Per Wold-Olsen  Brian Stuglik  Cecilia Daun Wennborg  Jarl Ulf Jungnelius  Per Samuelsson and Jennifer Jackson  with Per Wold-Olsen as Chairman of the Board of Directors.Detailed presentations of the persons proposed by the Nomination Committee for re-election are included as an appendix to the Nomination Committee's statement  available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com.Election of auditor (item 11)The Nomination Committee proposes  in accordance with the Audit Committee's recommendation  the re-election of the charted auditing firm Ernst & Young AB (EY)  with the request that Anna Svanberg is appointed as auditor in charge.Resolution on the introduction of a long-term shareholder program for members of the Board of Directors (item 14)The Nomination Committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term shareholder program for members of the Board of Directors of Oncopeptides (""Board SHP 2022"") in accordance with items 14 (a) – (b) below. The resolutions under items 14 (a) – (b) below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 14 (b) below not be met  the Nomination Committee proposes that Oncopeptides shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 14 (c) below and resolutions under items 14 (a) and 14 (c) shall then be conditional upon each other.Board SHP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted share awards (""Share Awards"") that entitle to ordinary shares in Oncopeptides to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 245 000 ordinary shares. As part of the implementation of Board SHP 2022 it is proposed that the Board of Directors  in order to cover the delivery of shares to the participants  be authorized to resolve on issue and purchase of class C shares and resolution on transfer of ordinary shares in accordance with item 14 (b) below.Proposal for resolution on adoption of a long-term shareholder program for members of the Board of Directors (item 14 (a))The rationale for the proposalThe Nomination Committee considers that it is desirable for Board members to be shareholders in the Company in order to strengthen common interests. Furthermore  an equity based program is a central part of a competitive remuneration in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the Board of Directors.

By having annual board equity programs  an individual board member can over time build a more meaningful equity position that will further incentivize long-term behavior and also honor members that have served and intend to serve the Company for many years. The Nomination Committee requests the Board members to keep their received shares at least as long as the Board member is part of the Board of Directors  with the exception of financing tax as a consequence of this shareholder program.Per Samuelsson  who is associated with the main owner  HealthCap VI L.P  has chosen to refrain from participating in the shareholder program.Conditions for Share AwardsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards:The Share Awards shall be granted to the participants based on a share of the participants' board remuneration in accordance with what follows from item 9 and also the below  as soon as practicable after the Annual General Meeting (the "" Grant Date ""). The Share Awards shall vest after approximately one year (corresponding to one year of service as a Board member)  corresponding to the earlier of the day before (i ) the Annual General Meeting 2023 or (ii) 1 July 2023 (the "" Vesting Date "")  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Oncopeptides on said date. Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Oncopeptides without any compensation being payable as soon as practicable three years after the Grant Date. The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Oncopeptides ' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures. The Share Awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged. The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Oncopeptides group. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Oncopeptides   the Share Awards will  in certain cases  vest in their entirety upon such transaction. The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board SHP 2022.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount  corresponding to 50 per cent of the remuneration for ordinary board work  for the respective participant divided by the volume weighted average price of the Oncopeptides share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date. The Share Awards granted to each participant are consequently to be seen as an investment of part of the fixed remuneration for ordinary board work in accordance with what follows from the Nomination Committee's proposal in item 9.The Share Awards under Board SHP 2022 shall be awarded in accordance with the following:Share Awards calculated based on SEK 750 000 to the Chairman; andShare Awards calculated based on SEK 300 000 to each of Brian Stuglik   Cecilia Daun Wennborg   Jennifer Jackson and Ulf Jungnelius .In any event  Board SHP 2022 will comprise a total of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  entitle to not more than 245 000 shares in Oncopeptides.Preparation of the proposalBoard SHP 2022 has been initiated by the Nomination Committee and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) listed companies.DilutionAssuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10  Board SHP 2022 will comprise not more than 195 000 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.23 per cent on a fully diluted basis. The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Oncopeptides' existing incentive programs can be found in Oncopeptides' annual report for 2021  note 27  which is available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com  and on the Company's website under ""Remuneration"".Scope and costs of the programBoard SHP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"".

Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10 and an annual increase in the share price of 20 per cent the average annual personnel cost for Board SHP 2022 according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 0.5 million before tax. The average annual social security costs are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 0.1 million  based on the above assumptions and social security costs of 22.2 per cent. The average total annual cost for Board SHP 2022 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security costs  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 0.6 million.The total cost of the Board SHP  including all costs referred to above and social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 1.9 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under Board SHP 2022 and Board LTIP 2021In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board SHP 2022 and Board LTIP 2021  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of class C shares and on repurchase of issued class C shares and resolves on transfer of own ordinary shares in accordance with item (b) below.

Upon the company's liquidation  class C shares carry equivalent right to the company's assets as other shares  however not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share.Where the company resolves to issue new shares by way of a cash issue or a set-off issue  one old share shall entitle the holder to pre-emption rights to one new share of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously owned by the holder (primary pre-emption rights). Shares that are not subscribed for pursuant to primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (subsidiary pre-emption rights).

The resolutions under items 15 (a) – 15 (b) below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 15 (b) below not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that Oncopeptides shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 15 (c) and resolutions under items 15 (a) and 15 (c) shall then be conditional upon each other.Co-worker LTIP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  share awards subject to performance vesting (""Share Awards"") that entitle to ordinary shares in Oncopeptides to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 3 860 849 shares. As part of the implementation of Co-worker LTIP 2022  the Board of Directors is proposed  in order to cover delivery of shares to participants and any related social security costs  to be authorized to resolve on issue  purchase and transfer of class C shares in accordance with item 15 (b) below.Proposal regarding adoption of a long-term performance based incentive program for the Company's employees and consultants (item 15 (a))The rationale for the proposalCo-worker LTIP 2022 is intended for employees and consultants. The Board of Directors of Oncopeptides believes that an equity and performance based incentive program is a vital part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees and consultants in Oncopeptides and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. The proposed program is key for the Company's ability to retain  motivate and possibly attract  qualified key employees in Europe due to the European regulatory registration process and sales preparations. A competitive equity based incentive program will be a key component in order to be able to retain and possibly attract highly skilled and experienced individuals as Oncopeptides continues to develop its organization and business.The Board of Directors of Oncopeptides believes that Co-worker LTIP 2022 will create a strong alignment of the interests of the participants and the interests of the shareholders. Co-worker LTIP 2022 is adapted to the current position and needs of Oncopeptides. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that Co-worker LTIP 2022 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Oncopeptides' operations  improve Company loyalty and that Co-worker LTIP 2022 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Oncopeptides.Conditions for Share AwardsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards:The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants no later than 36 months after the Annual General Meeting  i.e. Co-worker LTIP 2022 is intended to be a multi-year program. Share Awards that fall due according to the terms must be returned and can be granted again within the framework of the mentioned 36-month period.The Share Awards shall vest after three years over the period from the date the Share Awards are allocated ("" Grant Date "") up to and including the third anniversary of the Grant Date (the "" Vesting Date ""). In addition to this timely condition just stated  the Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Oncopeptides share price  in accordance with the vesting conditions below.Oncopeptides The Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Oncopeptides share price from and including the Grant Date up to the Vesting Date. The development of the share price will be measured based on the volume weighted average price of the Oncopeptides share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days immediately prior to the Grant Date and the 10 trading days immediately prior to the Vesting Date. In the event the price of Oncopeptides ' share has thereby increased by more than 60 per cent  100 per cent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 per cent  33 per cent of such Share Awards shall vest. In the event of an increase of the share price of between 20 and 60 per cent  vesting of the Share Awards will occur linearly. Should the increase of the share price be less than 20 per cent  no vesting will occur.Oncopeptides Nasdaq Oncopeptides Shares on vested Share Awards shall be allocated as soon as practically possible after the Vesting Date after decision by the Board of Directors (with certain exceptions where the time of vesting may be accelerated). The earliest point in time at which shares on vested Share Awards can be delivered shall be the day falling immediately following the Vesting Date.Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Oncopeptides without any compensation being payable provided that the holder is still an employee of Oncopeptides at the Vesting Date. With some customary exceptions  vesting can occur even if the participant is no longer employed by Oncopeptides at the Vesting Date.Oncopeptides Oncopeptides The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Oncopeptides ' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Share Awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Oncopeptides group.In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Oncopeptides   the Share Awards will  in certain cases  vest in their entirety upon such transaction  whereupon the performance measures shall be based upon the share price in the public take-over offer.AllocationThe Board of Directors shall resolve upon the allocation of Share Awards no later than 36 months after the Annual General Meeting. Everyone who is employed or a consultant can be granted Share Awards.The principle for allocation is that each participant is granted a yearly allocation as a percentage of the base salary. In preparation of the proposal  market practice for peer companies has been reviewed and based on such review  the proposal in Co-worker LTIP 2022 is that the allocation is limited to not more than 500 per cent for the CEO  not more than 200 per cent to members of global senior management and not more than 100 per cent for other employees and consultants  of the yearly base salary. In addition  market practice for peer companies has shown that the percentage for allocation to newly employed and consultants normally amount to 1.5 to 2.5 times the corresponding allocation to employees and consultants already employed  whereby the proposal in Co-worker LTIP 2022 is that the allocation is limited to 1.5 times the yearly allocation for newly employed and new consultants.The number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal to the yearly allocation described above divided by the volume weighted average price of the Oncopeptides share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the Share AwardsThe Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of Co-worker LTIP 2022  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Oncopeptides based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Oncopeptides or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of Co-worker LTIP 2022 no longer serve their purpose.Preparation of the proposalCo-worker LTIP 2022 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Oncopeptides and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs  market practice for European (including Swedish) listed companies and taking into account also the market practice to be enabling to retain and possibly attract suitable persons due to the European regulatory registration process and sales preparations. Co-worker LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.DilutionAssuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10  Co-worker LTIP 2022 will comprise not more than 3 860 849 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 4.6 per cent on a fully diluted basis.Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to the Company's previously implemented employee option programs Employee Option Program 2016/2023  Co-worker LTIP 2017  Co-worker LTIP 2018  Co-worker LTIP 2019 and Co-worker LTIP 2021 as well as the Company's previously implemented incentive programs Board LTIP 2019  Board LTIP 2020  Board LTIP 2021 and now proposed Board SHP 2022 for certain members of the Board of Directors  including potential realization of financial hedge related to social security costs (""Previously Implemented Programs"")  the total dilution amounts to approximately 10 per cent on a fully diluted basis. The Board's fundamental position regarding allotment according to Co-worker LTIP 2022 is that the number of allotted Share Awards including at any given time outstanding Previously Implemented Programs shall not exceed a dilution corresponding to 10 per cent  calculated on a fully diluted basis  in connection with each resolved allotment under Co-worker LTIP 2022. As stated above  Co-worker LTIP 2022 is also intended to be a multi-year program that is intended to cover the company's needs for up to 36 months.The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information on Oncopeptides' existing incentive programs can be found in Oncopeptides' annual report for 2021  note 27  which is available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com  and on the Company's website under ""Remuneration"".Scope and costs of the programCo-worker LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10  an annual increase in the share price of 20 per cent and that the Share Awards at the Grant Date are valued in accordance with a Monte Carlo simulation  the average annual personnel cost for Co-worker LTIP 2022 according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 10.3 million before tax. The average annual social security costs are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 3.2 million  based on the above assumptions and social security costs of 31.42 per cent. The average total annual cost for Co-worker LTIP 2022 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security costs  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 13.5 million.The total cost of the Co-worker LTIP 2022  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 40.6 million under the above assumptions.The costs associated with Co-worker LTIP 2022 are expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Expenses relating to R&D/operating expenses"".Delivery of shares under Co-worker LTIP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Co-worker LTIP 2022  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of class C shares  repurchase of issued class C shares and on transfer of own ordinary shares in accordance with item (b) below. Should the majority requirement for resolutions pursuant to item 13 or item 15 (b) not be met  the program may be hedged by a resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal in accordance with item 15 (c) below.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on a directed share issue of class C shares  repurchase of issued class C shares  transfer of own ordinary shares to participants in Co-worker LTIP 2022 and in the market (item 15 (b))The resolutions under items 15 (b)(i) - (iii) are proposed to be conditional upon i) that the Annual General Meeting resolves in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal in accordance with item 13 regarding the adoption of a new Articles of Association  and ii) upon each other. It is therefore proposed that the resolutions under items 15 (b)(i) - (iii) are adopted jointly.Authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of new class C shares (item 15 (b)(i))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  at one or several occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 428 983 by the issue of not more than 3 860 849 class C shares  each with a quota value of approximately SEK 0.11. With disapplication of the shareholders' preferential rights  a participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the disapplication of the shareholders' preferential rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares under Co-worker LTIP 2022 as well as to cover any social costs due to Co-worker LTIP 2022.Authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase own class C shares (item 15 (b)(ii))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  at one or several occasions  to repurchase class C shares. The repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. The purchase may be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to ensure the delivery of shares and to cover any social costs due to Co-worker LTIP 2022.Resolution on the transfer of own ordinary shares (item 15 (b)(iii))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that class C shares that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase class C shares in accordance with item 15 (b)(ii) above  following reclassification into ordinary shares  may be transferred free of charge to participants in Co-worker LTIP 2022 in accordance with resolved conditions and transferred to cover any social costs due to Co-worker LTIP 2022.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a maximum of 3 860 849 ordinary shares may be transferred to participants in accordance with the terms of Co-worker LTIP 2022  and that it may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the price range registered at the time  to cover any social security contributions in accordance with the terms of Co-worker LTIP 2022. The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation as a result of an in-between bonus issue  share split  share split  rights issue and/or similar events.Proposal regarding equity swap agreement with a third party (item 15(c))Should the majority requirement for the resolutions under item 15 (b) above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2022 resolves that Co-worker LTIP 2022 shall instead be hedged so that Oncopeptides can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Oncopeptides to the participants.Resolution regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve upon issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles (item 16)Main proposal (item 16 (a))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2022 resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to  until the next Annual General Meeting  on one or more occasions  decide upon issuances of new shares  warrants and/or convertibles. New issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles may occur with or without preferential rights for shareholders of the Company and may be made either in cash and/or by way of set-off or contribution in kind or otherwise on specific terms. The number of shares issued  or number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  may not correspond to a dilution of more than 20 per cent of the total number of shares outstanding at the Annual General Meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  after full exercise of the hereby proposed authorization. The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and the acting scope of the Board of Directors. Should the Board of Directors resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this must be to finance an acquisition of operations or  alternatively  to procure capital to finance project development. Upon such deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the new issue shall be made at market terms and conditions. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments that may be required to register the authorization.Alternative proposal (item 16 (b))If the proposal in item 16 (a) above does not get the required supportive votes from the Annual General Meeting 2022 to be passed  the Board of Directors proposes that it is given an authorization to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertibles corresponding to a dilution of not more than 10 per cent  on the same terms and conditions as stated above in item 16 (a).Resolution on principles for guidelines for remuneration to senior management (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes updated principles for guidelines for remuneration to senior management in accordance with the following.The Board's proposals for new guidelines for remuneration to senior management The CEO and the other members of senior management fall within the provisions of these guidelines. The guidelines are forward-looking  i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the AGM 2022. The guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability Oncopeptides is a biotech company focused on the development of targeted therapies for difficult-to-treat hematological diseases. Oncopeptides mainly conducts operations from the head office in Stockholm  Sweden. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To this end  it is necessary that the company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the company to offer the members of senior management a competitive total remuneration. Long-term share-based incentive programs have been implemented in the company. Such programs have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. The programs encompass management  Board members  founders and other personnel. For more information about these programs  including the criteria determining outcomes  refer to the Corporate governance report on pages 30-32.

These forward-looking statements may include  among other things  plans  objectives  beliefs  intentions  strategies  projections and anticipated future economic performance based on assumptions and the like that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as 'anticipate'  'estimate'  'expect'  'intend'  'will'  'project'  'plan'  'believe'  'target'  and other words and similar references to future periods but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. As such  all forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances that are beyond the control of the Company. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Therefore  you should not rely on such forward-looking statements  which speak only as of the date they are made  as a prediction of actual results or otherwise. Important factors which may cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to: the impact of outbreaks  epidemics or pandemics  such as the Covid-19 pandemic and ongoing challenges and uncertainties posed by the Covid-19 pandemic for businesses and governments around the world; the unanticipated loss of a material client or key personnel; delays or reductions in client advertising budgets; shifts in industry rates of compensation; regulatory compliance costs or litigation; changes in competitive factors in the industries in which we operate and demand for our products and services; our inability to realise the future anticipated benefits of acquisitions; failure to realise our assumptions regarding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets; natural disasters or acts of terrorism; the Company's ability to attract new clients; the economic and geopolitical impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine; the risk of global economic downturn; technological changes and risks to the security of IT and operational infrastructure  systems  data and information resulting from increased threat of cyber and other attacks; the Company's exposure to changes in the values of other major currencies (because a substantial portion of its revenues are derived and costs incurred outside of the UK); and the overall level of economic activity in the Company's major markets (which varies depending on  among other things  regional  national and international political and economic conditions and government regulations in the world's advertising markets). In addition  you should consider the risks described in Item 3D  captioned ""Risk Factors "" which could also cause actual results to differ from forward-looking information. In light of these and other uncertainties  the forward-looking statements included in this document should not be regarded as a representation by the Company that the Company's plans and objectives will be achieved. Neither the Company  nor any of its directors  officers or employees  provides any representation  assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of any events anticipated  expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements will actually occur. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise.EXHIBIT INDEXExhibit No. Description 1 Notification of Major Holdings dated 25 May 2022  prepared by WPP plc.TR-1: Standard form for notification of major holdings1.

It'll be a while.SFDR came in at 30%  CSDR just 4%.Dwyer: There's a number of regulatory touchpoints which affect ETFs  and how these key elements of the structure operate. In terms on non-ESMA  we continue to be of the view that the ETF guidelines need to be updated.16:37 Closing RemarksDwyer on SFDR  EU taxonomy: ""We fully understand the data related challenges  of an ETF as 6 8 9. We also need to ensure there is appropriate disclosure for investors. We're not in a position to address this really it lies with European authorities.""Dwyer: Our primary objective is an effective arbitrage system. IOSCO engagement has provided a meaningful insight to us in this in this context and will inform our future approach.16:37 Closing RemarksDwyer: ""The Covid period represented a solid testing of ETFs. They did demonstrate resilience  but not without support from regulatory authorities  such as the Bank of International Settlements. That kind of work is nearing its end. The CBI engaged with participants to identify ETF related pinch points  and we saw a marked increase in failed trades. Yet on balance  there was resilience in the operations of ETFs.""16:36 Closing RemarksDwyer: ""ETFs should not be overly complex. This is likely to have challenges to the arbitrage mechansism  and in the investor understanding perspective.""16:35 Closing RemarksDwyer: ""There is a balance to be struck between increased retail participation without inhibiting the next product or strategy. Innovation is always welcome but the risk of investor detriment must be damaged. This is in the regulatory DNA.""16:32 Closing RemarksDwyer: ""The concern is to look at product rules  do they support the needs of those liquidity providers  and in relation to the product itself. Need to ensure there is sufficient confidence in that liquidity provision. Needs to be capable of withstanding stress events""16:31 Closing RemarksDwyer: From our a regulatory perspective  we need to ensure that ETF structure is robust. Core to us is trader prices are relatable to NAV.16:30 Closing RemarksDwyer: Pretrade consolidation tape 'hopefully at end of decade.' Fundamental questions remain over quality of data.16:28 Closing RemarksDwyer: ""In only truly exceptional circumstances should there be differentiated access for investors. We common support the common approach to trading for ETFs.""16:25 Closing RemarksETF Update from Central Bank of IrelandCatherine Dwyer  Senior Policy Adviser  Central Bank of Ireland16:22 Germany PanelMiller: I expected the UK to do more to develop faster. This isn't to say the UK isn't in a good place right now.16:19 Germany PanelMiller: ""Crypto we see as a tool to engage people with."" McManus: ""It is not part of our offering. Focus on things you understand.""16:16 Germany PanelMcManus: ""The reality is wealth management is a partnership.""16:12 Germany PanelMiller: Italy has a high affinity for ETF products  following in footsteps of Germany. McManus also sees massive opportunity in Southern Europe  but needs targeting for mass affluent populations with digital engagement.16:07 Germany PanelMiller: ""Low interest rates  GameStop  crypto and the pandemic all increased interest in the pandemic. More than 50% of our clients will have a weekly payment into an ETF  averaging £500 a month.""16:01 Germany PanelMcManus: ""There's an assumption that every person in society wants to engage in investment management. People really require solutions to meet their goals  and people have thought very differently in the post-Covid period.""16:00 Germany PanelMcManus: ""ETFs aren't actually that easy to understand  especially for an everyday retail investor.""15:56 Germany PanelMiller: We pulled out of the UK at the beginning of last year  we were able to accelerate mcuh more quickly in Germany.15:52 Germany PanelMiller: ""When you get to the more nuanced ETFs that's where there's potentially more opportunity with more margin and higher fees.""15:45 Germany PanelLessons from Germany: The rise of retailAn ETF revolution has taken place in Germany over the past two years. BlackRock has now forecasted there will be 20 million people making monthly contributions to ETF savings plans by 2026  a vast increase in a market that now has the biggest ETF share in Europe.What are some of the key lessons market participants can take away from this growth story and how are other countries in Europe reacting?Speakers:Simon Miller  head of broker international at Scalable CapitalJames McManus  CIO at NutmegTheo Andrew  a senior reporter at ETF Stream15:07 European ETF PanelShastry: RFQs was created to decrease errors. There is a place for these systems  but not the most efficient way for smaller transactions.15:02 European ETF PanelBlanc tells of a guest at the Ecosystem conference who saw an ad on primetime French national television for a roboadvisor on ETF solutions. For Blanc  this is something that you wouldn't have seen five years ago.14:59 European ETF PanelChauhan: ""The responsibility of us as an ecosystem is to ask have we democratised the access of liquidity in a fair and transparent way.""14:52 European ETF PanelShastry: ""We were able to ramp up increase in trades during Covid thanks to advanced technology.""14:48 European ETF PanelShastry: ETFs were used to help the underlying fixed income market during the Covid crisis. ETFs used in ""a lot more sophisticated way than buy and hold.""14:45 European ETF PanelPanel Discussion: The European ETF market remains fragmented across trading venues with multilateral trading facilities  exchanges and systematic internalisers  to name a few  all looking to offer best execution opportunities to buy-side houses. This panel will explore how the ETF market is developing from both an innovation and technological perspective.Speakers:Gunjan Chauhan  Senior Managing Director at State Street Global Advisors  Global Head of Capital Markets and Strategic Partners for the SPDR ETF BusinessGregoire Blanc is the Head of Capital Markets & Liquidity at AmundiKeshava Shastry  managing director and head of capital market at DWSMichael O'Riordan  founding partner  Blackwater Search & Advisory14:39 HotseatIs the crypto pricing market still stuck in the dark ages? Thurston: ""Yes  very much so.""14:38 HotseatThurston on Trident: ""A triparty model utilising structures that were already in the industry.""14:35 HotseatThurston: The crypto providers were 'low hanging fruit' with the most issues and least infrastructure in place.14:31 HotseatThurston: ""We are now beginning to see more and more structure being brought into the crypto industry."" States that 21Shares should stop releasing products so quickly to better have a chance of grasping opportunities in crypto.14:30 HotseatNext up is 'In the hot seat: COSMOS and Trident: Bringing institutional assets to crypto'  a conversation between Bernie Thurston  CEO at Ultumus  and Tom Eckett  of ETF Stream.14:22 KeynoteMellor on Globalisation vs Localistion: There is a question whether localistion will retake globalisation  a trend which had benefitted London. Also remarks that the UK is a top 5 fintech location.14:19 KeynoteMellor: ""People need to trade in and through the City for it to remain competitive.""14:17 KeynoteMellor: In the last 18 months  the UK has decided it can't wait for the EU. There have been 30 consultations in the last year on the rules and regulations for the City. Queen's Speech contained mention of reform of Solvency II.14:13 Keynote""Equivalence is a ship that has sailed."" You are going to get divergence  says Mellor  as UK focuses on being a global financial centre rather than complete alignment with EU. The EU is also changing stance on what equivalence means.14:10 KeynoteMellor: A gap between Financial Services MoU  with UK having signed but EU yet to do so until further issues resolved. One temporary legislation in place in relation to clearing banks. According to EY  7 500 jobs have moved from UK to EU as a result of Brexit.14:09 KeynoteMellor: ""London's volumes of activity are growing  but still becoming a smaller piece of the pie.""14:08 KeynoteMellor: Across the EU  you have a fragmented response to financial services.14:05 KeynoteMellor: In 2018 London lost its place as the Number 1 global financial centre to New York  and New York has furthered its lead since.14:00 KeynoteWe are back and hearing from Robert Mellor  partner and UK Alternatives Markets Leader at PwC on London as a future financial leader.12:50 Settlement DisciplineStewart: ""I'm not yet at liberty to disclose who have paid penalty fees  but the people we are seeing who are the usual suspects."" On numbers of fines  Stewart demurs  and notes there is still fine tuning going on internally in own Clearstream systems.""It's a moving picture  which is why we're not disclosing numbers yet.""""I remain optimistic and bullish it is going to be for the greater good.""12:45 Settlement DisciplineStewart: ""Our mission in life is to be the infrastructure through which transactions are settled."" On CSDR: ""When things are ironed out things will operate smoother and more cheaply."" Penalty fees '""not in our interest."" and Clearstream desire to reach ""Mutually beneficial outcome quicker.""12:42 Settlement DisciplineStewart: ""For many in the market CSDR is still a point of pain  leading to much more partial settlement  and a cost consequence. A next step is people need to better understand the regulation.""12:35 Settlement DisciplineStewart: ""That international element is being caught up in CSDs and being caught up in resulting timeliness issues  late settlement effectively.""12:35 Settlement DisciplineStewart: ""There has been an international success of the ETF model in Europe.""12:34 Settlement DisciplineAndrew: CSDR hot potato in industry  Stewart starts with overview. Stewart notes it is a European regulation for CSDs  and is a massive regulation as CSDs are very large structures. CSDs are all about settlement  and ensuring the settlement process is carried out in a timely manner.12:30 Settlement disciplineNext up is 'Settlement discipline for ETFs: Challenges and opportunities'  a discussion between Allan Stewart  VP for ETF sales and relationship Management at Clearstream  and Theo Andrew  a senior reporter at ETF Stream.12:25 The evolution of ETF dataThurston: ""We have all these three letter acronyms in the ETF industry  and there is no consistency.""12:20 The evolution of ETF dataThurston: ""What we've seen with ESG is a very good structure poorly implemented  I don't think we're seeing the data for it.

The final analysis included six-month follow-up data and confirmed the topline results reported in December 2021.The VLA1553-302 trial met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that three consecutively manufactured vaccine lots elicited equivalent immune responses measured by neutralizing antibody titer GMT ratios on Day 29 after vaccination.The trial included 408 participants aged 18 to 45 years. The safety profile shown in study VLA1553-302 was similar to the Phase 3 trial  VLA1553-3011. With a 96.0% seroprotection rate at Day 180  the immunogenicity profile from study VLA1553-301 was also confirmed.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva commented  “We are extremely pleased that the final lot-to lot data confirmed the previously reported topline results. We have now all necessary clinical data to support submission with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  which we plan to start later this year. Chikungunya is a major  growing and unmet public health threat  yet no vaccine or specific treatment is currently available to prevent this debilitating disease. We will continue to work assiduously to bring VLA1553 to market as soon as possible.”Valneva’s chikungunya program was awarded Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the US FDA in July 2021. This milestone followed the US FDA’s Fast Track designation and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s PRIME designation which the Company received in December 2018 and in October 2020  respectively. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine Biologics License Application (BLA) to be approved in the U.S. will be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) 2.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in 72-92% of humans after 4 to 7 days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 100 countries. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas3 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.Story continuesAbout VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate designed to target the chikungunya virus. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.In March 2022  Valneva announced successful completion of the Phase 3 pivotal trial of VLA15534. The final six-month analysis confirmed the very high level of seroprotection reported from this trial in August 2021. In this double-blind  multi-center  randomized Phase 3 clinical trial  4 115 participants aged 18 years and above were randomized 3:1 into two groups to receive either 0.5mL of VLA1553 or a placebo. The trial met its primary endpoint  inducing protective CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers in 98.9% of participants 28 days after receiving a single shot (264 of 268 subjects from the per-protocol subgroup tested for immunogenicity  95% CI: 96.2-99.6). The seroprotective titer was agreed with the FDA to serve as a surrogate of protection that can be utilized in a submission for approval of VLA1553 under the accelerated approval pathway. VLA1553 was highly immunogenic  with a GMT of approximately 3 270.VLA1553 was generally well tolerated among the 3 082 subjects evaluated for safety. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board  or DSMB  continuously monitored the study and identified no safety concerns. Solicited adverse events were observed  the majority of which were mild or moderate and resolved within 3 days.Additionally  VLA1553 was shown in the Phase 3 pivotal trial to be highly immunogenic in elderly study participants  who achieved equally high seroprotection rates and neutralizing antibody titers as younger adults  as well as an equally good safety profile.VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing travel vaccine portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  if approved  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations. The global market for chikungunya vaccines is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20325.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15536. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20197  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Phase 3 study VLA1553-302The VLA1553-302 clinical lot-to-lot consistency study is a prospective  multicenter  randomized  pivotal Phase 3 study including 408 participants aged 18 to 45 years. Lyophilized VLA1553 were administered as a single intramuscular immunization. Equivalence of immune responses was determined based on neutralizing antibody titers. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate a pair-wise comparison of the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) on the ratio of GMTs on Day 29 after vaccination in the three vaccine lots. The two-sided 95% CI on the GMT ratio should be within 0.67 and 1.5 in order to demonstrate consistency.Study volunteers were followed for six months after vaccination. Additional information  including a detailed description of the study design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04786444).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development  beginning with the identification of deadly and debilitating infectious diseases that lack a prophylactic vaccine solution and for which there are limited therapeutic treatment options. It then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science  including its expertise across multiple vaccine modalities  as well as its established vaccine development capabilities  to develop prophylactic vaccines to address these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities to successfully commercialize two wholly owned vaccines and rapidly advance multiple vaccine candidates into late-stage clinical development  including candidates against Lyme disease (partnered with Pfizer)  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investors ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  PhDVP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  results and completion of research  development and clinical trials for investigational product candidates and estimates for future performance.

Despite current treatments  RA continues to pose a substantial burden to people living with the disease  comprised of the daily health issues directly related to their RA  such as pain  and the complications of managing comorbid conditions.1 2 3About the FINCH 4 LTE studyFINCH 4 is an ongoing phase 3 open-label LTE study of filgotinib 200mg and filgotinib 100mg for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of filgotinib in participants who have completed one of the parent studies of filgotinib in RA. Eligible patients completed a prior phase 3 randomised double-blind study of filgotinib lasting 52 weeks (FINCH 1 or 3) or 24 weeks (FINCH 2).About filgotinibFilgotinib is approved and marketed as Jyseleca (200mg and 100mg tablets) in the European Union  Great Britain  and Japan for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Available via SAP Data Custodian  Thales’s tokenization solution provides more granular levels of data protection and user access controls  dramatically accelerating time to compliance for organizations that are moving more applications and workload to the cloud.The new availability of Thales’s CipherTrust Tokenization in the SAP Data Custodian builds on a successful  long-term relationship between the two companies for encryption  tokenization and key management solutions. The tokenization solution in the SAP Data Custodian was developed by both organisations through SAP’s Co-innovation Lab  ensuring the security of sensitive data at the most fundamental levels of the application. SAP customers can now secure their private data at rest in a database  in use  and even during development.“The release of the SAP Data Custodian Tokenization solution powered by Thales’s CipherTrust Tokenization service further advances our commitment to secure our customers’ private data as they migrate to the public cloud ” said Dr Wasif Gilani at SAP. “This new solution builds on the strengths of both partners to create a comprehensive  trustworthy solution for our customers as they operate their applications using sensitive data.”Maintaining compliance with demanding security regulationsToday’s enterprises must ensure the privacy and security of sensitive data  including personally identifiable information (PII) and payment card information (PCI). In particular  the Schrems II decision mandates that all European companies conduct individual assessments of each data transfer to a non-EU country to ensure compliance. The new partnership between Thales and SAP allows customers to define security on a per-field basis in the application according to templates in the Data Custodian user interface. Field-level security protects private data before it is written to databases  simplifying database access controls and ensuring compliance with PII and PCI regulations.“Modern enterprises recognize the importance of a comprehensive cybersecurity solution  protecting sensitive data throughout its entire lifecycle  including the earliest moments of data creation ” said Todd Moore  vice president of encryption products at Thales. “This new CipherTrust Tokenization solution  co-developed with our partners at SAP  will give users the confidence that their data is secure at all times even at the most granular  field level. We will continue to partner with companies like SAP to develop highly integrated solutions that ensure data security for all cloud users.”Thales’s CipherTrust Tokenization solution is generally available today to secure all SAP applications supported by the SAP Data Custodian.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies  investing in digital and “deep tech” innovations – connectivity  big data  artificial intelligence  cybersecurity and quantum technologies – to build a confident future crucial for the development of our societies.

5530,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4514262-ocis-ebitda-explodes-higher-fertilizer-prices-q2-even-better,OCI's EBITDA Explodes On Higher Fertilizer Prices  And Q2 Will Be Even Better,OCI is taking full advantage of the current tailwind on the fertilizer markets & net debt and debt ratio are decreasing incredibly fast. Read more on OCI here.,Orest Lyzhechka/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionLong-time followers and readers may remember I was getting bullish on OCI (OTC:OCINF) a few years ago as the company was one of my favorite turnaround stories. It had just completed a sizeable investment in expanding its operations and the debt level was high but I was arguing a higher EBITDA would keep the debt ratio under control while I was also anticipating the free cash flow would help to reduce the net debt. This has now happened and OCI is now rated investment grade again by all three major rating agencies.The COVID pandemic made the situation a little bit tricky but OCI survived the test and is now printing cash – thanks to the very high fertilizer prices as revenue and EBITDA in Q1 doubled compared to the first quarter of last year.Yahoo FinanceOCI has its primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam where it’s trading with OCI as its ticker symbol. As the average daily volume on the Amsterdam listing exceeds half a million shares  it is by far the most liquid venue to trade in the company’s shares (and options).Q1 was phenomenal  but Q2 will be even betterAlthough OCI sold less fertilizer (the total amount of fertilizer products sold fell by 11%  mainly due to an inventory level build-up ahead of the spring season)  it saw a sharp uptick in the volumes traded for third parties.OCI Investor RelationsBut the commodity prices were the saving grace for OCI. The ammonia prices more than tripled compared to a year ago while virtually any other commodity produced by OCI (except methanol) saw their prices at least double as well. And although the melamine price was up by a factor of 2.49  OCI did curtail the production at its European plant due to the high natural gas prices which more than quintupled.OCI Investor RelationsDespite the lower volumes of own products sold  the revenue more than doubled to just over $2.3B resulting in a gross profit of $864M  which is more than 150% higher than in the first quarter of last year. There were some slightly higher operating expenses as the SG&A expenses increased but this had barely any impact on the reported results. The pre-tax income almost quadrupled to almost $840M while the net income jumped to $699M.OCI Investor RelationsOf that $699M  about $410M was attributable to the shareholders of OCI (the remainder of almost $290M was attributable to minority interests). This means the Q1 EPS was approximately $1.95 which translates into roughly 1.85 EUR per share  so on an annualized basis  the EPS is getting close to 7.50 EUR per share.My original thesis was cash flow centered. I argued the stronger cash flows would immediately contribute towards reducing the net debt and of course I was expecting to see a very strong conversion of earnings into free cash flow in the first quarter of the year.Let’s start with the reported operating cash flow  which came in at $726M. This includes an investment of almost $200M in the working capital position. We should however also deduct an additional $83M to adjust for the differences in taxes paid and taxes due while I will make an additional adjustment for the differences between interest paid and interest owed  which reduces the operating cash flow by an additional $25M. So on an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow is approximately $820M.OCI Investor RelationsThe financial cash flows also show a lease payment of $8M and a dividend paid to non-controlling interests of $67M. However  to be fair  I will deduct the entire income of $290M attributable to non-controlling interests as there is a difference between what’s ‘owed’ to those minority shareholders and what has actually been paid as a dividend. When all the dust has settled  the adjusted operating cash flow was $520M.OCI Investor RelationsMy main argument in the pre-COVID era was that once the new plants were completed  the capex levels would drop to almost zero. That scenario has now fully come through and in Q1 the total amount of depreciation expenses were almost $150M while the capex dropped to just the maintenance capex of just over $50M. This means the free cash flow attributable to the shareholders of OCI was approximately $470M or $2.23/share (or roughly 2.10 EUR per share). Not bad for just one quarter.OCI Investor RelationsNeedless to say the first quarter of 2022 was absolutely amazing but OCI doesn’t think the current tailwind will suddenly disappear. The short-term outlook is exceptionally strong as OCI expects its Q2 performance to be better than the Q1 result (both in terms of EBITDA as well as reported free cash flow) while it says it expects the positive market outlook to continue until at least 2024 thanks to the combination of low global grain stocks  favorable farm economics and of course  the geopolitical events in Eastern Europe which may have a major impact on food supply while the import ban for Russian and Belarussian fertilizer will likely keep the fertilizer prices elsewhere high.Suddenly the net debt is evaporating extremely fast  paving the way for dividendsThanks to the incoming free cash flow  the net debt is decreasing very fast and the next image provides an excellent overview of the evolution of the net debt as well as the debt ratio. Keep in mind the debt ratio (net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA) is based on the LTM EBITDA. This LTM EBITDA will continue to increase in the next few quarters so the debt ratio should actually continue to improve as the net debt will decrease thanks to the strong cash flows while the EBITDA will continue to increase.OCI Investor RelationsOCI has announced a dividend of 1.45 EUR per share based on the H2 2021 results but has guided for a much higher dividend after the first semester of this year. Considering the company is guiding for a better result in Q2 than in Q1  I think it’s not unreasonable to expect an EPS of around 4 EUR per share for the first half of the current financial year.The company recently updated its capital returns policy. The dividend will consist of a minimum dividend of $400M per year (approximately $1.90 per share) while OCI will also increase those dividends with a variable component  based on the actual financial performance. As OCI is definitely in a bullish cycle right now we should definitely be able to expect a substantial dividend after H1 as the base dividend will only require about 0.90 EUR of the likely 4.00+ EUR EPS generated in H1 2022.OCI Investor RelationsInvestment thesisWe are now about three years after my last article on OCI  and the investment thesis is now finally playing out  thanks to the strengthening fertilizer prices which accelerate the debt reduction and EBITDA increase. Without the exceptional strength we are currently seeing on the fertilizer market  OCI would still have been able to achieve its goals  but it’s going so much faster right now.OCI is currently immensely benefiting from the tailwinds in the fertilizer industry and as the company expects these tailwinds to continue into 2024  the company may actually have a net cash position (even after taking the generous dividends into account) before the down-cycle starts.I currently no longer have a position in OCI but I have considered writing some out of the money put options again.,neutral,0.13,0.57,0.29,mixed,0.28,0.12,0.59,True,English,"['Higher Fertilizer Prices', 'OCI', 'EBITDA', 'Q2', 'low global grain stocks', 'three major rating agencies', 'half a million shares', 'high natural gas prices', 'SG&A expenses', 'favorite turnaround stories', 'average daily volume', 'working capital position', 'favorable farm economics', 'stronger cash flows', 'financial cash flows', 'free cash flow', 'operating cash flow', 'inventory level build', 'positive market outlook', 'higher operating expenses', 'high fertilizer prices', 'OCI Investor Relations', 'depreciation expenses', 'debt level', 'short-term outlook', 'major impact', 'commodity prices', 'ammonia prices', 'less fertilizer', 'Belarussian fertilizer', 'Orest Lyzhechka', 'Getty Images', 'Long-time followers', 'OTC:OCINF', 'debt ratio', 'net debt', 'COVID pandemic', 'first quarter', 'Yahoo Finance', 'primary listing', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'ticker symbol', 'Amsterdam listing', 'liquid venue', 'total amount', 'spring season', 'sharp uptick', 'third parties', 'saving grace', 'other commodity', 'melamine price', 'European plant', 'gross profit', 'pre-tax income', 'net income', 'minority interests', 'original thesis', 'strong conversion', 'additional adjustment', 'lease payment', 'non-controlling interests', 'entire income', 'main argument', 'pre-COVID era', 'new plants', 'one quarter', 'current tailwind', 'geopolitical events', 'Eastern Europe', 'food supply', 'import ban', 'higher EBITDA', 'fertilizer products', 'sizeable investment', 'investment grade', 'last year', 'capex levels', 'maintenance capex', 'lower volumes', 'annualized basis', 'Q2 performance', 'Q1 result', 'minority shareholders', 'Q1 EPS', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'readers', 'company', 'operations', 'situation', 'test', 'revenue', 'options', 'methanol', 'factor', 'production', 'results', 'remainder', '1.85 EUR', 'course', 'earnings', 'differences', 'taxes', 'dividend', '90M', 'dust', 'scenario', 'terms', 'combination', 'way', '7.50', '2.10']",2022-05-25,2022-05-25,seekingalpha.com

5541,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.montelnews.com/news/1323473/nord-pool-mulls-acquisitions-ahead-of-financial-launch,Nord Pool mulls acquisitions ahead of financial launch,8 hours ago,(Montel) Nordic power exchange Nord Pool may acquire rivals ahead of a possible expansion into financial power trading  its new CEO told Montel  while adding he was concerned about growing political efforts to reregulate markets amid soaring energy prices.“We are still considering launching a marketplace for financial power. Many of our customers want to see physical and financial trading together and relate to fewer partners ” Tom Darell told Montel in an interview.“We also have great prerequisites [for financial product launch] since we are owned by [stock exchange] Euronext ” he added.Oslo-based Nord Pool has only offered spot and intraday trading since it sold its financial derivatives business to Nasdaq in 2010.But Paris-based Euronext said it wanted to reintroduce financial trading at the exchange after it bought a 66% majority from regional TSOs in late 2019.Darell  who took the helm of Nord Pool on 1 April  said the company was able to launch financial trading independently but would not rule out acquiring rivals to boost its expansion in the European power market.Nord Pool is currently active in 16 countries  altough the bulk of its activity is in the Nordic and Baltic regions as well as in the UK.“We believe we are facing market consolidation over time  because there are still many small exchanges and also monopolies that will eventually open up. We will be there when things happen ” said Darell.Reregulation is not the answerDarell comes to his position as Nord Pool chief in the face of an energy crisis. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since February has exacerbated the energy price crisis that began last year when Europe was faced with historically low gas storage levels ahead of winter.With euro-zone inflation spiking to record highs for six consecutive months  households and businesses across the region are piling pressure on governments to curb their soaring energy bills. And some politicians want to roll back deregulation in the power sector as a solution.“I see a risk [for reregulation]. It is therefore important to have informed discussion before decisions are made. And it is not easy to be a politician in this situation  since there is a strong pressure from the public [to do something] ” Darell said.A liberalised power market model has worked extremely well for 30 years  according to Darell  adding that today’s problems mainly stemmed from issues related to the green transition and unforeseen events like the war in Ukraine rather than a bad market design.“We still have a very efficient market. That is not the main problem ” said Darell  who prior to Nord Pool was responsible for integrating technology solutions for the energy business at service provider Volue.Still  some market participants criticise Nord Pool’s Nordic day-ahead system price for being increasingly inefficient due to historically wide price variations between the region’s 12 bidding zones.And that has had a knock-on effect on financial trading volumes  which plunged to a 21-year low last year and has dropped further this year.“But we know that customers will still have a hedging need also in the future ” said Darell  adding that financial trading volumes in Nord Pool’s markets across Europe totalled 13 500 TWh.,neutral,0.04,0.9,0.06,mixed,0.1,0.21,0.69,True,English,"['Nord Pool', 'financial launch', 'acquisitions', 'low gas storage levels', 'Nordic day-ahead system price', 'liberalised power market model', 'wide price variations', 'growing political efforts', 'many small exchanges', 'six consecutive months', 'bad market design', 'soaring energy prices', 'soaring energy bills', 'financial product launch', 'European power market', 'energy price crisis', 'financial derivatives business', 'financial trading volumes', 'financial power trading', 'Nordic power exchange', 'Oslo-based Nord Pool', 'Nord Pool chief', 'energy crisis', 'energy business', 'power sector', 'market consolidation', 'efficient market', 'market participants', 'intraday trading', 'new CEO', 'fewer partners', 'great prerequisites', 'stock exchange', 'regional TSOs', 'Baltic regions', 'euro-zone inflation', 'green transition', 'unforeseen events', 'main problem', 'technology solutions', 'service provider', '12 bidding zones', 'hedging need', 'possible expansion', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'strong pressure', 'Tom Darell', 'Montel', 'rivals', 'markets', 'marketplace', 'customers', 'physical', 'interview', 'spot', 'Nasdaq', '66% majority', 'late', 'helm', '1 April', 'company', '16 countries', 'bulk', 'activity', 'UK', 'time', 'monopolies', 'things', 'Reregulation', 'answer', 'position', 'face', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'February', 'winter', 'highs', 'households', 'businesses', 'governments', 'politicians', 'deregulation', 'risk', 'discussion', 'decisions', 'situation', 'public', 'something', '30 years', 'problems', 'issues', 'war', 'Volue', 'effect', '21-year', 'future', '500 TWh']",2022-05-25,2022-05-25,montelnews.com

RA often follows a painful  progressively debilitating course  depriving patients of the ability to continue their daily lives and leading to physical disability. Despite current treatments  RA continues to pose a substantial burden to people living with the disease  comprised of the daily health issues directly related to their RA  such as pain  and the complications of managing comorbid conditions.1 2 3 About the FINCH 4 LTE studyFINCH 4 is an ongoing phase 3 open-label LTE study of filgotinib 200mg and filgotinib 100mg for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of filgotinib in participants who have completed one of the parent studies of filgotinib in RA. Eligible patients completed a prior phase 3 randomised double-blind study of filgotinib lasting 52 weeks (FINCH 1 or 3) or 24 weeks (FINCH 2).

Ukraine is also a major exporter of corn and sunflower oil.Western powers have been discussing the idea of setting up ""safe corridors"" for grain exports from Ukraine's ports  although these would need Russian consent.""We have repeatedly stated on this point that a solution to the food problem requires a comprehensive approach  including the lifting of sanctions that have been imposed on Russian exports and financial transactions "" Rudenko was quoted as saying.""And it also requires the demining by the Ukrainian side of all ports where ships are anchored. Russia is ready to provide the necessary humanitarian passage  which it does every day.""The RIA news agency quoted Rudenko as saying Russia was in touch with the United Nations on the issue.'BLACKMAIL'Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba poured scorn on the suggestion that Moscow wanted to allow Ukraine to ship grain.""You could not find a better example of a blackmail in international relations "" he told the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""If anyone is buying it  I think there is a problem with that person  and we shouldn't waste too much time trying to understand why that person is making that point.""Odesa is Ukraine's main deep-water port and used to handle almost all its grain exports. It has suffered a number of Russian missile attacks  and Kyiv fears that Moscow wants to capture it as it has other Ukrainian ports  potentially through an amphibious assault.Rudenko was also quoted by Interfax as saying that any escort by Western ships of Ukrainian vessels carrying grain would ""seriously exacerbate the situation in the Black Sea"".Britain said on Tuesday it had no plans to send its warships to help get food exports out of Odesa.Euronext wheat fell to a two-week low in Paris on Wednesday after Russia said it would allow Ukrainian food exports to resume by sea under certain conditions. [WHT/]Russia's defence ministry said the port of Mariupol  the Ukrainian city on the shallow-water Azov Sea which was taken by Russia after a long siege  was operating normally after Russian forces finished removing mines from there.(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Kevin Liffey; Editing by David Clarke  Catherine Evans and Gareth Jones)",neutral,0.04,0.71,0.24,negative,0.01,0.08,0.91,True,English,"['Ukrainian food ships', 'Russia', 'corridor', 'conditions', 'Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko', 'Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba', 'growing global food crisis', 'global wheat supplies', 'RIA news agency', 'World Economic Forum', 'Russian missile attacks', 'necessary humanitarian passage', 'shallow-water Azov Sea', 'Interfax news agency', 'main deep-water port', 'other Ukrainian ports', 'Ukrainian food exports', 'significant grain exports', 'Black Sea ports', 'Russian exports', 'Russian consent', 'Russian forces', 'Ukrainian side', 'Ukrainian city', 'humanitarian corridor', 'Euronext wheat', 'Ukrainian vessels', '20 million tonnes', 'major exporter', 'sunflower oil', 'Western powers', 'safe corridors', 'comprehensive approach', 'financial transactions', 'United Nations', 'international relations', 'amphibious assault', 'defence ministry', 'long siege', 'Kevin Liffey', 'David Clarke', 'Catherine Evans', 'Gareth Jones', 'food problem', 'Western ships', 'Reuters', 'Ukraine', 'return', 'lifting', 'sanctions', 'Wednesday', 'thousands', 'troops', 'Feb.', 'silos', 'country', 'third', 'corn', 'idea', 'point', 'solution', 'demining', 'touch', 'issue', 'BLACKMAIL', 'suggestion', 'Moscow', 'example', 'Davos', 'person', 'time', 'Odesa', 'number', 'Kyiv', 'escort', 'situation', 'Britain', 'Tuesday', 'plans', 'warships', 'two', 'Paris', 'conditions', 'WHT', 'Mariupol', 'mines', 'Writing', 'Editing']",2022-05-26,2022-05-25,thestar.com.my
