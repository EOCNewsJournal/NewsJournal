The registration of shareholders starts at 10.30 CEST.Right to attendance and votingTo be entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the number of votes they may cast)  shareholders must be entered on the Company‚Äôs register of members maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB by Thursday 9 June 2022.Shareholders whose shares are registered in the name of a nominee should note that they may be required by their respective nominee/s to temporarily re-register their shares in their own name in the register of members maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB in order to be entitled to attend and vote (in person or by proxy) at the Meeting. Any such re-registration would need to be effected by Thursday 9 June 2022. Shareholders should therefore liaise with and instruct their nominees well in advance thereof.To be entitled to attend and vote in person at the Meeting  shareholders must notify Euroclear Sweden AB of their intention to attend the Meeting by Thursday 9 June 2022 and can do so by (i) e-mail to [email protected] com or (ii) mail to: Kambi Group plc  c/o Euroclear Sweden AB  Box 191  SE-101 23 Stockholm  Sweden or (iii) by phone on +46 8 402 9092 during the office hours of Euroclear Sweden AB. Notification should include the shareholder‚Äôs name  address  email address  daytime telephone number  personal or corporate identification number  number of shares held in the Company  as well as details of any proxies (if applicable  in the case that the shareholder has appointed a third party representative to attend the Meeting in their stead). Information submitted in connection with the notification will be computerised and used exclusively for the Meeting. See below for additional information on the processing of personal data.Shareholders‚Äô right to appoint a proxyA shareholder who is entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting  is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and vote on his or her behalf. A proxy need not also be a shareholder. If the shareholder is an individual  the proxy form must be signed by the appointer (or his authorised attorney) or comply with Article 126 of the Articles. If the shareholder is a corporation  the proxy form must be signed on its behalf by an authorised attorney or a duly authorised officer of the corporation or comply with Article 126 of the Articles.Proxy forms must clearly indicate whether the proxy is to vote in their discretion or in accordance with the voting instructions sheet attached to the proxy form. Your proxy shall vote as you have directed in respect of the resolutions set out in this notice or on any other resolution that is properly put to the meeting. If the proxy form is returned to the Company without any indication as to how the proxy shall vote  generally or in respect of a particular resolution  the proxy shall exercise their discretion as to how to vote or whether to abstain from voting  generally or in respect of that particular resolution (as applicable).Where the shareholder is a corporation  a document evidencing the signatory right of the officer signing the proxy form  must be submitted with the proxy form. Where the proxy form is signed on behalf of the shareholder by an attorney (rather than by an authorised representative  in the case of a corporation)  the original power of attorney or a copy thereof certified or notarised in a manner acceptable to the Board of Directors must be submitted to the Company  failing which the appointment of the proxy may be treated as invalid.The original signed proxy form and  if applicable  other supporting documents (required pursuant to the above instructions)  must be received by Euroclear Sweden AB no later than Thursday 9 June 2022 by (i) e-mail to [email protected] .com or (ii) mail to: Kambi Group plc  c/o Euroclear Sweden AB  Box 191  SE-101 23 Stockholm  Sweden.

THAT the Directors be and are hereby duly authorised and empowered in accordance with Articles 85(1) and 88(7) of the Companies Act and Article 3 of the Articles  on one or several occasions prior to the date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company  to issue and allot up to a maximum of 3 106 480 Ordinary ‚ÄòB‚Äô shares in the Company of a nominal value of ‚Ç¨0.003 each (corresponding to a dilution of 10% of total shares as at the date of the notice to the 2022 Annual General Meeting) for payment in kind or through a direct set-off in connection with an acquisition  and to authorise and empower the Directors to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption associated to the issue of the said shares. This resolution is being taken in terms and for the purposes of the approvals necessary in terms of the Companies Act and the Articles of Association of the Company. (Resolution a)8. WHEREAS (i) at a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company held on 30 March 2022  the Directors resolved to obtain authority to buy back Ordinary ‚ÄòB‚Äô shares in the Company having a nominal value of ‚Ç¨0.003 each; and(ii) pursuant to Article 5 of the Articles and Article 106(1) (b) of the Companies Act a company may acquire any of its own shares otherwise than by subscription  provided inter alia authorisation is given by an extraordinary resolution  which resolution will need to determine the terms and conditions of such acquisitions and in particular the maximum number of shares to be acquired  the duration of the period for which the authorisation is given and the maximum and minimum consideration.NOW THEREFORE the members of the Company resolve that the Company be generally authorised to make purchases of Ordinary ‚ÄòB‚Äô shares in the Company of a nominal value of ‚Ç¨0.003 each in its capital  subject to the following:(a) the maximum number of shares that may be so acquired is 3 106 480 which is equivalent to 10% of total shares as at the date of the notice to the 2022 Annual General Meeting;(b) the minimum price that may be paid for the shares is SEK1 per share;(c) the maximum price that may be paid for the shares is SEK1 000 per share;(d) the maximum aggregate number of shares that can either be i) issued and allotted under Resolution a and  ii) bought back under this Resolution b  shall not exceed 3 106 480; and(e) the authority conferred by this resolution shall expire on the date of the 2023 Annual General Meeting  but in any case shall not exceed the period of 18 months  but not so as to prejudice the completion of a purchase contracted before that date. (Resolution b)9. Closing of the Extraordinary General MeetingInformation about proposals related to Agenda itemsBoth extraordinary Resolutions  Resolutions a and b  were presented in their entirety to the Annual General Meeting held on 17 May  2022 (which resolutions were referred to therein as resolutions m and n respectively)  and obtained one majority of two required in terms of article 135 of the Companies Act (Cap 386)  and in terms of Articles 48B.2(b) of the Articles of Association of the Company. To this end  this Extraordinary General Meeting is being convened within 30 days of the Annual General Meeting  in accordance with the aforementioned provisions of the Companies Act and the Articles  in order to take a fresh vote on the proposed extraordinary resolutions.Agenda item 7 (Resolution a)The objectives of the authorisation are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a directed set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares on each issue date will be used in determining the price at which shares will be issued. For the purposes of Article 88(7) of the Companies Act  through this resolution the members of the Company are also authorising the Board of Directors to restrict or withdraw the members‚Äô right of pre-emption that would normally entitle members to be offered the newly issued shares in the Company in proportion to their shareholding before such new shares are offered to third parties.Agenda item 8 (Resolution b)The Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition by the Company of its own shares shall take place on First North Growth Market at Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares to all members of the Company. Such acquisitions of own shares may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on market terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to First North Growth Market at Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company‚Äôs annual report and accounts. Any resolution to repurchase own shares will be publicly disclosed. The objective of the buyback and transfer right is to ensure added value for the Company‚Äôs shareholders and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company‚Äôs capital structure.Following such buybacks  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or transfer to employees under a company share incentive plan. Once repurchased  further shareholder and Bondholder approval would be required before those shares could be cancelled.If used as consideration for an acquisition the intention would be that they would be issued as shares and not sold first.,neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,mixed,0.27,0.23,0.5,True,English,"['Kambi Group Plc Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Notice', 'General Meetings section', 'other supporting documents', 'Kambi Group plc', 'third party representative', 'Euroclear Sweden AB', 'daytime telephone number', 'corporate identification number', 'Aggregated attendance notifications', 'minutes Special Business', 'voting instructions sheet', 'EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING', 'other resolution', 'authorised representative', 'Thursday 30 June', 'H√§lsingegatan', 'Thursday 9 June', 'office hours', 'particular resolution', 'two persons', 'Extraordinary Resolutions', 'voting list', 'signatory right', 'proxy form', 'proxy data', 'Reading Time', 'respective nominee', 'additional information', 'personal data', 'authorised attorney', 'authorised officer', 'original power', 'following Agenda', 'company number', 'Company website', 'email address', 'Shareholders‚Äô right', '6 minutes', 'terms', 'Articles', 'Association', 'NOTICE', '11.00 CEST', 'Stockholm', 'registration', '10.30 CEST', 'purpose', 'determination', 'votes', 'register', 'members', 'shares', 'name', 'order', 'nominees', 'advance', 'intention', 'Box', 'details', 'proxies', 'case', 'stead', 'connection', 'processing', 'behalf', 'individual', 'appointer', 'corporation', 'discretion', 'accordance', 'indication', 'copy', 'manner', 'Board', 'Directors', 'appointment', 'default', 'Opening', 'Election', 'Chairman', 'approval', '113', '+46']",2022-05-24,2022-05-26,europeangaming.eu

The proposed remuneration for ordinary work of the Board of Directors (excluding work in committees and travel allowance) for the period until the end of the Annual General Meeting 2023 corresponds to a total value of SEK 4 200 000.The Nomination Committee considers that it is desirable for the Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting to be shareholders in Oncopeptides in order to strengthen common interests in the company.

Should the majority requirement for item 14 not be met  the Nomination Committee proposes that the remuneration amounts stated above be paid in full in cash  whereby the Board members are requested to invest 50 per cent of the remuneration amount in shares in the company by buying shares on the market.In addition to the above proposed remuneration for ordinary board work  each of the Board members residing in the United States shall receive an additional amount of SEK 100 000 and each of the Board members residing in Europe  but outside the Nordics  shall receive an additional amount of SEK 50 000.The proposed remuneration for work within the committees of the Board of Directors for the period until the end of the Annual General Meeting 2023 amounts to a total of SEK 357 500 and shall be allocated in accordance with the following:SEK 82 500 to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members;to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and to each of the other two members; SEK 55 000 to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members; andto the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and to each of the other two members; and SEK 55 000 to the Chairman of the Scientific Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members.The Nomination Committee proposes  in accordance with the Audit Committee's recommendation  that the auditor is paid according to approved invoices.Election of members of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors (item 10)The Nomination Committee proposes the re-election of Per Wold-Olsen  Brian Stuglik  Cecilia Daun Wennborg  Jarl Ulf Jungnelius  Per Samuelsson and Jennifer Jackson  with Per Wold-Olsen as Chairman of the Board of Directors.Detailed presentations of the persons proposed by the Nomination Committee for re-election are included as an appendix to the Nomination Committee's statement  available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com.Election of auditor (item 11)The Nomination Committee proposes  in accordance with the Audit Committee's recommendation  the re-election of the charted auditing firm Ernst & Young AB (EY)  with the request that Anna Svanberg is appointed as auditor in charge.Resolution on the introduction of a long-term shareholder program for members of the Board of Directors (item 14)The Nomination Committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term shareholder program for members of the Board of Directors of Oncopeptides (""Board SHP 2022"") in accordance with items 14 (a) ‚Äì (b) below. The resolutions under items 14 (a) ‚Äì (b) below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 14 (b) below not be met  the Nomination Committee proposes that Oncopeptides shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 14 (c) below and resolutions under items 14 (a) and 14 (c) shall then be conditional upon each other.Board SHP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted share awards (""Share Awards"") that entitle to ordinary shares in Oncopeptides to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 245 000 ordinary shares. As part of the implementation of Board SHP 2022 it is proposed that the Board of Directors  in order to cover the delivery of shares to the participants  be authorized to resolve on issue and purchase of class C shares and resolution on transfer of ordinary shares in accordance with item 14 (b) below.Proposal for resolution on adoption of a long-term shareholder program for members of the Board of Directors (item 14 (a))The rationale for the proposalThe Nomination Committee considers that it is desirable for Board members to be shareholders in the Company in order to strengthen common interests. Furthermore  an equity based program is a central part of a competitive remuneration in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the Board of Directors. In the opinion of the Nomination Committee the Board SHP 2022 as well as the previous years' Board LTIP will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Oncopeptides' operations  improve Company loyalty and that Board SHP 2022 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Oncopeptides. By having annual board equity programs  an individual board member can over time build a more meaningful equity position that will further incentivize long-term behavior and also honor members that have served and intend to serve the Company for many years. The Nomination Committee requests the Board members to keep their received shares at least as long as the Board member is part of the Board of Directors  with the exception of financing tax as a consequence of this shareholder program.Per Samuelsson  who is associated with the main owner  HealthCap VI L.P  has chosen to refrain from participating in the shareholder program.Conditions for Share AwardsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards:The Share Awards shall be granted to the participants based on a share of the participants' board remuneration in accordance with what follows from item 9 and also the below  as soon as practicable after the Annual General Meeting (the "" Grant Date "")."").The Share Awards shall vest after approximately one year (corresponding to one year of service as a Board member)  corresponding to the earlier of the day before (i ) the Annual General Meeting 2023 or (ii) 1 July 2023 (the "" Vesting Date "")  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Oncopeptides on said date.OncopeptidesEach vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Oncopeptides without any compensation being payable as soon as practicable three years after the Grant Date.The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Oncopeptides ' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Share Awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Oncopeptides group.In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Oncopeptides   the Share Awards will  in certain cases  vest in their entirety upon such transaction.The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board SHP 2022.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount  corresponding to 50 per cent of the remuneration for ordinary board work  for the respective participant divided by the volume weighted average price of the Oncopeptides share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date. The Share Awards granted to each participant are consequently to be seen as an investment of part of the fixed remuneration for ordinary board work in accordance with what follows from the Nomination Committee's proposal in item 9.The Share Awards under Board SHP 2022 shall be awarded in accordance with the following:Share Awards calculated based on SEK 750 000 to the Chairman; andto the Chairman; and Share Awards calculated based on SEK 300 000 to each of Brian Stuglik   Cecilia Daun Wennborg   Jennifer Jackson and Ulf Jungnelius .In any event  Board SHP 2022 will comprise a total of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  entitle to not more than 245 000 shares in Oncopeptides.Preparation of the proposalBoard SHP 2022 has been initiated by the Nomination Committee and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) listed companies.DilutionAssuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10  Board SHP 2022 will comprise not more than 195 000 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.23 per cent on a fully diluted basis. The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Oncopeptides' existing incentive programs can be found in Oncopeptides' annual report for 2021  note 27  which is available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com  and on the Company's website under ""Remuneration"".Scope and costs of the programBoard SHP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 ‚Äì Share-based payments"".

In the event the price of Oncopeptides ' share has thereby increased by more than 60 per cent  100 per cent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 per cent  33 per cent of such Share Awards shall vest.

Everyone who is employed or a consultant can be granted Share Awards.The principle for allocation is that each participant is granted a yearly allocation as a percentage of the base salary. In preparation of the proposal  market practice for peer companies has been reviewed and based on such review  the proposal in Co-worker LTIP 2022 is that the allocation is limited to not more than 500 per cent for the CEO  not more than 200 per cent to members of global senior management and not more than 100 per cent for other employees and consultants  of the yearly base salary. In addition  market practice for peer companies has shown that the percentage for allocation to newly employed and consultants normally amount to 1.5 to 2.5 times the corresponding allocation to employees and consultants already employed  whereby the proposal in Co-worker LTIP 2022 is that the allocation is limited to 1.5 times the yearly allocation for newly employed and new consultants.The number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal to the yearly allocation described above divided by the volume weighted average price of the Oncopeptides share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the Share AwardsThe Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of Co-worker LTIP 2022  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines.

Co-worker LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.DilutionAssuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10  Co-worker LTIP 2022 will comprise not more than 3 860 849 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 4.6 per cent on a fully diluted basis.Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to the Company's previously implemented employee option programs Employee Option Program 2016/2023  Co-worker LTIP 2017  Co-worker LTIP 2018  Co-worker LTIP 2019 and Co-worker LTIP 2021 as well as the Company's previously implemented incentive programs Board LTIP 2019  Board LTIP 2020  Board LTIP 2021 and now proposed Board SHP 2022 for certain members of the Board of Directors  including potential realization of financial hedge related to social security costs (""Previously Implemented Programs"")  the total dilution amounts to approximately 10 per cent on a fully diluted basis. The Board's fundamental position regarding allotment according to Co-worker LTIP 2022 is that the number of allotted Share Awards including at any given time outstanding Previously Implemented Programs shall not exceed a dilution corresponding to 10 per cent  calculated on a fully diluted basis  in connection with each resolved allotment under Co-worker LTIP 2022. As stated above  Co-worker LTIP 2022 is also intended to be a multi-year program that is intended to cover the company's needs for up to 36 months.The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information on Oncopeptides' existing incentive programs can be found in Oncopeptides' annual report for 2021  note 27  which is available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com  and on the Company's website under ""Remuneration"".Scope and costs of the programCo-worker LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 ‚Äì Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10  an annual increase in the share price of 20 per cent and that the Share Awards at the Grant Date are valued in accordance with a Monte Carlo simulation  the average annual personnel cost for Co-worker LTIP 2022 according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 10.3 million before tax. The average annual social security costs are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 3.2 million  based on the above assumptions and social security costs of 31.42 per cent. The average total annual cost for Co-worker LTIP 2022 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security costs  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 13.5 million.The total cost of the Co-worker LTIP 2022  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 40.6 million under the above assumptions.The costs associated with Co-worker LTIP 2022 are expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Expenses relating to R&D/operating expenses"".Delivery of shares under Co-worker LTIP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Co-worker LTIP 2022  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of class C shares  repurchase of issued class C shares and on transfer of own ordinary shares in accordance with item (b) below. Should the majority requirement for resolutions pursuant to item 13 or item 15 (b) not be met  the program may be hedged by a resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal in accordance with item 15 (c) below.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on a directed share issue of class C shares  repurchase of issued class C shares  transfer of own ordinary shares to participants in Co-worker LTIP 2022 and in the market (item 15 (b))The resolutions under items 15 (b)(i) - (iii) are proposed to be conditional upon i) that the Annual General Meeting resolves in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal in accordance with item 13 regarding the adoption of a new Articles of Association  and ii) upon each other. It is therefore proposed that the resolutions under items 15 (b)(i) - (iii) are adopted jointly.Authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of new class C shares (item 15 (b)(i))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  at one or several occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 428 983 by the issue of not more than 3 860 849 class C shares  each with a quota value of approximately SEK 0.11. With disapplication of the shareholders' preferential rights  a participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the disapplication of the shareholders' preferential rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares under Co-worker LTIP 2022 as well as to cover any social costs due to Co-worker LTIP 2022.Authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase own class C shares (item 15 (b)(ii))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  at one or several occasions  to repurchase class C shares. The repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. The purchase may be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to ensure the delivery of shares and to cover any social costs due to Co-worker LTIP 2022.Resolution on the transfer of own ordinary shares (item 15 (b)(iii))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that class C shares that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase class C shares in accordance with item 15 (b)(ii) above  following reclassification into ordinary shares  may be transferred free of charge to participants in Co-worker LTIP 2022 in accordance with resolved conditions and transferred to cover any social costs due to Co-worker LTIP 2022.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a maximum of 3 860 849 ordinary shares may be transferred to participants in accordance with the terms of Co-worker LTIP 2022  and that it may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the price range registered at the time  to cover any social security contributions in accordance with the terms of Co-worker LTIP 2022. The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation as a result of an in-between bonus issue  share split  share split  rights issue and/or similar events.Proposal regarding equity swap agreement with a third party (item 15(c))Should the majority requirement for the resolutions under item 15 (b) above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2022 resolves that Co-worker LTIP 2022 shall instead be hedged so that Oncopeptides can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Oncopeptides to the participants.Resolution regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve upon issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles (item 16)Main proposal (item 16 (a))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2022 resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to  until the next Annual General Meeting  on one or more occasions  decide upon issuances of new shares  warrants and/or convertibles. New issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles may occur with or without preferential rights for shareholders of the Company and may be made either in cash and/or by way of set-off or contribution in kind or otherwise on specific terms. The number of shares issued  or number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  may not correspond to a dilution of more than 20 per cent of the total number of shares outstanding at the Annual General Meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  after full exercise of the hereby proposed authorization. The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and the acting scope of the Board of Directors. Should the Board of Directors resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this must be to finance an acquisition of operations or  alternatively  to procure capital to finance project development. Upon such deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the new issue shall be made at market terms and conditions. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments that may be required to register the authorization.Alternative proposal (item 16 (b))If the proposal in item 16 (a) above does not get the required supportive votes from the Annual General Meeting 2022 to be passed  the Board of Directors proposes that it is given an authorization to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertibles corresponding to a dilution of not more than 10 per cent  on the same terms and conditions as stated above in item 16 (a).Resolution on principles for guidelines for remuneration to senior management (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes updated principles for guidelines for remuneration to senior management in accordance with the following.The Board's proposals for new guidelines for remuneration to senior managementThe CEO and the other members of senior management fall within the provisions of these guidelines. The guidelines are forward-looking  i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the AGM 2022. The guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityOncopeptides is a biotech company focused on the development of targeted therapies for difficult-to-treat hematological diseases. Oncopeptides mainly conducts operations from the head office in Stockholm  Sweden. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To this end  it is necessary that the company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the company to offer the members of senior management a competitive total remuneration. Long-term share-based incentive programs have been implemented in the company. Such programs have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. The programs encompass management  Board members  founders and other personnel. For more information about these programs  including the criteria determining outcomes  refer to the Corporate governance report on pages 30-32. Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.Forms of remuneration etc.The remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the general meeting may ‚Äì irrespective of these guidelines ‚Äì resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration.The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one year. The variable cash remuneration consists of a target-based variable remuneration corresponding to 25-50 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary with capped at a maximum of 1.5 times the target-based remuneration for the CEO other senior management.For the CEO and other members of senior management  pension benefits  including health insurance  should be defined-contribution. Variable cash remuneration is not pensionable. The pension premium for defined contribution pensions shall amount to not more than 24 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. Other benefits may include  for example  life insurance and medical insurance (Sw: Sjukv√•rdsf√∂rs√§kring). Such benefits may amount to not more than two percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Termination of employmentThe notice period may not exceed nine months if notice of termination of employment is given by the company. Fixed cash salary during the period of notice and severance pay may together not exceed an amount equivalent to the CEO's fixed cash salary during the notice period  and six months for other senior management. The notice period may not exceed six months without any right to severance pay when termination is made by the executive. Additionally  remuneration may be paid for non-compete undertakings. Such remuneration shall compensate for loss of income and shall only be paid in so far as the previously employed executive is not entitled to severance pay. The remuneration shall be based on the fixed cash salary at the time of termination of employment  unless otherwise provided by mandatory collective agreement provisions  and be paid during the time the non-compete undertaking applies  however not for more than 12 months following termination of employment.Criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration  etc.The variable cash remuneration shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria which can be financial or non-financial. They may be individualized  quantitative or qualitative objectives. The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by for example being clearly linked to the business strategy or promote the executive's long-term development.To which extent the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be determined when the measurement period has ended. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable remuneration to the CEO. For variable cash remuneration to other executives  the CEO is responsible for the evaluation. For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the company.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Director's decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Remuneration Committee has  with the help of external consultant Deloitte and PWC  carried out a comparative analysis of levels of remuneration and components thereof for individuals who are a part of executive management.The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the AGM. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company.The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of the company and its executive management. The CEO and the other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters.Description of material changes to the guidelines and how the shareholders' have been taken into considerationVariable remuneration to the CEO  which previously amounted to 50 per cent of the fixed cash remuneration with a maximum level of 200 per cent  has been adjusted to a maximum of 1.5 times target-based remuneration. The notice period from the company is adjusted from 24 months to 9 months for the CEO. Severance pay amounts to a maximum of the corresponding fixed cash salary during the notice period. Pension provision in 401K has been exchanged with a defined contribution pension provision amounting to a maximum of 24 per cent of fixed annual cash compensation.Required majorityA valid resolution in respect of authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on a directed share issue of class C shares and on repurchase of issued class C shares as well as resolution on transfer of own ordinary shares to participants in Co-worker LTIP 2022  Board SHP 2022 and Board LTIP 2021 requires that the proposals are supported by shareholders holding at least nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.A valid resolution in respect ofnew articles of association (item 13); andthe authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve upon issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles (item 16 (a) or alternatively  item 16 (b)requires support by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.DocumentsThe annual report  the auditor's report  full proposed resolutions according to items 13-16  the Board of Directors' reports  remuneration report and the auditor's statements under the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551)  the Nomination Committee's statement regarding its proposals and information regarding proposed members of the Board of Directors will be made available at the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com  no later than Wednesday 7 June 2022 and at the premises of the Company  address Luntmakargatan 46  111 37 Stockholm  Sweden  and will be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and state their postal address or email address.Information at the Annual General MeetingThe Board of Directors and the CEO shall  if requested by a shareholder  and if the Board of Directors' believes that it can be done without material harm to the Company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda and circumstances that may affect the assessment of the Company's or subsidiary's financial situation and the Company's relation to other group companies.

5478,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.ifre.com/story/3380348/us-treasury-decision-pushes-russia-to-brink-of-default-qm3vtdljf1,US Treasury decision pushes Russia to brink of default,1 day ago,"The US Treasury has announced that it will not extend a special licence that has allowed US citizens to receive bond payments from Russia  setting the stage for the first default by the sovereign on its foreign currency debt in more than 100 years. The licence expires at the end of today.It was issued in early March by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control  following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Since then  Russia has made a series of payments on its foreign currency bonds to investors. But the sovereign is now on the brink of a default  following Washington's decision to let the licence lapse.""The game of chicken ended with OFAC putting the Russian chicken out of its misery "" said Tim Ash  senior EM sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. ""Only a matter of time now before Russia formally defaults.""Last Friday  Russia's finance ministry accelerated coupon payments on two bonds ‚Äì its US$3bn 4.75% 2026s and ‚Ç¨1bn 2.65% 2036s ‚Äì that are not due until May 27. By making the payments to its National Settlement Depository  Russia said it had fulfilled its current obligations on the notesIt is not clear if the funds have been already channelled through to bondholders. One investor in Russian debt told IFR earlier in the week his fund had yet to receive the payments  though that was not a surprise as experience had shown there was often a time lag.One analyst said that  even following OFAC's decision  there is chance that bondholders could receive these latest payments. ""In theory  there is a chance that the payment may be processed even if the licence is not extended  since the finance ministry is technically not involved in the further stages of money flow "" he said. ""On the 27th  the NSD will debit Euroclear‚Äôs account with the NSD and then Euroclear will either process the payment or not.""Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Even if the monies on the 2026s and 2036s do eventually hit investors' accounts ‚Äì they both have 30-day grace periods ‚Äì Russia has further coupon payments due in June  which US investors will not be able to receive.The market is pricing in a default as more likely than not  and sooner rather than later  with the sovereign's foreign currency bonds trading at highly distressed levels.Ash said a default will be a big blow to Russia's pride. ""This will be humiliating for [President] Putin  who made a big thing with [then Chancellor] Schroeder at the time Russia was last on the brink of a Paris Club default that great powers like Russia pay their debts. Russia can no longer pay its debts because of its invasion of Ukraine. Reach your own conclusions on Russian superpower status "" he said.""Russia will lose almost all market access ‚Äì even to the Chinese ‚Äì because of this default. It will mean no financing for Russia Inc. except at exorbitant rates of interest. It means no capital  no investment and no growth.""A number of Russia's corporates have already been unable to process payments to their creditors on their foreign currency bonds because of the war.

Should the majority requirement for item 14 not be met  the Nomination Committee proposes that the remuneration amounts stated above be paid in full in cash  whereby the Board members are requested to invest 50 per cent of the remuneration amount in shares in the company by buying shares on the market.In addition to the above proposed remuneration for ordinary board work  each of the Board members residing in the United States shall receive an additional amount of SEK 100 000 and each of the Board members residing in Europe  but outside the Nordics  shall receive an additional amount of SEK 50 000.The proposed remuneration for work within the committees of the Board of Directors for the period until the end of the Annual General Meeting 2023 amounts to a total of SEK 357 500 and shall be allocated in accordance with the following:SEK 82 500 to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members;SEK 55 000 to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members; andSEK 55 000 to the Chairman of the Scientific Committee and SEK 27 500 to each of the other two members.The Nomination Committee proposes  in accordance with the Audit Committee's recommendation  that the auditor is paid according to approved invoices.Election of members of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors (item 10)The Nomination Committee proposes the re-election of Per Wold-Olsen  Brian Stuglik  Cecilia Daun Wennborg  Jarl Ulf Jungnelius  Per Samuelsson and Jennifer Jackson  with Per Wold-Olsen as Chairman of the Board of Directors.Detailed presentations of the persons proposed by the Nomination Committee for re-election are included as an appendix to the Nomination Committee's statement  available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com.Election of auditor (item 11)The Nomination Committee proposes  in accordance with the Audit Committee's recommendation  the re-election of the charted auditing firm Ernst & Young AB (EY)  with the request that Anna Svanberg is appointed as auditor in charge.Resolution on the introduction of a long-term shareholder program for members of the Board of Directors (item 14)The Nomination Committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term shareholder program for members of the Board of Directors of Oncopeptides (""Board SHP 2022"") in accordance with items 14 (a) ‚Äì (b) below. The resolutions under items 14 (a) ‚Äì (b) below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 14 (b) below not be met  the Nomination Committee proposes that Oncopeptides shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 14 (c) below and resolutions under items 14 (a) and 14 (c) shall then be conditional upon each other.Board SHP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted share awards (""Share Awards"") that entitle to ordinary shares in Oncopeptides to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 245 000 ordinary shares.

Furthermore  an equity based program is a central part of a competitive remuneration in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the Board of Directors. In the opinion of the Nomination Committee the Board SHP 2022 as well as the previous years' Board LTIP will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Oncopeptides' operations  improve Company loyalty and that Board SHP 2022 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Oncopeptides. By having annual board equity programs  an individual board member can over time build a more meaningful equity position that will further incentivize long-term behavior and also honor members that have served and intend to serve the Company for many years. The Nomination Committee requests the Board members to keep their received shares at least as long as the Board member is part of the Board of Directors  with the exception of financing tax as a consequence of this shareholder program.Per Samuelsson  who is associated with the main owner  HealthCap VI L.P  has chosen to refrain from participating in the shareholder program.Conditions for Share AwardsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards:The Share Awards shall be granted to the participants based on a share of the participants' board remuneration in accordance with what follows from item 9 and also the below  as soon as practicable after the Annual General Meeting (the "" Grant Date "").

Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Oncopeptides without any compensation being payable as soon as practicable three years after the Grant Date. The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Oncopeptides ' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures. The Share Awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged. The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Oncopeptides group. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Oncopeptides   the Share Awards will  in certain cases  vest in their entirety upon such transaction. The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board SHP 2022.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount  corresponding to 50 per cent of the remuneration for ordinary board work  for the respective participant divided by the volume weighted average price of the Oncopeptides share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.

The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Oncopeptides' existing incentive programs can be found in Oncopeptides' annual report for 2021  note 27  which is available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com  and on the Company's website under ""Remuneration"".Scope and costs of the programBoard SHP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 ‚Äì Share-based payments"".

In addition  market practice for peer companies has shown that the percentage for allocation to newly employed and consultants normally amount to 1.5 to 2.5 times the corresponding allocation to employees and consultants already employed  whereby the proposal in Co-worker LTIP 2022 is that the allocation is limited to 1.5 times the yearly allocation for newly employed and new consultants.The number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal to the yearly allocation described above divided by the volume weighted average price of the Oncopeptides share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the Share AwardsThe Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of Co-worker LTIP 2022  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines.

As stated above  Co-worker LTIP 2022 is also intended to be a multi-year program that is intended to cover the company's needs for up to 36 months.The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information on Oncopeptides' existing incentive programs can be found in Oncopeptides' annual report for 2021  note 27  which is available on the Company's website  www.oncopeptides.com  and on the Company's website under ""Remuneration"".Scope and costs of the programCo-worker LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 ‚Äì Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Share Awards of SEK 10  an annual increase in the share price of 20 per cent and that the Share Awards at the Grant Date are valued in accordance with a Monte Carlo simulation  the average annual personnel cost for Co-worker LTIP 2022 according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 10.3 million before tax. The average annual social security costs are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 3.2 million  based on the above assumptions and social security costs of 31.42 per cent. The average total annual cost for Co-worker LTIP 2022 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security costs  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 13.5 million.The total cost of the Co-worker LTIP 2022  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 40.6 million under the above assumptions.The costs associated with Co-worker LTIP 2022 are expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Expenses relating to R&D/operating expenses"".Delivery of shares under Co-worker LTIP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Co-worker LTIP 2022  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of class C shares  repurchase of issued class C shares and on transfer of own ordinary shares in accordance with item (b) below.

With disapplication of the shareholders' preferential rights  a participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares.

The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to ensure the delivery of shares and to cover any social costs due to Co-worker LTIP 2022.Resolution on the transfer of own ordinary shares (item 15 (b)(iii))The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that class C shares that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase class C shares in accordance with item 15 (b)(ii) above  following reclassification into ordinary shares  may be transferred free of charge to participants in Co-worker LTIP 2022 in accordance with resolved conditions and transferred to cover any social costs due to Co-worker LTIP 2022.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a maximum of 3 860 849 ordinary shares may be transferred to participants in accordance with the terms of Co-worker LTIP 2022  and that it may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the price range registered at the time  to cover any social security contributions in accordance with the terms of Co-worker LTIP 2022.

New issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles may occur with or without preferential rights for shareholders of the Company and may be made either in cash and/or by way of set-off or contribution in kind or otherwise on specific terms. The number of shares issued  or number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  may not correspond to a dilution of more than 20 per cent of the total number of shares outstanding at the Annual General Meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  after full exercise of the hereby proposed authorization. The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and the acting scope of the Board of Directors. Should the Board of Directors resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this must be to finance an acquisition of operations or  alternatively  to procure capital to finance project development. Upon such deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the new issue shall be made at market terms and conditions. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments that may be required to register the authorization.Alternative proposal (item 16 (b))If the proposal in item 16 (a) above does not get the required supportive votes from the Annual General Meeting 2022 to be passed  the Board of Directors proposes that it is given an authorization to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertibles corresponding to a dilution of not more than 10 per cent  on the same terms and conditions as stated above in item 16 (a).Resolution on principles for guidelines for remuneration to senior management (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes updated principles for guidelines for remuneration to senior management in accordance with the following.The Board's proposals for new guidelines for remuneration to senior management The CEO and the other members of senior management fall within the provisions of these guidelines.

To this end  it is necessary that the company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the company to offer the members of senior management a competitive total remuneration. Long-term share-based incentive programs have been implemented in the company. Such programs have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. The programs encompass management  Board members  founders and other personnel.

Such benefits may amount to not more than two percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Termination of employment The notice period may not exceed nine months if notice of termination of employment is given by the company. Fixed cash salary during the period of notice and severance pay may together not exceed an amount equivalent to the CEO's fixed cash salary during the notice period  and six months for other senior management. The notice period may not exceed six months without any right to severance pay when termination is made by the executive. Additionally  remuneration may be paid for non-compete undertakings. Such remuneration shall compensate for loss of income and shall only be paid in so far as the previously employed executive is not entitled to severance pay. The remuneration shall be based on the fixed cash salary at the time of termination of employment  unless otherwise provided by mandatory collective agreement provisions  and be paid during the time the non-compete undertaking applies  however not for more than 12 months following termination of employment.Criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration  etc. The variable cash remuneration shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria which can be financial or non-financial. They may be individualized  quantitative or qualitative objectives. The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by for example being clearly linked to the business strategy or promote the executive's long-term development.To which extent the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be determined when the measurement period has ended. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable remuneration to the CEO. For variable cash remuneration to other executives  the CEO is responsible for the evaluation. For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the company.Salary and employment conditions for employees In the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelines The Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee.

The Remuneration Committee has  with the help of external consultant Deloitte and PWC  carried out a comparative analysis of levels of remuneration and components thereof for individuals who are a part of executive management.The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the AGM. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company.The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of the company and its executive management. The CEO and the other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Derogation from the guidelines The Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability.

The final analysis included six-month follow-up data and confirmed the topline results reported in December 2021.The VLA1553-302 trial met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that three consecutively manufactured vaccine lots elicited equivalent immune responses measured by neutralizing antibody titer GMT ratios on Day 29 after vaccination.The trial included 408 participants aged 18 to 45 years. The safety profile shown in study VLA1553-302 was similar to the Phase 3 trial  VLA1553-3011. With a 96.0% seroprotection rate at Day 180  the immunogenicity profile from study VLA1553-301 was also confirmed.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva commented  ‚ÄúWe are extremely pleased that the final lot-to lot data confirmed the previously reported topline results. We have now all necessary clinical data to support submission with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  which we plan to start later this year. Chikungunya is a major  growing and unmet public health threat  yet no vaccine or specific treatment is currently available to prevent this debilitating disease. We will continue to work assiduously to bring VLA1553 to market as soon as possible.‚ÄùValneva‚Äôs chikungunya program was awarded Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the US FDA in July 2021. This milestone followed the US FDA‚Äôs Fast Track designation and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)‚Äôs PRIME designation which the Company received in December 2018 and in October 2020  respectively. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine Biologics License Application (BLA) to be approved in the U.S. will be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) 2.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in 72-92% of humans after 4 to 7 days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 100 countries. As of September 2020  there were more than 3 million reported cases in the Americas3 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.Story continuesAbout VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate designed to target the chikungunya virus. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.In March 2022  Valneva announced successful completion of the Phase 3 pivotal trial of VLA15534. The final six-month analysis confirmed the very high level of seroprotection reported from this trial in August 2021. In this double-blind  multi-center  randomized Phase 3 clinical trial  4 115 participants aged 18 years and above were randomized 3:1 into two groups to receive either 0.5mL of VLA1553 or a placebo. The trial met its primary endpoint  inducing protective CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers in 98.9% of participants 28 days after receiving a single shot (264 of 268 subjects from the per-protocol subgroup tested for immunogenicity  95% CI: 96.2-99.6). The seroprotective titer was agreed with the FDA to serve as a surrogate of protection that can be utilized in a submission for approval of VLA1553 under the accelerated approval pathway. VLA1553 was highly immunogenic  with a GMT of approximately 3 270.VLA1553 was generally well tolerated among the 3 082 subjects evaluated for safety. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board  or DSMB  continuously monitored the study and identified no safety concerns. Solicited adverse events were observed  the majority of which were mild or moderate and resolved within 3 days.Additionally  VLA1553 was shown in the Phase 3 pivotal trial to be highly immunogenic in elderly study participants  who achieved equally high seroprotection rates and neutralizing antibody titers as younger adults  as well as an equally good safety profile.VLA1553 would expand Valneva‚Äôs existing travel vaccine portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  if approved  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations. The global market for chikungunya vaccines is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20325.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15536. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20197  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 program.About Phase 3 study VLA1553-302The VLA1553-302 clinical lot-to-lot consistency study is a prospective  multicenter  randomized  pivotal Phase 3 study including 408 participants aged 18 to 45 years. Lyophilized VLA1553 were administered as a single intramuscular immunization. Equivalence of immune responses was determined based on neutralizing antibody titers. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate a pair-wise comparison of the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) on the ratio of GMTs on Day 29 after vaccination in the three vaccine lots. The two-sided 95% CI on the GMT ratio should be within 0.67 and 1.5 in order to demonstrate consistency.Study volunteers were followed for six months after vaccination. Additional information  including a detailed description of the study design  eligibility criteria and investigator sites  is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04786444).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

Despite current treatments  RA continues to pose a substantial burden to people living with the disease  comprised of the daily health issues directly related to their RA  such as pain  and the complications of managing comorbid conditions.1 2 3About the FINCH 4 LTE studyFINCH 4 is an ongoing phase 3 open-label LTE study of filgotinib 200mg and filgotinib 100mg for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of filgotinib in participants who have completed one of the parent studies of filgotinib in RA. Eligible patients completed a prior phase 3 randomised double-blind study of filgotinib lasting 52 weeks (FINCH 1 or 3) or 24 weeks (FINCH 2).About filgotinibFilgotinib is approved and marketed as Jyseleca (200mg and 100mg tablets) in the European Union  Great Britain  and Japan for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Available via SAP Data Custodian  Thales‚Äôs tokenizati‚Ä¶,PARIS LA D√âFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Thales today announced its CipherTrust Tokenization is the first SAP-certified tokenization solution available to SAP customers that can be used to secure sensitive data. Available via SAP Data Custodian  Thales‚Äôs tokenization solution provides more granular levels of data protection and user access controls  dramatically accelerating time to compliance for organizations that are moving more applications and workload to the cloud.The new availability of Thales‚Äôs CipherTrust Tokenization in the SAP Data Custodian builds on a successful  long-term relationship between the two companies for encryption  tokenization and key management solutions. The tokenization solution in the SAP Data Custodian was developed by both organisations through SAP‚Äôs Co-innovation Lab  ensuring the security of sensitive data at the most fundamental levels of the application. SAP customers can now secure their private data at rest in a database  in use  and even during development.‚ÄúThe release of the SAP Data Custodian Tokenization solution powered by Thales‚Äôs CipherTrust Tokenization service further advances our commitment to secure our customers‚Äô private data as they migrate to the public cloud ‚Äù said Dr Wasif Gilani at SAP. ‚ÄúThis new solution builds on the strengths of both partners to create a comprehensive  trustworthy solution for our customers as they operate their applications using sensitive data.‚ÄùMaintaining compliance with demanding security regulationsToday‚Äôs enterprises must ensure the privacy and security of sensitive data  including personally identifiable information (PII) and payment card information (PCI). In particular  the Schrems II decision mandates that all European companies conduct individual assessments of each data transfer to a non-EU country to ensure compliance. The new partnership between Thales and SAP allows customers to define security on a per-field basis in the application according to templates in the Data Custodian user interface. Field-level security protects private data before it is written to databases  simplifying database access controls and ensuring compliance with PII and PCI regulations.‚ÄúModern enterprises recognize the importance of a comprehensive cybersecurity solution  protecting sensitive data throughout its entire lifecycle  including the earliest moments of data creation ‚Äù said Todd Moore  vice president of encryption products at Thales. ‚ÄúThis new CipherTrust Tokenization solution  co-developed with our partners at SAP  will give users the confidence that their data is secure at all times even at the most granular  field level. We will continue to partner with companies like SAP to develop highly integrated solutions that ensure data security for all cloud users.‚ÄùThales‚Äôs CipherTrust Tokenization solution is generally available today to secure all SAP applications supported by the SAP Data Custodian.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies  investing in digital and ‚Äúdeep tech‚Äù innovations ‚Äì connectivity  big data  artificial intelligence  cybersecurity and quantum technologies ‚Äì to build a confident future crucial for the development of our societies.

5530,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4514262-ocis-ebitda-explodes-higher-fertilizer-prices-q2-even-better,OCI's EBITDA Explodes On Higher Fertilizer Prices  And Q2 Will Be Even Better,OCI is taking full advantage of the current tailwind on the fertilizer markets & net debt and debt ratio are decreasing incredibly fast. Read more on OCI here.,Orest Lyzhechka/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionLong-time followers and readers may remember I was getting bullish on OCI (OTC:OCINF) a few years ago as the company was one of my favorite turnaround stories. It had just completed a sizeable investment in expanding its operations and the debt level was high but I was arguing a higher EBITDA would keep the debt ratio under control while I was also anticipating the free cash flow would help to reduce the net debt. This has now happened and OCI is now rated investment grade again by all three major rating agencies.The COVID pandemic made the situation a little bit tricky but OCI survived the test and is now printing cash ‚Äì thanks to the very high fertilizer prices as revenue and EBITDA in Q1 doubled compared to the first quarter of last year.Yahoo FinanceOCI has its primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam where it‚Äôs trading with OCI as its ticker symbol. As the average daily volume on the Amsterdam listing exceeds half a million shares  it is by far the most liquid venue to trade in the company‚Äôs shares (and options).Q1 was phenomenal  but Q2 will be even betterAlthough OCI sold less fertilizer (the total amount of fertilizer products sold fell by 11%  mainly due to an inventory level build-up ahead of the spring season)  it saw a sharp uptick in the volumes traded for third parties.OCI Investor RelationsBut the commodity prices were the saving grace for OCI. The ammonia prices more than tripled compared to a year ago while virtually any other commodity produced by OCI (except methanol) saw their prices at least double as well. And although the melamine price was up by a factor of 2.49  OCI did curtail the production at its European plant due to the high natural gas prices which more than quintupled.OCI Investor RelationsDespite the lower volumes of own products sold  the revenue more than doubled to just over $2.3B resulting in a gross profit of $864M  which is more than 150% higher than in the first quarter of last year. There were some slightly higher operating expenses as the SG&A expenses increased but this had barely any impact on the reported results. The pre-tax income almost quadrupled to almost $840M while the net income jumped to $699M.OCI Investor RelationsOf that $699M  about $410M was attributable to the shareholders of OCI (the remainder of almost $290M was attributable to minority interests). This means the Q1 EPS was approximately $1.95 which translates into roughly 1.85 EUR per share  so on an annualized basis  the EPS is getting close to 7.50 EUR per share.My original thesis was cash flow centered. I argued the stronger cash flows would immediately contribute towards reducing the net debt and of course I was expecting to see a very strong conversion of earnings into free cash flow in the first quarter of the year.Let‚Äôs start with the reported operating cash flow  which came in at $726M. This includes an investment of almost $200M in the working capital position. We should however also deduct an additional $83M to adjust for the differences in taxes paid and taxes due while I will make an additional adjustment for the differences between interest paid and interest owed  which reduces the operating cash flow by an additional $25M. So on an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow is approximately $820M.OCI Investor RelationsThe financial cash flows also show a lease payment of $8M and a dividend paid to non-controlling interests of $67M. However  to be fair  I will deduct the entire income of $290M attributable to non-controlling interests as there is a difference between what‚Äôs ‚Äòowed‚Äô to those minority shareholders and what has actually been paid as a dividend. When all the dust has settled  the adjusted operating cash flow was $520M.OCI Investor RelationsMy main argument in the pre-COVID era was that once the new plants were completed  the capex levels would drop to almost zero. That scenario has now fully come through and in Q1 the total amount of depreciation expenses were almost $150M while the capex dropped to just the maintenance capex of just over $50M. This means the free cash flow attributable to the shareholders of OCI was approximately $470M or $2.23/share (or roughly 2.10 EUR per share). Not bad for just one quarter.OCI Investor RelationsNeedless to say the first quarter of 2022 was absolutely amazing but OCI doesn‚Äôt think the current tailwind will suddenly disappear. The short-term outlook is exceptionally strong as OCI expects its Q2 performance to be better than the Q1 result (both in terms of EBITDA as well as reported free cash flow) while it says it expects the positive market outlook to continue until at least 2024 thanks to the combination of low global grain stocks  favorable farm economics and of course  the geopolitical events in Eastern Europe which may have a major impact on food supply while the import ban for Russian and Belarussian fertilizer will likely keep the fertilizer prices elsewhere high.Suddenly the net debt is evaporating extremely fast  paving the way for dividendsThanks to the incoming free cash flow  the net debt is decreasing very fast and the next image provides an excellent overview of the evolution of the net debt as well as the debt ratio. Keep in mind the debt ratio (net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA) is based on the LTM EBITDA. This LTM EBITDA will continue to increase in the next few quarters so the debt ratio should actually continue to improve as the net debt will decrease thanks to the strong cash flows while the EBITDA will continue to increase.OCI Investor RelationsOCI has announced a dividend of 1.45 EUR per share based on the H2 2021 results but has guided for a much higher dividend after the first semester of this year. Considering the company is guiding for a better result in Q2 than in Q1  I think it‚Äôs not unreasonable to expect an EPS of around 4 EUR per share for the first half of the current financial year.The company recently updated its capital returns policy. The dividend will consist of a minimum dividend of $400M per year (approximately $1.90 per share) while OCI will also increase those dividends with a variable component  based on the actual financial performance. As OCI is definitely in a bullish cycle right now we should definitely be able to expect a substantial dividend after H1 as the base dividend will only require about 0.90 EUR of the likely 4.00+ EUR EPS generated in H1 2022.OCI Investor RelationsInvestment thesisWe are now about three years after my last article on OCI  and the investment thesis is now finally playing out  thanks to the strengthening fertilizer prices which accelerate the debt reduction and EBITDA increase. Without the exceptional strength we are currently seeing on the fertilizer market  OCI would still have been able to achieve its goals  but it‚Äôs going so much faster right now.OCI is currently immensely benefiting from the tailwinds in the fertilizer industry and as the company expects these tailwinds to continue into 2024  the company may actually have a net cash position (even after taking the generous dividends into account) before the down-cycle starts.I currently no longer have a position in OCI but I have considered writing some out of the money put options again.,neutral,0.13,0.57,0.29,mixed,0.28,0.12,0.59,True,English,"['Higher Fertilizer Prices', 'OCI', 'EBITDA', 'Q2', 'low global grain stocks', 'three major rating agencies', 'half a million shares', 'high natural gas prices', 'SG&A expenses', 'favorite turnaround stories', 'average daily volume', 'working capital position', 'favorable farm economics', 'stronger cash flows', 'financial cash flows', 'free cash flow', 'operating cash flow', 'inventory level build', 'positive market outlook', 'higher operating expenses', 'high fertilizer prices', 'OCI Investor Relations', 'depreciation expenses', 'debt level', 'short-term outlook', 'major impact', 'commodity prices', 'ammonia prices', 'less fertilizer', 'Belarussian fertilizer', 'Orest Lyzhechka', 'Getty Images', 'Long-time followers', 'OTC:OCINF', 'debt ratio', 'net debt', 'COVID pandemic', 'first quarter', 'Yahoo Finance', 'primary listing', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'ticker symbol', 'Amsterdam listing', 'liquid venue', 'total amount', 'spring season', 'sharp uptick', 'third parties', 'saving grace', 'other commodity', 'melamine price', 'European plant', 'gross profit', 'pre-tax income', 'net income', 'minority interests', 'original thesis', 'strong conversion', 'additional adjustment', 'lease payment', 'non-controlling interests', 'entire income', 'main argument', 'pre-COVID era', 'new plants', 'one quarter', 'current tailwind', 'geopolitical events', 'Eastern Europe', 'food supply', 'import ban', 'higher EBITDA', 'fertilizer products', 'sizeable investment', 'investment grade', 'last year', 'capex levels', 'maintenance capex', 'lower volumes', 'annualized basis', 'Q2 performance', 'Q1 result', 'minority shareholders', 'Q1 EPS', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'readers', 'company', 'operations', 'situation', 'test', 'revenue', 'options', 'methanol', 'factor', 'production', 'results', 'remainder', '1.85 EUR', 'course', 'earnings', 'differences', 'taxes', 'dividend', '90M', 'dust', 'scenario', 'terms', 'combination', 'way', '7.50', '2.10']",2022-05-25,2022-05-26,seekingalpha.com

5541,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.montelnews.com/news/1323473/nord-pool-mulls-acquisitions-ahead-of-financial-launch,Nord Pool mulls acquisitions ahead of financial launch,1 day ago,(Montel) Nordic power exchange Nord Pool may acquire rivals ahead of a possible expansion into financial power trading  its new CEO told Montel  while adding he was concerned about growing political efforts to reregulate markets amid soaring energy prices.‚ÄúWe are still considering launching a marketplace for financial power. Many of our customers want to see physical and financial trading together and relate to fewer partners ‚Äù Tom Darell told Montel in an interview.‚ÄúWe also have great prerequisites [for financial product launch] since we are owned by [stock exchange] Euronext ‚Äù he added.Oslo-based Nord Pool has only offered spot and intraday trading since it sold its financial derivatives business to Nasdaq in 2010.But Paris-based Euronext said it wanted to reintroduce financial trading at the exchange after it bought a 66% majority from regional TSOs in late 2019.Darell  who took the helm of Nord Pool on 1 April  said the company was able to launch financial trading independently but would not rule out acquiring rivals to boost its expansion in the European power market.Nord Pool is currently active in 16 countries  altough the bulk of its activity is in the Nordic and Baltic regions as well as in the UK.‚ÄúWe believe we are facing market consolidation over time  because there are still many small exchanges and also monopolies that will eventually open up. We will be there when things happen ‚Äù said Darell.Reregulation is not the answerDarell comes to his position as Nord Pool chief in the face of an energy crisis. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine since February has exacerbated the energy price crisis that began last year when Europe was faced with historically low gas storage levels ahead of winter.With euro-zone inflation spiking to record highs for six consecutive months  households and businesses across the region are piling pressure on governments to curb their soaring energy bills. And some politicians want to roll back deregulation in the power sector as a solution.‚ÄúI see a risk [for reregulation]. It is therefore important to have informed discussion before decisions are made. And it is not easy to be a politician in this situation  since there is a strong pressure from the public [to do something] ‚Äù Darell said.A liberalised power market model has worked extremely well for 30 years  according to Darell  adding that today‚Äôs problems mainly stemmed from issues related to the green transition and unforeseen events like the war in Ukraine rather than a bad market design.‚ÄúWe still have a very efficient market. That is not the main problem ‚Äù said Darell  who prior to Nord Pool was responsible for integrating technology solutions for the energy business at service provider Volue.Still  some market participants criticise Nord Pool‚Äôs Nordic day-ahead system price for being increasingly inefficient due to historically wide price variations between the region‚Äôs 12 bidding zones.And that has had a knock-on effect on financial trading volumes  which plunged to a 21-year low last year and has dropped further this year.‚ÄúBut we know that customers will still have a hedging need also in the future ‚Äù said Darell  adding that financial trading volumes in Nord Pool‚Äôs markets across Europe totalled 13 500 TWh.,neutral,0.04,0.9,0.06,mixed,0.1,0.21,0.69,True,English,"['Nord Pool', 'financial launch', 'acquisitions', 'low gas storage levels', 'Nordic day-ahead system price', 'liberalised power market model', 'wide price variations', 'growing political efforts', 'many small exchanges', 'six consecutive months', 'bad market design', 'soaring energy prices', 'soaring energy bills', 'financial product launch', 'European power market', 'energy price crisis', 'financial derivatives business', 'financial trading volumes', 'financial power trading', 'Nordic power exchange', 'Oslo-based Nord Pool', 'Nord Pool chief', 'energy crisis', 'energy business', 'power sector', 'market consolidation', 'efficient market', 'market participants', 'intraday trading', 'new CEO', 'fewer partners', 'great prerequisites', 'stock exchange', 'regional TSOs', 'Baltic regions', 'euro-zone inflation', 'green transition', 'unforeseen events', 'main problem', 'technology solutions', 'service provider', '12 bidding zones', 'hedging need', 'possible expansion', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'strong pressure', 'Tom Darell', 'Montel', 'rivals', 'markets', 'marketplace', 'customers', 'physical', 'interview', 'spot', 'Nasdaq', '66% majority', 'late', 'helm', '1 April', 'company', '16 countries', 'bulk', 'activity', 'UK', 'time', 'monopolies', 'things', 'Reregulation', 'answer', 'position', 'face', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'February', 'winter', 'highs', 'households', 'businesses', 'governments', 'politicians', 'deregulation', 'risk', 'discussion', 'decisions', 'situation', 'public', 'something', '30 years', 'problems', 'issues', 'war', 'Volue', 'effect', '21-year', 'future', '500 TWh']",2022-05-26,2022-05-26,montelnews.com

These conditions have materially worsened over the last few weeks and our second quarter is now expected to be high single digit negative. More broadly  previous assumptions need to be updated:Inflation in Europe is forecast to stay at high levels for the remainder of the year  hampering consumer confidence and the underlying demand for the category The evolution of the pandemic in China keeps generating serious bottlenecks which add extra costs and may slow down our restocking plans Freight  raw material and energy costs remain at very high levels and are not expected to ease in the near future. Against this backdrop of high inflation and volatility  projected costs have been underestimated  temporarily impacting the gross margin model.Despite the soft demand  the Group is determined to support sales development through short-term and mid-term action plans. It is also committed to protect profitability through rigorous cost control  while advancing on the mid-term agenda. In particular  it plans to maintain investment in strategic initiatives such as the opening of the second logistics centre and the deployment of the marketplace. The Group also plans to keep actively rebuild inventories to support future sales while managing sourcing constraints.However  the high uncertainty of the global topline context  together with the revision of its projected gross margin assessment  have led the Group to review its full-year objectives as follows:Updated guidance Previous guidance1 Top line growth Mid-single-digit negative Positive EBIT margin 5% or above around 9% FCF EUR 10m to 30m EUR 65m to 75m Carbon intensity CO 2 neutrality for scopes 1 and 2 Dividend pay-out ratio 30% to 40%Maisons du Monde stays confident in the profitable growth model detailed in the context of the Capital Markets Day of November 2021. The strategic plan disclosed on that occasion remains fully valid  although the timing for reaching the 2025 targets may be extended.Story continuesConference call for investors and analystsDate: 27 May 2022 at 07:30 CESTSpeaker: Julie Walbaum  CEOConnection details:Webcast: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/ptnwnu7eConference call: France: +33 (0)1 70 70 07 81 UK: +44 (0) 2071 928338 USA: +1 16467413167 Password: 9647572***Financial calendar31 May 2022 Annual General Meeting10 June 2022 Dividend payment date (proposed)28 July 2022 Q2 and H1 2022 financial results27 October 2022 Q3 and 9M 2022 sales***Disclaimer: Forward Looking StatementThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements "" including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

Part 2A and Part 26 enact in Ireland domestic rules in line with Directive 2013/34/EU (the ‚ÄúEU Accounting Directive (2013)‚Äù) and apply to large Irish incorporated companies  like the Company  that are involved in the exploration  discovery  development  and extraction of minerals. DTR 4.3A imposes equivalent requirements on issuers  like the Company  admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange that are similarly involved in the exploration  development and extraction of minerals.This report is available for download at https://www.kenmareresources.com/investors/reports-and-presentationsIt has also been submitted to Euronext Dublin and the UK National Storage Mechanism and will shortly be available for inspection at the following locations:https://direct.euronext.com/#/oamfilingandhttps://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanismAbout Kenmare Resources plcKenmare Resources plc is an Irish incorporated company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the ‚ÄúMoma Mine‚Äù)  which is located on the northern coast of Mozambique. Moma is one of the world‚Äôs largest producers of minerals sands products  accounting for production of approximately 8% of global titanium feedstocks and supplying to customers operating in over 15 countries. The Group‚Äôs products are key raw materials  ultimately consumed in everyday quality-of-life products such as paints  plastics  and ceramic tiles.Story continuesThe Group consists of the parent company (Kenmare Resources plc) and its subsidiary undertakings. The mining operations at the Moma Mine are carried out by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (‚ÄúKMML‚Äù) and downstream processing is undertaken by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited (‚ÄúKMPL‚Äù)  both of which are wholly-owned subsidiary undertakings of the Company. KMML and KMPL account for 100% of the Group‚Äôs turnover and 99% of the Group‚Äôs total assets. Therefore  all revenues and operating costs of the Group‚Äôs mining and processing operations are recorded by KMML and KMPL within the same tax jurisdiction  namely Mozambique.The parent company  Kenmare Resources plc  conducts no direct exploration or mining activities. The Group‚Äôs corporate costs are recorded by the parent company.Scope of reportDisclosure of payments to governments is required in respect of payments arising from the exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals; the payments included within this report therefore relate to the Group‚Äôs mining and processing activities at the Moma Mine in Mozambique.Groups are required to prepare a consolidated report disclosing payments made by the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings. Accordingly  this report reflects payments made by the Group companies conducting mining and processing activities  namely KMML and KMPL. The Group owns 100% of these entities and the amounts reflect 100% of the payments made by these subsidiary undertakings.For a broader discussion of the Group‚Äôs payments to governments and its contribution to its host communities  please see the Group‚Äôs 2021 Sustainability Report  available on the Company‚Äôs website at www.kenmareresources .com/investors/reports-and-presentationsPaymentsThe payments disclosed in this report are on a cash basis.The payments made to governments are required to be analysed into the following categories:Production entitlements - this category includes the host government‚Äôs share of production  which is usually outlined in a production sharing agreement. In 2021  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Taxes - this category includes taxes paid to governments on income  profits or production arising from the Group‚Äôs exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals. Taxes levied on consumption such as value added taxes  personal income taxes and sales taxes are excluded. KMML is subject to a corporation tax rate of 35% of the taxable profits of its Mozambique branch. Taxable profits of the branch are calculated by reference to the cash costs of producing Heavy Mineral Concentrate (‚ÄúHMC‚Äù) net of allowable tax deductions and increased by a defined margin.KMML‚Äôs Mozambique branch produces one product from its mining activities  namely HMC. HMC is sold to KMPL  which processes it into finished products (ilmenite  zircon  rutile and mineral sands concentrate)  which are exported worldwide to third party customers. The cash costs of mining include the costs of mine face preparation  dredging and dry mining operations  Wet Concentrator Plant operations  rehabilitation and support services.The margin applied to the cash costs of mining is stipulated in the Mineral Licensing Contract  dated 21 January 2002. The contract is between KMML and the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy (MIREME) of the Republic of Mozambique  acting for and on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique  which details the terms and conditions for the exploration  development and production of heavy minerals in the areas of Moma  Congolone and Quinga. The margin is determined by dividing the prices for sale of finished products to third party customers earned by KMPL in the year by the prices earned in the prior year  adjusted for inflation and applying this factor to the prior year margin. For the fiscal year ending 31 December 2021 the margin was 54.8%.KMPL has the benefit of operating within an Industrial Free Zone (‚ÄúIFZ‚Äù) and as an IFZ company  it is exempted from corporation tax.Royalties ‚Äì this category includes payments to a government for the rights to extract minerals or other materials. Typically amounts are levied based on production levels or revenues. KMML is subject to a mining royalty of 3% based on HMC sold to KMPL. The royalty is calculated by multiplying the cash costs of producing HMC  plus the margin as detailed above  by 3%.KMPL is subject to a revenue royalty of 1% on revenue recognised.Dividends - this category includes dividend payments other than dividends paid to a government as an ordinary shareholder of the Company or one of its subsidiary undertakings. In 2021  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Bonuses - this category includes bonuses paid to a government for and in consideration of signature  discovery  production  awards  grants and transfers of extraction rights and production bonuses. In 2021  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Fees ‚Äì this category includes licence fees  rental fees  entry fees and other considerations for mining licences or concessions.Infrastructure improvements ‚Äì this category includes payments to governments for infrastructure other than in circumstances where the infrastructure is expected to be primarily dedicated to operational activities throughout its useful life. Payments that form part of the Group‚Äôs social investment activities (which are primarily organised and administered by Kenmare Moma Development Association) are excluded. Such payments would include contributions in respect of local schools  healthcare or community facilities  or improvements to the general environment of local communities.Government‚ÄúGovernment‚Äù means any national  regional or local authority of a country  and includes a department  agency or undertaking that is a subsidiary undertaking where the authority is the parent undertaking.All payments referred to this report are made to the Government of Mozambique or its agencies; in particular  they are made to Autoridade Tribut√°ria Unidade dos Grandes Contribuintes‚ÄìNampula  a department of the Mozambican tax authority.Analysis by project/entityAn analysis of payments by project is required where payments are attributable to specific projects. Projects are defined as operational activities which are governed by a single contract  licence  lease  concession or similar legal agreement  and form the basis for payment liabilities with a government. Where agreements are substantially interconnected in operating and geographical terms  with substantially similar terms  those agreements should be treated as a single project. Payments may be disclosed at an entity level where payments are made in respect of obligations imposed at that entity level rather than at a project level. Payments below are disclosed at the entity level for KMML and KMPL  which between them operate the Moma Mine  which is treated as one project for purposes of this Report.MaterialityUnder Part 2A and Part 26  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of ‚Ç¨100 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of ‚Ç¨100 000.Currency and roundingAll monetary amounts in this report refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated. The amounts shown in this report have been rounded to the nearest $1 000.Payments to governments ‚Äì 2021Production entitlements Taxes Royalties Dividends Bonuses Fees Infrastructure improvements Total $‚Äô000 $‚Äô000 $‚Äô000 $‚Äô000 $‚Äô000 $‚Äô000 $‚Äô000 $‚Äô000 Country summary Government of Mozambique - 6 156 8 863 - - 388 - 15 407 Total - 6 156 8 863 - - 388 - 15 407 Entity report KMML - 6 156 4 200 - - 388 - 10 744 KMPL - - 4 663 - - - - 4 663 Total - 6 156 8 863 - - 388 - 15 407This report for Kenmare Resources plc (registered number 37550) was approved by the Directors of the Company on 25 May 2022 and signed on their behalf byMichael CarvillDirectorTony McCluskeyDirectorFor further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Doug Keatingedkeatinge@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 037 4163About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world‚Äôs largest producers of mineral sands products.

ExchangeWire believes that this reflects a more expansive view for ad tech and martech.After all  why focus on a multibillion-dollar retargeting display segment  when you can be building the tech layer for the multitrillion-dollar marketing industry?I always pen a prediction piece a few weeks out from ATS London (limited tickets available) to set the stage for Europe‚Äôs premium madtech event. Using Steins  I graded the probability of these predictions.Henceforth - given ATS London‚Äôs new June date and proximity to Cannes - I will use bottles of ros√© as our go-to probability icon. I look forward to seeing you all on 14/15 June.And here are those 2022 predictions in full:Shopify buys CriteoShopify could be a retail media power house. With over one million sites using its platform  Shopify could offer buyers a scaled shopper graph to buy ads across its network of sites. It could also enable its own platform customers to leverage the 'Shopify graph' ‚Äì as well as their own first-party data. The problem here: ad tech. Shopify doesn‚Äôt have any. And it will take time to build. The solution: buy Criteo. Criteo has skilfully pivoted its business away from display retargeting into retail media. After its deal closes with IPONWEB (June close most probable)  Criteo will have a world-class retail media infrastructure. Shopify needs Criteo to live its best retail-media life.Probability of Shopify buying Criteo: 2/5 ros√© bottlesMediaocean (Vista Equity Partners) buys MagniteBuy and sell side are converging. If everyone is competing on supply access  what is the point of buy-side/sell-side demarcation? Magnite is very cheap at the minute  and offers so much to Mediaocean in terms of CTV and display capabilities. Mediaocean could steal the march on its longtime rival The Trade Desk in the workflow and omnichannel media execution segment.Probability of Mediaocean buying Magnite: 3/5 ros√© bottlesGoodbye DoubleClickI ran a poll on LinkedIn on the future of Google‚Äôs third-party ad tech stack. Fifty-eight percent of respondents believe that Google will never leave ad tech. While I respect the wisdom of the crowd  I still believe strongly that Google will be forced to divest of its ad tech stack. Legislation is coming - so it is now only a matter of time.Probability of Google being forced to divest its ad stack: 3/5 ros√© bottlesThe coming zero ID shit show in EuropeAfter Google got hit with a USD$100m+ fine for confusing language on its cookie banner  the ‚Äòreject all‚Äô option was made available to users across the top CMPs in Europe. I am hearing anecdotally from some big publishers that ‚Äòreject all‚Äô clicks are on the rise. What is happening to those consent-less users? Well  ad tech is not in the business of monetising zero ID users - so the ‚Äòreject all‚Äô CPMs are collapsing. Matching IDs are ad tech‚Äôs business. Are they really going to re-engineer for the zero ID user? Short answer: no. This is going to be a huge problem for European publishers. Watch out for this.Probability of a European 'zero ID' shit show: 4/5 ros√© bottlesNetflix ‚ù§Ô∏è third-party ad techThere was an article recently outlining why Netflix should buy Roku. At USD$10bn (~¬£8bn)  it would be affordable ‚Äì but why spend so much money at this early stage on a programmatic-focused business? Netflix will instead lean on Freewheel and Google to manage direct buys. And opt for a white-labeled The Trade Desk for programmatic buys. In the short term  anyway  Netflix ‚ù§Ô∏è third-party ad tech.Probability: 4/5 ros√© bottleseBay buys an ad server to build out its ad-tech stackeBay wants to muscle in on the retail-media boom. But it lacks the ad tech infrastructure to scale. eBay will look to buy an ad-server solution to help build out the stack. eBay was rumoured to be buying Adform. But the deal fell apart on valuation. eBay may come back with an improved offer. Other potentials include Kevel and Smart.Probability of eBay buying an ad server: 3/5 ros√© bottlesRetail media ad nets every-bloody-whereRetail media will not mirror programmatic in display advertising. It is highly unlikely that Tesco  Carrefour  or equivalent  will feed sensitive sales data into the bid stream. Instead  we will see the rise of ad nets selling full-funnel solutions into agencies. The aisle sales parties will be legendary. A packet of Viscounts and a six pack of Fanta  anyone?Probability: 3/5 ros√© bottlesPublisher contextual row rumbles onThe fight between ad tech and publisher contextual data is going to continue until a suitable commercial model is agreed upon. In the post-cookie world  contextual data will be critical to open-web monetisation. This could get very messy.Probability: 4/5 ros√© bottlesThe European madtech IPO market roars back to life in late 2023It‚Äôs an absolute bloodbath in the markets right now. Tech stocks are getting hammered on valuations  as investors flee for the safe haven of ‚Äòpredictable growth‚Äô companies.Ad Tech IPOs: What could happen?The IPO market is shut for ad tech companies  but listings will return in late 2023 and much of 2024.Most European companies ExchangeWire speaks with are opting for New York - where there is an acceptance of ad tech as a public market segment. This should be a wake-up call for Euronext and LSE  as they are likely to lose out on a lot of deals. Here are those 2023/24 candidates in full - along with the probability:- OguryThe French ad net has developed an interesting data graph built around survey data and proprietary first-party data assets. The company could do a big PE round - given how much European PE LOVES ad nets - but it is looking at a public listing instead. Can a managed service ad tech business have a successful public listing?Chances of 23/24 IPO:4/5 ros√© bottles- SmartGoogle‚Äôs only real publisher full-stack competition. The company has been winning some big publisher accounts of late - and is doing USD$100m in revenue. Smart could be in the box seat in the coming 12-24 months given Google‚Äôs issues. An independent DoubleClick - bereft of the AdWords demand power hose - is not as intimidating as the Google death star. Chances of 23/24 IPO:4/5 ros√© bottles- MiQMiQ is going to be a very sizeable PE round later this year. The company is one of the biggest European ad tech companies in terms of revenue. At some stage the PE journey will end. MiQ will then likely go public on the NYSE/Nasdaq ‚Äì but might be a 2025 candidate. How they deal with Wall Street expectations will be crucial here.3/5 ros√© bottles- PermutiveArguably the most interesting European ad tech company. It‚Äôs very much built for the privacy-first age - and its technology is very much about enabling the publisher. Permutive did a series B raise backed by Softbank. The company trajectory will likely end in a US IPO in 2024.4/5 ros√© bottles- AdverityEurope‚Äôs martech unicorn is positioning itself as the enterprise analytics solution of choice for big marketers. Adverity has raised USD$165m (~¬£132m) to date  and is probably getting too expensive for most buyers.4/5 ros√© bottles- TeadsIt tried to go public in 2021  but the valuation at the time was thought to be too frothy by Wall Street. The company is drawing over USD$600m (~¬£480m) in revenue ‚Äì and has been working on its cookieless solution. It will regroup and go public in the next 24 months.4/5 ros√© bottles- InfosumThe ‚Äòclean room‚Äô specialist has a big opportunity to build the leading solution in this hyper-growth segment. This could be a trade sale given the walled-garden fragmentation.1/5 ros√© bottles- CavaiThe Norwegian-based ad tech platform is part of a new wave of post-cookie vendors shaping the future of the sector. Its tech offering is focused on data-driven creative  connecting the top and bottom of the funnel across the open web and retail media. The company will go public but maybe a 2025 candidate.2/5 ros√© bottles- TAPTAP DigitalRecently did a USD$100m (~¬£80m) PE deal. Its location-based solution is built on a privacy framework. The company is growing. The CEO wants to go public.3/5 ros√© bottles- The Ozone ProjectThis is a wild card. Ozone has built a tech layer and cookieless ad-net solution. It plans to sell the tech to international publishers. Ultimately  they will need to raise to fund this expansion. If they do  there will have to be an outcome. An LSE listing beckons - but not for a while.1/5 ros√© bottlesWe look forward to hosting you all at ATS London on 14/15 June  and discussing all of the above.,neutral,0.05,0.85,0.1,mixed,0.14,0.14,0.71,True,English,"['Ciar√°n O‚ÄôKane', '2022 MadTech Predictions', 'coming zero ID shit show', ""European 'zero ID' shit show"", 'The European madtech IPO market', 'omnichannel media execution segment', 'multibillion-dollar retargeting display segment', 'retail media power house', 'world-class retail media infrastructure', '2/5 ros√© bottles Mediaocean', 'zero ID user', 'premium madtech event', 'third-party ad tech stack', 'multitrillion-dollar marketing industry', 'Vista Equity Partners', 'The Trade Desk', 'USD$100m+ fine', 'aisle sales parties', 'suitable commercial model', 'predictable growth‚Äô companies', '3/5 ros√© bottles', '4/5 ros√© bottles', 'Publisher contextual row', 'sensitive sales data', 'publisher contextual data', 'ad tech infrastructure', 'one million sites', 'Ad Tech IPOs', 'new June date', 'best retail-media life', 'European publishers', 'ad stack', 'traditional date', 'first-party data', 'retail-media boom', 'ad-tech stack', 'ad server', 'ad nets', 'tech layer', 'Tech stocks', 'display capabilities', 'display advertising', 'ATS London', '14/15 June', 'expansive view', 'prediction piece', 'limited tickets', 'shopper graph', 'supply access', 'longtime rival', 'Goodbye DoubleClick', 'Fifty-eight percent', 'confusing language', 'cookie banner', 'top CMPs', 'big publishers', 'consent-less users', 'Matching IDs', 'Short answer', 'direct buys', 'short term', 'Other potentials', 'bid stream', 'full-funnel solutions', 'six pack', 'post-cookie world', 'web monetisation', 'absolute bloodbath', 'safe haven', 'platform customers', 'side demarcation', 'huge problem', 'early stage', 'programmatic buys', 'ad-server solution', 'programmatic-focused business', 'Shopify graph', 'probability icon', 'September', 'ExchangeWire', 'martech', 'Steins', 'predictions', 'proximity', 'Cannes', 'Criteo', 'buyers', 'ads', 'network', 'deal', 'IPONWEB', 'Magnite', 'everyone', 'point', 'minute', 'terms', 'CTV', 'march', 'workflow', 'poll', 'LinkedIn', 'future', 'Google', 'respondents', 'wisdom', 'crowd', 'Legislation', 'matter', 'option', 'clicks', 'rise', 'CPMs', 'Netflix', 'article', 'Roku', 'money', 'Freewheel', 'labeled', 'eBay', 'Adform', 'valuation', 'offer', 'Kevel', 'Smart', 'Tesco', 'Carrefour', 'agencies', 'packet', 'Viscounts', 'Fanta', 'fight', 'late', 'markets', 'investors']",2022-05-26,2022-05-26,exchangewire.com

(""CoolCo"").Sold 6.2 million New Fortress Energy Inc. (""NFE"") shares in Q2 2022 (""Q2"") realizing net cash proceeds of $253 million. Golar now owns 12.4 million NFE shares following the sale.Q1 Total Golar Cash and Listed Securities 1 position increased by $0.4 billion to $1.3 billion. Golar's share of Contractual Debt 1 decreased by $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion in Q1 and a further $0.5 billion in Q2 after sale of remaining carriers to CoolCo in April.Agreed to sell the steam turbine carrier Golar Arctic as a converted FSRU to Italy's Snam for 269 million Euros ($288 million).Strong progress made on opportunities for FSRU Golar Tundra and on pipeline of FLNG projects.Shipping spin-off: A key focus for Q1 was the spin-off of our 8 TFDE LNG carriers into CoolCo. CoolCo successfully concluded an upsized $275 million equity raise in January  listed on the Euronext Growth Oslo exchange in February  recruited a designated management team in March and closed its acquisition of 8 LNG carriers and The Cool Pool Limited from Golar during March and April. The sale of the management companies is contemplated to complete in Q2. In total the CoolCo transactions will reduce Golar‚Äôs contractual debt1 position by $821 million  release approximately $217 million in cash and cash equivalents to Golar  whilst maintaining a 31.25% shareholding in affiliate  CoolCo.FLNG operations and commodity hedges: FLNG Hilli maintained its unbroken 4-year record of 100% uptime during the quarter and started to produce its incremental 0.2mtpa of production  increasing scheduled production volume from 1.2mtpa to 1.4mtpa. The incremental 0.2mtpa that has a tariff linked to Dutch Title Transfer Facility (""TTF"") gas prices contributed $22.6 million of incremental proceeds net of commodity swaps to Golar during Q1. The Brent oil linked component of the tariff contributed $15.6 million  bringing Golar‚Äôs pro-rata share of gross proceeds from Hilli for the quarter to $64.0 million. Golar's share of the TTF linked gross proceeds is expected to be $19.0 million in Q2 (fully hedged)  $19.0 million in Q3 2022 (fully hedged) and $20.0 million in Q4 2022 (open). Estimated Q4 2022 TTF linked gross proceeds are based on a TTF spot price of $26.90/mmbtu and can be expected to increase (or decrease) by $0.8 million for each $1.00/MMBtu change in the TTF forward price. Hilli's earnings could increase further from 2023 until the end of the contract if the customer exercises a one-time 0.4mtpa TTF-linked option that expires on July 31  2022.Story continuesFLNG Gimi construction: Conversion of FLNG Gimi for its 20-year contract with BP scheduled to commence in Q4 2023 is 83% technically complete. Once delivered  Gimi is expected to unlock around $3.0 billion of earnings backlog1 to Golar  equivalent to $151 million in annual Adjusted EBITDA1. The commercial start-up of FLNG Gimi together with the commodity linked production from FLNG Hilli could result in Golar's share of annual Adjusted EBITDA1 generation from Hilli and Gimi exceeding $400.0 million within 3-years  a quadrupling of 2021 FLNG related earnings.FLNG business development: We are in detailed discussions with existing and prospective clients for new FLNG projects. Some of these projects would offer direct access to gas molecules or allow for a commodity linked earnings component  whilst others are on a tolling basis. Based on envisioned funding and ownership structures we expect that our Total Golar Cash and Listed Securities1 position could fund two FLNG growth projects.FSRU: On May 18  2022  Italian energy infrastructure company Snam and Golar signed a contract that will see Golar convert the last of its trading steam turbine LNG carriers  Golar Arctic  into a FSRU for delivery to Snam at a port in Sardinia  Italy. After conversion  acceptance and repayment of any vessel related debt  the FSRU will be sold to the Snam Group for 269 million Euros ($288 million). Initiation of activities including procurement of long lead items for the conversion is subject to Snam‚Äôs issuance of a Notice-to-Proceed. Once received  the process of conversion and sale is expected to take up to two years  with the vessel being required in a yard for around 9-months. Prior to entering the yard the Golar Arctic will continue to be traded by Golar as an LNG carrier. The estimated conversion cost is approximately $160 million due to the high specification of equipment required and inflationary market conditions.Developments in Europe have created an urgent need for more floating LNG terminals. Golar has received multiple approaches from European governments and utility companies for its modern high-spec FSRU Golar Tundra.Financial Summary(in thousands of $) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 % Change Q4 2021 % Change Net income attributable to Golar LNG Ltd 345 182 25 364 1261% 8 009 4210% Total operating revenues 79 688 77 456 3% 72 414 10% Adjusted EBITDA1 93 446 41 885 123% 59 957 56% Golar's share of contractual debt 1 1 743 747 2 170 987 (20)% 2 239 496 (22)%Q1 highlights and recent eventsFinancial and corporate:Profitability: Net income attributable to Golar of $345.2 million for the quarter  including: A $344.0 million non-cash mark-to-market gain recognized on NFE shares based on a March 31  2022 carrying value of $42.61 per share.

Q1 results associated with the 8 TFDE vessels and the Cool Pool Limited sold to CoolCo and the management companies still to be sold have been reclassified to Discontinued operations with Q1 2021 and Q4 2021 (""Q4"") numbers adjusted on a retrospective basis for comparison in the discussion of material movements below.Quarterly amortization of the day one gain recognized in respect of the incremental TTF linked production from FLNG Hilli contributed to the $7.3 million increase in Total operating revenues which increased from $72.4 million in Q4 to $79.7 million in Q1. Fees for the additional TTF linked production are accounted for within Realized and unrealized gains/losses on oil and gas derivative instruments. Revenue from shipping (Golar Arctic and Golar Tundra)  net of voyage  charter hire and commission expenses was $7.7 million and decreased by $0.6 million from $8.3 million in Q4.Vessel operating expenses increased  from $13.9 million in Q4 to $19.5 million in Q1  Q4 costs having been suppressed by a $5.4 million insurance recovery.The Brent oil linked component of Hilli's fees generates additional annual operating cash flows of approximately $3.1 million for every dollar increase in Brent Crude prices between $60.00 per barrel and the contractual ceiling. Billing of this component is based on a three-month look-back at average Brent Crude prices. As a result of rising prices  a $17.5 million realized gain on the oil derivative instrument was recorded in Q1  up from the $12.9 million realized in Q4. Golar has an effective 89.1% interest in these earnings. A realized gain of $26.2 million was also recognized in respect of fees for the additional TTF linked production that commenced in Q1. Golar has an effective 86.3% interest in these earnings. Offsetting this was a $1.1 million realized loss (100% attributable to Golar) on the hedged component of the quarter's TTF linked earnings. Collectively a $42.6 million realized gain on oil and gas derivative instruments was recognized as a result.The mark-to-market fair value of the Hilli Brent oil linked derivative asset increased by $169.6 million during the quarter  with a corresponding unrealized gain of the same amount recognized in the income statement. The fair value increase was driven by an upward movement in the expected future market price for Brent oil. Similarly  the mark-to-market fair value of the Hilli TTF natural gas derivative asset increased by $24.1 million during the quarter with a corresponding unrealized gain of the same amount recognized in the income statement  also driven by an upward movement in expected future TTF prices. Offsetting the unrealized TTF gain is a $25.7 million unrealized loss in respect of the hedged portion of Q2 and Q3 2022 TTF linked Hilli production. Collectively this therefore resulted in a $168.1 million Q1 unrealized gain on oil and gas derivative instruments.Of the $3.9 million Other operating income in Q1  $3.6 million was recognized in respect of LNG production over and above the quarter's pro-rata share of 1.4mt of full year 2022 contracted production.An increase in the NFE share price between January 1 and March 31 resulted in the recognition of a Q1 unrealized mark-to-market gain of $344.0 million on Golar‚Äôs 18.6 million NFE shares in Other non-operating income. The fair value of these shares was $42.61 per share as of March 31  2022. Together with $1.9 million of dividend income from NFE and a foreign exchange gain on the final tax settlement with the UK tax authorities relative to the foreign exchange rate used when recognizing the liability at December 31  2021  this collectively contributed to $350.2 million of Other non-operating income during the quarter.Balance Sheet and Liquidity:As of March 31  2022 Golar had $209.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $135.9 million of restricted cash. Restricted cash includes $16.3 million relating to the Hilli lessor-owned VIE. Total Golar cash1 position therefore amounts to $328.6 million. As of March 31  2022  $131.0 million had been drawn down against the Corporate RCF of $200 million  secured by our stake in NFE. On April 6  2022 Golar sold 6.2 million NFE shares raising net proceeds of $253 million and on May 10  2022 the $131.0 million Corporate RCF was repaid. The full $200 million undrawn Corporate RCF continues to be available for future drawdown and is now secured by Golar's remaining 12.4 million NFE shares. On February 11  2022 Golar also entered into a $250.0 million bilateral corporate facility secured by the Company's equity stakes in FLNG Hilli and Gimi. Undrawn as of March 31  2022 and to the current date  this facility remains available until June 30  2022.Expected FLNG funding sources USD Million March 31  2022 Total Golar Cash1 329 April 2022: Net proceeds from sale of 6.2m NFE shares 253 April 2022: Final settlement of legacy UK tax dispute (66) May 2022: Repayment of outstanding balance of Corporate RCF (131) Q2 2022 Balance of proceeds expected from CoolCo spin-off 33 Undrawn balance of $200m Corporate RCF (up to) 200 Undrawn $250m Corporate bilateral facility currently available until 30 June  2022 (up to) 250 Potential near-term funding sources 868 Listed Securities1: NFE  Avenir  and CoolCo shares(3) 719 Net of Corporate RCF secured by NFE investment (200) Forecast Total Golar Cash and Listed Securities1 (available for future FLNG investment) 1 387(3) Based on market value as of May 25  2022 for NFE and CoolCo and book value of Avenir as of March 31  2022.Inclusive of $10.6 million of capitalized interest  $82.4 million was invested in FLNG Gimi during the quarter  increasing the total Gimi Asset under development balance as at March 31  2022 to $960.3 million. Of this  $485.0 million had been drawn against the $700 million debt facility. Both the investment and debt drawn to date are reported on a 100% basis. Golar's share of remaining capital expenditure  net of the Company's share of remaining undrawn debt amounts to $213.0 million. Subsequent to the quarter end  a further $50.0 million has been drawn against the $700 million facility.Included within the $517.0 million current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt as at March 31  2022 is $370.9 million in respect of the Hilli lessor-owned VIE subsidiary that Golar is required to consolidate. The Current assets held for sale and Current liabilities held of sale of $644.1 million and $383.7 million respectively in Q1 include the remaining four TFDE vessels and The Cool Pool Limited sold in April 2022 and the management companies yet to be sold to CoolCo but contemplated to complete in Q2. After sale of the remaining four TFDE vessels  The Cool Pool Limited and the management companies  Golar's Q2 equity method investments will increase by approximately $62.5 million.Of Golar's $1.7 billion share of Contractual debt1 as of March 31  2022  $0.5 billion relates to the 4 TFDE vessels sold in April 2022  leaving $1.2 billion. Net of Total Golar cash of $0.3 billion  Net Debt1 therefore falls to around $0.9 billion. If Listed Securities1 are taken into account  this figure reduces to $0.2 billion. Assuming current commodity prices prevail  Golar's share of 2022 Adjusted EBITDA1 remains on track to reach $200.0 million. This could increase further in 2023 if the customer exercises their option to increase Hilli production to up to 1.6mtpa  and should exceed $400.0 million after the first full year of Gimi operations  expected in 2024. Offering strong debt coverage  near-term earnings power and meaningful growth potential that can be financed  the simplified Golar is well positioned for new FLNG projects.Corporate and Other Matters:As at March 31  2022  Golar had 108.0 million shares issued and outstanding post the repurchase and subsequent cancellation of 368 496 shares during the quarter. There were also 1.1 million outstanding stock options with an average price of $15.63 and 0.2 million unvested restricted stock units awarded. Of the initial $50.0 million approved share buyback scheme  $19.0 million remains available for further repurchases which will continue to be opportunistically pursued.On May 11  2022 Golar invested $2.4 million in Aqualung Carbon Capture  an Oslo-based technology company that has developed and achieved proof of concept for a CO2 capture and separation membrane technology. Subject to the successful completion of a commercial pilot project with an industrial user  the technology could be used in future FLNG projects  enabling Golar to offer interested customers the opportunity to further reduce emissions from our already low carbon footprint FLNG solutions. Golar has a 4.6% interest and a board seat in this company.Non-GAAP measuresIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP)  this earnings release and the associated investor presentation contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today  Karl Staubo  CEO. Please go ahead.Karl StauboThank you  and welcome to Golar LNG's Q1 earnings results presentation. Thank you for taking time to dial in. My name is Karl Fredrik Staubo  CEO of Golar LNG. Before we get into the presentation  please note the forward-looking statements on Slide 2. I am accompanied today by our CFO  Mr. Eduardo Maranhao to present this quarter's results.On Slide 4  we have outlined the company overview. Golar today owns two FLNGs  the Golar Hilli in operation in Cameroon  and the Golar Gimi under construction to start to 20 year contract with BP from Q4 of next year.Furthermore  we own an LNG steam carrier  the Golar Arctic  where we announced last week that we have agreed with Snam to forward sell the ship as a converted FSRU. Lastly  we own the Golar Tundra  the most modern promptly available FSRU globally  currently operating FLNG carrier.We have developed three FLNG designs that form the basis for our growth. All three designs are based on the same proven liquefaction technology  and we will highlight some of the key characteristics of the different capacities of the units later in the presentation.Other result of significant corporate transactions over the last 12 months we have three listed shareholdings. We own 6% of New Fortress Energy valued at $558 million on yesterday's close. We own about 31% of Cool Company Limited  the shipping spin-off we established during Q1 of this year. We own around 24% of Avenir LNG  a small scale LNG shipping and terminal business. And the total value of these investments amount to approximately $720 million.Golar celebrates its 75th year of operation this year  50 of which we've been actively involved with LNG maritime infrastructure assets. Golar has through its history pioneered some of the key developments in the sector  including the industry's first FSRU  the first FLNG  as well as the first ever integrated FSRU to power plants project.We have a market leading operations and have achieved 100% commercial uptime since the start-up of Hilli in 2018. We're now focusing these companies for FLNG growth opportunities.Turning to Slide 5  and again as a result of the M&A activities over the last 12 months with a total enterprise value of $6.2 billion at the time of sales  we have significantly strengthened our balance sheets. We currently have $1.4 billion of cash and listed securities. We're abouthalf cash and half is listed securities. We currently have a net cash position. Adjusting for the remaining CapEx on the FLNG Gimi  we have a total net debt position after delivery of Gimi of $300 million. That number excludes operating profits between now and Gimi delivery  so we anticipate that that number will be lower.Based on increased capacity utilization of Hilli  commodity upside on the tolling fee and startup of Gimi in Q4 of next year  we expect EBITDA generation to quadruple in 2024 versus 2021 levels. We've also refinanced corporate facilities and we currently have no debt maturities until 2025.I'll now hand the call over to Eduardo to present for Q1 results.Eduardo MaranhaoThanks Karl  and good morning  everybody. I'm very pleased to provide an update on our group results for the first quarter of 2022. So turning over to Slide Number 7  I wanted to show some of the highlights of this quarter.Starting with our FLNG units. Our first vessel  Hilli  continues to operate with a very solid performance  delivering 100% uptime. The Brent linked kicker in our contract generated an incremental EBITDA of $16 million this quarter  or 36% up when compared to Q4 last year.Since 1st of January  we've started to realize our TTF linked production from FLNG Hilli  which added an incremental EBITDA of $22 million. I will explain those different elements in more details further in this presentation.Construction of our second FLNG unit  the Gimi  continuous in Singapore  and is now 83% technically complete. We continue to make substantial progress on commercial discussions for future FLNG units  and we have a strong pipeline of opportunities for growth projects.So moving on to shipping in FSRUs  the formation of Cool Company was successfully completed this quarter. We've raised $275 million in a private placement in January  followed by the listing of its shares in the Euronext exchange in Oslo. In connection with that  Cool Company acquired eight of our TFDE vessels. In May  we announced the award of EUR269 million contract which Snam for the conversion of the Golar Arctic into an FSRU.Due to the current geopolitical situation in Europe  we continue to see a very active FSRU market and have received inquiries from multiple European counterparts for the deployment of our last unit to Golar Tundra. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and since the start of this year  we have released $470 million in cash proceeds from the Cool Company spin-off and also the sale of a portion of our NFE stake.In February  we have repaid $317 million of our outstanding convertible bonds  and then also entered into a new bilateral corporate facility of $250 million. We've continued our share buyback program  and so far we have repurchased 400 -- approximately 400 000 shares this quarter  leaving 108 million shares after debt outstanding.So moving on to Slide Number 8  this quarter we recorded an adjusted EBITDA of $93 million. This result is inclusive of Hilli  Arctic and Tundra  but excludes the 8 TFDE vessels that were sold to Cool Company. When compared on a like for like basis to the previous quarter  this represented an increase of 55%.Net income attributable to Golar was $345 million in this quarter  and that includes $168 million noncash gain  which was recognized on our Hilli Brent oil and TTF linked derivative and also a $344 million also noncash market to market gain recognized on our NFE shares based on March 31st position which carry the value of $42.61 per share.Our share of contractual debt at the end of the quarter stood at $1.7 billion. However  $0.5 billion of debt relates to 4 TFDE vessels that were sold to Cool Company in April. So that leaves us with a $1.2 billion of contractual debt post the completion of the eight vessels sale. Total cash at the end of Q1 was $329 million.When we consider the various subsequent events that took place since the end of the quarter  including for example  the $253 million of sale beneficiaries  our total cash position including access to revolving credit facilities stood at around $870 million. Further to that  when we take into account the value of our listed securities in NFE. Cool Company and Avenir  we have a liquidity position of just close to $1.4 billion. We estimate that this amount could allow us to fund two new FLNG growth projects.Moving on to Slide number 10  I wanted to provide a bit more color on the breakdown of our share of the distributable earnings from Hilli. As a result of the higher brand and TTF prices  our share of Hilli‚Äôs EBITDA almost doubled from the previous quarter  reaching $57 million in Q1 of 2022. Interesting to note that  this increase of almost 3.5 times when compared to Q1 of 2021  came at no additional CapEx to Golar. While the base tariff stood in line with the previous quarters  we recorded an incremental $16 million from Brent linked revenues and close to $23 million from TTF linked earnings  already net of the interest disruption we have entered.When we assumed forward commodity prices  our share of the 2022 adjusted EBITDA from Hilli remains on track to reach around $245 million in 2022.I will now hand over to Karl who can talk a bit more about debt forward looking.Karl StauboThank you  Eduardo. Turning to Slide 11 which elaborates on the embedded upside on the commodity exposure of Hilli's tariff. As you can see during 2021 Golar pro rata share of Hilli's EBITDA was $99 million. This is expected to grow by 2.5 times for 2022 on the back of higher Brent linked earnings where Golar generates $2.7 million of EBITDA for every dollar Brent is above 60. This is expected to generate about $91 million of EBITDA for 2022.Furthermore  the startup of the incremental 0.2 million tons of TTF linked production that commenced in January other than other $22.6 million in Golar share of Hilli Q1 EBITDA. For the full year  the TTF linked production is expected to add $81 million in incremental revenue where the TTF gas price exposure for Q2 and Q3 has been hedged at $25.38 per MMBtu. We remain open for Q4 TTF gas price exposure.Perenco  the charter of the unit has a onetime three year option to declare up to 0.4 million tons of increased production from 2023 until end of the contract in July 26 on the same TTF linked tariff as the current 0.2 produced this year. The option is declarable within end of July  and we see it as increasingly likely that Perenco will take up the option on the back of strong gas prices  but subject to the final outcome of the drilling program to tie in more reserves to Hilli.We do not expect Perenco to take up the option until closer to expiry of the option in July. The commodity exposure on Hilli enables as an FLNG provider to charge significantly higher tolling fees for traditional long-term tolling arrangements. As you can see from the boxes on the slide  the effective tolling fee for Hilli during 2021 was $3 per MMBtu. This has increased to an effective tolling fee of $13 per MMBtu during 2022. Hence the commodity exposure of our FLNG contracts  both existing and the ones we will target going forward  we see an extremely compelling risk reward. And we will continue to target similar type of structures.Turning to Slide 12 and an update on the construction of the FLNG Gimi  which is now 83% technically complete for conversion at Keppel Shipyard in Singapore. We have currently worked over 19 million man hours on the conversion. The reminder of the build is mainly around construction  installation and testing of equipment ahead of her 2023 sail-away and Q4 ‚Äò23 startup. In light of the recent resurgence of COVID in certain parts of Asia  we continue to closely monitor and take precautions for any potential COVID impacts for the 3 500 workers on site. We currently have no material impact on site and again this is the situation we are monitoring closely and we feel comfortable with the situation where it stands today.Turning to Slide 13 and as promised earlier in the presentation elaborating on the different FLNG designs we have available. We have developed three different designs all based on a generic design  meaning that they will not be tailor made to a specific field  both can be redeployed or interchanged  increasing operational flexibility and reducing residual value risk. They're also based on the same proven liquefaction topside and an extension of Golar‚Äôs proven operational track record.The Mark I has a liquefaction capacity of up to 2.7 million tons a year and it's suitable for stranded and associated gas resources. Both Hilli and Gimi are Mark I design FLNGs and are based on conversion of existing LNG must carriers. The Golar Tundra remains a Golar owned conversion candidate for potential future incremental Mark I units.The Mark II design is also a conversion of an existing LNG carrier into an FLNG. However  instead of adding liquefaction equipment to the width of the ship  Mark II places the liquefactiontopside on a new ship midsection added to an existing carrier. This allows for larger liquefaction capacities of up to 3.5 million tons and reduces the conversion construction time. Hence  this is a first direct solution for somewhat larger production projects than for Mark I.Lastly  our Mark III new build design is one we have worked to develop for more than a decade. Mark III has a liquefaction capacity of up to 5 million tons and is competitive also to larger shore-based liquefaction solutions. The lower CapEx per ton and lower carbon footprint even compared to land based solutions make the Mark III more economical faster to deploy liquefaction solution for large liquefaction projects globally.The new build hull also allows for increased storage and leg space. So our primary focus going forward is to develop projects that suit one of these three design alternatives.On page 14  we outlined why we mainly focus on floating African LNG projects when we look at our growth pipeline. When considering FLNG growth project  there are three key input factors that drive the delivery cost for LNG. Those are source gas  liquefaction costs  and lastly the shipping distance or shipping costs from production side to the end user.We believe that you can develop a stable source gas price of between $1 to $3 per MMBtu dependent on the size of the field in question if you target African gas. This compares to current spot prices for Henry Hub source gas in the U.S. where most of incremental liquefaction projects are planned of around $9 per MMBtu today.Secondly  as we are building a fit for purpose efficient liquefaction design in Asia  Golar's CapEx per ton compared to other floating or shore-based liquefaction solutions is very competitive.Lastly  African gas from a geographical point of view has a shorter sailing distance to end users whether they are in Europe or in Asia compared to U.S. liquefaction projects. Hence  if you have a lower input cost  a lower CapEx per ton and a shorter shipping distance  you should have a compelling competitive advantage when looking at the economics of incremental growth projects.Elaborating on that on Slide 15  again  this is a familiar slide that we have presented earlier occasions. But it gives a strong picture of the LNG value chain and the economics of an FLNG project. With source gas in Africa at around $1 per MMBtu  liquefaction cost on a tolling fee basis similar to what we charge BP on the Gimi of between $2 to $3 per MMBtu and shipping cost of around $1.50  African FLNG projects can today deliver LNG to end users for about $5 per MMBtu.If you compare that to current gas prices  these projects have a repayment of less than one year in the current market environment. This backdrop drives our FLNG project pipeline for potential charters and also explain why Golar is focused on projects where we can get exposure to commodity prices  driving the effective tolling fees significantly higher than for long-term tolling fees  as proven by their FLNG Gimi.This business model doesn't only work in a high gas price environment. On the right hand side  we have highlighted the $5 MMBtu of landed LNG price versus historical LNG prices. This business model makes money in most historical LNG price scenarios. However  we are strong believers that the energy and gas prices the next 10 years will be significantly higher than the previous 10 years  and hence FLNG should be an even better business going forward than what we have seen historically.In terms of illustrative economics  a tolling fee based on a large Mark III 5 million pounds FLNG units and a $3 tolling fee  we can generate an EBITDA of such a unit of around $750 million a year versus a CapEx of around 2.5 billion for such a large unit. Integrated projects however  using a 2.5 million ton Mark I design as an example and the landed gas price of $25 per MMBtu  in current gas price environment that would create an annual EBITDA of $2.5 billion to the project owners that we would target to be split between the upstream provider and the FLNG owner. So whether you go integrated or tolling  it's an attractive business. But if you believe as we do that  we will see higher energy prices you want to focus on integrated exposures.Turning the intention to FSRUs and the development that we have seen in Europe year-to-date. We have highlighted how the FSRU market has significantly changed on Slide 17. Entering into 2022  Europe has a total of 32 import facilities where 29 are land based and three are FSRUs.Year-to-date  we have seen 22 potential FSRU project surfacing where eight has already secured an FSRU and 14 remains on the planning stage. This compares to a global FSRU fleet of 46 units and an estimated availability of another three to five units in total between now and 2025. So the way we see it  it's three to five units available to service up to 14 incrementally planned FSRU project. We at Golar have received strong interest from several European countries for our open modern FSRU  the Golar Tundra.Turning to Slide 18  you can see that the gas price fundamentals keep on strengthening and keep on providing length. Starting on the far left  you can see the forward prices in May last year  in January this year and the 28th of May. The point being as one thing is that the front month is constantly lifting  but we're encouraged to see the future gas price also lifting providing further visibility for potential FLNG charters.On the mid side  you can see the expected liquefaction projects to come on between now and 2028. These are essentially pre -- I would call it pre-Ukraine Russia situation liquefaction projects  and this will seem to be needed to meet a balanced LNG market going forward.On the far right  we've taken some statistics to show how meaningful the impact of the Ukraine Russian situation may be on the need for liquefaction going forward.The global LNG market was last year 400 million tons. Russian pipeline gas exports to Europe was last year about 115 million tons  over 25% of the global LNG market. Hence  if European countries are to make really their ambitions to replace Russian gas with international LNG  we need to see a significant ramp up not only of re-gas terminals which key focus is on right now but gas sourcing. Keep in mind that the gas price in December was significantly higher than what it is today  even in the midst of the current situation. So this is a fundamentally tight market pre geopolitical shocks that after we expect it to be significantly stronger for longer.Turning to Slide 19 and a bit further background on last week's announced forward sale of the Golar Arctic. Golar Arctic is the only remaining steam LNG carrier in our fleet  by a long mile  the less competitive assets we have in our fleet. We entered into an agreement with Snam  where they will pursue a development of a virtual pipeline into Sardina. Snam is listed and has a market cap of around EUR18.7 billion.The transaction is a forward sale of the Arctic at ‚Ç¨269 million payable in installments as defined milestones. Our estimated conversion CapEx is $160 million  excluding contingencies and vessel costs. Hence  we think that by doing this measure  we have significantly high graded the value of the ship. We found a long-term use for a steam carrier. And we leverage on the learning effects we did from a recent and similar conversion of the Golar Viking which was sold to LNG Croatia.Turning to corporate and Slide 21  Golar recently announced our 2021 ESG report now available on our website. We continue a very strong safety record. We improved lost time injuries. We high grade our AER data  and we're proud to say that throughout the pandemic  we have maintained a very high retention. We have more than 70% of cadets still employed with us  and for senior officers we have a retention of more than 94%. Not only is that important to keep high quality of operations  it's also important to cater for future growth  especially in light of the LNG and new buildings coming on stream going forward.Turning to Slide 22 highlighting the earnings potential from our existing asset portfolio. Last 12 months we made $148 million of EBITDA. And to that the contractual EBITDA of Gimi starting in Q4 of next year and the commodity upside on the commodity link production from Hilli  we expect our run rate EBITDA to be more than $400 million from 2024 onwards.Hence  on a fully delivered basis  we trade up an EBITDA of just shy of seven times with capacity to help at least another two FLNG growth projects just from our current balance sheet position.To summarize on Slide 23  we are a leading owner and operator of pioneering maritime LNG infrastructure  we expect our EBITDA to quadruple in 2024 versus 2021 levels. We have cash and listed securities of 1.4 billion and net -- fully delivered net debt of less than $300 million. We have a book value of -- standing currently at $2.54 billion. And we are very focused on our FLNG growth pipeline going forward.That concludes our Q1 presentation. And I'll now hand it over to the operator for questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Chris Tsung from Weber Research.Chris TsungCan you provide some color on the decision for Snam to convert to Arctic? Was it based on price or timing deployment or price preference by Golar Tundra between any of the two vessels?Karl StauboThis is a project that we have developed with plan over a long time  it predates the geopolitical situation in Europe. I think the backdrop for their decision is the success of the LNG Croatia and the capacity needs in Sardinia and that this would be a cheaper alternative than to buy more modern tonnage for that specific project.Chris TsungI see. And just a follow-up for that. Can we think of the difference between the sale price at EUR269 million and the conversion costs for change? Is that the vessel sales price  is that the right way to think of it?Karl StauboSorry  you're breaking up a bit  is that the difference between?Chris TsungThe EUR269 million and the conversion costs  is that effectively the vessel sale price?Karl StauboThat's of course one way you can put the two  if you take the difference between the deal and net of outstanding debt of around $30 million  you get to the equity balance ownership.Chris TsungAnd just one last quick one  just -- of the three designs to Mark I  II and III  which one could we deployed the fastest?Karl StauboWe're currently working on projects on a tolling fee basis for Mark III  I'm going to integrate the basis where we are balancing the decision between Mark I and II. So it's difficult to say which one comes first  currently  it's tempting to say Mark I or IIOperatorNext question comes from the line of Sean Morgan from Evercore.Sean MorganHey  Karl and Eduardo. Question on the potential conversions and new FLNG. As you said that  net cash balance is obviously -- net debt balance is actually quite low. So you could potentially finance these out of cash. Would you want to do that or would you look at a more balanced approach to incorporate more debt? Or do you kind of look at potential expansion of FLNGs as a way to sort of deleverage as you grow?Karl StauboI think first and foremost  we have cash investment security of $1.4 billion on the company's free cash flow positive every quarter going forward based on the current performance of the group. So that means that all that money can be deployed to growth and around half of it is already in cash form. So I think we can fund one FLNG project just out of available cash the way we see it right now  and should we get more than one FLNG project  we could look up the list and securities position or reliever on Hilli and Gimi which on average has very low leverage at the moment.Sean MorganAnd then another question we get a lot  it's sort of difficult to gauge is in terms of counterparties  off the coast of Africa. And you talked about the low price to extract the gas reserves from that region  but when you think about contracting a new FLNG  do you go to sort of the nation state that controls the oil field or is there like a series of EMP partners that you would kind of be negotiating with first? And how's that process work in terms of converting an idea into an actual FLNG project?Karl StauboIf you think about it  we've worked for BP -- well  we're about to start to work for BP in Africa. We are working for Perenco in Africa. So on both of those that explains to you who the counterparts are  in that context  it's BP and Perenco and they are the ones interfacing with the local government. And to some extent  they're a good representation of the different sort of opportunity sets  one of them on a fixed tolling fees to a solid counterpart for a long time  and one of them with more commodity exposure.So the way we're working this is mainly with partners with a significant presence in country. But it also explains some of the reasoning why it's a bit difficult from consequent to guide on exact findings of when projects will be sanctioned. Because we can want to have done it yesterday and so can the charter  but you're reliant on governmental with all this environmental sign-offs and upstream to be in place. And that's really what's driving the timeline more than the interest from either us or the charter.Sean MorganAnd so beyond your two existing counterparties  though  is there like five to six other EMPs that are working in that region or is it more limited scope of potential partners?Karl StauboThat's a fair statement that you have several other guys operating in that area  [Indiscernible] really look them proven and associated gas reserves and in this market not to waste the resource.OperatorNext question comes from the line of Ben Nolan from Stifel.Ben NolanSo I guess I'll start again on the FLNG side  there's been -- you guys have been working on this for a while. And maybe could you just characterize what the conversations are like today with your customers versus maybe a year ago? There's obviously been some thought that there will be some positive developments  but there haven't been any major incremental ones in last number of years. So how do you think now is different  I guess  is the question.Karl StauboI think what's happened  this is mainly currently a driver of the gas development  and the fact that the gas price -- gas market is tight. You just see the amount of interest when the gas price is high the economics for this project is significantly better  and that's what drove the incremental increase in interest  the first six -- well  up until the Russia-Ukraine situation. After the Russia-Ukraine situation  you've seen first  a massive scramble from Europe to secure FSRUs. Now  they're slowly moving into the LNG carrier market and you can see term rates almost being the below that was operate  even as we enter into the soft part of the air  because Europe is scrambling to secure energy security.And then  ultimately  they now understand that the market was tight. They have created import terminals  but they haven't got their hands on the hydrocarbon. So you now see a lot of these countries leading the way. You've seen the likes of Germany first go to Qatar  then to U.S.  and yesterday  they announced that they think that African gas is a significant part of European -- Europe's energy solution. So that's coming and with the European countries  you can more easily secure offtake and financing than you could pre the Russia-Ukraine situation.Ben NolanSo the people seem to be more serious  is that sort of the takeaway here?Karl StauboThe economics are better  and the financing and offtake are more available than ever?Ben NolanAnd then for my second question  I might slip in a twofer on this one. But so you talk primarily about Africa  and you gave the illustrations about Africa  although in the past  you guys have talked about other regions like the Middle East and Mediterranean  different other places. Are those still on the table first of all  or are they substantially behind? And then for part number two  you talk about two  being able to fund two incremental units  but Mark III  the cost is substantially different than a Mark I. So is that assuming like one Mark III and one Mark I or how should we think about how you're thinking about two units?Karl StauboFirst part of the question is yes  it's also other geographies than just Africa. So that's why we say mainly African gas  because we see the attractions of the input and the distance. But there are other areas  for example  in the Middle East where the gas is essentially free. So that's obviously still part of the project and the considerations or development. But we are focused mainly on African  but there are other projects as well both in the Middle East and elsewhere.Sorry  the second part of your question.Ben NolanHow to think about when you say you can internally fund two projects  Mark I versus Mark II or a combination?Karl StauboIf you take the CapEx on these  you have -- of course  you can source that funding. So if you take the example of Hilli  for example  we have -- when we built our home  it was a $1.4 billion CapEx and we have $960 million of debt available. So that's call it  $500 million equity check  and with a $1.4 billion cash investment securities balance and the free cash flow to equity positive operation  we can fund it through balance sheet.When it comes to the larger assets  you can typically get yard financing which you can look at -- easily get for conversion.Ben NolanSo when you talk about self-funding two of these it's one of each  is that how to think about it?Karl StauboWe will take the project that we think makes the best economics  if that's two Mark IIs or one Mark III and a Mark I  remains to be seen when we announced the project.Ben NolanBut just two in general  that's the capacity is the takeaway. Okay.Karl StauboWe can comfortably fund two from the current balance sheet  and the rest is a timing thing. So you'll -- we generate cash flow pretty much every day. So it depends on the timing or when further units beyond those two  but I think if we double the FLNG fleet  we can look at our situation at that point. But for now  the focus is on getting to the next two.OperatorNext question comes from the line of [Craig Lewis]. Please announce your company name.Unidentified AnalystKarl  I was hoping you could comment a little bit on the ongoing drilling campaign you highlighted in the press release and the well past thing that's going on in West Africa. And really what I'm curious about and maybe it's a little bit of both is  is the driver or the customers doing those drilling campaigns? Is that going to potentially lead to more volumes for the Hilli or is it potentially going to lead to maybe an extension on the Hilli in -- with Perenco?Karl StauboThat's a good question and it's kind of yes to both. So the primary purpose of the drilling campaign we understand is to tie in more proven reserves  so that you increase the gas flow and enable the 0.4 million in increased production. But we have very clearly publicly stated  both to the market and of course to Perenco  and SNH  the governmental body [indiscernible] is that we will not enter into extension discussions until they declare that point four  because currently  we of course  have paid for equipment that‚Äôs not fully utilized and every incremental production is straight through to net income or free cash flow to equity utilized. And we don't want to be working on any extensions until we better utilize the equipment already in place.But you know  it can show gaps that could lead to an extension discussions as well. But for us  it's sort of  you have to tackle one obstacle at a time and for us  it's the increased production of the key driver on Hilli right now.Unidentified AnalystAnd then realizing that we were selling the steam  the Arctic  obviously  you're highlighting the Tundra and the opportunities for the Tundra. I guess a two part question there. One is  as we think about the path forward for the Tundra  is that more around an asset sale? Or could we potentially just see that be contracted and remain a core part of the fleet? And just piggybacking on that question  are there opportunities for Golar to expand its FSRU footprint?Karl StauboSo to the first part of your question. At the beginning of this year  there were several FSRU projects being worked  none of them in Europe. I think with both happened in the geopolitical situation  as we tried to highlight on the slide  the incremental increase in new FSRU projects out of Europe is unprecedented. And on the balance  we are very confident that unit will end up in Europe and not elsewhere.If you look at what's communicated by the various governments in Europe  some of them are targeting and chartering opportunities  and some of them are targeting acquisition of units. I think  for us  we remain agnostic whether we sell or charter  we will do what we think caters for the best risk adjusted economics. And that's our target and with the amount of interest and the specification of Tundra  we feel very comfortable about that situation.When it comes to the second part of your question  what we want to focus on going forward is FLNG project  because we think we have a unique competitive edge. And we still think that the economics of FLNG projects is the most compelling in the LNG value chain  at least for the next decade or so. However  we have no non-compete with any of the corporate transactions  but we have come to that over the last 12 months. And should there be an attractive FSRU project coming up  there's no reason why we should not take it on. However  I would highlight that our focus is FLNG growth  but we remain open to anyone who wants to talk to us or any attractive LNG infrastructure business.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.Craig ShereSo besides the gander that you already have  how do you see availability of vessels for acquisition for additional Mark I or Mark II conversions? And do you have any thoughts about timing and announcement of a full 2.4 MTPA deployment of the Hilli post your mid 2026 [Franco] contract expiration?Karl StauboSo  when you talk about source vessels for Mark I or Mark II  those will most likely be based on the most design carrier  so the one with a bolt on top. Those carriers are mainly steam carriers that will face significant operational challenges due to the new environmental regulations from first of January  so basically the new EEXI and CII regulations. Hence  these ships will be less suitable for -- to operate as LNG carriers and more suitable for floating storage jobs or as conversion candidates  whether for FSRU or FLNG.Because of the amount of those ships that will become less competitive for shipping and therefore need to find alternative works with a limited amount of companies with a track record of successfully redeploying or re-characterizing those types of ships  we're confident that there will be vessels available for conversion candidates.To the second part of your question when it comes to Hilli  I think we always try to do A before we do B before we do C and so forth. And for us  the next step on Hilli is to secure the 0.4 million tons in July of this year. After that  I think it's for sure in depending on Cameroon's government to try to find solutions to keep that unit in concrete. For both of them  this has been a massive economical success. And we think both of them have an interest in keeping the unit in country.On the other hand  I think the operational track record and the fact that the unit has no construction risks  and lastly that is very soon  the quickest FLNG you can get your hands on internationally  we think that in this gas price environment her attractiveness for potential work outside of Cameroon is increasingly attracted by the day. So to try to give some guidance on when we think we have development there  we would say it's hard to -- probably up to 12 months after the 0.4 or so  by summer next year or so  in that time period.Craig ShereAnd one last question on FLNG negotiations for new projects. I think we all understand that the upstream producers are your counterparties. But how many upstream producers have -- in Africa have set in stone relationships as far as royalties  profit sharing  what have you with the host governments? And to the degree  there's a major upsizing of a play with say  your FLNG that that reopen these things and make very complicated discussions where obviously the host governments want to get as much value from the current market as possible?Karl StauboThat's an extremely qualified question. And I think you're touching upon parts of the core of why the reason some of these projects  it's a bit difficult to guide on exactly when they will happen. I think it's fair to say that neither us nor any upstream partners would enter into such projects without very clear agreement with host governments on these specific points that we touched on  like the agreements on how things should be shared  flexibility and so forth. This is basically the key gating item in terms of timeline for the new FIDs. The flip side of the argument is that these are stranded gas reserves that are proven  and no one has the technology to monetize those fields. That's what we cater for. Today  we don't see anyone else doing FLNG or floating liquefaction as a service. We have a very proven track record of this. So therefore  I think we are the solution in terms of monetizing the unit. And it's a matter of finding a fair framework that works for the government  the upstream partner and for us.OperatorNext question comes from the line of Chris Robertson from Jefferies.Chris RobertsonOn the NFE shares  how are you guys thinking about those in terms -- are you just wanting to hold them until you need to monetize ahead of a new FLNG project or what's the thinking there?Karl StauboAnd that's a good question  Chris. So I think as you know  we got 18.6 million shares in total consideration when we sold high growth -- the share component of the consideration. Earlier in May  we sold one-third of that holding  freeing up $253 million. We liked the development of NFE. We like the direction they are taking the company. However  we have no lockup and no board system  no access to any nonpublic information. Hence  we're pretty much free to do what we want with that shareholding. The way we see it now  it's far better to sit NFE than to sit cash. And we have significant balance sheet flexibility to fund at least 1 FLNG project without touching that facility -- I'm sorry  those shares  and for now we are holders of the name.Chris RobertsonIs there any room for I guess a greater partnership with New Fortress now that they're getting into some floating LNG with offshore rigs  any expertise that you could offer or discussions there?Karl StauboI think  it was disclosed by NFE and Wes Edens on his earnings calls. We are as Golar  working together with NFE helping them out to develop their first LNG solution both on the engineering side and also on the operational side. Keep in mind  Golar still operates all of the maritime assets like the ships and the FSRUs that we sold to NFE. So we have a good working relationship on sort of all levels of the organizations. There's currently no specific plans  but I think we would certainly be open to working together when the right opportunities arise.OperatorNext question comes from the line of Nick [Linan] [indiscernible].Unidentified AnalystHow many yards are there that you think can do Mark I or Mark II conversions? And how many do you think could do Mark III new builds? And do you have any guaranteed slots for either of those types of work? And if so  like when you have options on those slots until -- because it seems like the odds are getting quite --Karl StauboThat's a very correct observation. They are getting extremely busy. So to some extent  that's a bit of an unusual situation for I think anyone in the maritime space  we haven't seen that since sort of the 2006 to 2008 cycle. But then again  the yard capacity has been built down significantly since then. And then the resurgence in activity has caused longer lead times  and obviously the general surprise squeeze globally.But to answer your question on Mark III  we think it's essentially one shipyard that we are -- that we think is up to the part. And on that one  we are in detailed discussion about securing slots.The way the shipyards think about things is that they are of course selling most of the capacities to fairly aggressive LNG carrier and container orders  but they are saving some space for what they call large offshore infrastructure projects. They have learned over time as most other people have the shipping markets are cyclical. And it's not wise of them to build down engineering and offshore capabilities because you never know when they are in demand and when that ramps up activity.So they are saving some slots for larger projects  but it's a limit to how long they hold the slots given the pressure on container and LNG carrier orders. That said  I think we have long standing relationships with the key yards in question and we are currently working to secure slot options for Mark IIIs.When it comes to Mark Is we have built Keppel in Singapore  and we think that‚Äôs the best shipyard to build Mark Is. We have not explored others and we have no intention to explore other for Mark Is either. When it comes to Mark IIs that's considered to be done at a different shipyard from both Mark I to Mark IIIs. So basically  we have one select shipyard we‚Äôve been working on with -- for quite some time on Mark II and III and we're already having a very established relationship with Keppel on Mark Is.OperatorThank you. There are no more questions at this time. I would like to hand back over to Karl Staubo for final remarks.Karl StauboThank you all for listening in and for good questions and we look forward to connecting with you next quarter. Have a great day.OperatorThat does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating.

Read ‚Ä¶,"(Reuters) - Russia is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine  in return for the lifting of some sanctions  the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying on Wednesday.Ukraine's Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia sent thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 and more than 20 million tonnes of grain are stuck in silos in the country.Russia and Ukraine usually account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies and the lack of significant grain exports from Ukrainian ports is contributing to a growing global food crisis. Ukraine is also a major exporter of corn and sunflower oil.Western powers have been discussing the idea of setting up ""safe corridors"" for grain exports from Ukraine's ports  although these would need Russian consent.""We have repeatedly stated on this point that a solution to the food problem requires a comprehensive approach  including the lifting of sanctions that have been imposed on Russian exports and financial transactions "" Rudenko was quoted as saying.""And it also requires the demining by the Ukrainian side of all ports where ships are anchored. Russia is ready to provide the necessary humanitarian passage  which it does every day.""The RIA news agency quoted Rudenko as saying Russia was in touch with the United Nations on the issue.'BLACKMAIL'Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba poured scorn on the suggestion that Moscow wanted to allow Ukraine to ship grain.""You could not find a better example of a blackmail in international relations "" he told the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""If anyone is buying it  I think there is a problem with that person  and we shouldn't waste too much time trying to understand why that person is making that point.""Odesa is Ukraine's main deep-water port and used to handle almost all its grain exports. It has suffered a number of Russian missile attacks  and Kyiv fears that Moscow wants to capture it as it has other Ukrainian ports  potentially through an amphibious assault.Rudenko was also quoted by Interfax as saying that any escort by Western ships of Ukrainian vessels carrying grain would ""seriously exacerbate the situation in the Black Sea"".Britain said on Tuesday it had no plans to send its warships to help get food exports out of Odesa.Euronext wheat fell to a two-week low in Paris on Wednesday after Russia said it would allow Ukrainian food exports to resume by sea under certain conditions. [WHT/]Russia's defence ministry said the port of Mariupol  the Ukrainian city on the shallow-water Azov Sea which was taken by Russia after a long siege  was operating normally after Russian forces finished removing mines from there.(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Kevin Liffey; Editing by David Clarke  Catherine Evans and Gareth Jones)",neutral,0.04,0.71,0.24,negative,0.01,0.08,0.91,True,English,"['Ukrainian food ships', 'Russia', 'corridor', 'conditions', 'Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko', 'Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba', 'growing global food crisis', 'global wheat supplies', 'RIA news agency', 'World Economic Forum', 'Russian missile attacks', 'necessary humanitarian passage', 'shallow-water Azov Sea', 'Interfax news agency', 'main deep-water port', 'other Ukrainian ports', 'Ukrainian food exports', 'significant grain exports', 'Black Sea ports', 'Russian exports', 'Russian consent', 'Russian forces', 'Ukrainian side', 'Ukrainian city', 'humanitarian corridor', 'Euronext wheat', 'Ukrainian vessels', '20 million tonnes', 'major exporter', 'sunflower oil', 'Western powers', 'safe corridors', 'comprehensive approach', 'financial transactions', 'United Nations', 'international relations', 'amphibious assault', 'defence ministry', 'long siege', 'Kevin Liffey', 'David Clarke', 'Catherine Evans', 'Gareth Jones', 'food problem', 'Western ships', 'Reuters', 'Ukraine', 'return', 'lifting', 'sanctions', 'Wednesday', 'thousands', 'troops', 'Feb.', 'silos', 'country', 'third', 'corn', 'idea', 'point', 'solution', 'demining', 'touch', 'issue', 'BLACKMAIL', 'suggestion', 'Moscow', 'example', 'Davos', 'person', 'time', 'Odesa', 'number', 'Kyiv', 'escort', 'situation', 'Britain', 'Tuesday', 'plans', 'warships', 'two', 'Paris', 'conditions', 'WHT', 'Mariupol', 'mines', 'Writing', 'Editing']",2022-05-26,2022-05-26,thestar.com.my
