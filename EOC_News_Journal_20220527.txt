These conditions have materially worsened over the last few weeks and our second quarter is now expected to be high single digit negative. More broadly  previous assumptions need to be updated:Inflation in Europe is forecast to stay at high levels for the remainder of the year  hampering consumer confidence and the underlying demand for the category The evolution of the pandemic in China keeps generating serious bottlenecks which add extra costs and may slow down our restocking plans Freight  raw material and energy costs remain at very high levels and are not expected to ease in the near future. Against this backdrop of high inflation and volatility  projected costs have been underestimated  temporarily impacting the gross margin model.Despite the soft demand  the Group is determined to support sales development through short-term and mid-term action plans. It is also committed to protect profitability through rigorous cost control  while advancing on the mid-term agenda. In particular  it plans to maintain investment in strategic initiatives such as the opening of the second logistics centre and the deployment of the marketplace. The Group also plans to keep actively rebuild inventories to support future sales while managing sourcing constraints.However  the high uncertainty of the global topline context  together with the revision of its projected gross margin assessment  have led the Group to review its full-year objectives as follows:Updated guidance Previous guidance1 Top line growth Mid-single-digit negative Positive EBIT margin 5% or above around 9% FCF EUR 10m to 30m EUR 65m to 75m Carbon intensity CO 2 neutrality for scopes 1 and 2 Dividend pay-out ratio 30% to 40%Maisons du Monde stays confident in the profitable growth model detailed in the context of the Capital Markets Day of November 2021. The strategic plan disclosed on that occasion remains fully valid  although the timing for reaching the 2025 targets may be extended.Story continuesConference call for investors and analystsDate: 27 May 2022 at 07:30 CESTSpeaker: Julie Walbaum  CEOConnection details:Webcast: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/ptnwnu7eConference call: France: +33 (0)1 70 70 07 81 UK: +44 (0) 2071 928338 USA: +1 16467413167 Password: 9647572***Financial calendar31 May 2022 Annual General Meeting10 June 2022 Dividend payment date (proposed)28 July 2022 Q2 and H1 2022 financial results27 October 2022 Q3 and 9M 2022 sales***Disclaimer: Forward Looking StatementThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements "" including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

Part 2A and Part 26 enact in Ireland domestic rules in line with Directive 2013/34/EU (the “EU Accounting Directive (2013)”) and apply to large Irish incorporated companies  like the Company  that are involved in the exploration  discovery  development  and extraction of minerals. DTR 4.3A imposes equivalent requirements on issuers  like the Company  admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange that are similarly involved in the exploration  development and extraction of minerals.This report is available for download at https://www.kenmareresources.com/investors/reports-and-presentationsIt has also been submitted to Euronext Dublin and the UK National Storage Mechanism and will shortly be available for inspection at the following locations:https://direct.euronext.com/#/oamfilingandhttps://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanismAbout Kenmare Resources plcKenmare Resources plc is an Irish incorporated company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the “Moma Mine”)  which is located on the northern coast of Mozambique. Moma is one of the world’s largest producers of minerals sands products  accounting for production of approximately 8% of global titanium feedstocks and supplying to customers operating in over 15 countries. The Group’s products are key raw materials  ultimately consumed in everyday quality-of-life products such as paints  plastics  and ceramic tiles.Story continuesThe Group consists of the parent company (Kenmare Resources plc) and its subsidiary undertakings. The mining operations at the Moma Mine are carried out by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (“KMML”) and downstream processing is undertaken by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited (“KMPL”)  both of which are wholly-owned subsidiary undertakings of the Company. KMML and KMPL account for 100% of the Group’s turnover and 99% of the Group’s total assets. Therefore  all revenues and operating costs of the Group’s mining and processing operations are recorded by KMML and KMPL within the same tax jurisdiction  namely Mozambique.The parent company  Kenmare Resources plc  conducts no direct exploration or mining activities. The Group’s corporate costs are recorded by the parent company.Scope of reportDisclosure of payments to governments is required in respect of payments arising from the exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals; the payments included within this report therefore relate to the Group’s mining and processing activities at the Moma Mine in Mozambique.Groups are required to prepare a consolidated report disclosing payments made by the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings. Accordingly  this report reflects payments made by the Group companies conducting mining and processing activities  namely KMML and KMPL. The Group owns 100% of these entities and the amounts reflect 100% of the payments made by these subsidiary undertakings.For a broader discussion of the Group’s payments to governments and its contribution to its host communities  please see the Group’s 2021 Sustainability Report  available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources .com/investors/reports-and-presentationsPaymentsThe payments disclosed in this report are on a cash basis.The payments made to governments are required to be analysed into the following categories:Production entitlements - this category includes the host government’s share of production  which is usually outlined in a production sharing agreement. In 2021  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Taxes - this category includes taxes paid to governments on income  profits or production arising from the Group’s exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals. Taxes levied on consumption such as value added taxes  personal income taxes and sales taxes are excluded. KMML is subject to a corporation tax rate of 35% of the taxable profits of its Mozambique branch. Taxable profits of the branch are calculated by reference to the cash costs of producing Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) net of allowable tax deductions and increased by a defined margin.KMML’s Mozambique branch produces one product from its mining activities  namely HMC. HMC is sold to KMPL  which processes it into finished products (ilmenite  zircon  rutile and mineral sands concentrate)  which are exported worldwide to third party customers. The cash costs of mining include the costs of mine face preparation  dredging and dry mining operations  Wet Concentrator Plant operations  rehabilitation and support services.The margin applied to the cash costs of mining is stipulated in the Mineral Licensing Contract  dated 21 January 2002. The contract is between KMML and the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy (MIREME) of the Republic of Mozambique  acting for and on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique  which details the terms and conditions for the exploration  development and production of heavy minerals in the areas of Moma  Congolone and Quinga. The margin is determined by dividing the prices for sale of finished products to third party customers earned by KMPL in the year by the prices earned in the prior year  adjusted for inflation and applying this factor to the prior year margin. For the fiscal year ending 31 December 2021 the margin was 54.8%.KMPL has the benefit of operating within an Industrial Free Zone (“IFZ”) and as an IFZ company  it is exempted from corporation tax.Royalties – this category includes payments to a government for the rights to extract minerals or other materials. Typically amounts are levied based on production levels or revenues. KMML is subject to a mining royalty of 3% based on HMC sold to KMPL. The royalty is calculated by multiplying the cash costs of producing HMC  plus the margin as detailed above  by 3%.KMPL is subject to a revenue royalty of 1% on revenue recognised.Dividends - this category includes dividend payments other than dividends paid to a government as an ordinary shareholder of the Company or one of its subsidiary undertakings. In 2021  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Bonuses - this category includes bonuses paid to a government for and in consideration of signature  discovery  production  awards  grants and transfers of extraction rights and production bonuses. In 2021  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Fees – this category includes licence fees  rental fees  entry fees and other considerations for mining licences or concessions.Infrastructure improvements – this category includes payments to governments for infrastructure other than in circumstances where the infrastructure is expected to be primarily dedicated to operational activities throughout its useful life. Payments that form part of the Group’s social investment activities (which are primarily organised and administered by Kenmare Moma Development Association) are excluded. Such payments would include contributions in respect of local schools  healthcare or community facilities  or improvements to the general environment of local communities.Government“Government” means any national  regional or local authority of a country  and includes a department  agency or undertaking that is a subsidiary undertaking where the authority is the parent undertaking.All payments referred to this report are made to the Government of Mozambique or its agencies; in particular  they are made to Autoridade Tributária Unidade dos Grandes Contribuintes–Nampula  a department of the Mozambican tax authority.Analysis by project/entityAn analysis of payments by project is required where payments are attributable to specific projects. Projects are defined as operational activities which are governed by a single contract  licence  lease  concession or similar legal agreement  and form the basis for payment liabilities with a government. Where agreements are substantially interconnected in operating and geographical terms  with substantially similar terms  those agreements should be treated as a single project. Payments may be disclosed at an entity level where payments are made in respect of obligations imposed at that entity level rather than at a project level. Payments below are disclosed at the entity level for KMML and KMPL  which between them operate the Moma Mine  which is treated as one project for purposes of this Report.MaterialityUnder Part 2A and Part 26  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of €100 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of €100 000.Currency and roundingAll monetary amounts in this report refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated. The amounts shown in this report have been rounded to the nearest $1 000.Payments to governments – 2021Production entitlements Taxes Royalties Dividends Bonuses Fees Infrastructure improvements Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Country summary Government of Mozambique - 6 156 8 863 - - 388 - 15 407 Total - 6 156 8 863 - - 388 - 15 407 Entity report KMML - 6 156 4 200 - - 388 - 10 744 KMPL - - 4 663 - - - - 4 663 Total - 6 156 8 863 - - 388 - 15 407This report for Kenmare Resources plc (registered number 37550) was approved by the Directors of the Company on 25 May 2022 and signed on their behalf byMichael CarvillDirectorTony McCluskeyDirectorFor further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Doug Keatingedkeatinge@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 037 4163About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world’s largest producers of mineral sands products.

ExchangeWire believes that this reflects a more expansive view for ad tech and martech.After all  why focus on a multibillion-dollar retargeting display segment  when you can be building the tech layer for the multitrillion-dollar marketing industry?I always pen a prediction piece a few weeks out from ATS London (limited tickets available) to set the stage for Europe’s premium madtech event. Using Steins  I graded the probability of these predictions.Henceforth - given ATS London’s new June date and proximity to Cannes - I will use bottles of rosé as our go-to probability icon. I look forward to seeing you all on 14/15 June.And here are those 2022 predictions in full:Shopify buys CriteoShopify could be a retail media power house. With over one million sites using its platform  Shopify could offer buyers a scaled shopper graph to buy ads across its network of sites. It could also enable its own platform customers to leverage the 'Shopify graph' – as well as their own first-party data. The problem here: ad tech. Shopify doesn’t have any. And it will take time to build. The solution: buy Criteo. Criteo has skilfully pivoted its business away from display retargeting into retail media. After its deal closes with IPONWEB (June close most probable)  Criteo will have a world-class retail media infrastructure. Shopify needs Criteo to live its best retail-media life.Probability of Shopify buying Criteo: 2/5 rosé bottlesMediaocean (Vista Equity Partners) buys MagniteBuy and sell side are converging. If everyone is competing on supply access  what is the point of buy-side/sell-side demarcation? Magnite is very cheap at the minute  and offers so much to Mediaocean in terms of CTV and display capabilities. Mediaocean could steal the march on its longtime rival The Trade Desk in the workflow and omnichannel media execution segment.Probability of Mediaocean buying Magnite: 3/5 rosé bottlesGoodbye DoubleClickI ran a poll on LinkedIn on the future of Google’s third-party ad tech stack. Fifty-eight percent of respondents believe that Google will never leave ad tech. While I respect the wisdom of the crowd  I still believe strongly that Google will be forced to divest of its ad tech stack. Legislation is coming - so it is now only a matter of time.Probability of Google being forced to divest its ad stack: 3/5 rosé bottlesThe coming zero ID shit show in EuropeAfter Google got hit with a USD$100m+ fine for confusing language on its cookie banner  the ‘reject all’ option was made available to users across the top CMPs in Europe. I am hearing anecdotally from some big publishers that ‘reject all’ clicks are on the rise. What is happening to those consent-less users? Well  ad tech is not in the business of monetising zero ID users - so the ‘reject all’ CPMs are collapsing. Matching IDs are ad tech’s business. Are they really going to re-engineer for the zero ID user? Short answer: no. This is going to be a huge problem for European publishers. Watch out for this.Probability of a European 'zero ID' shit show: 4/5 rosé bottlesNetflix ❤️ third-party ad techThere was an article recently outlining why Netflix should buy Roku. At USD$10bn (~£8bn)  it would be affordable – but why spend so much money at this early stage on a programmatic-focused business? Netflix will instead lean on Freewheel and Google to manage direct buys. And opt for a white-labeled The Trade Desk for programmatic buys. In the short term  anyway  Netflix ❤️ third-party ad tech.Probability: 4/5 rosé bottleseBay buys an ad server to build out its ad-tech stackeBay wants to muscle in on the retail-media boom. But it lacks the ad tech infrastructure to scale. eBay will look to buy an ad-server solution to help build out the stack. eBay was rumoured to be buying Adform. But the deal fell apart on valuation. eBay may come back with an improved offer. Other potentials include Kevel and Smart.Probability of eBay buying an ad server: 3/5 rosé bottlesRetail media ad nets every-bloody-whereRetail media will not mirror programmatic in display advertising. It is highly unlikely that Tesco  Carrefour  or equivalent  will feed sensitive sales data into the bid stream. Instead  we will see the rise of ad nets selling full-funnel solutions into agencies. The aisle sales parties will be legendary. A packet of Viscounts and a six pack of Fanta  anyone?Probability: 3/5 rosé bottlesPublisher contextual row rumbles onThe fight between ad tech and publisher contextual data is going to continue until a suitable commercial model is agreed upon. In the post-cookie world  contextual data will be critical to open-web monetisation. This could get very messy.Probability: 4/5 rosé bottlesThe European madtech IPO market roars back to life in late 2023It’s an absolute bloodbath in the markets right now. Tech stocks are getting hammered on valuations  as investors flee for the safe haven of ‘predictable growth’ companies.Ad Tech IPOs: What could happen?The IPO market is shut for ad tech companies  but listings will return in late 2023 and much of 2024.Most European companies ExchangeWire speaks with are opting for New York - where there is an acceptance of ad tech as a public market segment. This should be a wake-up call for Euronext and LSE  as they are likely to lose out on a lot of deals. Here are those 2023/24 candidates in full - along with the probability:- OguryThe French ad net has developed an interesting data graph built around survey data and proprietary first-party data assets. The company could do a big PE round - given how much European PE LOVES ad nets - but it is looking at a public listing instead. Can a managed service ad tech business have a successful public listing?Chances of 23/24 IPO:4/5 rosé bottles- SmartGoogle’s only real publisher full-stack competition. The company has been winning some big publisher accounts of late - and is doing USD$100m in revenue. Smart could be in the box seat in the coming 12-24 months given Google’s issues. An independent DoubleClick - bereft of the AdWords demand power hose - is not as intimidating as the Google death star. Chances of 23/24 IPO:4/5 rosé bottles- MiQMiQ is going to be a very sizeable PE round later this year. The company is one of the biggest European ad tech companies in terms of revenue. At some stage the PE journey will end. MiQ will then likely go public on the NYSE/Nasdaq – but might be a 2025 candidate. How they deal with Wall Street expectations will be crucial here.3/5 rosé bottles- PermutiveArguably the most interesting European ad tech company. It’s very much built for the privacy-first age - and its technology is very much about enabling the publisher. Permutive did a series C raise backed by Softbank. The company trajectory will likely end in a US IPO in 2024.4/5 rosé bottles- AdverityEurope’s martech unicorn is positioning itself as the enterprise analytics solution of choice for big marketers. Adverity has raised USD$165m (~£132m) to date  and is probably getting too expensive for most buyers.4/5 rosé bottles- TeadsIt tried to go public in 2021  but the valuation at the time was thought to be too frothy by Wall Street. The company is drawing over USD$600m (~£480m) in revenue – and has been working on its cookieless solution. It will regroup and go public in the next 24 months.4/5 rosé bottles- InfosumThe ‘clean room’ specialist has a big opportunity to build the leading solution in this hyper-growth segment. This could be a trade sale given the walled-garden fragmentation.1/5 rosé bottles- CavaiThe Norwegian-based ad tech platform is part of a new wave of post-cookie vendors shaping the future of the sector. Its tech offering is focused on data-driven creative  connecting the top and bottom of the funnel across the open web and retail media. The company will go public but maybe a 2025 candidate.2/5 rosé bottles- TAPTAP DigitalRecently did a USD$100m (~£80m) PE deal. Its location-based solution is built on a privacy framework. The company is growing. The CEO wants to go public.3/5 rosé bottles- The Ozone ProjectThis is a wild card. Ozone has built a tech layer and cookieless ad-net solution. It plans to sell the tech to international publishers. Ultimately  they will need to raise to fund this expansion. If they do  there will have to be an outcome. An LSE listing beckons - but not for a while.1/5 rosé bottlesWe look forward to hosting you all at ATS London on 14/15 June  and discussing all of the above.,neutral,0.05,0.85,0.1,mixed,0.14,0.14,0.71,True,English,"['Ciarán O’Kane', '2022 MadTech Predictions', 'coming zero ID shit show', ""European 'zero ID' shit show"", 'The European madtech IPO market', 'omnichannel media execution segment', 'multibillion-dollar retargeting display segment', 'retail media power house', 'world-class retail media infrastructure', '2/5 rosé bottles Mediaocean', 'zero ID user', 'premium madtech event', 'third-party ad tech stack', 'multitrillion-dollar marketing industry', 'Vista Equity Partners', 'The Trade Desk', 'USD$100m+ fine', 'aisle sales parties', 'suitable commercial model', 'predictable growth’ companies', '3/5 rosé bottles', '4/5 rosé bottles', 'Publisher contextual row', 'sensitive sales data', 'publisher contextual data', 'ad tech infrastructure', 'one million sites', 'Ad Tech IPOs', 'new June date', 'best retail-media life', 'European publishers', 'ad stack', 'traditional date', 'first-party data', 'retail-media boom', 'ad-tech stack', 'ad server', 'ad nets', 'tech layer', 'Tech stocks', 'display capabilities', 'display advertising', 'ATS London', '14/15 June', 'expansive view', 'prediction piece', 'limited tickets', 'shopper graph', 'supply access', 'longtime rival', 'Goodbye DoubleClick', 'Fifty-eight percent', 'confusing language', 'cookie banner', 'top CMPs', 'big publishers', 'consent-less users', 'Matching IDs', 'Short answer', 'direct buys', 'short term', 'Other potentials', 'bid stream', 'full-funnel solutions', 'six pack', 'post-cookie world', 'web monetisation', 'absolute bloodbath', 'safe haven', 'platform customers', 'side demarcation', 'huge problem', 'early stage', 'programmatic buys', 'ad-server solution', 'programmatic-focused business', 'Shopify graph', 'probability icon', 'September', 'ExchangeWire', 'martech', 'Steins', 'predictions', 'proximity', 'Cannes', 'Criteo', 'buyers', 'ads', 'network', 'deal', 'IPONWEB', 'Magnite', 'everyone', 'point', 'minute', 'terms', 'CTV', 'march', 'workflow', 'poll', 'LinkedIn', 'future', 'Google', 'respondents', 'wisdom', 'crowd', 'Legislation', 'matter', 'option', 'clicks', 'rise', 'CPMs', 'Netflix', 'article', 'Roku', 'money', 'Freewheel', 'labeled', 'eBay', 'Adform', 'valuation', 'offer', 'Kevel', 'Smart', 'Tesco', 'Carrefour', 'agencies', 'packet', 'Viscounts', 'Fanta', 'fight', 'late', 'markets', 'investors']",2022-05-26,2022-05-27,exchangewire.com

(""CoolCo"").Sold 6.2 million New Fortress Energy Inc. (""NFE"") shares in Q2 2022 (""Q2"") realizing net cash proceeds of $253 million. Golar now owns 12.4 million NFE shares following the sale.Q1 Total Golar Cash and Listed Securities 1 position increased by $0.4 billion to $1.3 billion. Golar's share of Contractual Debt 1 decreased by $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion in Q1 and a further $0.5 billion in Q2 after sale of remaining carriers to CoolCo in April.Agreed to sell the steam turbine carrier Golar Arctic as a converted FSRU to Italy's Snam for 269 million Euros ($288 million).Strong progress made on opportunities for FSRU Golar Tundra and on pipeline of FLNG projects.Shipping spin-off: A key focus for Q1 was the spin-off of our 8 TFDE LNG carriers into CoolCo. CoolCo successfully concluded an upsized $275 million equity raise in January  listed on the Euronext Growth Oslo exchange in February  recruited a designated management team in March and closed its acquisition of 8 LNG carriers and The Cool Pool Limited from Golar during March and April. The sale of the management companies is contemplated to complete in Q2. In total the CoolCo transactions will reduce Golar’s contractual debt1 position by $821 million  release approximately $217 million in cash and cash equivalents to Golar  whilst maintaining a 31.25% shareholding in affiliate  CoolCo.FLNG operations and commodity hedges: FLNG Hilli maintained its unbroken 4-year record of 100% uptime during the quarter and started to produce its incremental 0.2mtpa of production  increasing scheduled production volume from 1.2mtpa to 1.4mtpa. The incremental 0.2mtpa that has a tariff linked to Dutch Title Transfer Facility (""TTF"") gas prices contributed $22.6 million of incremental proceeds net of commodity swaps to Golar during Q1. The Brent oil linked component of the tariff contributed $15.6 million  bringing Golar’s pro-rata share of gross proceeds from Hilli for the quarter to $64.0 million. Golar's share of the TTF linked gross proceeds is expected to be $19.0 million in Q2 (fully hedged)  $19.0 million in Q3 2022 (fully hedged) and $20.0 million in Q4 2022 (open). Estimated Q4 2022 TTF linked gross proceeds are based on a TTF spot price of $26.90/mmbtu and can be expected to increase (or decrease) by $0.8 million for each $1.00/MMBtu change in the TTF forward price. Hilli's earnings could increase further from 2023 until the end of the contract if the customer exercises a one-time 0.4mtpa TTF-linked option that expires on July 31  2022.Story continuesFLNG Gimi construction: Conversion of FLNG Gimi for its 20-year contract with BP scheduled to commence in Q4 2023 is 83% technically complete. Once delivered  Gimi is expected to unlock around $3.0 billion of earnings backlog1 to Golar  equivalent to $151 million in annual Adjusted EBITDA1. The commercial start-up of FLNG Gimi together with the commodity linked production from FLNG Hilli could result in Golar's share of annual Adjusted EBITDA1 generation from Hilli and Gimi exceeding $400.0 million within 3-years  a quadrupling of 2021 FLNG related earnings.FLNG business development: We are in detailed discussions with existing and prospective clients for new FLNG projects. Some of these projects would offer direct access to gas molecules or allow for a commodity linked earnings component  whilst others are on a tolling basis. Based on envisioned funding and ownership structures we expect that our Total Golar Cash and Listed Securities1 position could fund two FLNG growth projects.FSRU: On May 18  2022  Italian energy infrastructure company Snam and Golar signed a contract that will see Golar convert the last of its trading steam turbine LNG carriers  Golar Arctic  into a FSRU for delivery to Snam at a port in Sardinia  Italy. After conversion  acceptance and repayment of any vessel related debt  the FSRU will be sold to the Snam Group for 269 million Euros ($288 million). Initiation of activities including procurement of long lead items for the conversion is subject to Snam’s issuance of a Notice-to-Proceed. Once received  the process of conversion and sale is expected to take up to two years  with the vessel being required in a yard for around 9-months. Prior to entering the yard the Golar Arctic will continue to be traded by Golar as an LNG carrier. The estimated conversion cost is approximately $160 million due to the high specification of equipment required and inflationary market conditions.Developments in Europe have created an urgent need for more floating LNG terminals. Golar has received multiple approaches from European governments and utility companies for its modern high-spec FSRU Golar Tundra.Financial Summary(in thousands of $) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 % Change Q4 2021 % Change Net income attributable to Golar LNG Ltd 345 182 25 364 1261% 8 009 4210% Total operating revenues 79 688 77 456 3% 72 414 10% Adjusted EBITDA1 93 446 41 885 123% 59 957 56% Golar's share of contractual debt 1 1 743 747 2 170 987 (20)% 2 239 496 (22)%Q1 highlights and recent eventsFinancial and corporate:Profitability: Net income attributable to Golar of $345.2 million for the quarter  including: A $344.0 million non-cash mark-to-market gain recognized on NFE shares based on a March 31  2022 carrying value of $42.61 per share.

The realized component comprised (i) Brent oil linked revenue of $17.5 million (December 31  2021: $12.9 million)  (ii) TTF-linked proceeds of $26.2 million and (iii) commodity swap expense of $1.1 million and represents the contracted amounts in relation to the Hilli LTA receivable in cash.(3) Included in “Other operating income” is $3.6 million for excess production over the contracted tolling capacity of 1.4 million tons.2021 Jan-Mar (in thousands of $) Shipping FLNG Corporate and other Total Total operating revenues 14 495 54 397 8 564 77 456 Vessel operating expenses (4 077) (12 300) (2 499) (18 876) Voyage  charterhire & commission expenses (6 341) (150) (16) (6 507) Administrative expenses (34) (143) (8 362) (8 539) Project development expenses — — (1 649) (1 649) Adjusted EBITDA 4 043 41 804 (3 962) 41 885Golar reports today Q1 net income attributable to Golar of $345.2 million. Golar also reports Adjusted EBITDA1 of $93.4 million inclusive of FLNG Hilli  Golar Arctic and Golar Tundra but excluding the 8 TFDE vessels and The Cool Pool Limited sold to CoolCo in March and April 2022  and the management companies  the sale of which is expected to complete in Q2. Q1 results associated with the 8 TFDE vessels and the Cool Pool Limited sold to CoolCo and the management companies still to be sold have been reclassified to Discontinued operations with Q1 2021 and Q4 2021 (""Q4"") numbers adjusted on a retrospective basis for comparison in the discussion of material movements below.Quarterly amortization of the day one gain recognized in respect of the incremental TTF linked production from FLNG Hilli contributed to the $7.3 million increase in Total operating revenues which increased from $72.4 million in Q4 to $79.7 million in Q1. Fees for the additional TTF linked production are accounted for within Realized and unrealized gains/losses on oil and gas derivative instruments. Revenue from shipping (Golar Arctic and Golar Tundra)  net of voyage  charter hire and commission expenses was $7.7 million and decreased by $0.6 million from $8.3 million in Q4.Vessel operating expenses increased  from $13.9 million in Q4 to $19.5 million in Q1  Q4 costs having been suppressed by a $5.4 million insurance recovery.The Brent oil linked component of Hilli's fees generates additional annual operating cash flows of approximately $3.1 million for every dollar increase in Brent Crude prices between $60.00 per barrel and the contractual ceiling. Billing of this component is based on a three-month look-back at average Brent Crude prices. As a result of rising prices  a $17.5 million realized gain on the oil derivative instrument was recorded in Q1  up from the $12.9 million realized in Q4. Golar has an effective 89.1% interest in these earnings. A realized gain of $26.2 million was also recognized in respect of fees for the additional TTF linked production that commenced in Q1. Golar has an effective 86.3% interest in these earnings. Offsetting this was a $1.1 million realized loss (100% attributable to Golar) on the hedged component of the quarter's TTF linked earnings. Collectively a $42.6 million realized gain on oil and gas derivative instruments was recognized as a result.The mark-to-market fair value of the Hilli Brent oil linked derivative asset increased by $169.6 million during the quarter  with a corresponding unrealized gain of the same amount recognized in the income statement. The fair value increase was driven by an upward movement in the expected future market price for Brent oil. Similarly  the mark-to-market fair value of the Hilli TTF natural gas derivative asset increased by $24.1 million during the quarter with a corresponding unrealized gain of the same amount recognized in the income statement  also driven by an upward movement in expected future TTF prices. Offsetting the unrealized TTF gain is a $25.7 million unrealized loss in respect of the hedged portion of Q2 and Q3 2022 TTF linked Hilli production. Collectively this therefore resulted in a $168.1 million Q1 unrealized gain on oil and gas derivative instruments.Of the $3.9 million Other operating income in Q1  $3.6 million was recognized in respect of LNG production over and above the quarter's pro-rata share of 1.4mt of full year 2022 contracted production.An increase in the NFE share price between January 1 and March 31 resulted in the recognition of a Q1 unrealized mark-to-market gain of $344.0 million on Golar’s 18.6 million NFE shares in Other non-operating income. The fair value of these shares was $42.61 per share as of March 31  2022. Together with $1.9 million of dividend income from NFE and a foreign exchange gain on the final tax settlement with the UK tax authorities relative to the foreign exchange rate used when recognizing the liability at December 31  2021  this collectively contributed to $350.2 million of Other non-operating income during the quarter.Balance Sheet and Liquidity:As of March 31  2022 Golar had $209.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $135.9 million of restricted cash. Restricted cash includes $16.3 million relating to the Hilli lessor-owned VIE. Total Golar cash1 position therefore amounts to $328.6 million. As of March 31  2022  $131.0 million had been drawn down against the Corporate RCF of $200 million  secured by our stake in NFE. On April 6  2022 Golar sold 6.2 million NFE shares raising net proceeds of $253 million and on May 10  2022 the $131.0 million Corporate RCF was repaid. The full $200 million undrawn Corporate RCF continues to be available for future drawdown and is now secured by Golar's remaining 12.4 million NFE shares. On February 11  2022 Golar also entered into a $250.0 million bilateral corporate facility secured by the Company's equity stakes in FLNG Hilli and Gimi.

Of this  $485.0 million had been drawn against the $700 million debt facility. Both the investment and debt drawn to date are reported on a 100% basis. Golar's share of remaining capital expenditure  net of the Company's share of remaining undrawn debt amounts to $213.0 million. Subsequent to the quarter end  a further $50.0 million has been drawn against the $700 million facility.Included within the $517.0 million current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt as at March 31  2022 is $370.9 million in respect of the Hilli lessor-owned VIE subsidiary that Golar is required to consolidate. The Current assets held for sale and Current liabilities held of sale of $644.1 million and $383.7 million respectively in Q1 include the remaining four TFDE vessels and The Cool Pool Limited sold in April 2022 and the management companies yet to be sold to CoolCo but contemplated to complete in Q2. After sale of the remaining four TFDE vessels  The Cool Pool Limited and the management companies  Golar's Q2 equity method investments will increase by approximately $62.5 million.Of Golar's $1.7 billion share of Contractual debt1 as of March 31  2022  $0.5 billion relates to the 4 TFDE vessels sold in April 2022  leaving $1.2 billion. Net of Total Golar cash of $0.3 billion  Net Debt1 therefore falls to around $0.9 billion. If Listed Securities1 are taken into account  this figure reduces to $0.2 billion. Assuming current commodity prices prevail  Golar's share of 2022 Adjusted EBITDA1 remains on track to reach $200.0 million. This could increase further in 2023 if the customer exercises their option to increase Hilli production to up to 1.6mtpa  and should exceed $400.0 million after the first full year of Gimi operations  expected in 2024. Offering strong debt coverage  near-term earnings power and meaningful growth potential that can be financed  the simplified Golar is well positioned for new FLNG projects.Corporate and Other Matters:As at March 31  2022  Golar had 108.0 million shares issued and outstanding post the repurchase and subsequent cancellation of 368 496 shares during the quarter. There were also 1.1 million outstanding stock options with an average price of $15.63 and 0.2 million unvested restricted stock units awarded. Of the initial $50.0 million approved share buyback scheme  $19.0 million remains available for further repurchases which will continue to be opportunistically pursued.On May 11  2022 Golar invested $2.4 million in Aqualung Carbon Capture  an Oslo-based technology company that has developed and achieved proof of concept for a CO2 capture and separation membrane technology. Subject to the successful completion of a commercial pilot project with an industrial user  the technology could be used in future FLNG projects  enabling Golar to offer interested customers the opportunity to further reduce emissions from our already low carbon footprint FLNG solutions. Golar has a 4.6% interest and a board seat in this company.Non-GAAP measuresIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP)  this earnings release and the associated investor presentation contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today  Karl Staubo  CEO. Please go ahead.Karl StauboThank you  and welcome to Golar LNG's Q1 earnings results presentation. Thank you for taking time to dial in. My name is Karl Fredrik Staubo  CEO of Golar LNG. Before we get into the presentation  please note the forward-looking statements on Slide 2. I am accompanied today by our CFO  Mr. Eduardo Maranhao to present this quarter's results.On Slide 4  we have outlined the company overview. Golar today owns two FLNGs  the Golar Hilli in operation in Cameroon  and the Golar Gimi under construction to start to 20 year contract with BP from Q4 of next year.Furthermore  we own an LNG steam carrier  the Golar Arctic  where we announced last week that we have agreed with Snam to forward sell the ship as a converted FSRU. Lastly  we own the Golar Tundra  the most modern promptly available FSRU globally  currently operating FLNG carrier.We have developed three FLNG designs that form the basis for our growth. All three designs are based on the same proven liquefaction technology  and we will highlight some of the key characteristics of the different capacities of the units later in the presentation.Other result of significant corporate transactions over the last 12 months we have three listed shareholdings. We own 6% of New Fortress Energy valued at $558 million on yesterday's close. We own about 31% of Cool Company Limited  the shipping spin-off we established during Q1 of this year. We own around 24% of Avenir LNG  a small scale LNG shipping and terminal business. And the total value of these investments amount to approximately $720 million.Golar celebrates its 75th year of operation this year  50 of which we've been actively involved with LNG maritime infrastructure assets. Golar has through its history pioneered some of the key developments in the sector  including the industry's first FSRU  the first FLNG  as well as the first ever integrated FSRU to power plants project.We have a market leading operations and have achieved 100% commercial uptime since the start-up of Hilli in 2018. We're now focusing these companies for FLNG growth opportunities.Turning to Slide 5  and again as a result of the M&A activities over the last 12 months with a total enterprise value of $6.2 billion at the time of sales  we have significantly strengthened our balance sheets. We currently have $1.4 billion of cash and listed securities. We're abouthalf cash and half is listed securities. We currently have a net cash position. Adjusting for the remaining CapEx on the FLNG Gimi  we have a total net debt position after delivery of Gimi of $300 million. That number excludes operating profits between now and Gimi delivery  so we anticipate that that number will be lower.Based on increased capacity utilization of Hilli  commodity upside on the tolling fee and startup of Gimi in Q4 of next year  we expect EBITDA generation to quadruple in 2024 versus 2021 levels. We've also refinanced corporate facilities and we currently have no debt maturities until 2025.I'll now hand the call over to Eduardo to present for Q1 results.Eduardo MaranhaoThanks Karl  and good morning  everybody. I'm very pleased to provide an update on our group results for the first quarter of 2022. So turning over to Slide Number 7  I wanted to show some of the highlights of this quarter.Starting with our FLNG units. Our first vessel  Hilli  continues to operate with a very solid performance  delivering 100% uptime. The Brent linked kicker in our contract generated an incremental EBITDA of $16 million this quarter  or 36% up when compared to Q4 last year.Since 1st of January  we've started to realize our TTF linked production from FLNG Hilli  which added an incremental EBITDA of $22 million. I will explain those different elements in more details further in this presentation.Construction of our second FLNG unit  the Gimi  continuous in Singapore  and is now 83% technically complete. We continue to make substantial progress on commercial discussions for future FLNG units  and we have a strong pipeline of opportunities for growth projects.So moving on to shipping in FSRUs  the formation of Cool Company was successfully completed this quarter. We've raised $275 million in a private placement in January  followed by the listing of its shares in the Euronext exchange in Oslo. In connection with that  Cool Company acquired eight of our TFDE vessels. In May  we announced the award of EUR269 million contract which Snam for the conversion of the Golar Arctic into an FSRU.Due to the current geopolitical situation in Europe  we continue to see a very active FSRU market and have received inquiries from multiple European counterparts for the deployment of our last unit to Golar Tundra. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and since the start of this year  we have released $470 million in cash proceeds from the Cool Company spin-off and also the sale of a portion of our NFE stake.In February  we have repaid $317 million of our outstanding convertible bonds  and then also entered into a new bilateral corporate facility of $250 million. We've continued our share buyback program  and so far we have repurchased 400 -- approximately 400 000 shares this quarter  leaving 108 million shares after debt outstanding.So moving on to Slide Number 8  this quarter we recorded an adjusted EBITDA of $93 million. This result is inclusive of Hilli  Arctic and Tundra  but excludes the 8 TFDE vessels that were sold to Cool Company. When compared on a like for like basis to the previous quarter  this represented an increase of 55%.Net income attributable to Golar was $345 million in this quarter  and that includes $168 million noncash gain  which was recognized on our Hilli Brent oil and TTF linked derivative and also a $344 million also noncash market to market gain recognized on our NFE shares based on March 31st position which carry the value of $42.61 per share.Our share of contractual debt at the end of the quarter stood at $1.7 billion. However  $0.5 billion of debt relates to 4 TFDE vessels that were sold to Cool Company in April. So that leaves us with a $1.2 billion of contractual debt post the completion of the eight vessels sale. Total cash at the end of Q1 was $329 million.When we consider the various subsequent events that took place since the end of the quarter  including for example  the $253 million of sale beneficiaries  our total cash position including access to revolving credit facilities stood at around $870 million. Further to that  when we take into account the value of our listed securities in NFE. Cool Company and Avenir  we have a liquidity position of just close to $1.4 billion. We estimate that this amount could allow us to fund two new FLNG growth projects.Moving on to Slide number 10  I wanted to provide a bit more color on the breakdown of our share of the distributable earnings from Hilli. As a result of the higher brand and TTF prices  our share of Hilli’s EBITDA almost doubled from the previous quarter  reaching $57 million in Q1 of 2022. Interesting to note that  this increase of almost 3.5 times when compared to Q1 of 2021  came at no additional CapEx to Golar. While the base tariff stood in line with the previous quarters  we recorded an incremental $16 million from Brent linked revenues and close to $23 million from TTF linked earnings  already net of the interest disruption we have entered.When we assumed forward commodity prices  our share of the 2022 adjusted EBITDA from Hilli remains on track to reach around $245 million in 2022.I will now hand over to Karl who can talk a bit more about debt forward looking.Karl StauboThank you  Eduardo. Turning to Slide 11 which elaborates on the embedded upside on the commodity exposure of Hilli's tariff. As you can see during 2021 Golar pro rata share of Hilli's EBITDA was $99 million. This is expected to grow by 2.5 times for 2022 on the back of higher Brent linked earnings where Golar generates $2.7 million of EBITDA for every dollar Brent is above 60. This is expected to generate about $91 million of EBITDA for 2022.Furthermore  the startup of the incremental 0.2 million tons of TTF linked production that commenced in January other than other $22.6 million in Golar share of Hilli Q1 EBITDA. For the full year  the TTF linked production is expected to add $81 million in incremental revenue where the TTF gas price exposure for Q2 and Q3 has been hedged at $25.38 per MMBtu. We remain open for Q4 TTF gas price exposure.Perenco  the charter of the unit has a onetime three year option to declare up to 0.4 million tons of increased production from 2023 until end of the contract in July 26 on the same TTF linked tariff as the current 0.2 produced this year. The option is declarable within end of July  and we see it as increasingly likely that Perenco will take up the option on the back of strong gas prices  but subject to the final outcome of the drilling program to tie in more reserves to Hilli.We do not expect Perenco to take up the option until closer to expiry of the option in July. The commodity exposure on Hilli enables as an FLNG provider to charge significantly higher tolling fees for traditional long-term tolling arrangements. As you can see from the boxes on the slide  the effective tolling fee for Hilli during 2021 was $3 per MMBtu. This has increased to an effective tolling fee of $13 per MMBtu during 2022. Hence the commodity exposure of our FLNG contracts  both existing and the ones we will target going forward  we see an extremely compelling risk reward. And we will continue to target similar type of structures.Turning to Slide 12 and an update on the construction of the FLNG Gimi  which is now 83% technically complete for conversion at Keppel Shipyard in Singapore. We have currently worked over 19 million man hours on the conversion. The reminder of the build is mainly around construction  installation and testing of equipment ahead of her 2023 sail-away and Q4 ‘23 startup. In light of the recent resurgence of COVID in certain parts of Asia  we continue to closely monitor and take precautions for any potential COVID impacts for the 3 500 workers on site. We currently have no material impact on site and again this is the situation we are monitoring closely and we feel comfortable with the situation where it stands today.Turning to Slide 13 and as promised earlier in the presentation elaborating on the different FLNG designs we have available. We have developed three different designs all based on a generic design  meaning that they will not be tailor made to a specific field  both can be redeployed or interchanged  increasing operational flexibility and reducing residual value risk. They're also based on the same proven liquefaction topside and an extension of Golar’s proven operational track record.The Mark I has a liquefaction capacity of up to 2.7 million tons a year and it's suitable for stranded and associated gas resources. Both Hilli and Gimi are Mark I design FLNGs and are based on conversion of existing LNG must carriers. The Golar Tundra remains a Golar owned conversion candidate for potential future incremental Mark I units.The Mark II design is also a conversion of an existing LNG carrier into an FLNG. However  instead of adding liquefaction equipment to the width of the ship  Mark II places the liquefactiontopside on a new ship midsection added to an existing carrier. This allows for larger liquefaction capacities of up to 3.5 million tons and reduces the conversion construction time. Hence  this is a first direct solution for somewhat larger production projects than for Mark I.Lastly  our Mark III new build design is one we have worked to develop for more than a decade. Mark III has a liquefaction capacity of up to 5 million tons and is competitive also to larger shore-based liquefaction solutions. The lower CapEx per ton and lower carbon footprint even compared to land based solutions make the Mark III more economical faster to deploy liquefaction solution for large liquefaction projects globally.The new build hull also allows for increased storage and leg space. So our primary focus going forward is to develop projects that suit one of these three design alternatives.On page 14  we outlined why we mainly focus on floating African LNG projects when we look at our growth pipeline. When considering FLNG growth project  there are three key input factors that drive the delivery cost for LNG. Those are source gas  liquefaction costs  and lastly the shipping distance or shipping costs from production side to the end user.We believe that you can develop a stable source gas price of between $1 to $3 per MMBtu dependent on the size of the field in question if you target African gas. This compares to current spot prices for Henry Hub source gas in the U.S. where most of incremental liquefaction projects are planned of around $9 per MMBtu today.Secondly  as we are building a fit for purpose efficient liquefaction design in Asia  Golar's CapEx per ton compared to other floating or shore-based liquefaction solutions is very competitive.Lastly  African gas from a geographical point of view has a shorter sailing distance to end users whether they are in Europe or in Asia compared to U.S. liquefaction projects. Hence  if you have a lower input cost  a lower CapEx per ton and a shorter shipping distance  you should have a compelling competitive advantage when looking at the economics of incremental growth projects.Elaborating on that on Slide 15  again  this is a familiar slide that we have presented earlier occasions. But it gives a strong picture of the LNG value chain and the economics of an FLNG project. With source gas in Africa at around $1 per MMBtu  liquefaction cost on a tolling fee basis similar to what we charge BP on the Gimi of between $2 to $3 per MMBtu and shipping cost of around $1.50  African FLNG projects can today deliver LNG to end users for about $5 per MMBtu.If you compare that to current gas prices  these projects have a repayment of less than one year in the current market environment. This backdrop drives our FLNG project pipeline for potential charters and also explain why Golar is focused on projects where we can get exposure to commodity prices  driving the effective tolling fees significantly higher than for long-term tolling fees  as proven by their FLNG Gimi.This business model doesn't only work in a high gas price environment. On the right hand side  we have highlighted the $5 MMBtu of landed LNG price versus historical LNG prices. This business model makes money in most historical LNG price scenarios. However  we are strong believers that the energy and gas prices the next 10 years will be significantly higher than the previous 10 years  and hence FLNG should be an even better business going forward than what we have seen historically.In terms of illustrative economics  a tolling fee based on a large Mark III 5 million pounds FLNG units and a $3 tolling fee  we can generate an EBITDA of such a unit of around $750 million a year versus a CapEx of around 2.5 billion for such a large unit. Integrated projects however  using a 2.5 million ton Mark I design as an example and the landed gas price of $25 per MMBtu  in current gas price environment that would create an annual EBITDA of $2.5 billion to the project owners that we would target to be split between the upstream provider and the FLNG owner. So whether you go integrated or tolling  it's an attractive business. But if you believe as we do that  we will see higher energy prices you want to focus on integrated exposures.Turning the intention to FSRUs and the development that we have seen in Europe year-to-date. We have highlighted how the FSRU market has significantly changed on Slide 17. Entering into 2022  Europe has a total of 32 import facilities where 29 are land based and three are FSRUs.Year-to-date  we have seen 22 potential FSRU project surfacing where eight has already secured an FSRU and 14 remains on the planning stage. This compares to a global FSRU fleet of 46 units and an estimated availability of another three to five units in total between now and 2025. So the way we see it  it's three to five units available to service up to 14 incrementally planned FSRU project. We at Golar have received strong interest from several European countries for our open modern FSRU  the Golar Tundra.Turning to Slide 18  you can see that the gas price fundamentals keep on strengthening and keep on providing length. Starting on the far left  you can see the forward prices in May last year  in January this year and the 28th of May. The point being as one thing is that the front month is constantly lifting  but we're encouraged to see the future gas price also lifting providing further visibility for potential FLNG charters.On the mid side  you can see the expected liquefaction projects to come on between now and 2028. These are essentially pre -- I would call it pre-Ukraine Russia situation liquefaction projects  and this will seem to be needed to meet a balanced LNG market going forward.On the far right  we've taken some statistics to show how meaningful the impact of the Ukraine Russian situation may be on the need for liquefaction going forward.The global LNG market was last year 400 million tons. Russian pipeline gas exports to Europe was last year about 115 million tons  over 25% of the global LNG market. Hence  if European countries are to make really their ambitions to replace Russian gas with international LNG  we need to see a significant ramp up not only of re-gas terminals which key focus is on right now but gas sourcing. Keep in mind that the gas price in December was significantly higher than what it is today  even in the midst of the current situation. So this is a fundamentally tight market pre geopolitical shocks that after we expect it to be significantly stronger for longer.Turning to Slide 19 and a bit further background on last week's announced forward sale of the Golar Arctic. Golar Arctic is the only remaining steam LNG carrier in our fleet  by a long mile  the less competitive assets we have in our fleet. We entered into an agreement with Snam  where they will pursue a development of a virtual pipeline into Sardina. Snam is listed and has a market cap of around EUR18.7 billion.The transaction is a forward sale of the Arctic at €269 million payable in installments as defined milestones. Our estimated conversion CapEx is $160 million  excluding contingencies and vessel costs. Hence  we think that by doing this measure  we have significantly high graded the value of the ship. We found a long-term use for a steam carrier. And we leverage on the learning effects we did from a recent and similar conversion of the Golar Viking which was sold to LNG Croatia.Turning to corporate and Slide 21  Golar recently announced our 2021 ESG report now available on our website. We continue a very strong safety record. We improved lost time injuries. We high grade our AER data  and we're proud to say that throughout the pandemic  we have maintained a very high retention. We have more than 70% of cadets still employed with us  and for senior officers we have a retention of more than 94%. Not only is that important to keep high quality of operations  it's also important to cater for future growth  especially in light of the LNG and new buildings coming on stream going forward.Turning to Slide 22 highlighting the earnings potential from our existing asset portfolio. Last 12 months we made $148 million of EBITDA. And to that the contractual EBITDA of Gimi starting in Q4 of next year and the commodity upside on the commodity link production from Hilli  we expect our run rate EBITDA to be more than $400 million from 2024 onwards.Hence  on a fully delivered basis  we trade up an EBITDA of just shy of seven times with capacity to help at least another two FLNG growth projects just from our current balance sheet position.To summarize on Slide 23  we are a leading owner and operator of pioneering maritime LNG infrastructure  we expect our EBITDA to quadruple in 2024 versus 2021 levels. We have cash and listed securities of 1.4 billion and net -- fully delivered net debt of less than $300 million. We have a book value of -- standing currently at $2.54 billion. And we are very focused on our FLNG growth pipeline going forward.That concludes our Q1 presentation. And I'll now hand it over to the operator for questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Chris Tsung from Weber Research.Chris TsungCan you provide some color on the decision for Snam to convert to Arctic? Was it based on price or timing deployment or price preference by Golar Tundra between any of the two vessels?Karl StauboThis is a project that we have developed with plan over a long time  it predates the geopolitical situation in Europe. I think the backdrop for their decision is the success of the LNG Croatia and the capacity needs in Sardinia and that this would be a cheaper alternative than to buy more modern tonnage for that specific project.Chris TsungI see. And just a follow-up for that. Can we think of the difference between the sale price at EUR269 million and the conversion costs for change? Is that the vessel sales price  is that the right way to think of it?Karl StauboSorry  you're breaking up a bit  is that the difference between?Chris TsungThe EUR269 million and the conversion costs  is that effectively the vessel sale price?Karl StauboThat's of course one way you can put the two  if you take the difference between the deal and net of outstanding debt of around $30 million  you get to the equity balance ownership.Chris TsungAnd just one last quick one  just -- of the three designs to Mark I  II and III  which one could we deployed the fastest?Karl StauboWe're currently working on projects on a tolling fee basis for Mark III  I'm going to integrate the basis where we are balancing the decision between Mark I and II. So it's difficult to say which one comes first  currently  it's tempting to say Mark I or IIOperatorNext question comes from the line of Sean Morgan from Evercore.Sean MorganHey  Karl and Eduardo. Question on the potential conversions and new FLNG. As you said that  net cash balance is obviously -- net debt balance is actually quite low. So you could potentially finance these out of cash. Would you want to do that or would you look at a more balanced approach to incorporate more debt? Or do you kind of look at potential expansion of FLNGs as a way to sort of deleverage as you grow?Karl StauboI think first and foremost  we have cash investment security of $1.4 billion on the company's free cash flow positive every quarter going forward based on the current performance of the group. So that means that all that money can be deployed to growth and around half of it is already in cash form. So I think we can fund one FLNG project just out of available cash the way we see it right now  and should we get more than one FLNG project  we could look up the list and securities position or reliever on Hilli and Gimi which on average has very low leverage at the moment.Sean MorganAnd then another question we get a lot  it's sort of difficult to gauge is in terms of counterparties  off the coast of Africa. And you talked about the low price to extract the gas reserves from that region  but when you think about contracting a new FLNG  do you go to sort of the nation state that controls the oil field or is there like a series of EMP partners that you would kind of be negotiating with first? And how's that process work in terms of converting an idea into an actual FLNG project?Karl StauboIf you think about it  we've worked for BP -- well  we're about to start to work for BP in Africa. We are working for Perenco in Africa. So on both of those that explains to you who the counterparts are  in that context  it's BP and Perenco and they are the ones interfacing with the local government. And to some extent  they're a good representation of the different sort of opportunity sets  one of them on a fixed tolling fees to a solid counterpart for a long time  and one of them with more commodity exposure.So the way we're working this is mainly with partners with a significant presence in country. But it also explains some of the reasoning why it's a bit difficult from consequent to guide on exact findings of when projects will be sanctioned. Because we can want to have done it yesterday and so can the charter  but you're reliant on governmental with all this environmental sign-offs and upstream to be in place. And that's really what's driving the timeline more than the interest from either us or the charter.Sean MorganAnd so beyond your two existing counterparties  though  is there like five to six other EMPs that are working in that region or is it more limited scope of potential partners?Karl StauboThat's a fair statement that you have several other guys operating in that area  [Indiscernible] really look them proven and associated gas reserves and in this market not to waste the resource.OperatorNext question comes from the line of Ben Nolan from Stifel.Ben NolanSo I guess I'll start again on the FLNG side  there's been -- you guys have been working on this for a while. And maybe could you just characterize what the conversations are like today with your customers versus maybe a year ago? There's obviously been some thought that there will be some positive developments  but there haven't been any major incremental ones in last number of years. So how do you think now is different  I guess  is the question.Karl StauboI think what's happened  this is mainly currently a driver of the gas development  and the fact that the gas price -- gas market is tight. You just see the amount of interest when the gas price is high the economics for this project is significantly better  and that's what drove the incremental increase in interest  the first six -- well  up until the Russia-Ukraine situation. After the Russia-Ukraine situation  you've seen first  a massive scramble from Europe to secure FSRUs. Now  they're slowly moving into the LNG carrier market and you can see term rates almost being the below that was operate  even as we enter into the soft part of the air  because Europe is scrambling to secure energy security.And then  ultimately  they now understand that the market was tight. They have created import terminals  but they haven't got their hands on the hydrocarbon. So you now see a lot of these countries leading the way. You've seen the likes of Germany first go to Qatar  then to U.S.  and yesterday  they announced that they think that African gas is a significant part of European -- Europe's energy solution. So that's coming and with the European countries  you can more easily secure offtake and financing than you could pre the Russia-Ukraine situation.Ben NolanSo the people seem to be more serious  is that sort of the takeaway here?Karl StauboThe economics are better  and the financing and offtake are more available than ever?Ben NolanAnd then for my second question  I might slip in a twofer on this one. But so you talk primarily about Africa  and you gave the illustrations about Africa  although in the past  you guys have talked about other regions like the Middle East and Mediterranean  different other places. Are those still on the table first of all  or are they substantially behind? And then for part number two  you talk about two  being able to fund two incremental units  but Mark III  the cost is substantially different than a Mark I. So is that assuming like one Mark III and one Mark I or how should we think about how you're thinking about two units?Karl StauboFirst part of the question is yes  it's also other geographies than just Africa. So that's why we say mainly African gas  because we see the attractions of the input and the distance. But there are other areas  for example  in the Middle East where the gas is essentially free. So that's obviously still part of the project and the considerations or development. But we are focused mainly on African  but there are other projects as well both in the Middle East and elsewhere.Sorry  the second part of your question.Ben NolanHow to think about when you say you can internally fund two projects  Mark I versus Mark II or a combination?Karl StauboIf you take the CapEx on these  you have -- of course  you can source that funding. So if you take the example of Hilli  for example  we have -- when we built our home  it was a $1.4 billion CapEx and we have $960 million of debt available. So that's call it  $500 million equity check  and with a $1.4 billion cash investment securities balance and the free cash flow to equity positive operation  we can fund it through balance sheet.When it comes to the larger assets  you can typically get yard financing which you can look at -- easily get for conversion.Ben NolanSo when you talk about self-funding two of these it's one of each  is that how to think about it?Karl StauboWe will take the project that we think makes the best economics  if that's two Mark IIs or one Mark III and a Mark I  remains to be seen when we announced the project.Ben NolanBut just two in general  that's the capacity is the takeaway. Okay.Karl StauboWe can comfortably fund two from the current balance sheet  and the rest is a timing thing. So you'll -- we generate cash flow pretty much every day. So it depends on the timing or when further units beyond those two  but I think if we double the FLNG fleet  we can look at our situation at that point. But for now  the focus is on getting to the next two.OperatorNext question comes from the line of [Craig Lewis]. Please announce your company name.Unidentified AnalystKarl  I was hoping you could comment a little bit on the ongoing drilling campaign you highlighted in the press release and the well past thing that's going on in West Africa. And really what I'm curious about and maybe it's a little bit of both is  is the driver or the customers doing those drilling campaigns? Is that going to potentially lead to more volumes for the Hilli or is it potentially going to lead to maybe an extension on the Hilli in -- with Perenco?Karl StauboThat's a good question and it's kind of yes to both. So the primary purpose of the drilling campaign we understand is to tie in more proven reserves  so that you increase the gas flow and enable the 0.4 million in increased production. But we have very clearly publicly stated  both to the market and of course to Perenco  and SNH  the governmental body [indiscernible] is that we will not enter into extension discussions until they declare that point four  because currently  we of course  have paid for equipment that’s not fully utilized and every incremental production is straight through to net income or free cash flow to equity utilized. And we don't want to be working on any extensions until we better utilize the equipment already in place.But you know  it can show gaps that could lead to an extension discussions as well. But for us  it's sort of  you have to tackle one obstacle at a time and for us  it's the increased production of the key driver on Hilli right now.Unidentified AnalystAnd then realizing that we were selling the steam  the Arctic  obviously  you're highlighting the Tundra and the opportunities for the Tundra. I guess a two part question there. One is  as we think about the path forward for the Tundra  is that more around an asset sale? Or could we potentially just see that be contracted and remain a core part of the fleet? And just piggybacking on that question  are there opportunities for Golar to expand its FSRU footprint?Karl StauboSo to the first part of your question. At the beginning of this year  there were several FSRU projects being worked  none of them in Europe. I think with both happened in the geopolitical situation  as we tried to highlight on the slide  the incremental increase in new FSRU projects out of Europe is unprecedented. And on the balance  we are very confident that unit will end up in Europe and not elsewhere.If you look at what's communicated by the various governments in Europe  some of them are targeting and chartering opportunities  and some of them are targeting acquisition of units. I think  for us  we remain agnostic whether we sell or charter  we will do what we think caters for the best risk adjusted economics. And that's our target and with the amount of interest and the specification of Tundra  we feel very comfortable about that situation.When it comes to the second part of your question  what we want to focus on going forward is FLNG project  because we think we have a unique competitive edge. And we still think that the economics of FLNG projects is the most compelling in the LNG value chain  at least for the next decade or so. However  we have no non-compete with any of the corporate transactions  but we have come to that over the last 12 months. And should there be an attractive FSRU project coming up  there's no reason why we should not take it on. However  I would highlight that our focus is FLNG growth  but we remain open to anyone who wants to talk to us or any attractive LNG infrastructure business.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.Craig ShereSo besides the gander that you already have  how do you see availability of vessels for acquisition for additional Mark I or Mark II conversions? And do you have any thoughts about timing and announcement of a full 2.4 MTPA deployment of the Hilli post your mid 2026 [Franco] contract expiration?Karl StauboSo  when you talk about source vessels for Mark I or Mark II  those will most likely be based on the most design carrier  so the one with a bolt on top. Those carriers are mainly steam carriers that will face significant operational challenges due to the new environmental regulations from first of January  so basically the new EEXI and CII regulations. Hence  these ships will be less suitable for -- to operate as LNG carriers and more suitable for floating storage jobs or as conversion candidates  whether for FSRU or FLNG.Because of the amount of those ships that will become less competitive for shipping and therefore need to find alternative works with a limited amount of companies with a track record of successfully redeploying or re-characterizing those types of ships  we're confident that there will be vessels available for conversion candidates.To the second part of your question when it comes to Hilli  I think we always try to do A before we do B before we do C and so forth. And for us  the next step on Hilli is to secure the 0.4 million tons in July of this year. After that  I think it's for sure in depending on Cameroon's government to try to find solutions to keep that unit in concrete. For both of them  this has been a massive economical success. And we think both of them have an interest in keeping the unit in country.On the other hand  I think the operational track record and the fact that the unit has no construction risks  and lastly that is very soon  the quickest FLNG you can get your hands on internationally  we think that in this gas price environment her attractiveness for potential work outside of Cameroon is increasingly attracted by the day. So to try to give some guidance on when we think we have development there  we would say it's hard to -- probably up to 12 months after the 0.4 or so  by summer next year or so  in that time period.Craig ShereAnd one last question on FLNG negotiations for new projects. I think we all understand that the upstream producers are your counterparties. But how many upstream producers have -- in Africa have set in stone relationships as far as royalties  profit sharing  what have you with the host governments? And to the degree  there's a major upsizing of a play with say  your FLNG that that reopen these things and make very complicated discussions where obviously the host governments want to get as much value from the current market as possible?Karl StauboThat's an extremely qualified question. And I think you're touching upon parts of the core of why the reason some of these projects  it's a bit difficult to guide on exactly when they will happen. I think it's fair to say that neither us nor any upstream partners would enter into such projects without very clear agreement with host governments on these specific points that we touched on  like the agreements on how things should be shared  flexibility and so forth. This is basically the key gating item in terms of timeline for the new FIDs. The flip side of the argument is that these are stranded gas reserves that are proven  and no one has the technology to monetize those fields. That's what we cater for. Today  we don't see anyone else doing FLNG or floating liquefaction as a service. We have a very proven track record of this. So therefore  I think we are the solution in terms of monetizing the unit. And it's a matter of finding a fair framework that works for the government  the upstream partner and for us.OperatorNext question comes from the line of Chris Robertson from Jefferies.Chris RobertsonOn the NFE shares  how are you guys thinking about those in terms -- are you just wanting to hold them until you need to monetize ahead of a new FLNG project or what's the thinking there?Karl StauboAnd that's a good question  Chris. So I think as you know  we got 18.6 million shares in total consideration when we sold high growth -- the share component of the consideration. Earlier in May  we sold one-third of that holding  freeing up $253 million. We liked the development of NFE. We like the direction they are taking the company. However  we have no lockup and no board system  no access to any nonpublic information. Hence  we're pretty much free to do what we want with that shareholding. The way we see it now  it's far better to sit NFE than to sit cash. And we have significant balance sheet flexibility to fund at least 1 FLNG project without touching that facility -- I'm sorry  those shares  and for now we are holders of the name.Chris RobertsonIs there any room for I guess a greater partnership with New Fortress now that they're getting into some floating LNG with offshore rigs  any expertise that you could offer or discussions there?Karl StauboI think  it was disclosed by NFE and Wes Edens on his earnings calls. We are as Golar  working together with NFE helping them out to develop their first LNG solution both on the engineering side and also on the operational side. Keep in mind  Golar still operates all of the maritime assets like the ships and the FSRUs that we sold to NFE. So we have a good working relationship on sort of all levels of the organizations. There's currently no specific plans  but I think we would certainly be open to working together when the right opportunities arise.OperatorNext question comes from the line of Nick [Linan] [indiscernible].Unidentified AnalystHow many yards are there that you think can do Mark I or Mark II conversions? And how many do you think could do Mark III new builds? And do you have any guaranteed slots for either of those types of work? And if so  like when you have options on those slots until -- because it seems like the odds are getting quite --Karl StauboThat's a very correct observation. They are getting extremely busy. So to some extent  that's a bit of an unusual situation for I think anyone in the maritime space  we haven't seen that since sort of the 2006 to 2008 cycle. But then again  the yard capacity has been built down significantly since then. And then the resurgence in activity has caused longer lead times  and obviously the general surprise squeeze globally.But to answer your question on Mark III  we think it's essentially one shipyard that we are -- that we think is up to the part. And on that one  we are in detailed discussion about securing slots.The way the shipyards think about things is that they are of course selling most of the capacities to fairly aggressive LNG carrier and container orders  but they are saving some space for what they call large offshore infrastructure projects. They have learned over time as most other people have the shipping markets are cyclical. And it's not wise of them to build down engineering and offshore capabilities because you never know when they are in demand and when that ramps up activity.So they are saving some slots for larger projects  but it's a limit to how long they hold the slots given the pressure on container and LNG carrier orders. That said  I think we have long standing relationships with the key yards in question and we are currently working to secure slot options for Mark IIIs.When it comes to Mark Is we have built Keppel in Singapore  and we think that’s the best shipyard to build Mark Is. We have not explored others and we have no intention to explore other for Mark Is either. When it comes to Mark IIs that's considered to be done at a different shipyard from both Mark I to Mark IIIs. So basically  we have one select shipyard we’ve been working on with -- for quite some time on Mark II and III and we're already having a very established relationship with Keppel on Mark Is.OperatorThank you. There are no more questions at this time. I would like to hand back over to Karl Staubo for final remarks.Karl StauboThank you all for listening in and for good questions and we look forward to connecting with you next quarter.

Kennedy  L-1855 Luxembourg R.C.S. Luxembourg B-124.284(the Company)Important Notice to Shareholders of the Company27 May 2022The board of directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”) hereby informs the shareholders of the Company (the “Shareholders”) about certain changes to the sub-funds of the Company (the “Sub-Funds”) permitted to undertake securities lending  as outlined below.Capitalised terms used in this notice shall have the same meaning ascribed to them in the latest version of the prospectus of the Company (the “Prospectus”)  unless the context otherwise requires.Change of Securities Lending AgentDeutsche Bank AG  acting through its Frankfurt am Main head office and its London and New York branches  currently acts as the securities lending agent appointed by the Company (the “Securities Lending Agent”). The Securities Lending Agent is authorised (i) to enter into Securities Lending Transactions on behalf of the Company and (ii) to invest any cash received/held on behalf of the Company as collateral pursuant to such Securities Lending Transactions (the “Securities Lending Services”).With effect from on or around 28 June 2022 (the “Effective Date”)  the Securities Lending Agent’s appointment will be terminated and the Investment Manager  DWS Investment GmbH  will take over the provision of the Securities Lending Services.Change of the maximum proportion of assets subject to Securities Lending for Direct Replication FundsThe current Prospectus provides that a Direct Replication Fund may enter into Securities Lending Transactions for up to 50 percent of its assets (the “Maximum Securities Lending Transactions Proportion”) to generate additional income and thereby offset part or all of its costs. While all assets of a Sub-Fund which engages in Securities Lending Transactions will be eligible for such transactions (with no distinction as regards asset classes in which the Sub-Fund may invest)  the expected proportion of a Sub-Fund's net assets subject to Securities Lending Transactions will typically vary between 0 percent. and 50 percent. for each relevant Sub-Fund (the “Expected Securities Lending Transactions Proportion”).As of the Effective Date  the Maximum Securities Lending Transactions Proportion of relevant Direct Replication Funds will be increased from up to 50 percent to up to 100 percent of its assets. For the avoidance of doubt  the Expected Securities Lending Transactions Proportion will remain unchanged.Securities Lending FeesCurrently  as provided in the relevant Product Annexes  a Sub-Fund undertaking Securities Lending Transactions is allocated 85 percent of the associated revenue generated  of which the Sub-Fund receives 70 percent  with the remaining 15 percent being received by the Sub-Portfolio Manager  DWS Investments UK Limited. The outstanding 15 percent is allocated to the Securities Lending Agent.As of the Effective Date  the fees relating to Securities Lending Transactions will change so that the Sub-Fund is allocated 70 percent of the associated revenue generated  with the remaining 30 percent allocated to the Management Company  DWS Investment S.A.. The Management Company shall  out of the revenues allocated to it  (i) be entitled to retain 5 percent of such 30 percent amount (that is 1.5 percent of the overall associated revenue generated) as its fee for the oversight and monitoring of the securities lending activities  (ii) pay all costs and fees directly incurred in respect of securities lending activities (including custody  transaction and collateral management and administration costs)  and (iii) pay such revenues as remain following payment of (i) and (ii) to the Investment Manager. The Investment Manager shall  out of the revenues it receives from the Management Company  pay all costs and expenses indirectly incurred in respect of securities lending activities (including but not limited to operational  information technology  legal  compliance and audit costs).For the avoidance of doubt  there will be no change in the proportion of revenues generated in relation to Securities Lending Transactions attributable to the Sub-Funds  with such proportion continuing to be 70 percent of the associated revenue generated.Changes in the Collateral Arrangements in respect of Securities Lending TransactionsIn order to mitigate the counterparty risk in relation to Securities Lending Transactions  collateral may be received in accordance with the collateral arrangement set out in the Prospectus.Currently the collateral received pursuant to Securities Lending Transactions can be held by both the Securities Lending Agent and/or The Bank of New York Mellon.As of the Effective Date  different entities may be involved in the collateral management or administration services  depending on the lender and/or collateral management structure. More specifically  the Management Company will delegate:Collateral services for Securities Lending Transactions for certain Sub-Funds to State Street Bank International GmbH  Zweigniederlassung Frankfurt with a sub-delegation for certain Sub-Funds to Euroclear Bank SA / NV; andManagement of collateral for Securities Lending Transactions for certain Sub-Funds to The Bank of New York Mellon  Bruxelles branch (Belgium) with sub-delegation to its London  New York  Orlando and Singapore branches and BNY Mellon International Operations India Private Limited  from time to time.As of the Effective Date  the collateral eligibility requirements will also change. The section “Collateral Arrangements in respect of Securities Lending Transaction(s)” of the Prospectus will be amended to reflect the new collateral requirements.General InformationShareholders who subscribe for Shares in the Sub-Funds on the primary market and who do not agree with the changes  are entitled to redeem their Shares in the Sub-Funds in accordance with the Prospectus. Such redemptions shall be free of any Redemption Charge from the date of this notice until 5:00 p.m. (Luxembourg time) on 27 June 2022. Please note that the Company does not charge any redemption fee for the sale of Shares in the secondary market. Orders to sell Shares through a stock exchange can be placed via an authorised intermediary or stockbroker. Shareholders should note that orders in the secondary market may incur costs over which the Company has no control and to which the above exemption on Redemption Charges does not apply.Copies of the revised Prospectus and the key information documents of the Sub-Funds reflecting the changes will be made available on the website of the Company (www.Xtrackers.com) on or around the Effective Date  and copies thereof may be obtained on request free of charge at the registered office of the Company or at the offices of foreign representatives  once available.Shareholders who have any queries or to whom any of the above is not clear should seek advice from their stockbroker  bank manager  legal advisor  accountant or other independent financial advisor. Shareholders should also consult their own professional advisors as to the specific tax implications under the laws of the countries of their nationality  residence  domicile or incorporation.Further information in relation to the changes may be obtained from the legal entities mentioned under Contact information below  the offices of foreign representatives or by sending an email to Xtrackers@dws.com.Neither the contents of the Company's website nor the contents of any other website accessible from hyperlinks on the Company's website is incorporated into  or forms part of  this announcement.Xtrackers IIThe Board of DirectorsContact InformationXtrackers II49  avenue J.F.

In each case the proxy must be received by Link Group at PXS1   10th Floor  Central Square  29 Wellington Street  Leeds LS1 4DL by 10am on 27 June 2022 6. If you return more than one proxy appointment  either by paper or electronic communication  the appointment received last by the Registrar before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence. You are advised to read the terms and conditions of use carefully. Electronic communication facilities are open to all shareholders and those who use them will not be disadvantaged. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Meeting (and any adjournment of the Meeting) by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual(available fromwww.euroclear.com/site/public/EUI). CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a 'CREST Proxy Instruction') must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited's specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent (ID RA10) by 10am on 27 June 2022 For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to mean the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST application host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time  any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will  therefore  apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member  or sponsored member  or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. Any corporation which is a shareholder can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a shareholder provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers in relation to the same shares. As at 26 May 2022 (being the latest practicable business day prior to the publication of this Notice)  the Company's ordinary issued share capital consists of ordinary shares  carrying one vote each. 3 Therefore  the total voting rights in the Company as at 26 May 2022 are 1 080 816 000. 12. Under Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006  shareholders meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company's financial statements (including the Auditor's Report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Meeting; or (ii) any circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual financial statements and reports were laid in accordance with Section 437 of the Companies Act 2006 (in each case) that the shareholders propose to raise at the relevant meeting. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with Sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006  it must forward the statement to the Company's auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Meeting for the relevant financial year includes any statement that the Company has been required under Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website. The Company must cause to be answered any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the Meeting but no such answer need be given if: (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the Meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the Meeting that the question be answered. The following documents are available for inspection during normal business hours at the registered office of the Company on any business day from the date of this Notice until the time of the Meeting: copies of the Directors' letters of appointment or service contracts.

A copy of this Notice  and other information required by Section 311A of the Companies Act 2006  can be found on the Company's website at https://bravebison.com/ 4 Explanation of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting For the benefit of shareholders we provide the following notes concerning some of the resolutions to be placed before them at the Annual General Meeting: Resolution 1: Accounts and reportsFor each financial period  the Directors are required to lay the audited accounts  the Directors' report and the auditors' report before the Company in general meeting. Resolution 2: Reappointment of auditors At each general meeting at which accounts are laid before shareholders  the Company is required to appoint auditors to serve until the next such meeting. Accordingly  resolution 2 seeks the reappointment of Moore Kingston Smith LLP as the Company's auditors to serve until the next annual general meeting of the Company and  in accordance with normal practice  authorises the Directors to determine their remuneration. Resolutions 3 and 4: Directors' authority to allot sharesThe Directors may only allot shares or grant rights over shares if authorised to do so by the shareholders. The Directors also require additional authority from shareholders to allot shares or grant rights over shares where they propose to do so for cash and otherwise than to existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings. The authorities granted at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 27 May 2021 are due to expire at the Company's Annual General Meeting in 2022 or on 17 September 2022  whichever is the earlier  and therefore require renewal. Resolutions 3 and 4  if passed  will continue to give the Directors flexibility to act in the best interests of the shareholders  when the opportunity arises  by issuing new shares. Resolution 4 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to grant a new authority to allot unissued share capital up to an aggregate nominal value of £360 272.00  representing approximately one-third of the issued share capital of the Company as at 26 May 2022  and a further authority to allot an additional one- third of the issued share capital of the Company as at 26 May 2022 provided that such allotment is reserved for rights issues. Resolution 5 will be proposed as a special resolution to allot shares or grant rights over shares for cash and otherwise than to existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings. The authority will be limited to shares issued up to a maximum aggregate nominal value of £108 082.00 being 10% of the issued Ordinary Share capital. These two authorities  if given  will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting in 2023 or on the date which is 15 months after the relevant resolution is passed. 5 This is an excerpt of the original content.

5619,Euroclear,Google API,https://mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-minutes-of-the-securities-lending-committee-meeting-may-2022/,Bank Of England: Minutes Of The Securities Lending Committee Meeting – May 2022 - The Securities Lending Committee Is A Forum For Market Participants And Authorities To Discuss The UK Securities Lendi,2 hours ago,Time: 2pm-3.30pm | Location: 20 MoorgateMinutes Item 1 – Introductory remarks The Chair confirmed that the minutes of the November 2021 meeting were published on the Bank of England’s (BoE) website and had no comments to raise on the minutes from that meeting. The Chair welcomed additional attendees (Shikha Kalra  Debashree Tripathy  Tina Baker  and Charles Jomar Alino) to the meeting. Item 2 – recent market trends and observations A challenging macro environment drove equity markets in Q1  stemming from: the Russia/Ukraine conflict  hawkish monetary policy communications  rate hikes and the prospect of Quantitative Tightening. Clients had rotated into value and away from growth stocks. Equity capital market activity had slowed as liquidity conditions deteriorated but are expected to pick up in Q3. Increased market volatility was supporting revenues in some markets but this in part was dependent on risk appetite and contagion risk. Cash reinvestment returns increased  following interest rate rises in US. Capital requirements and Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) continued to be a focus for the industry. On-loan balances picked up in Q1 partly driven by increased market volatility. The securities lending market continued to face a lack of specials  although there was still some interest in travel and airline stocks. Corporate bond demand was strong  as was demand for Exchange Traded Products (ETPs). Hedge Funds preferred to express market views through ETPs rather than through sectoral shorts. Hedge fund performance was mixed with some strategies experiencing double-digit losses  although most quant funds have fared better. The Central Securities Depositary Regulation (CSDR) continues to draw many resources. The industry is trying to move to increased automation and leverage use of technology but this will take time. There continues to be a number of issues and numerous trade breaks. Settlement rates have improved marginally in the UK and Europe but continue to lag the US - although it benefits from a less fragmented market place. The Committee agreed that inefficiencies in settlement were not uniform across product classes  with settlement rates of corporate bonds significantly lower than fixed income or equities. Equities settlement benefited from increased automation. The liquidity issues in corporate bonds arise because of structural inefficiencies in the settlement process rather than CSDR. These issues are coming to light due to the high volume of trades going through the system. The Committee felt that CSDR fines were not high enough to justify their processing costs. The Committee discussed Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) as an asset class. There was consensus that the UK and European SPACs markets had not taken off in the same way as that in the US. And that the ‘shelf life’ of the SPACs asset class could be getting shorter based off limited interest this year compared to 2021. Item 3 – Voting The committee discussed a well-publicised instance where one counterparty had borrowed shares for voting purposes at an AGM. The Bank stated that they were disappointed that this transaction had taken place in clear breach of Chapter 4  section 6.3 of the UK Money Markets Code  and would be discussed further at the Code Sub-Committee. The Bank re-iterated that borrowing specifically to vote was against the widely agreed best practice in the market. ISLA supported the views of the Bank. The Committee agreed that trading protocols in this example fell outside of best practice. Given the link between the Code and the Senior Managers Regime  Committee members felt that this case also raised important questions about the governance surrounding this trade. The Committee agreed that the wording in the UK Money Market Code was clear on the topic of borrowing shares for voting at an AGM. It was agreed that the Code should be upheld all times to give institutional investors confidence that their shares and lending actions would not be contorted by the actions of borrowers. It was agreed that issues of this nature could impact the confidence of Institutional Investors and limit the supply of stock to the market. The Committee discussed the US treatment of loaned shares over AGMs. The SEC have placed the onus on lenders to define the purpose of the lending transactions and to call out instances where their shares that are out on loan but not recalled over the AGM dates. The Committee discussed whether there are opportunities for consolidated trade surveillance based of widely available data. In this instance  only STFR reporting would reveal how the position is building up. Item 4 - Agent lender disclosures ISLA have now established a working group that have met three times to reinstate and develop standards around agent lender disclosure. Agent lender disclosure provides an industry standard for agent lenders and broker-dealers to exchange underlying principal level detail information related to transactions executed under securities lending agreements. The initiative established a standard process and infrastructure among industry participants. The key challenge in this initiative will be securing the agreement of the lending and borrowing community on ‘Know-Your-Customer’ data standards. Item 5 - Tokenised collateral This item will now be discussed at the next meeting. Item 6 – ESG Most firms did not lend Russian or Ukraine securities and collateral over the last few months  and they were also excluded from collateral sets. Some members discussed that work was initially required to define what constitutes a Russian security; one example shared was that of a non-Russia security with Russian beneficial owner. In the end  a cautious approach was adopted and the security was not lent. The Committee agreed that there was some reliance on ETFs and tri-party agents to continue to monitor the underlying assets  but felt that tri-parties were well practised in managing sanctions. Most lenders sought to recall their Russian assets. But there were different messages from Clearstream and Euroclear with regards to the timing and opening of Bridge Settlements. Some members felt that their instructions where not clear on when the sanctions where being applied and to which securities. Item 7 - D&I The London network of Women in Securities Finance (WISF) continues to grow in membership. As the industry returns to in-person events  the group this year has intentionally focussed on networking opportunities. Earlier this year it completed full launch of a new networking initiative called ‘Grow Your Network’ (GYN) this enables women to establish connections with other people across the securities finance industry  helping to advance them professionally  as well as giving them the opportunity to support others to grow. ‘Grow Your Network’ creates a series of one-to-one connections by pairing WISF members with individuals where opportunities to cross paths may not have existed  for short icebreaker introductions. Pairings take into consideration backgrounds  experience  and different grades  to ensure diverse matching. The WISF London Network aims to run at least two rounds of GYN this year. Its first in-person networking event will take place at the ISLA Annual Conference in Vienna on June 6-8th  which will be open to all delegates  inclusive of all genders  and present opportunity for members to connect across the growing membership. Item 8 - AOB The Committee will seek to discuss at a future meeting implementation of the output floor under Basel 4. Based on the proposals some Beneficial Owners will not be rated. There was interest from some Committee members to discuss how to incorporate this in the future regime.

The Board of Directors recommend a vote for the approval of Resolutions 1 to 6. 6 Resolutions 7 and 8: Appointment of auditors and determination of auditors' remuneration At each general meeting at which the accounts are laid before shareholders  the Company is required to appoint auditors to serve until the next such general meeting. KPMG LLP has indicated its willingness to continue to act as the Company's auditors. Accordingly  Resolution 7 is an ordinary resolution to re-appoint KPMG LLP  an English registered limited liability partnership  as the Company's statutory auditor in the UK to serve until the next AGM of the Company. Resolution 8 is an ordinary resolution giving the Company's Audit Committee authority to determine the auditors' remuneration for the fiscal year ending 31 December 2022. The Board of Directors recommend a vote for the approval of Resolutions 7 and 8. Resolution 9: Receipt of the reports and accounts The Companies Act 2006 (the ""CA 2006"") requires the directors of a public company to lay  in respect of each financial year  copies of the directors' reports  the independent auditors' report and the audited financial statements of the Company before the Company's shareholders. Each report and the audited financial statements of the Company are contained in the 2021 Annual Report. In accordance with best practice  the Company proposes an ordinary resolution to receive the 2021 Annual Report. The 2021 Annual Report may be found in the ""Investor Relations"" section of the Company website at: https://ir.achillestx.com/agm2022 . The Board of Directors recommend a vote for the approval of Resolution 9. Resolution 10: Directors' Remuneration Policy In accordance with the requirements of the CA 2006  as a UK resident company listed on Nasdaq  the Company is required to establish a Directors' Remuneration Policy containing a framework of limits within which the Remuneration Committee of the Board is authorised by shareholders to operate. This policy must be approved by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders at the first general meeting of the Company at which the Company lays copies of the directors' reports  the independent auditors' report and the audited financial statements of the Company before the Company's shareholders and every three years thereafter. Given that the forthcoming AGM is the first at which the Company is required to lay the Directors' Remuneration Policy before the shareholders  the Company is seeking shareholder approval in respect of the proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy  which sets out the Company's forward-looking policy on Directors' remuneration. Further details of the proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy are set out on pages 15 to 24 of the 2021 Annual Report. The Board of Directors recommend a vote for the approval of Resolution 10. Resolution 11: UK statutory directors' annual report on remuneration The CA 2006 requires that the annual report on directors' remuneration  contained within the 2021 Annual Report  be subject to an annual advisory  non-binding vote so that shareholders may indicate  by voting on an ordinary resolution  their approval of the remuneration of the Company's directors in the relevant financial year  as well as how the Company's remuneration policy will be applied in the following financial year. 7 The full text of the Company's remuneration report is set out at pages 24 to 32 of the 2021 Annual Report and sets out the Company's policy towards  and gives details of  Directors' remuneration and other relevant information. This vote is advisory and non-binding. Although non-binding  our Board  and the Remuneration Committee of the Board  will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our director remuneration program and the application of our Directors' Remuneration Policy. Following the upcoming AGM  and as required by the CA 2006  the directors' annual report on remuneration will be delivered to the UK Registrar of Companies. The Board of Directors recommend a vote for the approval  on a non-binding  advisory basis  of Resolution 11. 8 SHAREHOLDER NOTES VOTING - ADS Holders You are entitled to exercise your vote as a holder of an interest in the capital of the Company represented by ADSs if you or your brokerage firm  bank or nominee is registered as a holder of ADSs at 17:00 Eastern Standard Time on 19 May 2022 (the ""Record Date"" for ADS holders).

By order of the Board Edwin Moses Chairman 26 May 2022 Registered Office: 245 Hammersmith Road  London W6 8PW  United Kingdom 11 Notice of Meeting - Further Notes 1. The Company  pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended)  specifies that only those members registered in the Company's Register of Members of the Company at 17:00 (UK time) on 24 June 2022 (or if the Meeting is adjourned  members entered on the Register of Members of the Company not later than 17:00 (UK time) on the date which is two working days before the date of the adjourned Meeting) shall be entitled to attend  speak and vote at the AGM in respect of the number of ordinary shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries on the Register of Members of the Company after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend  speak or vote at the Meeting. 2. A member entitled to attend  speak and vote at the Meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of his/her rights to attend  speak and to vote instead of him/her. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the Meeting in person. If a member wishes his/her proxy to speak on his/her behalf at the Meeting he/she will need to appoint his/her own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give his/her instructions directly to them. Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending  speaking and voting at the Meeting or any adjournment thereof in person. If a proxy is appointed and the member attends the Meeting in person  the proxy appointment will automatically be terminated. 3. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. A member may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy  please sign and date the form of proxy and attach a schedule listing the names and addresses (in block letters) of all of your proxies  the number of shares in respect of which each proxy is appointed (which  in aggregate  should not exceed the number of shares held by you) and indicating how you wish each proxy to vote or abstain from voting. If you wish to appoint the Chairman as one of your multiple proxies  simply write ""the Chairman of the Meeting"". 4. A form of proxy is enclosed and details of how to appoint and direct a proxy to vote on each resolution are set out in the notes to the form of proxy. To be valid the form of proxy must be completed and signed  and lodged with the Company at 245 Hammersmith Road  London W6 8PW  marked for the attention of the Company Secretary  no later than 17:00 (UK time) on 24 June 2022 and in the event of adjournment not less than 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before the time fixed for the Meeting together with  if appropriate  the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a notarially certified or office copy of such power or authority. In the case of a member which is a Company  the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the Company or an attorney for the Company. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the form of proxy. 5. In the case of joint holders  the signature of only one of the joint holders is required on the form of proxy. In the event that more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  the appointment submitted by the first named holder on the Register of Members of the Company will be accepted to the exclusion of the other joint holder. 6. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a member provided that  if it is appointing more than one corporate representative  it does not do so in relation to the same shares. It is therefore no longer necessary to nominate a designated corporate representative. 7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the AGM and any adjournment(s) of the Meeting by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service 12 provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ""CREST Proxy Instruction"") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited's specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the Company's agent (ID: BO011) no later than 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before the Meeting. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his/her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. 8. A vote withheld is not a vote in law  which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution  and if no voting indication is given  a proxy may vote or abstain from voting at his/her discretion. A proxy may vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the Meeting. 9. In order to revoke a proxy instruction a member will need to send a signed hard copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke a proxy appointment to the Company at 245 Hammersmith Road  London W6 8PW  marked for the attention of the Company Secretary  together with  if appropriate  the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a notarially certified or office copy of such power or authority. In the case of a member  which is a company  the notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the company. 10. If shareholder or an ADR holder wishes to listen to the webcast of the AGM  please email your name (and name of the shareholder or ADR holder you represent  if applicable)  address and email ID to shares@achillestx.com with '2022 AGM Webcast' in the title line. The Company will email the access details directly to the shareholder or ADR holder to access the webcast. The email must be received by the Company by no later than 17:00 (UK Time) (12:00 Eastern time) on 21 June 2022 in order for the shareholder or ADR holder to be entitled to access the webcast. Please note that ADR holders will not be able to vote as part of the AGM webcast and  as a result  you are strongly encouraged to submit a proxy form to ensure that you are able to participate in the business of the meeting. 13 11.

You may not use any electronic address provided either in this notice of AGM or any related documents (including the annual report and accounts and proxy form) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated. 14 Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Achilles Therapeutics plc published this content on 26 May 2022 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

5621,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.ifre.com/story/3381899/russia-faces-credit-event-question-again-dxt15bmh4p,Russia faces credit event question – again,"There was a sense of deja vu over Russia's status in the international financial markets after a market participant posed a question to a derivatives industry body on Thursday about ""a failure to pay credit event"" by the sovereign.","There was a sense of deja vu over Russia's status in the international financial markets after a market participant posed a question to a derivatives industry body on Thursday about ""a failure to pay credit event"" by the sovereign. A ruling in favour could lead to payouts to holders of credit default swap contracts against Russia.It is the latest in a series of questions the EMEA Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee has fielded around a potential Russian default since the country's invasion of Ukraine in February. Most recently  the 14-member committee ruled unanimously in April that ""a potential failure to pay"" had occurred after Russia threatened to make payments due on two US dollar bonds in roubles. The triggering of CDS contracts was eventually averted after Russia paid its international bondholders in US dollars before the two bonds' grace period had expired.One of the bonds subject to the committee's ruling in April was the sovereign 4.5% April 2022s and that note is at the heart of this latest question. This time the issue isn't about the potential currency of payment  instead bondholders argue that Russia owes about US$1.9m in accrued interest on the bond.Principal and coupon payments were due on April 4. But because Russia was unable to service the debt through its offshore reserves following further US government restrictions  it didn't make the payments until May 2 after Moscow decided to use its onshore assets. It made US$564.8m of principal and coupon payments on the April 2022s and US$84.4m of coupon payments on its April 2042s.Holders of the 2022s argue that Russia has not paid the interest accrued beyond April 4  ""putting it in default under the bonds""  according to a statement on the DC website.The bondholders said they ""submitted a default notice via Euroclear"" on May 11 ""demanding the payment"". They added that despite the demand  ""Russia has not paid the interest owed"".There is currently US$2.54bn of net notional CDS in Russia CDS to be settled  according to JP Morgan.Determine thisThe DC is meeting on May 27. Even if it rules that a credit event has occurred that would not be a formal declaration that Russia has defaulted  although it should lead to the CDS being triggered.Indeed  quite how any declaration of default can be made when the ratings agencies are no longer allowed to cover Russia remains to be seen. But even if the non-payment of the accrued interest isn't considered by market participants as a formal default  it seems only a matter of time before US actions push Russia into that situation.A special waiver  General License 9C  issued by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control that had let US citizens receive Russian bond payments was allowed to expire on May 25. Analysts said the decision had set the stage for Russia to default on its US$40bn or so of foreign currency bonds.""The game of chicken ended with OFAC putting the Russian chicken out of its misery "" said Tim Ash  senior EM sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. ""It's only a matter of time now before Russia formally defaults.""That could be in roughly a month's time – not on the April 2022s but on two other bonds  the US$3bn 4.75% 2026s and €1bn 2.65% 2036s.On May 20  Russia's finance ministry brought forward coupon payments on those two bonds even though they were not due until May 27. By making the payments to its National Settlement Depository  Russia said it had fulfilled its current obligations on the notes.Yet the funds have not been channelled to investors  according to one foreign holder of Russia's bonds  although he noted there was often a time lag.Whether  following OFAC's decision  the payments will still be processed to bondholders isn't clear. ""In theory  there is a chance that the payment may be processed even if the licence is not extended  since the finance ministry is technically not involved in the further stages of money flow "" said an analyst. ""On the 27th  the NSD will debit Euroclear’s account with the NSD and then Euroclear will either process the payment or not.""Euroclear did not respond to a request for comment.Grace under pressureEven if the monies on the 2026s and 2036s do eventually hit investors' accounts – they both have 30-day grace periods – Russia has further coupon payments due in June. A payment due on June 24 on the US dollar 12.75% 2028s looks vulnerable to OFAC's decision.""The 24th June bond is paid offshore and so without General License 9C [a payment] will presumably not be able to be made. That would then trigger a failure to pay CDS trigger after the 15 business day grace period "" said JP Morgan analysts.Investors might take other action  too. Holders of any affected sovereign bond may be tempted to accelerate  demanding all monies owed to them are paid.According to one restructuring lawyer  this is not commonly done where a formal negotiation between the debtor and its creditors is possible. However  in this situation such lawsuits might be filed since negotiations are unlikely and Russia has plenty of assets overseas  such as oil cargoes or central bank reserves  that could be seized by bondholders.According to Reuters  Russia's finance ministry said last week that the US Treasury's decision to end the waiver ""primarily infringes on the rights of the foreign investors in the Russian debt instruments"". It said the sovereign would continue to service its external debt in roubles  which could then be converted into the currency of issuance via the NSD.On Thursday  Interfax reported that finance minister Anton Siluanov said Russia was working on a new ""mechanism"" to facilitate future payments to its creditors  but did not give any further details.Additional reporting by Christopher Spink",negative,0.01,0.18,0.81,mixed,0.02,0.13,0.84,True,English,"['credit event question', 'Russia', 'EMEA Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee', '15 business day grace period', 'senior EM sovereign strategist', ""two bonds' grace period"", 'credit default swap contracts', 'two US dollar bonds', 'derivatives industry body', 'General License 9C', 'BlueBay Asset Management', 'National Settlement Depository', 'one foreign holder', '30-day grace periods', 'one restructuring lawyer', 'international financial markets', 'US government restrictions', 'two other bonds', 'net notional CDS', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'foreign currency bonds', 'potential Russian default', 'JP Morgan analysts', '24th June bond', 'Russian bond payments', 'credit event', 'CDS contracts', 'potential currency', '14-member committee', 'other action', 'sovereign bond', 'US dollars', 'US actions', 'US Treasury', 'US citizens', 'default notice', 'formal default', 'Russian chicken', 'deja vu', 'market participant', 'offshore reserves', 'onshore assets', 'DC website', 'The DC', 'ratings agencies', 'special waiver', 'Tim Ash', 'finance ministry', 'current obligations', 'money flow', 'CDS trigger', 'formal negotiation', 'international bondholders', 'sovereign 4.5% April', 'coupon payments', 'potential failure', 'latest question', 'April 2042s', 'formal declaration', ""investors' accounts"", 'time lag', 'April 2022s', 'Russia CDS', 'US$', 'sense', 'status', 'Thursday', 'ruling', 'favour', 'payouts', 'series', 'questions', 'country', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'roubles', 'triggering', 'note', 'heart', 'issue', 'accrued', 'interest', 'Principal', 'debt', 'May', 'Moscow', 'statement', 'Euroclear', 'demand', 'matter', 'situation', 'Office', 'decision', 'stage', 'game', 'OFAC', 'misery', 'month', 'funds', 'theory', 'chance', 'licence', 'further', '27th', 'NSD', 'request', 'comment', 'pressure', 'monies', '2026s', '2036s', '2028s', 'all', 'creditors', 'lawsuits', 'negotiations', 'plenty']",2022-05-27,2022-05-27,ifre.com

5633,Clearstream,Google API,https://mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-minutes-of-the-securities-lending-committee-meeting-may-2022/,Bank Of England: Minutes Of The Securities Lending Committee Meeting – May 2022 - The Securities Lending Committee Is A Forum For Market Participants And Authorities To Discuss The UK Securities Lendi,2 hours ago,Time: 2pm-3.30pm | Location: 20 MoorgateMinutes Item 1 – Introductory remarks The Chair confirmed that the minutes of the November 2021 meeting were published on the Bank of England’s (BoE) website and had no comments to raise on the minutes from that meeting. The Chair welcomed additional attendees (Shikha Kalra  Debashree Tripathy  Tina Baker  and Charles Jomar Alino) to the meeting. Item 2 – recent market trends and observations A challenging macro environment drove equity markets in Q1  stemming from: the Russia/Ukraine conflict  hawkish monetary policy communications  rate hikes and the prospect of Quantitative Tightening. Clients had rotated into value and away from growth stocks. Equity capital market activity had slowed as liquidity conditions deteriorated but are expected to pick up in Q3. Increased market volatility was supporting revenues in some markets but this in part was dependent on risk appetite and contagion risk. Cash reinvestment returns increased  following interest rate rises in US. Capital requirements and Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) continued to be a focus for the industry. On-loan balances picked up in Q1 partly driven by increased market volatility. The securities lending market continued to face a lack of specials  although there was still some interest in travel and airline stocks. Corporate bond demand was strong  as was demand for Exchange Traded Products (ETPs). Hedge Funds preferred to express market views through ETPs rather than through sectoral shorts. Hedge fund performance was mixed with some strategies experiencing double-digit losses  although most quant funds have fared better. The Central Securities Depositary Regulation (CSDR) continues to draw many resources. The industry is trying to move to increased automation and leverage use of technology but this will take time. There continues to be a number of issues and numerous trade breaks. Settlement rates have improved marginally in the UK and Europe but continue to lag the US - although it benefits from a less fragmented market place. The Committee agreed that inefficiencies in settlement were not uniform across product classes  with settlement rates of corporate bonds significantly lower than fixed income or equities. Equities settlement benefited from increased automation. The liquidity issues in corporate bonds arise because of structural inefficiencies in the settlement process rather than CSDR. These issues are coming to light due to the high volume of trades going through the system. The Committee felt that CSDR fines were not high enough to justify their processing costs. The Committee discussed Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) as an asset class. There was consensus that the UK and European SPACs markets had not taken off in the same way as that in the US. And that the ‘shelf life’ of the SPACs asset class could be getting shorter based off limited interest this year compared to 2021. Item 3 – Voting The committee discussed a well-publicised instance where one counterparty had borrowed shares for voting purposes at an AGM. The Bank stated that they were disappointed that this transaction had taken place in clear breach of Chapter 4  section 6.3 of the UK Money Markets Code  and would be discussed further at the Code Sub-Committee. The Bank re-iterated that borrowing specifically to vote was against the widely agreed best practice in the market. ISLA supported the views of the Bank. The Committee agreed that trading protocols in this example fell outside of best practice. Given the link between the Code and the Senior Managers Regime  Committee members felt that this case also raised important questions about the governance surrounding this trade. The Committee agreed that the wording in the UK Money Market Code was clear on the topic of borrowing shares for voting at an AGM. It was agreed that the Code should be upheld all times to give institutional investors confidence that their shares and lending actions would not be contorted by the actions of borrowers. It was agreed that issues of this nature could impact the confidence of Institutional Investors and limit the supply of stock to the market. The Committee discussed the US treatment of loaned shares over AGMs. The SEC have placed the onus on lenders to define the purpose of the lending transactions and to call out instances where their shares that are out on loan but not recalled over the AGM dates. The Committee discussed whether there are opportunities for consolidated trade surveillance based of widely available data. In this instance  only STFR reporting would reveal how the position is building up. Item 4 - Agent lender disclosures ISLA have now established a working group that have met three times to reinstate and develop standards around agent lender disclosure. Agent lender disclosure provides an industry standard for agent lenders and broker-dealers to exchange underlying principal level detail information related to transactions executed under securities lending agreements. The initiative established a standard process and infrastructure among industry participants. The key challenge in this initiative will be securing the agreement of the lending and borrowing community on ‘Know-Your-Customer’ data standards. Item 5 - Tokenised collateral This item will now be discussed at the next meeting. Item 6 – ESG Most firms did not lend Russian or Ukraine securities and collateral over the last few months  and they were also excluded from collateral sets. Some members discussed that work was initially required to define what constitutes a Russian security; one example shared was that of a non-Russia security with Russian beneficial owner. In the end  a cautious approach was adopted and the security was not lent. The Committee agreed that there was some reliance on ETFs and tri-party agents to continue to monitor the underlying assets  but felt that tri-parties were well practised in managing sanctions. Most lenders sought to recall their Russian assets. But there were different messages from Clearstream and Euroclear with regards to the timing and opening of Bridge Settlements. Some members felt that their instructions where not clear on when the sanctions where being applied and to which securities. Item 7 - D&I The London network of Women in Securities Finance (WISF) continues to grow in membership. As the industry returns to in-person events  the group this year has intentionally focussed on networking opportunities. Earlier this year it completed full launch of a new networking initiative called ‘Grow Your Network’ (GYN) this enables women to establish connections with other people across the securities finance industry  helping to advance them professionally  as well as giving them the opportunity to support others to grow. ‘Grow Your Network’ creates a series of one-to-one connections by pairing WISF members with individuals where opportunities to cross paths may not have existed  for short icebreaker introductions. Pairings take into consideration backgrounds  experience  and different grades  to ensure diverse matching. The WISF London Network aims to run at least two rounds of GYN this year. Its first in-person networking event will take place at the ISLA Annual Conference in Vienna on June 6-8th  which will be open to all delegates  inclusive of all genders  and present opportunity for members to connect across the growing membership. Item 8 - AOB The Committee will seek to discuss at a future meeting implementation of the output floor under Basel 4. Based on the proposals some Beneficial Owners will not be rated. There was interest from some Committee members to discuss how to incorporate this in the future regime.

It performed well in our tests and should work in areas of good to moderate signals.The Antennas Direct Clearstream Horizon is a stylish indoor TV antenna with a companion amplifier that helps pull in stations in areas of good to moderate signals.The unit measures 23x5x.09 inches (WxHxD) and weighs 1.5 pounds. It wouldn’t look out of place alongside your TV or mounted on a wall  like a soundbar. It also ships with a small stand that allows it to be placed on a shelf or cabinet.The antenna is designed to cover the VHF High and UHF bands  which are broadcast channels 7 through 37. In the age of digital TV  the channel number used in a TV station’s name and its actual broadcast channel do not necessarily match up  so check our guide to find your local broadcast channel numbers.This review is part of TechHive’s coverage of the best TV antennas  where you’ll find reviews of the competition’s offerings  plus a buyer’s guide to the features you should consider when shopping for this type of product.Clearmstream Horizon TV antenna performanceAntennas Direct shared this photo of the Clearstream Horizon mounted to a wall  but don’t forget that you’ll need to deal with cables wherever you install it. Antennas DirectAntennas Direct says the antenna has a range of “60+ miles ” but that’s theoretical and the range you experience depends on your local terrain and the location of transmitters you’re looking to tune to. That said  Antennas Direct is not making the kind of outlandish claim we’ve seen from some less-scrupulous manufacturers.We tested the antenna against the Winegard FlatWave Amped  which is our current top pick for indoor amplified antennas  and found it compared favorably.The amplifier is a small  inline unit that can be switched on or off depending on the signal you’re trying to catch. This is handy  because in some cases adding an amplifier might make reception worse by overloading your TV’s tuner. That wasn’t a problem in our tests and it helped the signal every time it was switched on.Antenna Direct’s Jolt signal amplifier improved the Clearstream Horizon’s performance when we turned it on. You can turn it off if it overpowers your TV tuner. Martyn Williams/FoundryIn the first position we tested  at the bottom of a window facing the direction of the broadcast towers  it managed to pick up eight local TV stations and one out-of-market station. The Winegard in the same position received two additional local stations.Moving the antenna to a new position  higher up on the wall just above the window  resulted in stronger signals and successful reception of an additional out-of-market station  which was the same as the Winegard antenna. On the Clearstream Horizon  the signal quality was slightly weaker on some channels  although it didn’t make a big difference to the programs received.Martyn Williams/FoundryBoth antennas successfully received the local transmitter broadcasting ATSC 3.0 “NextGen TV” programming.Bottom line on the Antennas Direct Clearstream HorizonThe Antennas Direct Clearstream Horizon worked well with the amplifier turned on. Reception performance was marginally less than the Winegard FlatWave Amped  but it wasn’t a major difference. The Clearstream Horizon definitely wins for its looks over the Winegard and is an indoor antenna we can recommend  especially if you want something that looks good.,positive,0.99,0.0,0.0,mixed,0.6,0.13,0.28,True,English,"['Clearstream Horizon review', 'indoor TV antenna', 'Clearmstream Horizon TV antenna performance', 'ATSC 3.0 “NextGen TV” programming', 'local broadcast channel numbers', 'eight local TV stations', 'two additional local stations', 'looking indoor TV antenna', 'stylish indoor TV antenna', 'Good local channel reception', 'Antennas Direct Clearstream Horizon', 'local transmitter broadcasting', 'actual broadcast channel', 'current top pick', 'indoor amplified antennas', 'best TV antennas', 'Winegard FlatWave Amped', 'The Clearstream Horizon', 'small, inline unit', 'Jolt signal amplifier', 'companion signal amplifier', 'indoor antenna', 'local terrain', 'broadcast towers', 'Reception performance', 'digital TV', 'The Antennas', 'Antenna Direct', 'The Winegard', 'small stand', 'Winegard antenna', 'TV tuner', 'Inline amplifier', 'companion amplifier', 'successful reception', 'glance Expert', 'Rating Pros', 'signal strength', 'Attractive design', 'AC power', 'moderate signals', '23x5x.09 inches', 'VHF High', 'UHF bands', '60+ miles', 'outlandish claim', 'less-scrupulous manufacturers', 'first position', 'market station', 'same position', 'new position', 'stronger signals', 'signal quality', 'big difference', 'major difference', 'cabinet Cons', 'Bottom line', 'shelf', 'wall', 'window', 'cord', 'Verdict', 'tests', 'areas', 'WxHxD', '1.5 pounds', 'place', 'soundbar', 'channels', 'age', 'name', 'guide', 'review', 'part', 'TechHive', 'competition', 'offerings', 'buyer', 'features', 'type', 'product', 'photo', 'cables', 'range', 'location', 'transmitters', 'kind', 'cases', 'problem', 'Foundry', 'direction', 'programs', 'looks', 'something']",2022-05-27,2022-05-27,techhive.com

This rigid indoor antenna can be mounted to a wall or rested on a tabletop  and it features an powered signal amplifier. It delivered performance on par with our top pick ...,Cable and satellite TV subscriptions are becoming ever more expensive  so more and more homes are ditching pay TV in favor of free  over-the-air broadcasts. Digital TV typically provides between 20 and 60 channels depending on where you live  and can save you at least $1 000 a year  based on a typical pay TV subscription.Folks who do are often surprised by the higher image quality they get from broadcast TV. That’s because cable and satellite services compress the video signal in order to reduce the bandwidth required to stream it to your home  all so they can cram in more of the channels you probably never watch anyway.So  cut that cable  ditch that dish  and join the growing number of American households that are free from monthly bills for TV service.Updated May 27  2022 to add a link to our Antennas Direct Clearstream Horizon review.

Its unique double figure-eight design is sure to look distinctive and it can receive signals from different directions  which is useful if you live in an area with stations in multiple places. Read our full Antennas Direct Clearstream 4 Max reviewHow we test TV antennasTechHive tests TV antennas in a location in the Washington  D.C. metro area. (Until 2020  we tested in the San Francisco Bay Area  so you might see references to that location in older reviews). The D.C. location receives strong signals from local TV stations  but presents several challenges: There are a large number of trees around to influence reception; some of the independent D.C. TV stations are weak and difficult to receive; and with a good antenna  distant reception of Baltimore market stations is possible.Indoor antennas are tested indoors and outdoor antennas outdoors. Each time we test a new antenna  we retest our current top pick to ensure a fair benchmark.We use a set-top box to scan for channels and record the number of RF channels received by each antenna and their strength. Each RF channel carries a number of digital stations  but the number is different per channel and can change  so digital stations received isn’t as useful a measurement. We scan several times and adjust the direction of the antenna on some rescans.Our picks are the antennas that receive the largest number of stations with the highest signal level in both the UHF (channels 14 through 51) and VHF-High (channels 7 through 13) bands  which are the primary TV broadcast bands.TV antenna shopping tipsPutting up an antenna is easy  but before you buy one you’ll need to figure out what channels are available where you live  how strong the signals are likely to be  and what direction they’re coming from. See TechHive’s guide to choosing an antenna to figure all that out.As a rule of thumb  indoor antennas are suitable for areas with strong or very strong signals  the attic/outdoor antennas work in areas of medium signal strength  and the larger outdoor antennas in areas of weak signals.Once you’ve determined your needs  this article will help with your antenna purchase.

5639,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.ledgerinsights.com/jp-morgan-uses-blockchain-for-collateral-settlement/,JP Morgan uses blockchain for collateral settlement,12 hours ago,Yesterday Bloomberg reported that JP Morgan Chase has developed a collateral management blockchain solution for traditional finance. Last week it executed its first transaction by tokenizing BlackRock money market fund shares and using them as collateral. This is the latest solution from its Onyx blockchain and digital assets division.“What we’ve achieved is the frictionless transfer of collateral assets on an instantaneous basis ” said Ben Challice  JPMorgan’s global head of trading services. While the asset was a money market fund in this case  it plans to tokenize equities  fixed income and other asset types on its enterprise blockchain network. BlackRock wasn’t one of the counterparties but was heavily involved and is interested in the technology. It also enables collateral to be managed outside of normal trading house.“As the crypto sector grows over time  there will be a growing set of financial activities that happen on the public blockchain  so we want to make sure that we are able to not only support that but also be ready to provide related services ” added Challice.This is by no means the first use of blockchain for collateral management  but Challice’s comments suggest expanding use cases perhaps beyond purely interbank applications.JP Morgan’s Onyx division has multiple applications in production  including JPM Coin  interbank payments  including its Partior joint venture  and repo trading.JP Morgan’s blockchain collateral experienceThe bank knows a fair bit about using blockchain for this collateral use case because it’s involved in at least two other projects. It’s an investor in a major European-based collateral platform HQLAX  alongside numerous international banks such as Goldman Sachs  Citi  BNP Paribas  BNY Mellon  ING  Commerzbank  UBS and Credit Suisse. The largest outside investor is the Deutsche Boerse which provides a core piece of functionality. In that case  the collateral and securities lending is used for banks to ensure they have the right mix of liquid assets as required by Basel III banking rules.It was also a founding participant in the startup Baton System’s collateral management platform for foreign exchange derivative transactions. Core Collateral  the startup’s distributed ledger technology platform  processes several billion dollars in transactions daily and claims to handle more than 40% of the margins globally for cleared bank derivatives.There are several other DLT-based collateral and securities lending projects  including from the Tel Aviv stock exchange  OCC securities  and the Spanish stock exchange  BME.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,neutral,0.04,0.91,0.05,True,English,"['JP Morgan', 'collateral settlement', 'blockchain', 'BlackRock money market fund shares', 'Basel III banking rules', 'Tel Aviv stock exchange', 'foreign exchange derivative transactions', 'major European-based collateral platform', 'several other DLT-based collateral', 'collateral management blockchain solution', 'Spanish stock exchange', 'several billion dollars', 'two other projects', 'Partior joint venture', 'collateral management platform', 'other asset types', 'normal trading house', 'ledger technology platform', 'enterprise blockchain network', 'numerous international banks', 'largest outside investor', 'startup Baton System', 'digital assets division', 'securities lending projects', 'blockchain collateral experience', 'JP Morgan Chase', 'collateral use case', 'latest solution', 'collateral assets', 'Onyx division', 'Core Collateral', 'trading services', 'first use', 'use cases', 'repo trading', 'liquid assets', 'OCC securities', 'Onyx blockchain', 'public blockchain', 'traditional finance', 'first transaction', 'frictionless transfer', 'instantaneous basis', 'global head', 'fixed income', 'crypto sector', 'growing set', 'financial activities', 'related services', 'interbank applications', 'multiple applications', 'JPM Coin', 'interbank payments', 'fair bit', 'Goldman Sachs', 'BNP Paribas', 'BNY Mellon', 'Credit Suisse', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'core piece', 'right mix', 'founding participant', 'Ben Challice', 'Bloomberg', 'JPMorgan', 'equities', 'counterparties', 'time', 'means', 'comments', 'production', 'HQLAX', 'Citi', 'Commerzbank', 'UBS', 'functionality', 'margins', 'derivatives', 'BME']",2022-05-27,2022-05-27,ledgerinsights.com

Therefore  I want to determine whether sourness or sweetness prevails today in the German REIT market.Source: markets.ft.com / FTSE EPRA Nareit Germany Index PriceStarting our analysis of German REITs (or so-called G-REITs)  I have to say that German and international investors have enjoyed REIT legislation since 2007  when the country implemented the following fundamental rules:At least 75% of the total assets of the G-REIT must be immovable property  and at least 75% of its gross earnings must derive from rental  leasing  letting  and disposal of immovable propertyThe G-REIT has to distribute at least 90% of its net income  calculated under German GAAP  to its shareholders until the end of the following business yearAll current income is tax-exempt and capital gains are tax-exemptIn general  the investor has to pay a withholding tax of 25% plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge on the withholding tax  totaling 26.375%Having defined the legislative requirements of G-REITs  I need to mention that the universe of G-REITs at the local Deutsche Boerse Stock Exchange is presented by 12 public funds  broken down into four core sectors:Multifamily: Vonovia (OTCPK:VNNVF)  Grand City Properties (OTC:GRNNF)  TAG Immobilien (OTC:TAGOF)  LEG Immobilien (OTCPK:LEGIF)  Adler (OTC:ADPPF)Mixed Use: Hamborner (OTC:HANBF)  Deutsche Wohnen (OTCPK:DWHHF)  Aroundtown (OTCPK:AANNF)  Patrizia (OTC:PTZIF)Office: DIC Asset (OTCPK:DDCCF)  alstria office (OTC:ALSRF)Retail: Deutsche EuroShop (OTC:DUSCF)In terms of public valuation  the Multifamily sector occupies more than 60% of the total capitalization pie of ~ EUR 62 bln as of May 2022. (see infographics below).Source: Author's calculations based on public market capitalization data of German REITsInvestment analysis of German REITsI am going to guide you through the 3-step process of how I assess the investment attractiveness of German REITs in the current market environment:General Index analysis Analysis of strength of the regional economy Valuation metrics analysisGeneral index analysisFrom the macro standpoint  the current total capitalization of all 12 REITs corresponds with almost the lowest value of the iSTOXX® Germany Real Estate Capped 20 index for the last five years  which gives me the first impression of the right timing to enter the market in general.Source: iSTOXX® Germany Real Estate Capped 20 indexLands economic strengths analysisAs you may know  the Federal Republic of Germany consists of Lands (actually  sixteen partly sovereign federated states)  each of which has its unique cultural environment and economic power. Therefore  I thought it would be interesting to create an analytical framework to see the potential of each land and match it with the portfolio allocation of REITs  ranging by the highest percent of investments into a particular land. By overlapping two dimensions  we could identify REITs  investing in the most attractive areas. For this analysis  I decided to use three indicators:Purchasing powerThe highest GRP (gross regional product)The highest level of HDI (human development index)Below you can see the result:Source: A map created by Author with a template from yourfreetemplates.com and information about GfK Purchasing Power  GRP (2018)  and HDI (2018) from wikipedia.org. The Author calculates the REITs assets allocation.Two main outcomes:Three lands - North Rhine-Westphalia  Baden-Wurttemberg  and Bavaria - are the leaders in this assessment Hamborner is the only REIT with large (>15%) portfolio allocations in these three landsSo  Hamborner could be an excellent long-term investment  bearing in mind its unusually high free float (~ 77% of shares outstanding) for those who are valuation-agnostic and looking for alternative ways to screen potential targets for their REIT portfolio.Also  I would like to touch TAG Immobilien slightly. Despite its highest portfolio allocations outside the perimeter of top-3 lands  it will invest (and has already invested) heavily into Polish assets  including the acquisition of local developer ROBYG - the leading player in the Polish residential market.I fully agree with the investment rationale of TAG as against the backdrop of its macroeconomic solid and demographic growth  Poland is experiencing a structural gap between demand and supply in the multifamily segment for historical reasons. Therefore  it deserves attention from the individual and institutional investors.Source: TAG Immobilien company presentation as of May-2022I fully agree with the investment rationale of TAG as against the backdrop of its macroeconomic solid and demographic growth  Poland is experiencing a structural gap between demand and supply in the multifamily segment for historical reasons. Therefore  it deserves attention from the individual and institutional investors.Valuation metrics analysisJust as in my previous articles about the local landscape of REITs in different countries  I prepared a few data tables to make a snapshot of the current valuation of 11 REITs and calculate the necessary metrics for different investment strategies. (I excluded Adler because of alleged manipulation of financial reports and apparent fraud by the management. For those interested in reading about this story  which could be a great addition to David Einhorn's collection of short sales  please see a fascinating report by the research group Viceroy Research).Source: Author's calculations Source: Author's calculationsThe bottom line is that amongst 11 REITs:Deutsche Wohnen and DIC Asset have the lowest P/NAV ratio Deutsche EuroShop and DIC Asset have the lowest P/FFO 2021 multiple Patrizia has the highest cap rate spread TAG Immobilien and DIC Asset have the highest dividend yieldBearing the results of my 3-step analysis in mind  I would like to highlight one of my favorite German REITs  which a) seems undervalued to me and b) has an excitingly scalable business model.Patrizia - my top pick from the German REIT marketSpeaking about a mixed-use REIT Patrizia  I have to say that it has a unique business model for Germany and other European REITs. I would better identify this company as PREIM or public real estate investment manager instead of REIT because its operations are almost entirely based on the fee model  managing real estate investments for institutional  semi-professional  and private investors. Looking at the balance sheet:Source: Patrizia company presentation as of May-2022 Source: Patrizia company presentation as of May-2022I have to say that it is one of the strongest I have ever seen in the REIT space overall.1) The net equity ratio is more than 70%Equity (excl. non-controlling interests) divided by total net assets (total assets less loans covered by cash in hand)2) Interest-bearing Debt/Total Assets is 17.5%3) Two-fifths of the asset side of the balance sheet is a highly liquid part of assets (cash + deposits + current receivables)Overall  Patrizia  still being a founder-led company (CEO Wolfgang Egger founded it in 1984!)  has four core activities:Placing and managing fund assets in core and core+ strategies for clients through its platformsCo-investing with clients in value-add and opportunistic segmentsPlaying the role of Fund of Fund  investing clients' money into the best RE funds around the worldSpeculatively investing from its balanceSource: Patrizia company presentation as of May-2022Generating five types of cash flows:Management fees based on AUMTransaction fees based on the volume of purchases or salesPerformance fees for achieving investment hurdlesNet sales revenues and co-investment income as return on capital employedSource: Patrizia company presentation as of May-2022Also  unexpectedly for me  but considering the six years  Patrizia found its way to top-3 dealmakers in Europe.Source: Patrizia company presentation as of May-2022The investment rationale for Patrizia is supported by the asset-light  mixed fee-based business model  and strong AUM  which reflects in the decisions of the Analyst community.

A personalized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive an adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants receive their vaccine immediately after they complete their adjuvant treatment. The other half is given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease. This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who have a high risk of relapse. Up to 30 patients will receive TG4050 in France  in the UK and in the USA. The principal investigator of the trial is Prof. Christian Ottensmeier  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre and Professor of Immuno-Oncology at the University of Liverpool. In France  the clinical trial is being conducted at Institut Curie  Paris by Prof. Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  Head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i)  and at the IUCT-Oncopole  Toulouse by Prof. Jean-Pierre Delord. In the USA  the trial is being led by Dr. Yujie Zhao  MD  PhD  at the Mayo Clinic. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.In parallel  a Phase I clinical trial of TG4050 is enrolling patients with ovarian cancer. This second trial is including patients at the time of asymptomatic relapse after surgery and first-line chemotherapy. Dr. Matthew Block  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncology  Consultant Immunology and Associate Professor of Oncology at the Mayo Clinic (USA) is the principal investigator of the trial; in France  the trial is being conducted by Prof. Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  at Institut Curie and by Dr. Alexandra Martinez  MD  Associate Head of Surgical Department  at IUCT-Oncopole. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.The first preliminary clinical data generated from the first patients treated with TG4050 were very encouraging.About myvac®myvac® is a viral vector (MVA – Modified Vaccinia Ankara) based  individualized immunotherapy platform that has been developed by Transgene to target solid tumors. myvac®-derived products are designed to stimulate the patient’s immune system  recognize and destroy tumors using the patient’s own cancer specific genetic mutations.

Data presentations will include findings in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  as well as established indications of advanced renal cell carcinoma and radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-R DTC). These data show that the therapeutic potential of Cabometyx as a key treatment option in a broad range of tumors is continuing to be realized.Updated outcomes from the multicenter Phase Ib COSMIC-021 trial evaluating the combination of Cabometyx plus atezolizumab in an expanded patient population in metastatic NSCLC demonstrate encouraging clinical activity with manageable toxicity in people previously treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI).1 These data lay the foundations for the potential of Cabometyx in metastatic NSCLC which is being further examined in the ongoing Phase III CONTACT-01 trial. This trial is evaluating the combination of Cabometyx plus atezolizumab vs docetaxel in patients with metastatic NSCLC previously treated with an ICI and platinum-containing chemotherapy  and topline results of the study are expected to be announced in the second half of 2022.“ Currently  first-line immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with metastatic NSCLC but there is a real need for additional effective treatment options for those patients who progress after a prior immunotherapy ” said Santiago Ponce-Aix  M.D.  Head of Drug Development Department  Institute Gustave Roussy  France  and an investigator in the COSMIC-021 trial. “ These new data are encouraging as they show the potential role of Cabometyx in creating an environment which may enhance atezolizumab’s activity in NSCLC. We look forward to further data evaluating this combination for this patient population where there remains such a high unmet medical need.”“ The therapeutic potential of Cabometyx as a treatment option against a broad range of tumors including NSCLC is continuing to be evaluated and these data demonstrate our ambition to bring meaningful new treatments to patients. These latest data support the potential role of Cabometyx to positively impact treatment when paired with immunotherapy  and we will continue to evaluate Cabometyx as both a monotherapy and in combination with other innovative therapies for the most difficult-to-treat cancers ” said Dr. Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development at Ipsen.An exploratory analysis will also be presented investigating the relationship between depth of response (DepOR) and clinical outcomes in CheckMate -9ER  evaluating Cabometyx in combination with nivolumab vs sunitinib in previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma.2 DepOR was defined as the best percent reduction from baseline in sum of diameters of target lesions. Overall  greater proportions of patients receiving Cabometyx plus nivolumab demonstrated deeper responses vs sunitinib. Regardless of treatment  deeper responses were generally associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.2Additionally  two new data analyses from the pivotal Phase III trial COSMIC-311 evaluating Cabometyx in RAI-R DTC will be presented. One analysis relates to outcomes for prespecified subgroups based on the baseline histology subtypes of papillary and follicular thyroid cancers  with results showing Cabometyx maintained superior efficacy vs placebo irrespective of histology subtype.3 Median PFS was 9.2 months for Cabometyx vs 1.9 months for placebo in the papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) subgroup (HR 0.27 95% CI  0.17-0.43) and 11.2 months vs 2.5 months in the follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) subgroup (HR 0.18 95% CI  0.10-0.31). The overall response rate (ORR) was 15% for Cabometyx vs 0% for placebo in the PTC subgroup and 8% vs 0% in the FTC subgroup.3Another analysis will be presented related to outcomes for prespecified subgroups who received prior lenvatinib and/or sorafenib treatment. The data from this analysis showed Cabometyx maintained its PFS vs placebo irrespective of prior lenvatinib and/or sorafenib treatment.4 Median PFS across the different groups included 16.6 months for Cabometyx vs 3.2 months for placebo in prior sorafenib (no lenvatinib) (HR 0.13  95% CI 0.06–0.26)  5.8 months vs 1.9 months in prior lenvatinib (no sorafenib) (HR 0.28  95% CI 0.16-0.48)  and 7.6 months vs 1.9 months in prior sorafenib and lenvatinib (HR 0.27  95% CI 0.13–0.54).4The safety profile identified in COSMIC-021  CheckMate -9ER and COSMIC-311 was consistent with that previously observed for Cabometyx in monotherapy and in combination.Ipsen thanks the patients and investigators involved in the COSMIC-021  CheckMate -9ER and COSMIC-311 clinical trials.ENDSMore information can be found during the presentation sessions outlined below:Lead author Indication Abstract title Presentation number/timing (CDT) Neal NSCLC Cabozantinib (C) Plus Atezolizumab (A) or C Alone in Patients (Pts) With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (aNSCLC) Previously Treated With an Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI): Results From Cohorts 7 and 20 of the COSMIC-021 Study Oral Abstract 9005Fri 3 Jun 2:24- 2:36 PM Lung Cancer – Non-Small Cell Metastatic Suárez RCC Association between depth of response and clinical outcomes: exploratory analysis in patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) in CheckMate 9ER Oral Abstract 4501Fri 3 Jun 2:57- 3:09 PM GU Cancer - Kidney and Bladder Pal Urothelial Carcinoma Cabozantinib (C) in Combination With Atezolizumab (A) in Urothelial Carcinoma (UC): Results From Cohorts 3  4  5 of the COSMIC-021 Study5 Oral Abstract 4504 Fri 3 Jun 3:57 PM – 4:09 PM GU Cancer - Kidney and Bladder Capdevila RAI-R DTC Cabozantinib versus placebo in patients (pts) with radioiodine-refractory (RAIR) differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who have progressed after prior VEGFR-targeted therapy: outcomes in prespecified subgroups based on histology subtypes Poster Abstract 6081 Mon Jun 6 1:15-4:15 PM Head & Neck Cancer Hernando RAI-R DTC Cabozantinib (C) versus placebo (P) in patients (pts) with radioiodine-refractory (RAIR) differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who have progressed after prior VEGFR-targeted therapy: outcomes in prespecified subgroups based on prior VEGFR-targeted therapy Poster Abstract 6083 Mon Jun 6 1:15-4:15 PM Head & Neck CancerAbout non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death globally.6 There are broadly two different groups of lung cancer - NSCLC and SCLC (small cell lung cancer). NSCLC accounts for around 80-85% of all cases.7 The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma  squamous cell carcinoma  and large cell carcinoma. These subtypes  which start from different types of lung cells are grouped together as NSCLC because their treatment and prognoses are often similar.7About renal cell carcinoma (RCC)There were over 430 000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2020.8 Of these  RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer  accounting for approximately 90% of cases.9 10 It is almost twice as common in men  and male patients account for over two thirds of deaths.9 If detected in the early stages  the five-year survival rate is high  but for patients with or late-stage metastatic RCC the survival rate is much lower  around 12%  with no identified cure for this disease.11 12About radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-R DTC)In 2020  over 580 000 new cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed worldwide.13 Thyroid cancer is the ninth most commonly occurring cancer globally and incidence is three times higher in women than in men  with the disease representing one in every 20 cancers diagnosed among women.13 While cancerous thyroid tumors include differentiated  medullary and anaplastic forms  differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) makes up about 90 to 95% of cases.14 15 DTC is typically treated with surgery  followed by ablation of the remaining thyroid tissue with radioactive iodine (RAI)  but approximately 5 to 15% of cases are resistant to RAI treatment.16 Patients who develop RAI-R DTC have a poor prognosis with an average estimated survival of three to five years.17About the COSMIC-021 trial18COSMIC-021 is a multicenter  Phase Ib  open-label study that was divided into two parts: a dose-escalation phase and an expansion cohort phase. In the expansion phase  the trial enrolled 23 cohorts in 12 tumor types: NSCLC  RCC  UC  castration-resistant prostate cancer  hepatocellular carcinoma  triple-negative breast cancer  epithelial ovarian cancer  endometrial cancer  gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma  colorectal adenocarcinoma  head and neck cancer  and DTC. Exelixis is the study sponsor of COSMIC-021. Both Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) have opted in to participate in the trial and are contributing to the funding for this study under the terms of the companies’ respective collaboration agreements with Exelixis. Roche is providing atezolizumab for the trial.About the CheckMate -9ER trial19CheckMate -9ER was an open-label  randomized  multi-national Phase III trial evaluating people living with previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC. A total of 651 patients (23% favorable risk  58% intermediate risk  20% poor risk; 25% PD-L1 ≥1%) were randomized to Cabometyx plus nivolumab (n= 323) versus sunitinib (n=328). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). The primary efficacy analysis compared the doublet combination versus sunitinib in all randomized patients. The trial was sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical Co and co-funded by Exelixis  Ipsen and Takeda.About the COSMIC-311 trial20COSMIC-311 was a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial that enrolled 258 patients at 164 sites globally. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Cabometyx 60 mg or placebo once-daily. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population as well as objective response rate in the first 100 randomly assigned patients (objective response rate intention-to-treat [OITT] population)  both evaluated by a blinded independent radiology committee. Additional endpoints included safety  overall survival and quality of life. Exelixis is the sponsor  and Ipsen is co-funding the COSMIC-311 trial.About Cabometyx (cabozantinib)Outside the United States and Japan  Cabometyx is currently approved in 60 countries  including in the European Union (E.U.)

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

5655,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/green-hydrogen-ipo/8552849/,Bryan Garnier was joint global coordinator and joint bookrunner for green hydrogen company IPO,13 hours ago,The independent investment bank is taking on the roles for Lhyfe at its €110 million IPO on Euronext Paris.Leading European healthcare and tech-related company independent investment bank Bryan Garnier was Lhyfe’s joint global coordinator and joint bookrunner at the green hydrogen company’s €110 million IPO on Euronext Paris.Institutional and strategic investors from France  Norway and Portugal made cornerstone investments.Once the greenshoe has been fully exercised  the transaction value could rise to reach €124 million  for a market capitalization higher than €400 million.Lhyfe is a top green hydrogen producer and supplier. It produces the carbon emission-free fuel through a process powered by renewable energy that also does not generate any greenhouse gas emissions. A leader among green hydrogen companies  Lhyfe was first established in 2017. It now operates in more than ten countries  including France and Denmark.The company develops renewable H2 projects to be used for industry and mobility applications. It currently boasts a 93-project pipeline throughout Europe and is slated for 4.8 GW of total production capacity by 2028.At a time in which the world is decarbonizing and the energy crisis is escalating in Europe due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia –from which much of Europe imports their energy – Lhyfe is positioning itself to play a key role in the energy transition acceleration.The green hydrogen company’s IPO arrived at a time when the European Commission is committing to H2.Earlier this month  the European Commission tripled its H2 commitment through its REPowerEU Plan. Within that strategy  it has now created a 350 GW H2 capacity target for 2030. This is notably larger than the 80 GW target it had set in the previous version of the strategy. The target includes both domestic H2 production as well as imports of the clean fuel.It has underscored the importance of H2 made using renewable energy for carbon emission-free production. This acceleration is greatly to do with the effort to reduce European dependency on importing Russian energy. That said  it aligns with an already existing intention to transition away from fossil fuels in favor of cleaner sources of energy.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,neutral,0.05,0.89,0.06,True,English,"['green hydrogen company', 'joint global coordinator', 'joint bookrunner', 'Bryan Garnier', 'IPO', 'tech-related company independent investment bank', 'top green hydrogen producer', '350 GW H2 capacity target', 'green hydrogen company', 'green hydrogen companies', 'total production capacity', 'greenhouse gas emissions', 'carbon emission-free production', 'joint global coordinator', 'carbon emission-free fuel', 'domestic H2 production', 'Leading European healthcare', 'renewable H2 projects', 'energy transition acceleration', '80 GW target', 'joint bookrunner', 'clean fuel', 'H2 commitment', 'European Commission', 'European dependency', 'renewable energy', 'Euronext Paris', 'Bryan Garnier', 'strategic investors', 'cornerstone investments', 'transaction value', 'market capitalization', 'ten countries', 'mobility applications', '93-project pipeline', 'Russian invasion', 'key role', 'REPowerEU Plan', 'previous version', 'existing intention', 'fossil fuels', 'cleaner sources', 'energy crisis', 'Russian energy', '€110 million IPO', '4.8 GW', 'H2.', 'roles', 'Lhyfe', 'Institutional', 'France', 'Norway', 'Portugal', 'greenshoe', 'supplier', 'process', 'leader', 'Denmark', 'industry', 'time', 'world', 'Ukraine', 'sanctions', 'strategy', 'imports', 'importance', 'effort', 'favor']",2022-05-27,2022-05-27,hydrogenfuelnews.com

BendjamaThe abstract can be accessed on the ASCO and Transgene websites.***About the clinical trialsTG4050 is being evaluated in two Phase I clinical trials for patients with ovarian cancer (NCT03839524) and HPV-negative head and neck cancers (NCT04183166).In a first Phase I trial  TG4050 is being administered to patients with HPV-negative head and neck cancer. A personalized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive an adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants receive their vaccine immediately after they complete their adjuvant treatment. The other half is given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease. This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who have a high risk of relapse. Up to 30 patients will receive TG4050 in France  in the UK and in the USA. The principal investigator of the trial is Prof. Christian Ottensmeier  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre and Professor of Immuno-Oncology at the University of Liverpool. In France  the clinical trial is being conducted at Institut Curie  Paris by Prof. Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  Head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i)  and at the IUCT-Oncopole  Toulouse by Prof. Jean-Pierre Delord. In the USA  the trial is being led by Dr. Yujie Zhao  MD  PhD  at the Mayo Clinic. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.In parallel  a Phase I clinical trial of TG4050 is enrolling patients with ovarian cancer. This second trial is including patients at the time of asymptomatic relapse after surgery and first-line chemotherapy. Dr. Matthew Block  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncology  Consultant Immunology and Associate Professor of Oncology at the Mayo Clinic (USA) is the principal investigator of the trial; in France  the trial is being conducted by Prof. Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  at Institut Curie and by Dr. Alexandra Martinez  MD  Associate Head of Surgical Department  at IUCT-Oncopole. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.The first preliminary clinical data generated from the first patients treated with TG4050 were very encouraging.About myvac®myvac® is a viral vector (MVA – Modified Vaccinia Ankara) based  individualized immunotherapy platform that has been developed by Transgene to target solid tumors. myvac®-derived products are designed to stimulate the patient’s immune system  recognize and destroy tumors using the patient’s own cancer specific genetic mutations.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases – including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure – with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.Story continuesThe alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload (congestion) through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.In the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints  rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life as well as a mean survival probability of 70% at 12 months post-implantation (compared to 50% survival rate for refractory ascites patients in the published literature). All patients have been implanted with the alfapump and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. Top-line results of the RED DESERT study and interim results of the SAHARA DESERT study indicate that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  improve cardio-renal status and restore diuretic response for months post-treatment. Reporting of top-line data for SAHARA DESERT is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is not currently approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Study) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to cirrhosis.
