Kennedy  L-1855 Luxembourg R.C.S. Luxembourg B-124.284(the Company)Important Notice to Shareholders of the Company27 May 2022The board of directors of the Company (the “Board of Directors”) hereby informs the shareholders of the Company (the “Shareholders”) about certain changes to the sub-funds of the Company (the “Sub-Funds”) permitted to undertake securities lending  as outlined below.Capitalised terms used in this notice shall have the same meaning ascribed to them in the latest version of the prospectus of the Company (the “Prospectus”)  unless the context otherwise requires.Change of Securities Lending AgentDeutsche Bank AG  acting through its Frankfurt am Main head office and its London and New York branches  currently acts as the securities lending agent appointed by the Company (the “Securities Lending Agent”). The Securities Lending Agent is authorised (i) to enter into Securities Lending Transactions on behalf of the Company and (ii) to invest any cash received/held on behalf of the Company as collateral pursuant to such Securities Lending Transactions (the “Securities Lending Services”).With effect from on or around 28 June 2022 (the “Effective Date”)  the Securities Lending Agent’s appointment will be terminated and the Investment Manager  DWS Investment GmbH  will take over the provision of the Securities Lending Services.Change of the maximum proportion of assets subject to Securities Lending for Direct Replication FundsThe current Prospectus provides that a Direct Replication Fund may enter into Securities Lending Transactions for up to 50 percent of its assets (the “Maximum Securities Lending Transactions Proportion”) to generate additional income and thereby offset part or all of its costs. While all assets of a Sub-Fund which engages in Securities Lending Transactions will be eligible for such transactions (with no distinction as regards asset classes in which the Sub-Fund may invest)  the expected proportion of a Sub-Fund's net assets subject to Securities Lending Transactions will typically vary between 0 percent. and 50 percent. for each relevant Sub-Fund (the “Expected Securities Lending Transactions Proportion”).As of the Effective Date  the Maximum Securities Lending Transactions Proportion of relevant Direct Replication Funds will be increased from up to 50 percent to up to 100 percent of its assets. For the avoidance of doubt  the Expected Securities Lending Transactions Proportion will remain unchanged.Securities Lending FeesCurrently  as provided in the relevant Product Annexes  a Sub-Fund undertaking Securities Lending Transactions is allocated 85 percent of the associated revenue generated  of which the Sub-Fund receives 70 percent  with the remaining 15 percent being received by the Sub-Portfolio Manager  DWS Investments UK Limited. The outstanding 15 percent is allocated to the Securities Lending Agent.As of the Effective Date  the fees relating to Securities Lending Transactions will change so that the Sub-Fund is allocated 70 percent of the associated revenue generated  with the remaining 30 percent allocated to the Management Company  DWS Investment S.A.. The Management Company shall  out of the revenues allocated to it  (i) be entitled to retain 5 percent of such 30 percent amount (that is 1.5 percent of the overall associated revenue generated) as its fee for the oversight and monitoring of the securities lending activities  (ii) pay all costs and fees directly incurred in respect of securities lending activities (including custody  transaction and collateral management and administration costs)  and (iii) pay such revenues as remain following payment of (i) and (ii) to the Investment Manager. The Investment Manager shall  out of the revenues it receives from the Management Company  pay all costs and expenses indirectly incurred in respect of securities lending activities (including but not limited to operational  information technology  legal  compliance and audit costs).For the avoidance of doubt  there will be no change in the proportion of revenues generated in relation to Securities Lending Transactions attributable to the Sub-Funds  with such proportion continuing to be 70 percent of the associated revenue generated.Changes in the Collateral Arrangements in respect of Securities Lending TransactionsIn order to mitigate the counterparty risk in relation to Securities Lending Transactions  collateral may be received in accordance with the collateral arrangement set out in the Prospectus.Currently the collateral received pursuant to Securities Lending Transactions can be held by both the Securities Lending Agent and/or The Bank of New York Mellon.As of the Effective Date  different entities may be involved in the collateral management or administration services  depending on the lender and/or collateral management structure. More specifically  the Management Company will delegate:Collateral services for Securities Lending Transactions for certain Sub-Funds to State Street Bank International GmbH  Zweigniederlassung Frankfurt with a sub-delegation for certain Sub-Funds to Euroclear Bank SA / NV; andManagement of collateral for Securities Lending Transactions for certain Sub-Funds to The Bank of New York Mellon  Bruxelles branch (Belgium) with sub-delegation to its London  New York  Orlando and Singapore branches and BNY Mellon International Operations India Private Limited  from time to time.As of the Effective Date  the collateral eligibility requirements will also change. The section “Collateral Arrangements in respect of Securities Lending Transaction(s)” of the Prospectus will be amended to reflect the new collateral requirements.General InformationShareholders who subscribe for Shares in the Sub-Funds on the primary market and who do not agree with the changes  are entitled to redeem their Shares in the Sub-Funds in accordance with the Prospectus. Such redemptions shall be free of any Redemption Charge from the date of this notice until 5:00 p.m. (Luxembourg time) on 27 June 2022. Please note that the Company does not charge any redemption fee for the sale of Shares in the secondary market. Orders to sell Shares through a stock exchange can be placed via an authorised intermediary or stockbroker. Shareholders should note that orders in the secondary market may incur costs over which the Company has no control and to which the above exemption on Redemption Charges does not apply.Copies of the revised Prospectus and the key information documents of the Sub-Funds reflecting the changes will be made available on the website of the Company (www.Xtrackers.com) on or around the Effective Date  and copies thereof may be obtained on request free of charge at the registered office of the Company or at the offices of foreign representatives  once available.Shareholders who have any queries or to whom any of the above is not clear should seek advice from their stockbroker  bank manager  legal advisor  accountant or other independent financial advisor. Shareholders should also consult their own professional advisors as to the specific tax implications under the laws of the countries of their nationality  residence  domicile or incorporation.Further information in relation to the changes may be obtained from the legal entities mentioned under Contact information below  the offices of foreign representatives or by sending an email to Xtrackers@dws.com.Neither the contents of the Company's website nor the contents of any other website accessible from hyperlinks on the Company's website is incorporated into  or forms part of  this announcement.Xtrackers IIThe Board of DirectorsContact InformationXtrackers II49  avenue J.F.

5619,Euroclear,Google API,https://mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-minutes-of-the-securities-lending-committee-meeting-may-2022/,Bank Of England: Minutes Of The Securities Lending Committee Meeting – May 2022 - The Securities Lending Committee Is A Forum For Market Participants And Authorities To Discuss The UK Securities Lendi,1 day ago,Time: 2pm-3.30pm | Location: 20 MoorgateMinutes Item 1 – Introductory remarks The Chair confirmed that the minutes of the November 2021 meeting were published on the Bank of England’s (BoE) website and had no comments to raise on the minutes from that meeting. The Chair welcomed additional attendees (Shikha Kalra  Debashree Tripathy  Tina Baker  and Charles Jomar Alino) to the meeting. Item 2 – recent market trends and observations A challenging macro environment drove equity markets in Q1  stemming from: the Russia/Ukraine conflict  hawkish monetary policy communications  rate hikes and the prospect of Quantitative Tightening. Clients had rotated into value and away from growth stocks. Equity capital market activity had slowed as liquidity conditions deteriorated but are expected to pick up in Q3. Increased market volatility was supporting revenues in some markets but this in part was dependent on risk appetite and contagion risk. Cash reinvestment returns increased  following interest rate rises in US. Capital requirements and Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) continued to be a focus for the industry. On-loan balances picked up in Q1 partly driven by increased market volatility. The securities lending market continued to face a lack of specials  although there was still some interest in travel and airline stocks. Corporate bond demand was strong  as was demand for Exchange Traded Products (ETPs). Hedge Funds preferred to express market views through ETPs rather than through sectoral shorts. Hedge fund performance was mixed with some strategies experiencing double-digit losses  although most quant funds have fared better. The Central Securities Depositary Regulation (CSDR) continues to draw many resources. The industry is trying to move to increased automation and leverage use of technology but this will take time. There continues to be a number of issues and numerous trade breaks. Settlement rates have improved marginally in the UK and Europe but continue to lag the US - although it benefits from a less fragmented market place. The Committee agreed that inefficiencies in settlement were not uniform across product classes  with settlement rates of corporate bonds significantly lower than fixed income or equities. Equities settlement benefited from increased automation. The liquidity issues in corporate bonds arise because of structural inefficiencies in the settlement process rather than CSDR. These issues are coming to light due to the high volume of trades going through the system. The Committee felt that CSDR fines were not high enough to justify their processing costs. The Committee discussed Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) as an asset class. There was consensus that the UK and European SPACs markets had not taken off in the same way as that in the US. And that the ‘shelf life’ of the SPACs asset class could be getting shorter based off limited interest this year compared to 2021. Item 3 – Voting The committee discussed a well-publicised instance where one counterparty had borrowed shares for voting purposes at an AGM. The Bank stated that they were disappointed that this transaction had taken place in clear breach of Chapter 4  section 6.3 of the UK Money Markets Code  and would be discussed further at the Code Sub-Committee. The Bank re-iterated that borrowing specifically to vote was against the widely agreed best practice in the market. ISLA supported the views of the Bank. The Committee agreed that trading protocols in this example fell outside of best practice. Given the link between the Code and the Senior Managers Regime  Committee members felt that this case also raised important questions about the governance surrounding this trade. The Committee agreed that the wording in the UK Money Market Code was clear on the topic of borrowing shares for voting at an AGM. It was agreed that the Code should be upheld all times to give institutional investors confidence that their shares and lending actions would not be contorted by the actions of borrowers. It was agreed that issues of this nature could impact the confidence of Institutional Investors and limit the supply of stock to the market. The Committee discussed the US treatment of loaned shares over AGMs. The SEC have placed the onus on lenders to define the purpose of the lending transactions and to call out instances where their shares that are out on loan but not recalled over the AGM dates. The Committee discussed whether there are opportunities for consolidated trade surveillance based of widely available data. In this instance  only STFR reporting would reveal how the position is building up. Item 4 - Agent lender disclosures ISLA have now established a working group that have met three times to reinstate and develop standards around agent lender disclosure. Agent lender disclosure provides an industry standard for agent lenders and broker-dealers to exchange underlying principal level detail information related to transactions executed under securities lending agreements. The initiative established a standard process and infrastructure among industry participants. The key challenge in this initiative will be securing the agreement of the lending and borrowing community on ‘Know-Your-Customer’ data standards. Item 5 - Tokenised collateral This item will now be discussed at the next meeting. Item 6 – ESG Most firms did not lend Russian or Ukraine securities and collateral over the last few months  and they were also excluded from collateral sets. Some members discussed that work was initially required to define what constitutes a Russian security; one example shared was that of a non-Russia security with Russian beneficial owner. In the end  a cautious approach was adopted and the security was not lent. The Committee agreed that there was some reliance on ETFs and tri-party agents to continue to monitor the underlying assets  but felt that tri-parties were well practised in managing sanctions. Most lenders sought to recall their Russian assets. But there were different messages from Clearstream and Euroclear with regards to the timing and opening of Bridge Settlements. Some members felt that their instructions where not clear on when the sanctions where being applied and to which securities. Item 7 - D&I The London network of Women in Securities Finance (WISF) continues to grow in membership. As the industry returns to in-person events  the group this year has intentionally focussed on networking opportunities. Earlier this year it completed full launch of a new networking initiative called ‘Grow Your Network’ (GYN) this enables women to establish connections with other people across the securities finance industry  helping to advance them professionally  as well as giving them the opportunity to support others to grow. ‘Grow Your Network’ creates a series of one-to-one connections by pairing WISF members with individuals where opportunities to cross paths may not have existed  for short icebreaker introductions. Pairings take into consideration backgrounds  experience  and different grades  to ensure diverse matching. The WISF London Network aims to run at least two rounds of GYN this year. Its first in-person networking event will take place at the ISLA Annual Conference in Vienna on June 6-8th  which will be open to all delegates  inclusive of all genders  and present opportunity for members to connect across the growing membership. Item 8 - AOB The Committee will seek to discuss at a future meeting implementation of the output floor under Basel 4. Based on the proposals some Beneficial Owners will not be rated. There was interest from some Committee members to discuss how to incorporate this in the future regime.

5633,Clearstream,Google API,https://mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-minutes-of-the-securities-lending-committee-meeting-may-2022/,Bank Of England: Minutes Of The Securities Lending Committee Meeting – May 2022 - The Securities Lending Committee Is A Forum For Market Participants And Authorities To Discuss The UK Securities Lendi,1 day ago,Time: 2pm-3.30pm | Location: 20 MoorgateMinutes Item 1 – Introductory remarks The Chair confirmed that the minutes of the November 2021 meeting were published on the Bank of England’s (BoE) website and had no comments to raise on the minutes from that meeting. The Chair welcomed additional attendees (Shikha Kalra  Debashree Tripathy  Tina Baker  and Charles Jomar Alino) to the meeting. Item 2 – recent market trends and observations A challenging macro environment drove equity markets in Q1  stemming from: the Russia/Ukraine conflict  hawkish monetary policy communications  rate hikes and the prospect of Quantitative Tightening. Clients had rotated into value and away from growth stocks. Equity capital market activity had slowed as liquidity conditions deteriorated but are expected to pick up in Q3. Increased market volatility was supporting revenues in some markets but this in part was dependent on risk appetite and contagion risk. Cash reinvestment returns increased  following interest rate rises in US. Capital requirements and Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) continued to be a focus for the industry. On-loan balances picked up in Q1 partly driven by increased market volatility. The securities lending market continued to face a lack of specials  although there was still some interest in travel and airline stocks. Corporate bond demand was strong  as was demand for Exchange Traded Products (ETPs). Hedge Funds preferred to express market views through ETPs rather than through sectoral shorts. Hedge fund performance was mixed with some strategies experiencing double-digit losses  although most quant funds have fared better. The Central Securities Depositary Regulation (CSDR) continues to draw many resources. The industry is trying to move to increased automation and leverage use of technology but this will take time. There continues to be a number of issues and numerous trade breaks. Settlement rates have improved marginally in the UK and Europe but continue to lag the US - although it benefits from a less fragmented market place. The Committee agreed that inefficiencies in settlement were not uniform across product classes  with settlement rates of corporate bonds significantly lower than fixed income or equities. Equities settlement benefited from increased automation. The liquidity issues in corporate bonds arise because of structural inefficiencies in the settlement process rather than CSDR. These issues are coming to light due to the high volume of trades going through the system. The Committee felt that CSDR fines were not high enough to justify their processing costs. The Committee discussed Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) as an asset class. There was consensus that the UK and European SPACs markets had not taken off in the same way as that in the US. And that the ‘shelf life’ of the SPACs asset class could be getting shorter based off limited interest this year compared to 2021. Item 3 – Voting The committee discussed a well-publicised instance where one counterparty had borrowed shares for voting purposes at an AGM. The Bank stated that they were disappointed that this transaction had taken place in clear breach of Chapter 4  section 6.3 of the UK Money Markets Code  and would be discussed further at the Code Sub-Committee. The Bank re-iterated that borrowing specifically to vote was against the widely agreed best practice in the market. ISLA supported the views of the Bank. The Committee agreed that trading protocols in this example fell outside of best practice. Given the link between the Code and the Senior Managers Regime  Committee members felt that this case also raised important questions about the governance surrounding this trade. The Committee agreed that the wording in the UK Money Market Code was clear on the topic of borrowing shares for voting at an AGM. It was agreed that the Code should be upheld all times to give institutional investors confidence that their shares and lending actions would not be contorted by the actions of borrowers. It was agreed that issues of this nature could impact the confidence of Institutional Investors and limit the supply of stock to the market. The Committee discussed the US treatment of loaned shares over AGMs. The SEC have placed the onus on lenders to define the purpose of the lending transactions and to call out instances where their shares that are out on loan but not recalled over the AGM dates. The Committee discussed whether there are opportunities for consolidated trade surveillance based of widely available data. In this instance  only STFR reporting would reveal how the position is building up. Item 4 - Agent lender disclosures ISLA have now established a working group that have met three times to reinstate and develop standards around agent lender disclosure. Agent lender disclosure provides an industry standard for agent lenders and broker-dealers to exchange underlying principal level detail information related to transactions executed under securities lending agreements. The initiative established a standard process and infrastructure among industry participants. The key challenge in this initiative will be securing the agreement of the lending and borrowing community on ‘Know-Your-Customer’ data standards. Item 5 - Tokenised collateral This item will now be discussed at the next meeting. Item 6 – ESG Most firms did not lend Russian or Ukraine securities and collateral over the last few months  and they were also excluded from collateral sets. Some members discussed that work was initially required to define what constitutes a Russian security; one example shared was that of a non-Russia security with Russian beneficial owner. In the end  a cautious approach was adopted and the security was not lent. The Committee agreed that there was some reliance on ETFs and tri-party agents to continue to monitor the underlying assets  but felt that tri-parties were well practised in managing sanctions. Most lenders sought to recall their Russian assets. But there were different messages from Clearstream and Euroclear with regards to the timing and opening of Bridge Settlements. Some members felt that their instructions where not clear on when the sanctions where being applied and to which securities. Item 7 - D&I The London network of Women in Securities Finance (WISF) continues to grow in membership. As the industry returns to in-person events  the group this year has intentionally focussed on networking opportunities. Earlier this year it completed full launch of a new networking initiative called ‘Grow Your Network’ (GYN) this enables women to establish connections with other people across the securities finance industry  helping to advance them professionally  as well as giving them the opportunity to support others to grow. ‘Grow Your Network’ creates a series of one-to-one connections by pairing WISF members with individuals where opportunities to cross paths may not have existed  for short icebreaker introductions. Pairings take into consideration backgrounds  experience  and different grades  to ensure diverse matching. The WISF London Network aims to run at least two rounds of GYN this year. Its first in-person networking event will take place at the ISLA Annual Conference in Vienna on June 6-8th  which will be open to all delegates  inclusive of all genders  and present opportunity for members to connect across the growing membership. Item 8 - AOB The Committee will seek to discuss at a future meeting implementation of the output floor under Basel 4. Based on the proposals some Beneficial Owners will not be rated. There was interest from some Committee members to discuss how to incorporate this in the future regime.

5639,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.ledgerinsights.com/jp-morgan-uses-blockchain-for-collateral-settlement/,JP Morgan uses blockchain for collateral settlement,1 day ago,Yesterday Bloomberg reported that JP Morgan Chase has developed a collateral management blockchain solution for traditional finance. Last week it executed its first transaction by tokenizing BlackRock money market fund shares and using them as collateral. This is the latest solution from its Onyx blockchain and digital assets division.“What we’ve achieved is the frictionless transfer of collateral assets on an instantaneous basis ” said Ben Challice  JPMorgan’s global head of trading services. While the asset was a money market fund in this case  it plans to tokenize equities  fixed income and other asset types on its enterprise blockchain network. BlackRock wasn’t one of the counterparties but was heavily involved and is interested in the technology. It also enables collateral to be managed outside of normal trading house.“As the crypto sector grows over time  there will be a growing set of financial activities that happen on the public blockchain  so we want to make sure that we are able to not only support that but also be ready to provide related services ” added Challice.This is by no means the first use of blockchain for collateral management  but Challice’s comments suggest expanding use cases perhaps beyond purely interbank applications.JP Morgan’s Onyx division has multiple applications in production  including JPM Coin  interbank payments  including its Partior joint venture  and repo trading.JP Morgan’s blockchain collateral experienceThe bank knows a fair bit about using blockchain for this collateral use case because it’s involved in at least two other projects. It’s an investor in a major European-based collateral platform HQLAX  alongside numerous international banks such as Goldman Sachs  Citi  BNP Paribas  BNY Mellon  ING  Commerzbank  UBS and Credit Suisse. The largest outside investor is the Deutsche Boerse which provides a core piece of functionality. In that case  the collateral and securities lending is used for banks to ensure they have the right mix of liquid assets as required by Basel III banking rules.It was also a founding participant in the startup Baton System’s collateral management platform for foreign exchange derivative transactions. Core Collateral  the startup’s distributed ledger technology platform  processes several billion dollars in transactions daily and claims to handle more than 40% of the margins globally for cleared bank derivatives.There are several other DLT-based collateral and securities lending projects  including from the Tel Aviv stock exchange  OCC securities  and the Spanish stock exchange  BME.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,neutral,0.04,0.91,0.05,True,English,"['JP Morgan', 'collateral settlement', 'blockchain', 'BlackRock money market fund shares', 'Basel III banking rules', 'Tel Aviv stock exchange', 'foreign exchange derivative transactions', 'major European-based collateral platform', 'several other DLT-based collateral', 'collateral management blockchain solution', 'Spanish stock exchange', 'several billion dollars', 'two other projects', 'Partior joint venture', 'collateral management platform', 'other asset types', 'normal trading house', 'ledger technology platform', 'enterprise blockchain network', 'numerous international banks', 'largest outside investor', 'startup Baton System', 'digital assets division', 'securities lending projects', 'blockchain collateral experience', 'JP Morgan Chase', 'collateral use case', 'latest solution', 'collateral assets', 'Onyx division', 'Core Collateral', 'trading services', 'first use', 'use cases', 'repo trading', 'liquid assets', 'OCC securities', 'Onyx blockchain', 'public blockchain', 'traditional finance', 'first transaction', 'frictionless transfer', 'instantaneous basis', 'global head', 'fixed income', 'crypto sector', 'growing set', 'financial activities', 'related services', 'interbank applications', 'multiple applications', 'JPM Coin', 'interbank payments', 'fair bit', 'Goldman Sachs', 'BNP Paribas', 'BNY Mellon', 'Credit Suisse', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'core piece', 'right mix', 'founding participant', 'Ben Challice', 'Bloomberg', 'JPMorgan', 'equities', 'counterparties', 'time', 'means', 'comments', 'production', 'HQLAX', 'Citi', 'Commerzbank', 'UBS', 'functionality', 'margins', 'derivatives', 'BME']",2022-05-27,2022-05-28,ledgerinsights.com
5640,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4514971-patrizia-german-reits-sweet-sour-today,Patrizia: Are German REITs Sweet Or Sour Today?,1 day ago,"Mariha-kitchen/iStock via Getty ImagesGerman public real estate funds in a nutshellFor as long as anyone can remember  German housewives have been cooking a dish called ""Rotkohl "" or red cabbage mixed with apples  vinegar  cloves  cinnamon  sugar  onions  fruit jams  caraway seeds  garlic  wine  raisins  and any number of spices  which made it both sour and sweet in the same way.I think that the characteristics of this nationally famous meal can be a good metaphor for describing the historical performance of the German REITs  which turned from sour to sweet and vice versa several times within the last 18 years  as you can see from the FTSE EPRA NAREIT Germany Index analysis below. Therefore  I want to determine whether sourness or sweetness prevails today in the German REIT market.Source: markets.ft.com / FTSE EPRA Nareit Germany Index PriceStarting our analysis of German REITs (or so-called G-REITs)  I have to say that German and international investors have enjoyed REIT legislation since 2007  when the country implemented the following fundamental rules:At least 75% of the total assets of the G-REIT must be immovable property  and at least 75% of its gross earnings must derive from rental  leasing  letting  and disposal of immovable propertyThe G-REIT has to distribute at least 90% of its net income  calculated under German GAAP  to its shareholders until the end of the following business yearAll current income is tax-exempt and capital gains are tax-exemptIn general  the investor has to pay a withholding tax of 25% plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge on the withholding tax  totaling 26.375%Having defined the legislative requirements of G-REITs  I need to mention that the universe of G-REITs at the local Deutsche Boerse Stock Exchange is presented by 12 public funds  broken down into four core sectors:Multifamily: Vonovia (OTCPK:VNNVF)  Grand City Properties (OTC:GRNNF)  TAG Immobilien (OTC:TAGOF)  LEG Immobilien (OTCPK:LEGIF)  Adler (OTC:ADPPF)Mixed Use: Hamborner (OTC:HANBF)  Deutsche Wohnen (OTCPK:DWHHF)  Aroundtown (OTCPK:AANNF)  Patrizia (OTC:PTZIF)Office: DIC Asset (OTCPK:DDCCF)  alstria office (OTC:ALSRF)Retail: Deutsche EuroShop (OTC:DUSCF)In terms of public valuation  the Multifamily sector occupies more than 60% of the total capitalization pie of ~ EUR 62 bln as of May 2022. (see infographics below).Source: Author's calculations based on public market capitalization data of German REITsInvestment analysis of German REITsI am going to guide you through the 3-step process of how I assess the investment attractiveness of German REITs in the current market environment:General Index analysis Analysis of strength of the regional economy Valuation metrics analysisGeneral index analysisFrom the macro standpoint  the current total capitalization of all 12 REITs corresponds with almost the lowest value of the iSTOXX® Germany Real Estate Capped 20 index for the last five years  which gives me the first impression of the right timing to enter the market in general.Source: iSTOXX® Germany Real Estate Capped 20 indexLands economic strengths analysisAs you may know  the Federal Republic of Germany consists of Lands (actually  sixteen partly sovereign federated states)  each of which has its unique cultural environment and economic power. Therefore  I thought it would be interesting to create an analytical framework to see the potential of each land and match it with the portfolio allocation of REITs  ranging by the highest percent of investments into a particular land. By overlapping two dimensions  we could identify REITs  investing in the most attractive areas. For this analysis  I decided to use three indicators:Purchasing powerThe highest GRP (gross regional product)The highest level of HDI (human development index)Below you can see the result:Source: A map created by Author with a template from yourfreetemplates.com and information about GfK Purchasing Power  GRP (2018)  and HDI (2018) from wikipedia.org. The Author calculates the REITs assets allocation.Two main outcomes:Three lands - North Rhine-Westphalia  Baden-Wurttemberg  and Bavaria - are the leaders in this assessment Hamborner is the only REIT with large (>15%) portfolio allocations in these three landsSo  Hamborner could be an excellent long-term investment  bearing in mind its unusually high free float (~ 77% of shares outstanding) for those who are valuation-agnostic and looking for alternative ways to screen potential targets for their REIT portfolio.Also  I would like to touch TAG Immobilien slightly. Despite its highest portfolio allocations outside the perimeter of top-3 lands  it will invest (and has already invested) heavily into Polish assets  including the acquisition of local developer ROBYG - the leading player in the Polish residential market.I fully agree with the investment rationale of TAG as against the backdrop of its macroeconomic solid and demographic growth  Poland is experiencing a structural gap between demand and supply in the multifamily segment for historical reasons. Therefore  it deserves attention from the individual and institutional investors.Source: TAG Immobilien company presentation as of May-2022I fully agree with the investment rationale of TAG as against the backdrop of its macroeconomic solid and demographic growth  Poland is experiencing a structural gap between demand and supply in the multifamily segment for historical reasons. Therefore  it deserves attention from the individual and institutional investors.Valuation metrics analysisJust as in my previous articles about the local landscape of REITs in different countries  I prepared a few data tables to make a snapshot of the current valuation of 11 REITs and calculate the necessary metrics for different investment strategies. (I excluded Adler because of alleged manipulation of financial reports and apparent fraud by the management. For those interested in reading about this story  which could be a great addition to David Einhorn's collection of short sales  please see a fascinating report by the research group Viceroy Research).Source: Author's calculations Source: Author's calculationsThe bottom line is that amongst 11 REITs:Deutsche Wohnen and DIC Asset have the lowest P/NAV ratio Deutsche EuroShop and DIC Asset have the lowest P/FFO 2021 multiple Patrizia has the highest cap rate spread TAG Immobilien and DIC Asset have the highest dividend yieldBearing the results of my 3-step analysis in mind  I would like to highlight one of my favorite German REITs  which a) seems undervalued to me and b) has an excitingly scalable business model.Patrizia - my top pick from the German REIT marketSpeaking about a mixed-use REIT Patrizia  I have to say that it has a unique business model for Germany and other European REITs. I would better identify this company as PREIM or public real estate investment manager instead of REIT because its operations are almost entirely based on the fee model  managing real estate investments for institutional  semi-professional  and private investors. Looking at the balance sheet:Source: Patrizia company presentation as of May-2022 Source: Patrizia company presentation as of May-2022I have to say that it is one of the strongest I have ever seen in the REIT space overall.1) The net equity ratio is more than 70%Equity (excl. non-controlling interests) divided by total net assets (total assets less loans covered by cash in hand)2) Interest-bearing Debt/Total Assets is 17.5%3) Two-fifths of the asset side of the balance sheet is a highly liquid part of assets (cash + deposits + current receivables)Overall  Patrizia  still being a founder-led company (CEO Wolfgang Egger founded it in 1984!)  has four core activities:Placing and managing fund assets in core and core+ strategies for clients through its platformsCo-investing with clients in value-add and opportunistic segmentsPlaying the role of Fund of Fund  investing clients' money into the best RE funds around the worldSpeculatively investing from its balanceSource: Patrizia company presentation as of May-2022Generating five types of cash flows:Management fees based on AUMTransaction fees based on the volume of purchases or salesPerformance fees for achieving investment hurdlesNet sales revenues and co-investment income as return on capital employedSource: Patrizia company presentation as of May-2022Also  unexpectedly for me  but considering the six years  Patrizia found its way to top-3 dealmakers in Europe.Source: Patrizia company presentation as of May-2022The investment rationale for Patrizia is supported by the asset-light  mixed fee-based business model  and strong AUM  which reflects in the decisions of the Analyst community. Eight out of eight analysts covering this REIT confirmed their BUY opinion in Q1 2022 with a target price of EUR 26.8 (> 65% upside):Source: Patrizia analyst report as of May-2022ConclusionTo sum up  I would like to tell my readers that  in my opinion  the German REIT market is worth spending additional time looking through using different analytical frameworks. Furthermore  I hope my article will help you get a first impression of the state of the market nowadays or make you think about adding any of them to your portfolios.

BendjamaThe abstract can be accessed on the ASCO and Transgene websites.***About the clinical trialsTG4050 is being evaluated in two Phase I clinical trials for patients with ovarian cancer (NCT03839524) and HPV-negative head and neck cancers (NCT04183166).In a first Phase I trial  TG4050 is being administered to patients with HPV-negative head and neck cancer. A personalized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive an adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants receive their vaccine immediately after they complete their adjuvant treatment. The other half is given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease. This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who have a high risk of relapse. Up to 30 patients will receive TG4050 in France  in the UK and in the USA. The principal investigator of the trial is Prof. Christian Ottensmeier  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre and Professor of Immuno-Oncology at the University of Liverpool. In France  the clinical trial is being conducted at Institut Curie  Paris by Prof. Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  Head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i)  and at the IUCT-Oncopole  Toulouse by Prof. Jean-Pierre Delord. In the USA  the trial is being led by Dr. Yujie Zhao  MD  PhD  at the Mayo Clinic. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.In parallel  a Phase I clinical trial of TG4050 is enrolling patients with ovarian cancer. This second trial is including patients at the time of asymptomatic relapse after surgery and first-line chemotherapy. Dr. Matthew Block  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncology  Consultant Immunology and Associate Professor of Oncology at the Mayo Clinic (USA) is the principal investigator of the trial; in France  the trial is being conducted by Prof. Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  at Institut Curie and by Dr. Alexandra Martinez  MD  Associate Head of Surgical Department  at IUCT-Oncopole. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.The first preliminary clinical data generated from the first patients treated with TG4050 were very encouraging.About myvac®myvac® is a viral vector (MVA – Modified Vaccinia Ankara) based  individualized immunotherapy platform that has been developed by Transgene to target solid tumors. myvac®-derived products are designed to stimulate the patient’s immune system  recognize and destroy tumors using the patient’s own cancer specific genetic mutations.

5655,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/green-hydrogen-ipo/8552849/,Bryan Garnier was joint global coordinator and joint bookrunner for green hydrogen company IPO,1 day ago,The independent investment bank is taking on the roles for Lhyfe at its €110 million IPO on Euronext Paris.Leading European healthcare and tech-related company independent investment bank Bryan Garnier was Lhyfe’s joint global coordinator and joint bookrunner at the green hydrogen company’s €110 million IPO on Euronext Paris.Institutional and strategic investors from France  Norway and Portugal made cornerstone investments.Once the greenshoe has been fully exercised  the transaction value could rise to reach €124 million  for a market capitalization higher than €400 million.Lhyfe is a top green hydrogen producer and supplier. It produces the carbon emission-free fuel through a process powered by renewable energy that also does not generate any greenhouse gas emissions. A leader among green hydrogen companies  Lhyfe was first established in 2017. It now operates in more than ten countries  including France and Denmark.The company develops renewable H2 projects to be used for industry and mobility applications. It currently boasts a 93-project pipeline throughout Europe and is slated for 4.8 GW of total production capacity by 2028.At a time in which the world is decarbonizing and the energy crisis is escalating in Europe due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia –from which much of Europe imports their energy – Lhyfe is positioning itself to play a key role in the energy transition acceleration.The green hydrogen company’s IPO arrived at a time when the European Commission is committing to H2.Earlier this month  the European Commission tripled its H2 commitment through its REPowerEU Plan. Within that strategy  it has now created a 350 GW H2 capacity target for 2030. This is notably larger than the 80 GW target it had set in the previous version of the strategy. The target includes both domestic H2 production as well as imports of the clean fuel.It has underscored the importance of H2 made using renewable energy for carbon emission-free production. This acceleration is greatly to do with the effort to reduce European dependency on importing Russian energy. That said  it aligns with an already existing intention to transition away from fossil fuels in favor of cleaner sources of energy.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,neutral,0.05,0.89,0.06,True,English,"['green hydrogen company', 'joint global coordinator', 'joint bookrunner', 'Bryan Garnier', 'IPO', 'tech-related company independent investment bank', 'top green hydrogen producer', '350 GW H2 capacity target', 'green hydrogen company', 'green hydrogen companies', 'total production capacity', 'greenhouse gas emissions', 'carbon emission-free production', 'joint global coordinator', 'carbon emission-free fuel', 'domestic H2 production', 'Leading European healthcare', 'renewable H2 projects', 'energy transition acceleration', '80 GW target', 'joint bookrunner', 'clean fuel', 'H2 commitment', 'European Commission', 'European dependency', 'renewable energy', 'Euronext Paris', 'Bryan Garnier', 'strategic investors', 'cornerstone investments', 'transaction value', 'market capitalization', 'ten countries', 'mobility applications', '93-project pipeline', 'Russian invasion', 'key role', 'REPowerEU Plan', 'previous version', 'existing intention', 'fossil fuels', 'cleaner sources', 'energy crisis', 'Russian energy', '€110 million IPO', '4.8 GW', 'H2.', 'roles', 'Lhyfe', 'Institutional', 'France', 'Norway', 'Portugal', 'greenshoe', 'supplier', 'process', 'leader', 'Denmark', 'industry', 'time', 'world', 'Ukraine', 'sanctions', 'strategy', 'imports', 'importance', 'effort', 'favor']",2022-05-27,2022-05-28,hydrogenfuelnews.com

BendjamaThe abstract can be accessed on the ASCO and Transgene websites.***About the clinical trialsTG4050 is being evaluated in two Phase I clinical trials for patients with ovarian cancer (NCT03839524) and HPV-negative head and neck cancers (NCT04183166).In a first Phase I trial  TG4050 is being administered to patients with HPV-negative head and neck cancer. A personalized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive an adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants receive their vaccine immediately after they complete their adjuvant treatment. The other half is given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease. This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who have a high risk of relapse. Up to 30 patients will receive TG4050 in France  in the UK and in the USA. The principal investigator of the trial is Prof. Christian Ottensmeier  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre and Professor of Immuno-Oncology at the University of Liverpool. In France  the clinical trial is being conducted at Institut Curie  Paris by Prof. Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  Head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i)  and at the IUCT-Oncopole  Toulouse by Prof. Jean-Pierre Delord. In the USA  the trial is being led by Dr. Yujie Zhao  MD  PhD  at the Mayo Clinic. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.In parallel  a Phase I clinical trial of TG4050 is enrolling patients with ovarian cancer. This second trial is including patients at the time of asymptomatic relapse after surgery and first-line chemotherapy. Dr. Matthew Block  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncology  Consultant Immunology and Associate Professor of Oncology at the Mayo Clinic (USA) is the principal investigator of the trial; in France  the trial is being conducted by Prof. Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  at Institut Curie and by Dr. Alexandra Martinez  MD  Associate Head of Surgical Department  at IUCT-Oncopole. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.The first preliminary clinical data generated from the first patients treated with TG4050 were very encouraging.About myvac®myvac® is a viral vector (MVA – Modified Vaccinia Ankara) based  individualized immunotherapy platform that has been developed by Transgene to target solid tumors. myvac®-derived products are designed to stimulate the patient’s immune system  recognize and destroy tumors using the patient’s own cancer specific genetic mutations.

5671,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.ifre.com/story/3381899/russia-faces-credit-event-question-again-dxt15bmh4p,Russia faces credit event question – again,1 day ago,"There was a sense of deja vu over Russia's status in the international financial markets after a market participant posed a question to a derivatives industry body on Thursday about ""a failure to pay credit event"" by the sovereign. A ruling in favour could lead to payouts to holders of credit default swap contracts against Russia.It is the latest in a series of questions the EMEA Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee has fielded around a potential Russian default since the country's invasion of Ukraine in February. Most recently  the 14-member committee ruled unanimously in April that ""a potential failure to pay"" had occurred after Russia threatened to make payments due on two US dollar bonds in roubles. The triggering of CDS contracts was eventually averted after Russia paid its international bondholders in US dollars before the two bonds' grace period had expired.One of the bonds subject to the committee's ruling in April was the sovereign 4.5% April 2022s and that note is at the heart of this latest question. This time the issue isn't about the potential currency of payment  instead bondholders argue that Russia owes about US$1.9m in accrued interest on the bond.Principal and coupon payments were due on April 4. But because Russia was unable to service the debt through its offshore reserves following further US government restrictions  it didn't make the payments until May 2 after Moscow decided to use its onshore assets. It made US$564.8m of principal and coupon payments on the April 2022s and US$84.4m of coupon payments on its April 2042s.Holders of the 2022s argue that Russia has not paid the interest accrued beyond April 4  ""putting it in default under the bonds""  according to a statement on the DC website.The bondholders said they ""submitted a default notice via Euroclear"" on May 11 ""demanding the payment"". They added that despite the demand  ""Russia has not paid the interest owed"".There is currently US$2.54bn of net notional CDS in Russia CDS to be settled  according to JP Morgan.Determine thisThe DC is meeting on May 27. Even if it rules that a credit event has occurred that would not be a formal declaration that Russia has defaulted  although it should lead to the CDS being triggered.Indeed  quite how any declaration of default can be made when the ratings agencies are no longer allowed to cover Russia remains to be seen. But even if the non-payment of the accrued interest isn't considered by market participants as a formal default  it seems only a matter of time before US actions push Russia into that situation.A special waiver  General License 9C  issued by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control that had let US citizens receive Russian bond payments was allowed to expire on May 25. Analysts said the decision had set the stage for Russia to default on its US$40bn or so of foreign currency bonds.""The game of chicken ended with OFAC putting the Russian chicken out of its misery "" said Tim Ash  senior EM sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. ""It's only a matter of time now before Russia formally defaults.""That could be in roughly a month's time – not on the April 2022s but on two other bonds  the US$3bn 4.75% 2026s and €1bn 2.65% 2036s.On May 20  Russia's finance ministry brought forward coupon payments on those two bonds even though they were not due until May 27. By making the payments to its National Settlement Depository  Russia said it had fulfilled its current obligations on the notes.Yet the funds have not been channelled to investors  according to one foreign holder of Russia's bonds  although he noted there was often a time lag.Whether  following OFAC's decision  the payments will still be processed to bondholders isn't clear. ""In theory  there is a chance that the payment may be processed even if the licence is not extended  since the finance ministry is technically not involved in the further stages of money flow "" said an analyst. ""On the 27th  the NSD will debit Euroclear’s account with the NSD and then Euroclear will either process the payment or not.""Euroclear did not respond to a request for comment.Grace under pressureEven if the monies on the 2026s and 2036s do eventually hit investors' accounts – they both have 30-day grace periods – Russia has further coupon payments due in June. A payment due on June 24 on the US dollar 12.75% 2028s looks vulnerable to OFAC's decision.""The 24th June bond is paid offshore and so without General License 9C [a payment] will presumably not be able to be made. That would then trigger a failure to pay CDS trigger after the 15 business day grace period "" said JP Morgan analysts.Investors might take other action  too. Holders of any affected sovereign bond may be tempted to accelerate  demanding all monies owed to them are paid.According to one restructuring lawyer  this is not commonly done where a formal negotiation between the debtor and its creditors is possible. However  in this situation such lawsuits might be filed since negotiations are unlikely and Russia has plenty of assets overseas  such as oil cargoes or central bank reserves  that could be seized by bondholders.According to Reuters  Russia's finance ministry said last week that the US Treasury's decision to end the waiver ""primarily infringes on the rights of the foreign investors in the Russian debt instruments"". It said the sovereign would continue to service its external debt in roubles  which could then be converted into the currency of issuance via the NSD.On Thursday  Interfax reported that finance minister Anton Siluanov said Russia was working on a new ""mechanism"" to facilitate future payments to its creditors  but did not give any further details.Additional reporting by Christopher Spink",negative,0.01,0.18,0.81,mixed,0.02,0.13,0.84,True,English,"['credit event question', 'Russia', 'EMEA Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee', '15 business day grace period', 'senior EM sovereign strategist', ""two bonds' grace period"", 'credit default swap contracts', 'two US dollar bonds', 'derivatives industry body', 'General License 9C', 'BlueBay Asset Management', 'National Settlement Depository', 'one foreign holder', '30-day grace periods', 'one restructuring lawyer', 'international financial markets', 'US government restrictions', 'two other bonds', 'net notional CDS', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'foreign currency bonds', 'potential Russian default', 'JP Morgan analysts', '24th June bond', 'Russian bond payments', 'credit event', 'CDS contracts', 'potential currency', '14-member committee', 'other action', 'sovereign bond', 'US dollars', 'US actions', 'US Treasury', 'US citizens', 'default notice', 'formal default', 'Russian chicken', 'deja vu', 'market participant', 'offshore reserves', 'onshore assets', 'DC website', 'The DC', 'ratings agencies', 'special waiver', 'Tim Ash', 'finance ministry', 'current obligations', 'money flow', 'CDS trigger', 'formal negotiation', 'international bondholders', 'sovereign 4.5% April', 'coupon payments', 'potential failure', 'latest question', 'April 2042s', 'formal declaration', ""investors' accounts"", 'time lag', 'April 2022s', 'Russia CDS', 'US$', 'sense', 'status', 'Thursday', 'ruling', 'favour', 'payouts', 'series', 'questions', 'country', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'roubles', 'triggering', 'note', 'heart', 'issue', 'accrued', 'interest', 'Principal', 'debt', 'May', 'Moscow', 'statement', 'Euroclear', 'demand', 'matter', 'situation', 'Office', 'decision', 'stage', 'game', 'OFAC', 'misery', 'month', 'funds', 'theory', 'chance', 'licence', 'further', '27th', 'NSD', 'request', 'comment', 'pressure', 'monies', '2026s', '2036s', '2028s', 'all', 'creditors', 'lawsuits', 'negotiations', 'plenty']",2022-05-28,2022-05-28,ifre.com

As of December 31  2020  we had two classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act: Class A common stock  $0.0001 par value per share (“Class A common stock”) and warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock.Our authorized capital stock consists of:● 700 000 000 shares of Class A common stock;● 500 000 000 shares of Class B common stock  par value $0.0001 per share (“Class B common stock”);● 300 000 000 shares of Class C common stock  par value $0.0001 per share (“Class C common stock” and  together with the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock  “common stock”); and● 100 000 000 shares of preferred stock  par value $0.0001 per share.Common StockVotingPursuant to the Charter  holders of Class A common stock and Class C common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to the stockholders for their vote or approval  except as required by applicable law. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to the stockholders for their vote or approval. Prior to the date on which Grosvenor Holdings  L.L.C.  GCM Grosvenor Management  LLC and Grosvenor Holdings II  L.L.C. (the “GCMH Equityholders”) beneficially own voting shares representing less than 20% of the amount of Class A common stock held by the GCMH Equityholders immediately following the closing of our business combination on November 17  2020 (the “Sunset Date”)  the holders of Class C common stock are entitled to the lesser of (i) 10 votes per share and (ii) the Class C Share Voting Amount (as defined in the Charter) on all matters submitted to stockholders for their vote or approval. From and after the Sunset Date  holders of Class C Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share. The Class B common stock is not entitled to vote (except as required by applicable law).As of May 27  2022  GCM V  LLC (“GCM V”) controlled approximately 75% of the combined voting power of our common stock as a result of its ownership of all of Class C common stock. Accordingly  Michael Sacks  through his control of GCM V  controls our business policies and affairs and can control any action requiring the general approval of our stockholders  including the election of our board  the adoption of amendments to the Charter and Bylaws and approval of any merger or sale of substantially all of its assets. Until the Sunset Date  Mr. Sacks will continue to control the outcome of matters submitted to the stockholders.The Class B common stock is non-voting and is not entitled to any votes on any matter that is submitted to a vote of our stockholders  except as required by Delaware law. Delaware law would permit holders of Class B common stock to vote  with one vote per share  on a matter if it were to (i) change the par value of the Class B common stock or (ii) amend the Charter to alter the powers  preferences  or special rights of the Class B common stock as a whole in a way that would adversely affect the holders of Class B common stock.As a result  in these limited instances  the holders of a majority of the Class B common stock could defeat such an amendment to the Charter. For example  if a proposed amendment of the Charter provided for the Class B common stock to rank junior to the Class A common stock or Class C common stock with respect to (i) any dividend or distribution  (ii) the distribution of proceeds were we to be acquired or (iii) any other right  Delaware law would require the separate vote of the holders of Class B common stock  with each share of Class B common stock entitled to one vote per share. In this instance  the holders of a majority of the Class B common stock could defeat that amendment to the Charter.6DividendsThe holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock (collectively  the “Economic Rights Stock”) are entitled to receive dividends as and if declared by our board of directors out of legally available funds. Under the Charter  dividends may not be declared or paid in respect of the Class A common stock or the Class B common stock unless they are declared or paid in the same amount in respect of the other class of Economic Rights Stock. With respect to stock dividends  holders of Class A common stock must receive Class A common stock and holders of Class B common stock must receive Class B common stock.The holders of Class C common stock do not have any right to receive dividends other than stock dividends consisting of shares of Class C common stock  paid proportionally with respect to each outstanding share of Class C common stock.Merger  Consolidation or Tender or Exchange OfferThe holders of Class A common stock are not entitled to receive economic consideration for their shares in excess of that payable to the holders of Class B common stock in connection with any merger  consolidation  or tender or exchange offer. However  in any such event involving consideration in the form of securities  the holders of Class B common stock will be deemed to have received the same consideration as the holders of Class A common stock.Liquidation or DissolutionUpon our liquidation or dissolution  the holders of all classes of common stock are entitled to their respective par value  and the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will then be entitled to share ratably in those of our assets that are legally available for distribution to stockholders after payment of liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any holders of preferred stock then outstanding. Other than their par value  the holders of Class C common stock will not have any right to receive a distribution upon our liquidation or dissolution.Conversion  Transferability and ExchangeSubject to the terms of the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Partnership Agreement of Grosvenor Capital Management Holdings  LLLP (“A&R LLLPA”)  the limited partners of Grosvenor Capital Management Holdings  LLLP (“GCMH”) (other than GCM Grosvenor Holdings  LLC (“IntermediateCo”)) may from time to time cause GCMH to redeem any or all of their units of partnership interest in GCMH (the “Grosvenor common units”) in exchange for  at our election (subject to certain exceptions)  either cash (based on the market price for a share of the Class A common stock) or shares of Class A common stock. At our election  such transaction may be effectuated via a direct exchange of Class A common stock or cash by IntermediateCo for the redeemed Grosvenor common units.The Charter provides that (i) a share of Class C common stock will automatically be cancelled for no consideration upon any sale or other transfer of a share of Class A common stock issued as a result of any redemption or direct exchange of Grosvenor common units transferred to any person that is not Michael Sacks  GCM V or the GCM Equityholders (or affiliate or owner thereof)  and (ii) a share of Class C common stock will automatically be cancelled for no consideration upon the redemption or exchange of a Grosvenor common unit for cash. Shares of Class A common stock  Class B common stock and Class C common stock are not subject to any conversion right.Other ProvisionsNone of the Class A common stock  Class B common stock or Class C common stock has any pre-emptive or other subscription rights  or sinking fund provisions.7Preferred StockWe are authorized to issue up to 100 000 000 shares of preferred stock. Our board of directors is authorized  subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and the Charter  to determine the terms and conditions of the preferred stock  including whether the shares of preferred stock will be issued in one or more series  the number of shares to be included in each series and the powers (including the voting power)  designations  preferences and rights of the shares. Our board of directors also will be authorized to designate any qualifications  limitations or restrictions on the shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of Class A common stock  Class B common stock and Class C common stock  which could have a negative impact on the market price of the Class A common stock.Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation or BylawsThe Bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority vote of our board of directors or by the holders of at least the majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon  subject to the Stockholders’ Agreement (for so long as it remains in effect). The affirmative vote of a majority of our board of directors and a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon is required to amend the Charter  subject to the terms contained therein.Exclusive ForumThe Charter provides that  to the fullest extent permitted by law  and unless we provide notice in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us  (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors  officers  employees  agents or stockholders to us or our stockholders  (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL  Charter or Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine  in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. The Charter further provides that  unless we otherwise consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  to the fullest extent permitted by law  the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933  as amended (the “Securities Act”). There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision relating to causes of action arising under the Securities Act  and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The clauses described above will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of the Charter and BylawsThe provisions of the Charter and Bylaws and of the DGCL summarized below may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay  defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that you might consider in your best interest  including an attempt that might result in your receipt of a premium over the market price for your shares of Class A common stock.The Charter and Bylaws contain certain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing our future takeover or change in control unless such takeover or change in control is approved by our board of directors.These provisions include:Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings of Stockholders. The Charter provides that  until we are no longer a “controlled company” under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(1)  stockholder action can be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. The Charter and Bylaws also provide that  subject to any special rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock and except as otherwise required by law  special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by our board of directors  the chairman or so long as we are a “controlled company ” by the Secretary at the request of any holder of at least 25% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors  voting together as a single class. Stockholders are not otherwise permitted to call a special meeting or to require our board of directors to call a special meeting.8Advance Notice Procedures. The Bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders  and for stockholder nominations of persons for election to our board of directors to be brought before an annual or special meeting of stockholders. Stockholders at an annual meeting will only be able to consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting  who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has given our Secretary timely written notice  in proper form  of the stockholder’s intention to bring that business or nomination before the meeting. Although the Bylaws do not give our board of directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting  as applicable  the Bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed or may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.Authorized but Unissued Shares. Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuance without stockholder approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes  including future public offerings to raise additional capital  corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of a majority of our common stock by means of a proxy contest  tender offer  merger or otherwise.Business Combinations with Interested Stockholders. The Charter provides that we are not subject to Section 203 of the DGCL  an anti-takeover law. In general  Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination  such as a merger  with an “interested stockholder” (which includes a person or group owning 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder  unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. However  the Charter contains provisions that have a similar effect to Section 203  except that they provide that Mr. Sacks and the GCMH Equityholders  their respective affiliates and successors and their direct and indirect transferees will not be deemed to be “interested stockholders ” regardless of the percentage of our voting stock owned by them  and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions.Corporate OpportunitiesThe Charter provides that  to the fullest extent permitted by law  we renounce any interest or expectancy in a transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for us and Mr. Sacks (other than in his capacity as an officer and employee of our Company)  the GCMH Equityholders  or any of our non-employee directors have no duty to present such corporate opportunity to us and they may invest in competing businesses or do business with our clients or customers.Registration RightsOn November 17  2020  we entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the CF Sponsor  the GCMH Equityholders and certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors that agreed to purchase shares of Class A common stock in a private placement in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain transaction agreement dated as of August 2  2020. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement  we agreed to register for resale  pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act  certain shares of our Class A common stock and other equity securities that are held by the parties thereto from time to time.Transfer Agent and RegistrarThe transfer agent for our common stock is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.

(Section 6.1) The occurrence of certain Events of Default or an acceleration under the indenture may constitute an event of default under certain indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries outstanding from time to time.We will provide the trustee written notice of any Default or Event of Default within 30 days of becoming aware of the occurrence of such Default or Event of Default  which notice will describe in reasonable detail the status of such Default or Event of Default and what action we are taking or propose to take in respect thereof. (Section 6.1)If an Event of Default with respect to debt securities of any series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing  then the trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may  by a notice in writing to us (and to the trustee if given by the holders)  declare to be due and payable immediately the principal of (or  if the debt securities of that series are discount securities  that portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all debt securities of that series. In the case of an Event of Default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization  the principal (or such specified amount) of and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all outstanding debt securities will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of outstanding debt securities. At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to debt securities of any series has been made  but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may rescind and annul the acceleration if all Events of Default  other than the non-payment of accelerated principal and interest  if any  with respect to debt securities of that series  have been cured or waived as provided in the indenture.

(Section 6.12)No holder of any debt security of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding  judicial or otherwise  with respect to the indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee  or for any remedy under the indenture  unless:● that holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to debt securities of that series; and● the holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have made written request  and offered indemnity or security satisfactory to the trustee  to the trustee to institute the proceeding as trustee  and the trustee has not received from the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series a direction inconsistent with that request and has failed to institute the proceeding within 60 days. (Section 6.7)Notwithstanding any other provision in the indenture  the holder of any debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of  premium and any interest on that debt security on or after the due dates expressed in that debt security and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment. (Section 6.8)The indenture requires us  within 120 days after the end of our fiscal year  to furnish to the trustee a statement as to compliance with the indenture. (Section 4.3) If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the securities of any series and if it is known to a responsible officer of the trustee  the trustee shall mail to each Securityholder of the securities of that series notice of a Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs or  if later  after a responsible officer of the trustee has knowledge of such Default or Event of Default. The indenture provides that the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any series of any Default or Event of Default (except in payment on any debt securities of that series) with respect to debt securities of that series if the trustee determines in good faith that withholding notice is in the interest of the holders of those debt securities.

(Section 9.1)We may also modify and amend the indenture with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected by the modifications or amendments. We may not make any modification or amendment without the consent of the holders of each affected debt security then outstanding if that amendment will:● reduce the amount of debt securities whose holders must consent to an amendment  supplement or waiver;● reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any debt security;● reduce the principal of or premium on or change the fixed maturity of any debt security or reduce the amount of  or postpone the date fixed for  the payment of any sinking fund or analogous obligation with respect to any series of debt securities;● reduce the principal amount of discount securities payable upon acceleration of maturity;● waive a default in the payment of the principal of  premium or interest on any debt security (except a rescission of acceleration of the debt securities of any series by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding debt securities of that series and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);● make the principal of or premium or interest on any debt security payable in currency other than that stated in the debt security;● make any change to certain provisions of the indenture relating to  among other things  the right of holders of debt securities to receive payment of the principal of  premium and interest on those debt securities and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and to waivers or amendments; or● waive a redemption payment with respect to any debt security. (Section 9.3)Except for certain specified provisions  the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may on behalf of the holders of all debt securities of that series waive our compliance with provisions of the indenture. (Section 9.2) The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may on behalf of the holders of all the debt securities of such series waive any past default under the indenture with respect to that series and its consequences  except a default in the payment of the principal of  premium or any interest on any debt security of that series; provided  however  that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may rescind an acceleration and its consequences  including any related payment default that resulted from the acceleration. (Section 6.13)15Defeasance of Debt Securities and Certain Covenants in Certain CircumstancesLegal Defeasance. The indenture provides that  unless otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable series of debt securities  we may be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the debt securities of any series (subject to certain exceptions). We will be so discharged upon the irrevocable deposit with the trustee  in trust  of money and/or U.S. government obligations or  in the case of debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars  government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency  that  through the payment of interest and principal in accordance with their terms  will provide money or U.S. government obligations in an amount sufficient in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank to pay and discharge each installment of principal  premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of the debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the indenture and those debt securities.This discharge may occur only if  among other things  we have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that we have received from  or there has been published by  the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling or  since the date of execution of the indenture  there has been a change in the applicable United States federal income tax law  in either case to the effect that  and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that  the holders of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income  gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit  defeasance and discharge and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit  defeasance and discharge had not occurred. (Section 8.3)Defeasance of Certain Covenants. The indenture provides that  unless otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable series of debt securities  upon compliance with certain conditions:● we may omit to comply with the covenant described under the heading “Consolidation  Merger and Sale of Assets” and certain other covenants set forth in the indenture  as well as any additional covenants which may be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement; and● any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of that series (“covenant defeasance”).The conditions include:● depositing with the trustee money and/or U.S. government obligations or  in the case of debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars  government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency  that  through the payment of interest and principal in accordance with their terms  will provide money in an amount sufficient in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank to pay and discharge each installment of principal of  premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of the debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the indenture and those debt securities; and● delivering to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income  gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and related covenant defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit and related covenant defeasance had not occurred. (Section 8.4)16No Personal Liability of Directors  Officers  Employees or SecurityholdersNone of our past  present or future directors  officers  employees or securityholders  as such  will have any liability for any of our obligations under the debt securities or the indenture or for any claim based on  or in respect or by reason of  such obligations or their creation. By accepting a debt security  each holder waives and releases all such liability. This waiver and release is part of the consideration for the issue of the debt securities. However  this waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws  and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.Governing LawThe indenture and the debt securities  including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the indenture or the securities  will be governed by the laws of the State of New York.The indenture will provide that we  the trustee and the holders of the debt securities (by their acceptance of the debt securities) irrevocably waive  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to the indenture  the debt securities or the transactions contemplated thereby.The indenture will provide that any legal suit  action or proceeding arising out of or based upon the indenture or the transactions contemplated thereby may be instituted in the federal courts of the United States of America located in the City of New York or the courts of the State of New York in each case located in the City of New York  and we  the trustee and the holder of the debt securities (by their acceptance of the debt securities) irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit  action or proceeding. The indenture will further provide that service of any process  summons  notice or document by mail (to the extent allowed under any applicable statute or rule of court) to such party’s address set forth in the indenture will be effective service of process for any suit  action or other proceeding brought in any such court. The indenture will further provide that we  the trustee and the holders of the debt securities (by their acceptance of the debt securities) irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any suit  action or other proceeding in the courts specified above and irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim any such suit  action or other proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. (Section 10.10)17DESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARESWe may  at our option  elect to offer depositary shares rather than full shares of preferred stock. Each depositary share will represent ownership of and entitlement to all rights and preferences of a fraction of a share of preferred stock of a specified series (including dividend  voting  redemption and liquidation rights). The applicable fraction will be specified in a prospectus supplement. The shares of preferred stock represented by the depositary shares will be deposited with a depositary named in the applicable prospectus supplement  under a deposit agreement among us  the depositary and the holders of the certificates evidencing depositary shares (“depositary receipts”). Depositary receipts will be delivered to those persons purchasing depositary shares in the offering. The depositary will be the transfer agent  registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the depositary shares. Holders of depositary receipts agree to be bound by the deposit agreement  which requires holders to take certain actions such as filing proof of residence and paying certain charges.The summary of the terms of the depositary shares contained in this prospectus does not purport to be complete and is subject to  and qualified in its entirety by  the provisions of the deposit agreement and the Charter and the certificate of designation that are  or will be  filed with the SEC for the applicable series of preferred stock.DividendsThe depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary shares to the record holders of depositary receipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares owned by such holders on the relevant record date  which will be the same date as the record date fixed by us for the applicable series of preferred stock. The depositary  however  will distribute only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any depositary share a fraction of one cent  and any balance not so distributed will be added to and treated as part of the next sum received by the depositary for distribution to record holders of depositary receipts then outstanding.In the event of a distribution other than in cash  the depositary will distribute property received by it to the record holders of depositary receipts entitled thereto  in proportion  as nearly as may be practicable  to the number of depositary shares owned by such holders on the relevant record date  unless the depositary determines (after consultation with us) that it is not feasible to make such distribution  in which case the depositary may (with our approval) adopt any other method for such distribution as it deems equitable and appropriate  including the sale of such property (at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem equitable and appropriate) and distribution of the net proceeds from such sale to such holders.Liquidation PreferenceIn the event of the liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the affairs of GCM Grosvenor  whether voluntary or involuntary  the holders of each depositary share will be entitled to the fraction of the liquidation preference accorded each share of the applicable series of preferred stock as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.RedemptionIf the series of preferred stock represented by the applicable series of depositary shares is redeemable  such depositary shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption  in whole or in part  of the preferred stock held by the depositary. Whenever we redeem any preferred stock held by the depositary  the depositary will redeem as of the same redemption date the number of depositary shares representing the shares of preferred stock so redeemed. The depositary will mail the notice of redemption promptly upon receipt of such notice from us and not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of the preferred stock and the depositary shares to the record holders of the depositary receipts.18VotingPromptly upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of the series of preferred stock represented by the applicable series of depositary shares are entitled to vote  the depositary will mail the information contained in such notice of meeting to the record holders of the depositary receipts as of the record date for such meeting. Each such record holder of depositary receipts will be entitled to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the number of shares of preferred stock represented by such record holder’s depositary shares. The depositary will endeavor  insofar as practicable  to vote such preferred stock represented by such depositary shares in accordance with such instructions  and we will agree to take all action which may be deemed necessary by the depositary in order to enable the depositary to do so. The depositary will abstain from voting any of the preferred stock to the extent that it does not receive specific instructions from the holders of depositary receipts.Withdrawal of Preferred StockUpon surrender of depositary receipts at the principal office of the depositary and payment of any unpaid amount due the depositary  and subject to the terms of the deposit agreement  the owner of the depositary shares evidenced thereby is entitled to delivery of the number of whole shares of preferred stock and all money and other property  if any  represented by such depositary shares. Partial shares of preferred stock will not be issued. If the depositary receipts delivered by the holder evidence a number of depositary shares in excess of the number of depositary shares representing the number of whole shares of preferred stock to be withdrawn  the depositary will deliver to such holder at the same time a new depositary receipt evidencing such excess number of depositary shares. Holders of preferred stock thus withdrawn will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such shares under the deposit agreement or to receive depositary receipts evidencing depositary shares therefor.Amendment and Termination of Deposit AgreementThe form of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary shares and any provision of the deposit agreement may at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between us and the depositary. However  any amendment which materially and adversely alters the rights of the holders (other than any change in fees) of depositary shares will not be effective unless such amendment has been approved by at least a majority of the depositary shares then outstanding. No such amendment may impair the right  subject to the terms of the deposit agreement  of any owner of any depositary shares to surrender the depositary receipt evidencing such depositary shares with instructions to the depositary to deliver to the holder of the preferred stock and all money and other property  if any  represented thereby  except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law.The deposit agreement will be permitted to be terminated by us upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to the applicable depositary if a majority of each series of preferred stock affected by such termination consents to such termination  whereupon such depositary will be required to deliver or make available to each holder of depositary receipts  upon surrender of the depositary receipts held by such holder  such number of whole or fractional shares of preferred stock as are represented by the depositary shares evidenced by such depositary receipts together with any other property held by such depositary with respect to such depositary receipts. In addition  the deposit agreement will automatically terminate if (a) all outstanding depositary shares thereunder shall have been redeemed  (b) there shall have been a final distribution in respect of the related preferred stock in connection with any liquidation  dissolution or winding-up of GCM Grosvenor and such distribution shall have been distributed to the holders of depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares representing such preferred stock or (c) each share of the related preferred stock shall have been converted into stock of GCM Grosvenor not so represented by depositary shares.Charges of DepositaryWe will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary arrangements. We will pay charges of the depositary in connection with the initial deposit of the preferred stock and initial issuance of the depositary shares  and redemption of the preferred stock and all withdrawals of preferred stock by owners of depositary shares. Holders of depositary receipts will pay transfer  income and other taxes and governmental charges and certain other charges as are provided in the deposit agreement to be for their accounts. In certain circumstances  the depositary may refuse to transfer depositary shares  may withhold dividends and distributions and sell the depositary shares evidenced by such depositary receipt if such charges are not paid. The applicable prospectus supplement will include information with respect to fees and charges  if any  in connection with the deposit or substitution of the underlying securities  the receipt and distribution of dividends  the sale or exercise of rights  the withdrawal of the underlying security  and the transferring  splitting or grouping of receipts. The applicable prospectus supplement will also include information with respect to the right to collect the fees and charges  if any  against dividends received and deposited securities.19MiscellaneousThe depositary will forward to the holders of depositary receipts all notices  reports and proxy soliciting material from us which are delivered to the depositary and which we are required to furnish to the holders of the preferred stock. In addition  the depositary will make available for inspection by holders of depositary receipts at the principal office of the depositary  and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable  any notices  reports and proxy soliciting material received from us which are received by the depositary as the holder of preferred stock. The applicable prospectus supplement will include information about the rights  if any  of holders of receipts to inspect the transfer books of the depositary and the list of holders of receipts.Neither the depositary nor GCM Grosvenor assumes any obligation or will be subject to any liability under the deposit agreement to holders of depositary receipts other than for its negligence or willful misconduct. Neither the depositary nor GCM Grosvenor will be liable if it is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond its control in performing its obligations under the deposit agreement. The obligations of GCM Grosvenor and the depositary under the deposit agreement will be limited to performance in good faith of their duties thereunder  and they will not be obligated to prosecute or defend any legal proceeding in respect of any depositary shares or preferred stock unless satisfactory indemnity is furnished. GCM Grosvenor and the depositary may rely on written advice of counsel or accountants  on information provided by holders of the depositary receipts or other persons believed in good faith to be competent to give such information and on documents believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.In the event the depositary shall receive conflicting claims  requests or instructions from any holders of depositary receipts  on the one hand  and us  on the other hand  the depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims  requests or instructions received from us.Resignation and Removal of DepositaryThe depositary may resign at any time by delivering to us notice of its election to do so  and we may at any time remove the depositary  any such resignation or removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment. Such successor depositary must be appointed within 60 days after delivery of the notice for resignation or removal and must be a bank or trust company having its principal office in the United States and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $150 000 000.20DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTSWe may issue warrants for the purchase of shares of our common stock or preferred stock or of debt securities. We may issue warrants independently or together with other securities  and the warrants may be attached to or separate from any offered securities. Each series of warrants will be issued under a separate warrant agreement to be entered into between us and the investors or a warrant agent. The following summary of material provisions of the warrants and warrant agreements are subject to  and qualified in their entirety by reference to  all the provisions of the warrant agreement and warrant certificate applicable to a particular series of warrants. The terms of any warrants offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the terms described below. We urge you to read the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus  as well as the complete warrant agreements and warrant certificates that contain the terms of the warrants.The particular terms of any issue of warrants will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to the issue. Those terms may include:● the number of shares of common stock or preferred stock purchasable upon the exercise of warrants to purchase such shares and the price at which such number of shares may be purchased upon such exercise;● the designation  stated value and terms (including  without limitation  liquidation  dividend  conversion and voting rights) of the series of preferred stock purchasable upon exercise of warrants to purchase preferred stock;● the principal amount of debt securities that may be purchased upon exercise of a debt warrant and the exercise price for the warrants  which may be payable in cash  securities or other property;● the date  if any  on and after which the warrants and the related debt securities  preferred stock or common stock will be separately transferable;● the terms of any rights to redeem or call the warrants;● the date on which the right to exercise the warrants will commence and the date on which the right will expire;● United States Federal income tax consequences applicable to the warrants; and● any additional terms of the warrants  including terms  procedures  and limitations relating to the exchange  exercise and settlement of the warrants.Holders of equity warrants will not be entitled:● to vote  consent or receive dividends;● receive notice as shareholders with respect to any meeting of shareholders for the election of our directors or any other matter; or● exercise any rights as shareholders of GCM Grosvenor.Each warrant will entitle its holder to purchase the principal amount of debt securities or the number of shares of preferred stock or common stock at the exercise price set forth in  or calculable as set forth in  the applicable prospectus supplement. Unless we otherwise specify in the applicable prospectus supplement  holders of the warrants may exercise the warrants at any time up to the specified time on the expiration date that we set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. After the close of business on the expiration date  unexercised warrants will become void.A holder of warrant certificates may exchange them for new warrant certificates of different denominations  present them for registration of transfer and exercise them at the corporate trust office of the warrant agent or any other office indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. Until any warrants to purchase debt securities are exercised  the holder of the warrants will not have any rights of holders of the debt securities that can be purchased upon exercise  including any rights to receive payments of principal  premium or interest on the underlying debt securities or to enforce covenants in the applicable indenture. Until any warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock are exercised  the holders of the warrants will not have any rights of holders of the underlying common stock or preferred stock  including any rights to receive dividends or payments upon any liquidation  dissolution or winding up on the common stock or preferred stock  if any.21DESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTSWe may issue purchase contracts for the purchase or sale of debt or equity securities issued by us. Each purchase contract will entitle the holder thereof to purchase or sell  and obligate us to sell or purchase  on specified dates  such securities at a specified purchase price  which may be based on a formula  all as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. Any purchase contracts we issue will be physically settled by delivery of such securities. The applicable prospectus supplement will also specify the methods by which the holders may purchase or sell such securities and any acceleration  cancellation or termination provisions or other provisions relating to the settlement of a purchase contract.DESCRIPTION OF UNITSWe may issue units consisting of any combination of the other types of securities offered under this prospectus in one or more series. We may evidence each series of units by unit certificates that we will issue under a separate agreement. We may enter into unit agreements with a unit agent. Each unit agent will be a bank or trust company that we select. We will indicate the name and address of the unit agent in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to a particular series of units.The following description  together with the additional information included in any applicable prospectus supplement  summarizes the general features of the units that we may offer under this prospectus. You should read any prospectus supplement and any free writing prospectus that we may authorize to be provided to you related to the series of units being offered  as well as the complete unit agreements that contain the terms of the units. Specific unit agreements will contain additional important terms and provisions and we will file as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part  or will incorporate by reference from another report that we file with the SEC  the form of each unit agreement relating to units offered under this prospectus.If we offer any units  certain terms of that series of units will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement  including  without limitation  the following  as applicable:● the title of the series of units;● identification and description of the separate constituent securities comprising the units;● the price or prices at which the units will be issued;● the date  if any  on and after which the constituent securities comprising the units will be separately transferable;● a discussion of certain United States federal income tax considerations applicable to the units; and● any other terms of the units and their constituent securities.22GLOBAL SECURITIESBook-Entry  Delivery and FormUnless we indicate differently in any applicable prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus  the securities initially will be issued in book-entry form and represented by one or more global notes or global securities (collectively  “global securities”). The global securities will be deposited with  or on behalf of  The Depository Trust Company  New York  New York  as depositary (“DTC”)  and registered in the name of Cede & Co.  the nominee of DTC. Unless and until it is exchanged for individual certificates evidencing securities under the limited circumstances described below  a global security may not be transferred except as a whole by the depositary to its nominee or by the nominee to the depositary  or by the depositary or its nominee to a successor depositary or to a nominee of the successor depositary.DTC has advised us that it is:● a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law;● a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law;● a member of the Federal Reserve System;● a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and● a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.DTC holds securities that its participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the settlement among its participants of securities transactions  such as transfers and pledges  in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in participants’ accounts  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. “Direct participants” in DTC include securities brokers and dealers  including underwriters  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC  National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation  all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others  which we sometimes refer to as indirect participants  that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant  either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC.Purchases of securities under the DTC system must be made by or through direct participants  which will receive a credit for the securities on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of the actual purchaser of a security  which we sometimes refer to as a beneficial owner  is in turn recorded on the direct and indirect participants’ records. Beneficial owners of securities will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchases. However  beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of their transactions  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the direct or indirect participants through which they purchased securities. Transfers of ownership interests in global securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the global securities  except under the limited circumstances described below.To facilitate subsequent transfers  all global securities deposited by direct participants with DTC will be registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee  Cede & Co.  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other nominee will not change the beneficial ownership of the securities. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the securities. DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts the securities are credited  which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The participants are responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.So long as the securities are in book-entry form  you will receive payments and may transfer securities only through the facilities of the depositary and its direct and indirect participants. We will maintain an office or agency in the location specified in the prospectus supplement for the applicable securities  where notices and demands in respect of the securities and the indenture may be delivered to us and where certificated securities may be surrendered for payment  registration of transfer or exchange.23Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants  by direct participants to indirect participants and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them  subject to any legal requirements in effect from time to time.Redemption notices will be sent to DTC. If less than all of the securities of a particular series are being redeemed  DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each direct participant in the securities of such series to be redeemed.Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (or such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the securities. Under its usual procedures  DTC will mail an omnibus proxy to us as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns the consenting or voting rights of Cede & Co. to those direct participants to whose accounts the securities of such series are credited on the record date  identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy.So long as securities are in book-entry form  we will make payments on those securities to the depositary or its nominee  as the registered owner of such securities  by wire transfer of immediately available funds. If securities are issued in definitive certificated form under the limited circumstances described below and unless if otherwise provided in the description of the applicable securities herein or in the applicable prospectus supplement  we will have the option of making payments by check mailed to the addresses of the persons entitled to payment or by wire transfer to bank accounts in the United States designated in writing to the applicable trustee or other designated party at least 15 days before the applicable payment date by the persons entitled to payment  unless a shorter period is satisfactory to the applicable trustee or other designated party.Redemption proceeds  distributions and dividend payments on the securities will be made to Cede & Co.  or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit direct participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us on the payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices  as is the case with securities held for the account of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name.” Those payments will be the responsibility of participants and not of DTC or us  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds  distributions and dividend payments to Cede & Co.  or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC  is our responsibility  disbursement of payments to direct participants is the responsibility of DTC  and disbursement of payments to the beneficial owners is the responsibility of direct and indirect participants.Except under the limited circumstances described below  purchasers of securities will not be entitled to have securities registered in their names and will not receive physical delivery of securities. Accordingly  each beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of DTC and its participants to exercise any rights under the securities and the indenture.The laws of some jurisdictions may require that some purchasers of securities take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Those laws may impair the ability to transfer or pledge beneficial interests in securities.DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depositary with respect to the securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to us. Under such circumstances  in the event that a successor depositary is not obtained  securities certificates are required to be printed and delivered.As noted above  beneficial owners of a particular series of securities generally will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in those securities. However  if:● DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the global security or securities representing such series of securities or if DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act at a time when it is required to be registered and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days of the notification to us or of our becoming aware of DTC’s ceasing to be so registered  as the case may be;● we determine  in our sole discretion  not to have such securities represented by one or more global securities; or● an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such series of securities we will prepare and deliver certificates for such securities in exchange for beneficial interests in the global securities. Any beneficial interest in a global security that is exchangeable under the circumstances described in the preceding sentence will be exchangeable for securities in definitive certificated form registered in the names that the depositary directs. It is expected that these directions will be based upon directions received by the depositary from its participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the global securities.24Euroclear and ClearstreamIf so provided in the applicable prospectus supplement  you may hold interests in a global security through Clearstream Banking S.A.  which we refer to as “Clearstream ” or Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V.  as operator of the Eurocle,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.02,0.32,0.66,True,English,"['GCM Grosvenor Inc', 'Form', 'Class A Common Stock Preferred Stock Debt Securities Depositary Shares Warrants Purchase Contracts Units', 'I.R.S.

The Company shall transfer warrants to members of the board of directors in accordance with item C below. Oversubscription cannot take place.

The board of directors has the right to extend the subscription period. New subscription of shares by virtue of the warrants can be made during the period July 1  2024 - July 1  2025 . Each warrant shall entail a right to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to an amount of SEK 1.38 .

Shares accrued due to subscription entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that is the closest after the new shares have been entered in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB . Approval of transfer of warrants 1. Eligible for acquisitionThe right to acquire warrants from the Company shall accrue to the Company's four board members - personally or through a wholly owned company. Each ordinary member of the board of directors has the right to acquire a maximum of 250 000 warrants of series 2022/2023 and 250 000 warrants of series 2022/2025 each and the chairman of the board has the right to acquire a maximum of 500 000 warrants of series 2022/2023 and 250 000 warrants of series 2022/2025. The transfer of warrants of series 2022/2023 shall take place on June 30  2023 and the transfer of warrants of series 2022/2025 shall take place on June 30  2024 . The transfer shall only be made to persons who  at the time of the transfer  are still fulfilling their directorship for the Company. Allocation requires that the acquisition of warrants can legally take place and that  in the opinion of the board of directors  it can be made to reasonable administrative and financial efforts. 2. Price and paymentThe warrants shall be transferred without consideration. The value per warrant has been calculated by the Company to SEK 0.54 per warrant of series 2022/2023 and SEK 0.80 per warrant of series 2022/2025 based on a share price at valuation of approx. SEK 1.6 and a volatility of 66 percent. More information about the warrant program 1. DilutionUpon full subscription with the support of all warrants  2 250 000 new shares may be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.45 percent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company  however  subject to the recalculation of the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription for  which may occur as a result of certain issues and more. 2. Costs for the Company  motives etc.The Company's costs for the program are  in addition to costs for preparation and administration of the incentive program  limited to social security charges in Sweden for the participant with tax domicile in Sweden . Assuming an increase of the Company's share price by 100 percent during the term of the program  these costs would not exceed approximately SEK 300 000 . The other participants in the program are  for tax purposes  residents outside of Sweden . According to foreign tax law  this means that the program does not give rise to any costs for the Company as the participants themselves are responsible for taxation. Against this background  there is no reason for the Company to hedge the warrant program in this regard. It is considered justified that the term of the warrants is less than three years since the incentive program is deemed necessary for the Company to be able to provide fair consideration without affecting the liquidity to an excessive extent  and thereby attract and retain competent board members. Therefore  it is considered that the subscription price and the maturity of the warrants  as well as the principles for allocation of warrants to the board members  may be considered reasonable in light of market practice and the Company's need to be able to stimulate the participants' work effort through an offer to participate in the warrant program. 3. Other share-based incentive programs The Company currently has no other share-based incentive programs. 4. Promotion of the Company's long-term value creationIn order for the program to have an economic value for the participants  it requires that the share price exceeds the subscription price during the period when the warrants can be exercised. The Company believes that the share price is a good indication that the participants have contributed to long-term value creation for the Company. 5. Preparation of the matter The warrant program has been developed by shareholders in the Company. 6. Authorization and decision-making rules The general meeting instructs the board of directors of the Company to execute the resolution in accordance with items A and B above and to carry out the transfer of warrants in accordance with item C above.

In the age of digital TV  the channel number used in a TV station’s name and its actual broadcast channel do not necessarily match up  so check our guide to find your local broadcast channel numbers.This review is part of TechHive’s coverage of the best TV antennas  where you’ll find reviews of the competition’s offerings  plus a buyer’s guide to the features you should consider when shopping for this type of product.Clearmstream Horizon TV antenna performanceAntennas Direct shared this photo of the Clearstream Horizon mounted to a wall  but don’t forget that you’ll need to deal with cables wherever you install it. Antennas DirectAntennas Direct says the antenna has a range of “60+ miles ” but that’s theoretical and the range you experience depends on your local terrain and the location of transmitters you’re looking to tune to. That said  Antennas Direct is not making the kind of outlandish claim we’ve seen from some less-scrupulous manufacturers.We tested the antenna against the Winegard FlatWave Amped  which is our current top pick for indoor amplified antennas  and found it compared favorably.The amplifier is a small  inline unit that can be switched on or off depending on the signal you’re trying to catch. This is handy  because in some cases adding an amplifier might make reception worse by overloading your TV’s tuner. That wasn’t a problem in our tests and it helped the signal every time it was switched on.Antenna Direct’s Jolt signal amplifier improved the Clearstream Horizon’s performance when we turned it on. You can turn it off if it overpowers your TV tuner. Martyn Williams/FoundryIn the first position we tested  at the bottom of a window facing the direction of the broadcast towers  it managed to pick up eight local TV stations and one out-of-market station. The Winegard in the same position received two additional local stations.Moving the antenna to a new position  higher up on the wall just above the window  resulted in stronger signals and successful reception of an additional out-of-market station  which was the same as the Winegard antenna. On the Clearstream Horizon  the signal quality was slightly weaker on some channels  although it didn’t make a big difference to the programs received.Martyn Williams/FoundryBoth antennas successfully received the local transmitter broadcasting ATSC 3.0 “NextGen TV” programming.Bottom line on the Antennas Direct Clearstream HorizonThe Antennas Direct Clearstream Horizon worked well with the amplifier turned on. Reception performance was marginally less than the Winegard FlatWave Amped  but it wasn’t a major difference. The Clearstream Horizon definitely wins for its looks over the Winegard and is an indoor antenna we can recommend  especially if you want something that looks good.,positive,0.99,0.0,0.0,mixed,0.6,0.13,0.28,True,English,"['Clearstream Horizon review', 'indoor TV antenna', 'Clearmstream Horizon TV antenna performance', 'ATSC 3.0 “NextGen TV” programming', 'local broadcast channel numbers', 'eight local TV stations', 'two additional local stations', 'looking indoor TV antenna', 'stylish indoor TV antenna', 'Good local channel reception', 'Antennas Direct Clearstream Horizon', 'local transmitter broadcasting', 'actual broadcast channel', 'current top pick', 'indoor amplified antennas', 'best TV antennas', 'Winegard FlatWave Amped', 'The Clearstream Horizon', 'small, inline unit', 'Jolt signal amplifier', 'companion signal amplifier', 'indoor antenna', 'local terrain', 'broadcast towers', 'Reception performance', 'digital TV', 'The Antennas', 'Antenna Direct', 'The Winegard', 'small stand', 'Winegard antenna', 'TV tuner', 'Inline amplifier', 'companion amplifier', 'successful reception', 'glance Expert', 'Rating Pros', 'signal strength', 'Attractive design', 'AC power', 'moderate signals', '23x5x.09 inches', 'VHF High', 'UHF bands', '60+ miles', 'outlandish claim', 'less-scrupulous manufacturers', 'first position', 'market station', 'same position', 'new position', 'stronger signals', 'signal quality', 'big difference', 'major difference', 'cabinet Cons', 'Bottom line', 'shelf', 'wall', 'window', 'cord', 'Verdict', 'tests', 'areas', 'WxHxD', '1.5 pounds', 'place', 'soundbar', 'channels', 'age', 'name', 'guide', 'review', 'part', 'TechHive', 'competition', 'offerings', 'buyer', 'features', 'type', 'product', 'photo', 'cables', 'range', 'location', 'transmitters', 'kind', 'cases', 'problem', 'Foundry', 'direction', 'programs', 'looks', 'something']",2022-05-28,2022-05-28,techhive.com

Digital TV typically provides between 20 and 60 channels depending on where you live  and can save you at least $1 000 a year  based on a typical pay TV subscription.Folks who do are often surprised by the higher image quality they get from broadcast TV. That’s because cable and satellite services compress the video signal in order to reduce the bandwidth required to stream it to your home  all so they can cram in more of the channels you probably never watch anyway.So  cut that cable  ditch that dish  and join the growing number of American households that are free from monthly bills for TV service.Updated May 27  2022 to add a link to our Antennas Direct Clearstream Horizon review. This rigid indoor antenna can be mounted to a wall or rested on a tabletop  and it features an powered signal amplifier. It delivered performance on par with our top pick in this category  the Winegard FlatWave Amped.Channel Master Flatenna 35 — Best budget-priced indoor TV antenna Pros Very low priceWell madeU.S.-based customer support Cons Won't do much for your living-room décor Best Prices Today: If you live close enough to the broadcast towers for the stations you want to watch  a less-expensive non-amplified antenna like the Channel Master Flatenna might be all you need to cut the cord. At the time of this review  we found that Channel Master itself was offering the best price on this antenna: Just $10 plus $7.50 for shipping.

This amplified antenna has a tiny tuner onboard that can virtually change its reception pattern to pull in the most stations possible. We like it a lot.

It has a built-in amplifier and performed well on both VHF-High and UHF broadcast bands. Because of its size you’ll want this one in the attic or outside of your house.

Its unique double figure-eight design is sure to look distinctive and it can receive signals from different directions  which is useful if you live in an area with stations in multiple places. Read our full Antennas Direct Clearstream 4 Max reviewHow we test TV antennasTechHive tests TV antennas in a location in the Washington  D.C. metro area. (Until 2020  we tested in the San Francisco Bay Area  so you might see references to that location in older reviews). The D.C. location receives strong signals from local TV stations  but presents several challenges: There are a large number of trees around to influence reception; some of the independent D.C. TV stations are weak and difficult to receive; and with a good antenna  distant reception of Baltimore market stations is possible.Indoor antennas are tested indoors and outdoor antennas outdoors. Each time we test a new antenna  we retest our current top pick to ensure a fair benchmark.We use a set-top box to scan for channels and record the number of RF channels received by each antenna and their strength. Each RF channel carries a number of digital stations  but the number is different per channel and can change  so digital stations received isn’t as useful a measurement. We scan several times and adjust the direction of the antenna on some rescans.Our picks are the antennas that receive the largest number of stations with the highest signal level in both the UHF (channels 14 through 51) and VHF-High (channels 7 through 13) bands  which are the primary TV broadcast bands.TV antenna shopping tipsPutting up an antenna is easy  but before you buy one you’ll need to figure out what channels are available where you live  how strong the signals are likely to be  and what direction they’re coming from. See TechHive’s guide to choosing an antenna to figure all that out.As a rule of thumb  indoor antennas are suitable for areas with strong or very strong signals  the attic/outdoor antennas work in areas of medium signal strength  and the larger outdoor antennas in areas of weak signals.Once you’ve determined your needs  this article will help with your antenna purchase.

Within each investment strategy  we make primary investments in funds managed by third-party managers  which we refer to as primary fund investments; we acquire secondary stakes in such funds  which we refer to as secondaries; we co-invest alongside such primary fund managers  which we refer to as co-investments; and we invest directly into operating businesses and operating assets  which we refer to as direct investing. A number of our clients utilize multiple strategies and approaches. From a structural standpoint  we offer investment portfolios to clients in two broad categories: ● Customized separate accounts.

As of December 31  2020  we had two classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act: Class A common stock  $0.0001 par value per share (“Class A common stock”) and warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock.Our authorized capital stock consists of:● 700 000 000 shares of Class A common stock;● 500 000 000 shares of Class B common stock  par value $0.0001 per share (“Class B common stock”);● 300 000 000 shares of Class C common stock  par value $0.0001 per share (“Class C common stock” and  together with the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock  “common stock”); and● 100 000 000 shares of preferred stock  par value $0.0001 per share.Common StockVotingPursuant to the Charter  holders of Class A common stock and Class C common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to the stockholders for their vote or approval  except as required by applicable law. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to the stockholders for their vote or approval. Prior to the date on which Grosvenor Holdings  L.L.C.  GCM Grosvenor Management  LLC and Grosvenor Holdings II  L.L.C. (the “GCMH Equityholders”) beneficially own voting shares representing less than 20% of the amount of Class A common stock held by the GCMH Equityholders immediately following the closing of our business combination on November 17  2020 (the “Sunset Date”)  the holders of Class C common stock are entitled to the lesser of (i) 10 votes per share and (ii) the Class C Share Voting Amount (as defined in the Charter) on all matters submitted to stockholders for their vote or approval. From and after the Sunset Date  holders of Class C Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per share. The Class B common stock is not entitled to vote (except as required by applicable law).As of May 27  2022  GCM V  LLC (“GCM V”) controlled approximately 75% of the combined voting power of our common stock as a result of its ownership of all of Class C common stock. Accordingly  Michael Sacks  through his control of GCM V  controls our business policies and affairs and can control any action requiring the general approval of our stockholders  including the election of our board  the adoption of amendments to the Charter and Bylaws and approval of any merger or sale of substantially all of its assets. Until the Sunset Date  Mr. Sacks will continue to control the outcome of matters submitted to the stockholders.The Class B common stock is non-voting and is not entitled to any votes on any matter that is submitted to a vote of our stockholders  except as required by Delaware law. Delaware law would permit holders of Class B common stock to vote  with one vote per share  on a matter if it were to (i) change the par value of the Class B common stock or (ii) amend the Charter to alter the powers  preferences  or special rights of the Class B common stock as a whole in a way that would adversely affect the holders of Class B common stock.As a result  in these limited instances  the holders of a majority of the Class B common stock could defeat such an amendment to the Charter. For example  if a proposed amendment of the Charter provided for the Class B common stock to rank junior to the Class A common stock or Class C common stock with respect to (i) any dividend or distribution  (ii) the distribution of proceeds were we to be acquired or (iii) any other right  Delaware law would require the separate vote of the holders of Class B common stock  with each share of Class B common stock entitled to one vote per share. In this instance  the holders of a majority of the Class B common stock could defeat that amendment to the Charter.6DividendsThe holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock (collectively  the “Economic Rights Stock”) are entitled to receive dividends as and if declared by our board of directors out of legally available funds. Under the Charter  dividends may not be declared or paid in respect of the Class A common stock or the Class B common stock unless they are declared or paid in the same amount in respect of the other class of Economic Rights Stock. With respect to stock dividends  holders of Class A common stock must receive Class A common stock and holders of Class B common stock must receive Class B common stock.The holders of Class C common stock do not have any right to receive dividends other than stock dividends consisting of shares of Class C common stock  paid proportionally with respect to each outstanding share of Class C common stock.Merger  Consolidation or Tender or Exchange OfferThe holders of Class A common stock are not entitled to receive economic consideration for their shares in excess of that payable to the holders of Class B common stock in connection with any merger  consolidation  or tender or exchange offer. However  in any such event involving consideration in the form of securities  the holders of Class B common stock will be deemed to have received the same consideration as the holders of Class A common stock.Liquidation or DissolutionUpon our liquidation or dissolution  the holders of all classes of common stock are entitled to their respective par value  and the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will then be entitled to share ratably in those of our assets that are legally available for distribution to stockholders after payment of liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any holders of preferred stock then outstanding. Other than their par value  the holders of Class C common stock will not have any right to receive a distribution upon our liquidation or dissolution.Conversion  Transferability and ExchangeSubject to the terms of the Fifth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Partnership Agreement of Grosvenor Capital Management Holdings  LLLP (“A&R LLLPA”)  the limited partners of Grosvenor Capital Management Holdings  LLLP (“GCMH”) (other than GCM Grosvenor Holdings  LLC (“IntermediateCo”)) may from time to time cause GCMH to redeem any or all of their units of partnership interest in GCMH (the “Grosvenor common units”) in exchange for  at our election (subject to certain exceptions)  either cash (based on the market price for a share of the Class A common stock) or shares of Class A common stock. At our election  such transaction may be effectuated via a direct exchange of Class A common stock or cash by IntermediateCo for the redeemed Grosvenor common units.The Charter provides that (i) a share of Class C common stock will automatically be cancelled for no consideration upon any sale or other transfer of a share of Class A common stock issued as a result of any redemption or direct exchange of Grosvenor common units transferred to any person that is not Michael Sacks  GCM V or the GCM Equityholders (or affiliate or owner thereof)  and (ii) a share of Class C common stock will automatically be cancelled for no consideration upon the redemption or exchange of a Grosvenor common unit for cash. Shares of Class A common stock  Class B common stock and Class C common stock are not subject to any conversion right.Other ProvisionsNone of the Class A common stock  Class B common stock or Class C common stock has any pre-emptive or other subscription rights  or sinking fund provisions.7Preferred StockWe are authorized to issue up to 100 000 000 shares of preferred stock. Our board of directors is authorized  subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and the Charter  to determine the terms and conditions of the preferred stock  including whether the shares of preferred stock will be issued in one or more series  the number of shares to be included in each series and the powers (including the voting power)  designations  preferences and rights of the shares. Our board of directors also will be authorized to designate any qualifications  limitations or restrictions on the shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of Class A common stock  Class B common stock and Class C common stock  which could have a negative impact on the market price of the Class A common stock.Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation or BylawsThe Bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority vote of our board of directors or by the holders of at least the majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon  subject to the Stockholders’ Agreement (for so long as it remains in effect). The affirmative vote of a majority of our board of directors and a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon is required to amend the Charter  subject to the terms contained therein.Exclusive ForumThe Charter provides that  to the fullest extent permitted by law  and unless we provide notice in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us  (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors  officers  employees  agents or stockholders to us or our stockholders  (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL  Charter or Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine  in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. The Charter further provides that  unless we otherwise consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  to the fullest extent permitted by law  the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933  as amended (the “Securities Act”). There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision relating to causes of action arising under the Securities Act  and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The clauses described above will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of the Charter and BylawsThe provisions of the Charter and Bylaws and of the DGCL summarized below may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay  defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that you might consider in your best interest  including an attempt that might result in your receipt of a premium over the market price for your shares of Class A common stock.The Charter and Bylaws contain certain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing our future takeover or change in control unless such takeover or change in control is approved by our board of directors.These provisions include:Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings of Stockholders. The Charter provides that  until we are no longer a “controlled company” under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(1)  stockholder action can be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. The Charter and Bylaws also provide that  subject to any special rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock and except as otherwise required by law  special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by our board of directors  the chairman or so long as we are a “controlled company ” by the Secretary at the request of any holder of at least 25% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors  voting together as a single class. Stockholders are not otherwise permitted to call a special meeting or to require our board of directors to call a special meeting.8Advance Notice Procedures. The Bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders  and for stockholder nominations of persons for election to our board of directors to be brought before an annual or special meeting of stockholders. Stockholders at an annual meeting will only be able to consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting  who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has given our Secretary timely written notice  in proper form  of the stockholder’s intention to bring that business or nomination before the meeting. Although the Bylaws do not give our board of directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting  as applicable  the Bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed or may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.Authorized but Unissued Shares. Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuance without stockholder approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes  including future public offerings to raise additional capital  corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of a majority of our common stock by means of a proxy contest  tender offer  merger or otherwise.Business Combinations with Interested Stockholders. The Charter provides that we are not subject to Section 203 of the DGCL  an anti-takeover law. In general  Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination  such as a merger  with an “interested stockholder” (which includes a person or group owning 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder  unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. However  the Charter contains provisions that have a similar effect to Section 203  except that they provide that Mr. Sacks and the GCMH Equityholders  their respective affiliates and successors and their direct and indirect transferees will not be deemed to be “interested stockholders ” regardless of the percentage of our voting stock owned by them  and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions.Corporate OpportunitiesThe Charter provides that  to the fullest extent permitted by law  we renounce any interest or expectancy in a transaction or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for us and Mr. Sacks (other than in his capacity as an officer and employee of our Company)  the GCMH Equityholders  or any of our non-employee directors have no duty to present such corporate opportunity to us and they may invest in competing businesses or do business with our clients or customers.Registration RightsOn November 17  2020  we entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the CF Sponsor  the GCMH Equityholders and certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors that agreed to purchase shares of Class A common stock in a private placement in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain transaction agreement dated as of August 2  2020. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement  we agreed to register for resale  pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act  certain shares of our Class A common stock and other equity securities that are held by the parties thereto from time to time.Transfer Agent and RegistrarThe transfer agent for our common stock is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Each person investing in our Class A common stock held through The Depository Trust Company must rely on the procedures thereof and on institutions that have accounts therewith to exercise any rights of a holder of our Class A common stock.For as long as any shares of our Class A common stock are listed on Nasdaq or on any other stock exchange operating in the United States  the laws of the State of New York shall apply to the property law aspects of our Class A common stock (including securities exercisable for or convertible into our Class A common stock) reflected in the register administered by our transfer agent.We have listed shares of our Class A common stock in registered form and such shares  through the transfer agent  will not be certificated.

(Section 5.1)Events of DefaultUnless otherwise set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement  “Event of Default” means with respect to any series of debt securities  any of the following:● default in the payment of any interest upon any debt security of that series when it becomes due and payable  and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days (unless the entire amount of the payment is deposited by us with the trustee or with a paying agent prior to the expiration of the 30-day period);● default in the payment of principal of any security of that series at its maturity;● default in the performance or breach of any other covenant or warranty by us in the indenture (other than a covenant or warranty that has been included in the indenture solely for the benefit of a series of debt securities other than that series)  which default continues uncured for a period of 60 days after we receive written notice from the trustee or GCM Grosvenor and the trustee receive written notice from the holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series as provided in the indenture; or● certain voluntary or involuntary events of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization of GCM Grosvenor (Section 6.1).No Event of Default with respect to a particular series of debt securities (except as to certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization) necessarily constitutes an Event of Default with respect to any other series of debt securities. (Section 6.1) The occurrence of certain Events of Default or an acceleration under the indenture may constitute an event of default under certain indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries outstanding from time to time.We will provide the trustee written notice of any Default or Event of Default within 30 days of becoming aware of the occurrence of such Default or Event of Default  which notice will describe in reasonable detail the status of such Default or Event of Default and what action we are taking or propose to take in respect thereof. (Section 6.1)If an Event of Default with respect to debt securities of any series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing  then the trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may  by a notice in writing to us (and to the trustee if given by the holders)  declare to be due and payable immediately the principal of (or  if the debt securities of that series are discount securities  that portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all debt securities of that series. In the case of an Event of Default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization  the principal (or such specified amount) of and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all outstanding debt securities will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of outstanding debt securities. At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to debt securities of any series has been made  but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may rescind and annul the acceleration if all Events of Default  other than the non-payment of accelerated principal and interest  if any  with respect to debt securities of that series  have been cured or waived as provided in the indenture. (Section 6.2) We refer you to the prospectus supplement relating to any series of debt securities that are discount securities for the particular provisions relating to acceleration of a portion of the principal amount of such discount securities upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.13The indenture provides that the trustee may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture unless the trustee receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any cost  liability or expense which might be incurred by it in performing such duty or exercising such right or power. (Section 7.1(e)) Subject to certain rights of the trustee  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series will have the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to the debt securities of that series. (Section 6.12)No holder of any debt security of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding  judicial or otherwise  with respect to the indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee  or for any remedy under the indenture  unless:● that holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to debt securities of that series; and● the holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have made written request  and offered indemnity or security satisfactory to the trustee  to the trustee to institute the proceeding as trustee  and the trustee has not received from the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series a direction inconsistent with that request and has failed to institute the proceeding within 60 days. (Section 6.7)Notwithstanding any other provision in the indenture  the holder of any debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of  premium and any interest on that debt security on or after the due dates expressed in that debt security and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment. (Section 6.8)The indenture requires us  within 120 days after the end of our fiscal year  to furnish to the trustee a statement as to compliance with the indenture. (Section 4.3) If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the securities of any series and if it is known to a responsible officer of the trustee  the trustee shall mail to each Securityholder of the securities of that series notice of a Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs or  if later  after a responsible officer of the trustee has knowledge of such Default or Event of Default. The indenture provides that the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any series of any Default or Event of Default (except in payment on any debt securities of that series) with respect to debt securities of that series if the trustee determines in good faith that withholding notice is in the interest of the holders of those debt securities. (Section 7.5)Modification and WaiverWe and the trustee may modify  amend or supplement the indenture or the debt securities of any series without the consent of any holder of any debt security:● to cure any ambiguity  defect or inconsistency;● to comply with covenants in the indenture described above under the heading “Consolidation  Merger and Sale of Assets”;● to provide for uncertificated securities in addition to or in place of certificated securities;● to add guarantees with respect to debt securities of any series or secure debt securities of any series;14● to surrender any of our rights or powers under the indenture;● to add covenants or events of default for the benefit of the holders of debt securities of any series;● to comply with the applicable procedures of the applicable depositary;● to make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any holder of debt securities;● to provide for the issuance of and establish the form and terms and conditions of debt securities of any series as permitted by the indenture;● to effect the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the debt securities of any series and to add to or change any of the provisions of the indenture to provide for or facilitate administration by more than one trustee; or● to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. (Section 9.1)We may also modify and amend the indenture with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected by the modifications or amendments. We may not make any modification or amendment without the consent of the holders of each affected debt security then outstanding if that amendment will:● reduce the amount of debt securities whose holders must consent to an amendment  supplement or waiver;● reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any debt security;● reduce the principal of or premium on or change the fixed maturity of any debt security or reduce the amount of  or postpone the date fixed for  the payment of any sinking fund or analogous obligation with respect to any series of debt securities;● reduce the principal amount of discount securities payable upon acceleration of maturity;● waive a default in the payment of the principal of  premium or interest on any debt security (except a rescission of acceleration of the debt securities of any series by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding debt securities of that series and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);● make the principal of or premium or interest on any debt security payable in currency other than that stated in the debt security;● make any change to certain provisions of the indenture relating to  among other things  the right of holders of debt securities to receive payment of the principal of  premium and interest on those debt securities and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and to waivers or amendments; or● waive a redemption payment with respect to any debt security. (Section 9.3)Except for certain specified provisions  the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may on behalf of the holders of all debt securities of that series waive our compliance with provisions of the indenture. (Section 9.2) The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may on behalf of the holders of all the debt securities of such series waive any past default under the indenture with respect to that series and its consequences  except a default in the payment of the principal of  premium or any interest on any debt security of that series; provided  however  that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may rescind an acceleration and its consequences  including any related payment default that resulted from the acceleration. (Section 6.13)15Defeasance of Debt Securities and Certain Covenants in Certain CircumstancesLegal Defeasance. The indenture provides that  unless otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable series of debt securities  we may be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the debt securities of any series (subject to certain exceptions). We will be so discharged upon the irrevocable deposit with the trustee  in trust  of money and/or U.S. government obligations or  in the case of debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars  government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency  that  through the payment of interest and principal in accordance with their terms  will provide money or U.S. government obligations in an amount sufficient in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank to pay and discharge each installment of principal  premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of the debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the indenture and those debt securities.This discharge may occur only if  among other things  we have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that we have received from  or there has been published by  the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling or  since the date of execution of the indenture  there has been a change in the applicable United States federal income tax law  in either case to the effect that  and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that  the holders of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income  gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit  defeasance and discharge and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit  defeasance and discharge had not occurred. (Section 8.3)Defeasance of Certain Covenants. The indenture provides that  unless otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable series of debt securities  upon compliance with certain conditions:● we may omit to comply with the covenant described under the heading “Consolidation  Merger and Sale of Assets” and certain other covenants set forth in the indenture  as well as any additional covenants which may be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement; and● any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of that series (“covenant defeasance”).The conditions include:● depositing with the trustee money and/or U.S. government obligations or  in the case of debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars  government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency  that  through the payment of interest and principal in accordance with their terms  will provide money in an amount sufficient in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank to pay and discharge each installment of principal of  premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of the debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the indenture and those debt securities; and● delivering to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income  gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and related covenant defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit and related covenant defeasance had not occurred. (Section 8.4)16No Personal Liability of Directors  Officers  Employees or SecurityholdersNone of our past  present or future directors  officers  employees or securityholders  as such  will have any liability for any of our obligations under the debt securities or the indenture or for any claim based on  or in respect or by reason of  such obligations or their creation. By accepting a debt security  each holder waives and releases all such liability. This waiver and release is part of the consideration for the issue of the debt securities. However  this waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws  and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.Governing LawThe indenture and the debt securities  including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the indenture or the securities  will be governed by the laws of the State of New York.The indenture will provide that we  the trustee and the holders of the debt securities (by their acceptance of the debt securities) irrevocably waive  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to the indenture  the debt securities or the transactions contemplated thereby.The indenture will provide that any legal suit  action or proceeding arising out of or based upon the indenture or the transactions contemplated thereby may be instituted in the federal courts of the United States of America located in the City of New York or the courts of the State of New York in each case located in the City of New York  and we  the trustee and the holder of the debt securities (by their acceptance of the debt securities) irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit  action or proceeding. The indenture will further provide that service of any process  summons  notice or document by mail (to the extent allowed under any applicable statute or rule of court) to such party’s address set forth in the indenture will be effective service of process for any suit  action or other proceeding brought in any such court. The indenture will further provide that we  the trustee and the holders of the debt securities (by their acceptance of the debt securities) irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any suit  action or other proceeding in the courts specified above and irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim any such suit  action or other proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. (Section 10.10)17DESCRIPTION OF DEPOSITARY SHARESWe may  at our option  elect to offer depositary shares rather than full shares of preferred stock. Each depositary share will represent ownership of and entitlement to all rights and preferences of a fraction of a share of preferred stock of a specified series (including dividend  voting  redemption and liquidation rights). The applicable fraction will be specified in a prospectus supplement. The shares of preferred stock represented by the depositary shares will be deposited with a depositary named in the applicable prospectus supplement  under a deposit agreement among us  the depositary and the holders of the certificates evidencing depositary shares (“depositary receipts”). Depositary receipts will be delivered to those persons purchasing depositary shares in the offering. The depositary will be the transfer agent  registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the depositary shares. Holders of depositary receipts agree to be bound by the deposit agreement  which requires holders to take certain actions such as filing proof of residence and paying certain charges.The summary of the terms of the depositary shares contained in this prospectus does not purport to be complete and is subject to  and qualified in its entirety by  the provisions of the deposit agreement and the Charter and the certificate of designation that are  or will be  filed with the SEC for the applicable series of preferred stock.DividendsThe depositary will distribute all cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary shares to the record holders of depositary receipts in proportion to the number of depositary shares owned by such holders on the relevant record date  which will be the same date as the record date fixed by us for the applicable series of preferred stock. The depositary  however  will distribute only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any depositary share a fraction of one cent  and any balance not so distributed will be added to and treated as part of the next sum received by the depositary for distribution to record holders of depositary receipts then outstanding.In the event of a distribution other than in cash  the depositary will distribute property received by it to the record holders of depositary receipts entitled thereto  in proportion  as nearly as may be practicable  to the number of depositary shares owned by such holders on the relevant record date  unless the depositary determines (after consultation with us) that it is not feasible to make such distribution  in which case the depositary may (with our approval) adopt any other method for such distribution as it deems equitable and appropriate  including the sale of such property (at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem equitable and appropriate) and distribution of the net proceeds from such sale to such holders.Liquidation PreferenceIn the event of the liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the affairs of GCM Grosvenor  whether voluntary or involuntary  the holders of each depositary share will be entitled to the fraction of the liquidation preference accorded each share of the applicable series of preferred stock as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.RedemptionIf the series of preferred stock represented by the applicable series of depositary shares is redeemable  such depositary shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption  in whole or in part  of the preferred stock held by the depositary. Whenever we redeem any preferred stock held by the depositary  the depositary will redeem as of the same redemption date the number of depositary shares representing the shares of preferred stock so redeemed. The depositary will mail the notice of redemption promptly upon receipt of such notice from us and not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of the preferred stock and the depositary shares to the record holders of the depositary receipts.18VotingPromptly upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of the series of preferred stock represented by the applicable series of depositary shares are entitled to vote  the depositary will mail the information contained in such notice of meeting to the record holders of the depositary receipts as of the record date for such meeting. Each such record holder of depositary receipts will be entitled to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the number of shares of preferred stock represented by such record holder’s depositary shares. The depositary will endeavor  insofar as practicable  to vote such preferred stock represented by such depositary shares in accordance with such instructions  and we will agree to take all action which may be deemed necessary by the depositary in order to enable the depositary to do so. The depositary will abstain from voting any of the preferred stock to the extent that it does not receive specific instructions from the holders of depositary receipts.Withdrawal of Preferred StockUpon surrender of depositary receipts at the principal office of the depositary and payment of any unpaid amount due the depositary  and subject to the terms of the deposit agreement  the owner of the depositary shares evidenced thereby is entitled to delivery of the number of whole shares of preferred stock and all money and other property  if any  represented by such depositary shares. Partial shares of preferred stock will not be issued. If the depositary receipts delivered by the holder evidence a number of depositary shares in excess of the number of depositary shares representing the number of whole shares of preferred stock to be withdrawn  the depositary will deliver to such holder at the same time a new depositary receipt evidencing such excess number of depositary shares. Holders of preferred stock thus withdrawn will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such shares under the deposit agreement or to receive depositary receipts evidencing depositary shares therefor.Amendment and Termination of Deposit AgreementThe form of depositary receipt evidencing the depositary shares and any provision of the deposit agreement may at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between us and the depositary. However  any amendment which materially and adversely alters the rights of the holders (other than any change in fees) of depositary shares will not be effective unless such amendment has been approved by at least a majority of the depositary shares then outstanding. No such amendment may impair the right  subject to the terms of the deposit agreement  of any owner of any depositary shares to surrender the depositary receipt evidencing such depositary shares with instructions to the depositary to deliver to the holder of the preferred stock and all money and other property  if any  represented thereby  except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law.The deposit agreement will be permitted to be terminated by us upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to the applicable depositary if a majority of each series of preferred stock affected by such termination consents to such termination  whereupon such depositary will be required to deliver or make available to each holder of depositary receipts  upon surrender of the depositary receipts held by such holder  such number of whole or fractional shares of preferred stock as are represented by the depositary shares evidenced by such depositary receipts together with any other property held by such depositary with respect to such depositary receipts. In addition  the deposit agreement will automatically terminate if (a) all outstanding depositary shares thereunder shall have been redeemed  (b) there shall have been a final distribution in respect of the related preferred stock in connection with any liquidation  dissolution or winding-up of GCM Grosvenor and such distribution shall have been distributed to the holders of depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares representing such preferred stock or (c) each share of the related preferred stock shall have been converted into stock of GCM Grosvenor not so represented by depositary shares.Charges of DepositaryWe will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary arrangements. We will pay charges of the depositary in connection with the initial deposit of the preferred stock and initial issuance of the depositary shares  and redemption of the preferred stock and all withdrawals of preferred stock by owners of depositary shares. Holders of depositary receipts will pay transfer  income and other taxes and governmental charges and certain other charges as are provided in the deposit agreement to be for their accounts. In certain circumstances  the depositary may refuse to transfer depositary shares  may withhold dividends and distributions and sell the depositary shares evidenced by such depositary receipt if such charges are not paid. The applicable prospectus supplement will include information with respect to fees and charges  if any  in connection with the deposit or substitution of the underlying securities  the receipt and distribution of dividends  the sale or exercise of rights  the withdrawal of the underlying security  and the transferring  splitting or grouping of receipts. The applicable prospectus supplement will also include information with respect to the right to collect the fees and charges  if any  against dividends received and deposited securities.19MiscellaneousThe depositary will forward to the holders of depositary receipts all notices  reports and proxy soliciting material from us which are delivered to the depositary and which we are required to furnish to the holders of the preferred stock. In addition  the depositary will make available for inspection by holders of depositary receipts at the principal office of the depositary  and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable  any notices  reports and proxy soliciting material received from us which are received by the depositary as the holder of preferred stock. The applicable prospectus supplement will include information about the rights  if any  of holders of receipts to inspect the transfer books of the depositary and the list of holders of receipts.Neither the depositary nor GCM Grosvenor assumes any obligation or will be subject to any liability under the deposit agreement to holders of depositary receipts other than for its negligence or willful misconduct. Neither the depositary nor GCM Grosvenor will be liable if it is prevented or delayed by law or any circumstance beyond its control in performing its obligations under the deposit agreement. The obligations of GCM Grosvenor and the depositary under the deposit agreement will be limited to performance in good faith of their duties thereunder  and they will not be obligated to prosecute or defend any legal proceeding in respect of any depositary shares or preferred stock unless satisfactory indemnity is furnished. GCM Grosvenor and the depositary may rely on written advice of counsel or accountants  on information provided by holders of the depositary receipts or other persons believed in good faith to be competent to give such information and on documents believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.In the event the depositary shall receive conflicting claims  requests or instructions from any holders of depositary receipts  on the one hand  and us  on the other hand  the depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims  requests or instructions received from us.Resignation and Removal of DepositaryThe depositary may resign at any time by delivering to us notice of its election to do so  and we may at any time remove the depositary  any such resignation or removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment. Such successor depositary must be appointed within 60 days after delivery of the notice for resignation or removal and must be a bank or trust company having its principal office in the United States and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $150 000 000.20DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTSWe may issue warrants for the purchase of shares of our common stock or preferred stock or of debt securities. We may issue warrants independently or together with other securities  and the warrants may be attached to or separate from any offered securities. Each series of warrants will be issued under a separate warrant agreement to be entered into between us and the investors or a warrant agent. The following summary of material provisions of the warrants and warrant agreements are subject to  and qualified in their entirety by reference to  all the provisions of the warrant agreement and warrant certificate applicable to a particular series of warrants. The terms of any warrants offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the terms described below. We urge you to read the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus  as well as the complete warrant agreements and warrant certificates that contain the terms of the warrants.The particular terms of any issue of warrants will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to the issue. Those terms may include:● the number of shares of common stock or preferred stock purchasable upon the exercise of warrants to purchase such shares and the price at which such number of shares may be purchased upon such exercise;● the designation  stated value and terms (including  without limitation  liquidation  dividend  conversion and voting rights) of the series of preferred stock purchasable upon exercise of warrants to purchase preferred stock;● the principal amount of debt securities that may be purchased upon exercise of a debt warrant and the exercise price for the warrants  which may be payable in cash  securities or other property;● the date  if any  on and after which the warrants and the related debt securities  preferred stock or common stock will be separately transferable;● the terms of any rights to redeem or call the warrants;● the date on which the right to exercise the warrants will commence and the date on which the right will expire;● United States Federal income tax consequences applicable to the warrants; and● any additional terms of the warrants  including terms  procedures  and limitations relating to the exchange  exercise and settlement of the warrants.Holders of equity warrants will not be entitled:● to vote  consent or receive dividends;● receive notice as shareholders with respect to any meeting of shareholders for the election of our directors or any other matter; or● exercise any rights as shareholders of GCM Grosvenor.Each warrant will entitle its holder to purchase the principal amount of debt securities or the number of shares of preferred stock or common stock at the exercise price set forth in  or calculable as set forth in  the applicable prospectus supplement. Unless we otherwise specify in the applicable prospectus supplement  holders of the warrants may exercise the warrants at any time up to the specified time on the expiration date that we set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. After the close of business on the expiration date  unexercised warrants will become void.A holder of warrant certificates may exchange them for new warrant certificates of different denominations  present them for registration of transfer and exercise them at the corporate trust office of the warrant agent or any other office indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. Until any warrants to purchase debt securities are exercised  the holder of the warrants will not have any rights of holders of the debt securities that can be purchased upon exercise  including any rights to receive payments of principal  premium or interest on the underlying debt securities or to enforce covenants in the applicable indenture. Until any warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock are exercised  the holders of the warrants will not have any rights of holders of the underlying common stock or preferred stock  including any rights to receive dividends or payments upon any liquidation  dissolution or winding up on the common stock or preferred stock  if any.21DESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTSWe may issue purchase contracts for the purchase or sale of debt or equity securities issued by us. Each purchase contract will entitle the holder thereof to purchase or sell  and obligate us to sell or purchase  on specified dates  such securities at a specified purchase price  which may be based on a formula  all as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. Any purchase contracts we issue will be physically settled by delivery of such securities. The applicable prospectus supplement will also specify the methods by which the holders may purchase or sell such securities and any acceleration  cancellation or termination provisions or other provisions relating to the settlement of a purchase contract.DESCRIPTION OF UNITSWe may issue units consisting of any combination of the other types of securities offered under this prospectus in one or more series. We may evidence each series of units by unit certificates that we will issue under a separate agreement. We may enter into unit agreements with a unit agent. Each unit agent will be a bank or trust company that we select. We will indicate the name and address of the unit agent in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to a particular series of units.The following description  together with the additional information included in any applicable prospectus supplement  summarizes the general features of the units that we may offer under this prospectus. You should read any prospectus supplement and any free writing prospectus that we may authorize to be provided to you related to the series of units being offered  as well as the complete unit agreements that contain the terms of the units. Specific unit agreements will contain additional important terms and provisions and we will file as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part  or will incorporate by reference from another report that we file with the SEC  the form of each unit agreement relating to units offered under this prospectus.If we offer any units  certain terms of that series of units will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement  including  without limitation  the following  as applicable:● the title of the series of units;● identification and description of the separate constituent securities comprising the units;● the price or prices at which the units will be issued;● the date  if any  on and after which the constituent securities comprising the units will be separately transferable;● a discussion of certain United States federal income tax considerations applicable to the units; and● any other terms of the units and their constituent securities.22GLOBAL SECURITIESBook-Entry  Delivery and FormUnless we indicate differently in any applicable prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus  the securities initially will be issued in book-entry form and represented by one or more global notes or global securities (collectively  “global securities”). The global securities will be deposited with  or on behalf of  The Depository Trust Company  New York  New York  as depositary (“DTC”)  and registered in the name of Cede & Co.  the nominee of DTC. Unless and until it is exchanged for individual certificates evidencing securities under the limited circumstances described below  a global security may not be transferred except as a whole by the depositary to its nominee or by the nominee to the depositary  or by the depositary or its nominee to a successor depositary or to a nominee of the successor depositary.DTC has advised us that it is:● a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law;● a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law;● a member of the Federal Reserve System;● a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and● a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.DTC holds securities that its participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the settlement among its participants of securities transactions  such as transfers and pledges  in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in participants’ accounts  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. “Direct participants” in DTC include securities brokers and dealers  including underwriters  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC  National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation  all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others  which we sometimes refer to as indirect participants  that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant  either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC.Purchases of securities under the DTC system must be made by or through direct participants  which will receive a credit for the securities on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of the actual purchaser of a security  which we sometimes refer to as a beneficial owner  is in turn recorded on the direct and indirect participants’ records. Beneficial owners of securities will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchases. However  beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of their transactions  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the direct or indirect participants through which they purchased securities. Transfers of ownership interests in global securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the global securities  except under the limited circumstances described below.To facilitate subsequent transfers  all global securities deposited by direct participants with DTC will be registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee  Cede & Co.  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other nominee will not change the beneficial ownership of the securities. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the securities. DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts the securities are credited  which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The participants are responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.So long as the securities are in book-entry form  you will receive payments and may transfer securities only through the facilities of the depositary and its direct and indirect participants. We will maintain an office or agency in the location specified in the prospectus supplement for the applicable securities  where notices and demands in respect of the securities and the indenture may be delivered to us and where certificated securities may be surrendered for payment  registration of transfer or exchange.23Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants  by direct participants to indirect participants and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them  subject to any legal requirements in effect from time to time.Redemption notices will be sent to DTC. If less than all of the securities of a particular series are being redeemed  DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each direct participant in the securities of such series to be redeemed.Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (or such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the securities. Under its usual procedures  DTC will mail an omnibus proxy to us as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns the consenting or voting rights of Cede & Co. to those direct participants to whose accounts the securities of such series are credited on the record date  identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy.So long as securities are in book-entry form  we will make payments on those securities to the depositary or its nominee  as the registered owner of such securities  by wire transfer of immediately available funds. If securities are issued in definitive certificated form under the limited circumstances described below and unless if otherwise provided in the description of the applicable securities herein or in the applicable prospectus supplement  we will have the option of making payments by check mailed to the addresses of the persons entitled to payment or by wire transfer to bank accounts in the United States designated in writing to the applicable trustee or other designated party at least 15 days before the applicable payment date by the persons entitled to payment  unless a shorter period is satisfactory to the applicable trustee or other designated party.Redemption proceeds  distributions and dividend payments on the securities will be made to Cede & Co.  or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit direct participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us on the payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices  as is the case with securities held for the account of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name.” Those payments will be the responsibility of participants and not of DTC or us  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds  distributions and dividend payments to Cede & Co.  or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC  is our responsibility  disbursement of payments to direct participants is the responsibility of DTC  and disbursement of payments to the beneficial owners is the responsibility of direct and indirect participants.Except under the limited circumstances described below  purchasers of securities will not be entitled to have securities registered in their names and will not receive physical delivery of securities. Accordingly  each beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of DTC and its participants to exercise any rights under the securities and the indenture.The laws of some jurisdictions may require that some purchasers of securities take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Those laws may impair the ability to transfer or pledge beneficial interests in securities.DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depositary with respect to the securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to us. Under such circumstances  in the event that a successor depositary is not obtained  securities certificates are required to be printed and delivered.As noted above  beneficial owners of a particular series of securities generally will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in those securities. However  if:● DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the global security or securities representing such series of securities or if DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act at a time when it is required to be registered and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days of the notification to us or of our becoming aware of DTC’s ceasing to be so registered  as the case may be;● we determine  in our sole discretion  not to have such securities represented by one or more global securities; or● an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such series of securities we will prepare and deliver certificates for such securities in exchange for beneficial interests in the global securities. Any beneficial interest in a global security that is exchangeable under the circumstances described in the preceding sentence will be exchangeable for securities in definitive certificated form registered in the names that the depositary directs. It is expected that these directions will be based upon directions received by the depositary from its participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the global securities.24Euroclear and ClearstreamIf so provided in the applicable prospectus supplement  you may hold interests in a global security through Clearstream Banking S.A.  which we refer to as “Clearstream ” or Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V.  as operator of the Eurocle,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.02,0.32,0.66,True,English,"['GCM Grosvenor Inc', 'Form', 'Class A Common Stock Preferred Stock Debt Securities Depositary Shares Warrants Purchase Contracts Units', 'I.R.S.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases – including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure – with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.Story continuesThe alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload (congestion) through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.In the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints  rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life as well as a mean survival probability of 70% at 12 months post-implantation (compared to 50% survival rate for refractory ascites patients in the published literature). All patients have been implanted with the alfapump and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. Top-line results of the RED DESERT study and interim results of the SAHARA DESERT study indicate that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  improve cardio-renal status and restore diuretic response for months post-treatment. Reporting of top-line data for SAHARA DESERT is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is not currently approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Study) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to cirrhosis.

(“Frontline” or the ""Company"") (NYSE: FRO – OSE: FRO) announces that it has agreed to acquire a total of 5 955 705 shares in Euronav N.V. (NYSE: EURN & Euronext: EURN) (“Euronav”) representing 2.95% of the outstanding shares in privately negotiated share exchange transactions with certain shareholders of Euronav N.V. where such shareholders of Euronav N.V. receive consideration shares in Frontline.Frontline will issue a total of 8 337 986 new shares as a result of these transactions  equivalent to an exchange ratio of 1.4. Frontline will be entitled to the declared USD 0 06 dividend to be paid by Euronav on the acquired shares on 8 June 2022. Settlement is expected to take place on or about 1 June 2022 by delivery of existing shares through a share lending arrangement with Frontline's main shareholder Hemen Holding Ltd.Following completion of the issue of the new Frontline shares  Frontline will have a total of 211 868 965 shares issued and outstanding.Frontline and Euronav announced on April 7th the plans for a potential combination between the two companies to create a global leader in the tanker industry. Since the announcement  positive volatility has returned to the tanker market in what Frontline believes is the early phase of a cyclical recovery for the industry coinciding with a historically low orderbook. Frontline’s belief in the strong merits of the combination  creating a global leader in the tanker industry  therefore remains unchanged.Frontline and Euronav are working extensively to conclude due diligence and finalize an appropriate transaction structure. This may include a voluntary exchange offer by Frontline for Euronav shares as a first step  and Frontline would then consider setting the minimum acceptance ratio as low as 50.1% including shares already owned by Frontline.The parties have identified significant operational and administrative synergies  and many of these can be addressed in parallel with the steps towards a full business combination. More details will be shared when the combination proposal has been finalized and can be announced to the market.Story continuesFor further information  please contact:Lars H.

This advanced IOT system was realized in collaboration with Verso Altimo  a Croatia-based internationally renowned integrator and operator Makedonski Telekom. The energy-efficient  sustainable and future-proof Smart City Solution is based on a modular design that offers the possibility of activating several relevant IOT verticals such as for Smart Lighting  Air Quality monitoring  Smart Water Solutions  Security and Crowd Monitoring.Municipal bodies have responsibility of providing appropriate lighting levels in the city while  keeping energy costs to a minimum. With lighting accounting for a large portion of a city's total energy consumption  the need for cost-effective and sustainable options is crucial. Simply switching to LED lighting can result in electricity savings of up to 50 to 60 percent  and by adding Remoticom's smart lighting control systems  the overall energy savings can go up to 80 percent.Remoticom's expansion into the Eastern European region will initially target key municipalities across Northern Macedonia  Serbia  Albania  Greece  Montenegro  Croatia  Bosnia Herzegovina  Slovenia  Bulgaria  Romania  Slovakia  Czech Republic and Poland. Crescent believes that similar deployments will soon follow suite in Western Europe.Crescent NV hereby reaffirms that despite severe ongoing supply chain shortages the company remains on track to deliver better than 20% growth during the first semester of 2022 at improving levels of profitability. Moreover  since incoming orders have continued to exceed Crescent's ability to fill the demand during the first semester of 2022  we remain optimistic about a year end outlook of better than 25% annualized growth.CONTACTEdwin BexGaston Geenslaan 14B-3001 Leuven  BelgiumTEL: +32 (0) 16 31 74 11E-mail: investor@option.comwww.remoticom.comwww.crescent-ventures.com,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,positive,0.57,0.35,0.07,True,English,"['OCCASIONAL PRESS RELEASE', 'Smart City solutions', 'Eastern Europe', 'Crescent', 'expansion', 'ongoing supply chain shortages', 'several relevant IOT verticals', 'smart lighting control systems', 'future-proof Smart City Solution', 'advanced IOT system', 'Smart Water Solutions', 'OCCASIONAL PRESS RELEASE', 'year end outlook', 'Smart Lighting Solutions', '10,000 ZSC150 Lighting controllers', 'total energy consumption', 'Air Quality monitoring', 'Eastern European region', 'Smart City solutions', 'overall energy savings', 'appropriate lighting levels', 'lighting accounting', 'LED lighting', 'energy costs', 'Crowd Monitoring', 'electricity savings', '18h00 CET', 'Euronext Brussels', 'successful deployment', 'emerging opportunity', 'Verso Altimo', 'Croatia-based internationally', 'Makedonski Telekom', 'energy-efficient, sustainable', 'modular design', 'Municipal bodies', 'large portion', 'sustainable options', 'key municipalities', 'Northern Macedonia', 'Bosnia Herzegovina', 'Czech Republic', 'similar deployments', 'Western Europe', 'first semester', 'incoming orders', 'Edwin Bex', 'Gaston Geenslaan', 'Crescent NV', '50 to 60 percent', '25% annualized growth', 'Remoticom BV', '80 percent', '20% growth', 'Crescent/Remoticom', 'expansion', 'Leuven', 'Belgium', 'May', 'Skopje', 'increased', 'presence', 'collaboration', 'integrator', 'operator', 'possibility', 'Security', 'responsibility', 'need', 'cost-effective', 'Serbia', 'Albania', 'Greece', 'Montenegro', 'Slovenia', 'Bulgaria', 'Romania', 'Slovakia', 'Poland', 'suite', 'severe', 'company', 'track', 'improving', 'profitability', 'demand', 'CONTACT', 'mail', 'investor', 'crescent-ventures']",2022-05-28,2022-05-28,marketscreener.com
