To the extent a board member conducts work for the Company  in addition to the board work  consulting fees and other compensation for such work may be paid. The policy is forward looking  i.e. applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the policy by the Annual General Meeting in 2022.A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel  consequently  it is necessary that the company offers market competitive remuneration.For information regarding Hansa Biopharma's strategic priorities  please visit https://hansabiopharma.com/this-is-hansa/our-commitment/For information regarding Hansa Biopharma's equity story  please visit https://investors.hansabiopharma.com/English/our-equity-story/default.aspxLong-term (share-based) incentive programs have been implemented in the company. Such programs have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. The program includes  among others  the CEO and other senior executives in the company. The performance criteria used to assess the outcome of the plans are distinctly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the company's long-term value creation  including its sustainability.For more information regarding these incentive programs  including the criteria which the outcome depends on  please see https://hansabiopharma.com/this-is-hansa/corporate-governance/.This policy enables the company to offer senior executives a competitive remuneration. The remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed base salary  variable cash remuneration (including STI)  pension benefits and other benefits. The components  their purpose and link to the company's business strategy are described below.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the policyThe Board of Directors has established a Committee within the Board (the Remuneration Committee)  with the tasks of preparing  within the Board of Directors  the policy for remuneration for senior executives. The Board of Directors shall propose a revised policy at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for senior executives  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of the company and its executive management.Unless otherwise stated herein  the Board of Directors shall resolve on matters regarding remuneration and employment provisions for all other senior executives. The CEO may decide upon Variable Cash Remuneration  including STI  for the other senior executives. The Remuneration Committee and the CEO  as applicable  shall continuously report to the Board of Directors. The CEO and the other senior executives shall not be present when their respective remuneration terms are decided.Additionally  the general meeting may – irrespective of this policy – resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration.Fixed Base SalaryPurpose and link to strategy Supports the attraction and retention of the best talent. Ensures competitiveness while controlling fixed costs to maximise efficiency. Operational Details Normally reviewed annually and increases will usually be effective from 1 April or following a change in responsibilities.The Remuneration Committee will consider  among other things  the following parameters when reviewing fixed base salary:Variable Cash RemunerationA portion of the total remuneration for the senior executives are linked to business performance so that total remuneration will increase or decrease in line with performance  thus promoting the company's business strategy and long-term interests (see ""Annual Short-Term Incentive (STI)"" below).For retention or recruitment purposes or extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks the Remuneration Committee  based on proposal of CEO  may  on an individual basis  decide on an additional variable cash remuneration. Such remuneration may not exceed an annual amount corresponding to 30 percent of the total fixed annual cash salary and may not be paid more than once each year per individual.Annual Short-Term Incentive (STI)Purpose and link to strategy To incentivise and create focus on the delivery of corporate objectives and strategic criteria. Operational Details The performance criteria  weighting and targets for the corporate objectives are to be proposed by the Remuneration Committee annually  evaluated and approved by the Board of Directors. Stretched targets shall be set by reference to the company's operating plan and historical and projected performance. The performance criteria  weighting and targets for the individual objectives are to be proposed  evaluated and approved annually by the CEO as manager for members of the executive committee or  if it is not the CEO  then the respective manager for such members of the executive committee  and for the CEO the Remuneration Committee. The outcome of criteria for awarding STI is to be measured over a period of one year and depend on the degree of fulfilment of predetermined targets. The Board of Directors shall have the possibility  under applicable law or contractual provisions  subject to the restrictions that may apply under law or contract  to reclaim in whole or in part STI paid on incorrect grounds (claw-back). Opportunity Levels The maximum opportunity for STI can amount up to max 75 percent of fixed base salary.The Remuneration Committee shall have the possibility to review the opportunity levels in order to ensure market competitiveness. Performance criteria The STI plan awards shall be based on corporate objectives and individual objectives and be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria.The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests.For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the company.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for this remuneration policy  salary and employment conditions for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time.Derogation from the policyThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the policy  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the policy.Description of material changes to the guidelines and how the views of shareholders' have been taken into considerationIn order to drive the business outcomes through a tailored employee incentive program that balances individual achievement and organisational contribution it is proposed that the performance criteria for the ""Annual Short-Term Incentive (""STI"") shall include both corporate and individual objectives. Furthermore  it is proposed that the performance criteria  weighting and targets for the individual objectives under the STI are to be proposed  evaluated and approved annually by the CEO as manager for members of the executive committee or  if it is not the CEO  then the respective manager for such members of the executive committee  and for the CEO the Remuneration Committee. The proposed adjustments have been reflected in these guidelines which will be subject to the shareholders' approval at the annual general meeting 2022.During 2021  neither the Remuneration Committee nor the Board of Directors received any comments or questions from the shareholders on the remuneration guidelines adopted at the annual general meeting 2021.Proposal regarding the amendment of the articles of association (item 16)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a new § 14  with the wording set out below  is included in the Articles of Association  subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declaring the registration statement on Form F-1 relating to a potential initial public offering of American Depositary Shares in the U.S. representing common shares in Hansa Biopharma effective. The proposal entails  subject to the mentioned condition being fulfilled  that the Articles of Association will set out the forum for resolving certain U.S. securities related complaints.§ 14Without any infringement on Swedish forum provisions and without applying Chapter 7  Section 54 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551)  the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933  as amended  and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder  unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum.Proposal for a long-term incentive program 2022 (item 17 - 18)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive program for employees at Hansa Biopharma (""LTIP 2022""). LTIP 2022 includes two elements; one performance-based share rights program (item 17)  and one employee stock option program (item 18). LTIP 2022 is generally structured in line with the previously adopted and outstanding incentive programs approved by the annual general meetings held 2018  2019  2020 and 2021 (the ""Outstanding Incentive Programs""). For a description of the Outstanding Incentive Programs  please refer to the company's Annual Report for 2021  pages 95-100 (Eng. version)  and the company's webpage  www.hansabiopharma.com. In addition to the described incentive programs  there are no other long-term incentive programs in Hansa Biopharma.Proposal to adopt a long-term incentive program based on performance-based share rights for employees at Hansa Biopharma (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive program based on performance-based share rights for employees of the Hansa Biopharma group  within the framework of LTIP 2022  (the ""Share Rights Program 2022"") in accordance with item 17(a). The decision to adopt the Share Rights Program 2022 in accordance with item 17(a) shall further be conditional upon that the general meeting resolves on hedging measures in accordance with item 17(b) or  if the majority required for resolution in accordance with item 17(b) is not met  in accordance with the proposal according to item 17(c) below.Proposal to adopt the Share Rights Program 2022 (item 17(a))The program in briefThe Share Rights Program 2022 is proposed to include the CEO  the broader leadership team and other key employees  meaning that a maximum of 45 individuals within the Hansa Biopharma group will be able to participate. Participants will be given the opportunity to receive ordinary shares free of charge within the framework of the Share Rights Program 2022  so-called ""Performance Shares""  in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below.Within the framework of the Share Rights Program 2022  the company may allot participants rights to Performance Shares which means that  subject to certain conditions being met  the right to receive a Performance Share free of charge (""Share Rights"").The background and rationale for the proposalThe purpose of the Share Rights Program 2022 is to create the conditions for motivating and retaining competent employees within the Hansa Biopharma group and to increase the coherence between the employees'  shareholders' and the company's objectives  as well as to increase the motivation to reach and exceed the company's financial and non-financial targets. The Share Rights Program 2022 has been designed so that the program includes both current and future senior executives and other key employees.By offering Share Rights that are based on a combination of both  share price development and strategic goals  the participants are premiered for increased shareholder value/value-creating measures. The Share Rights Program 2022 also rewards employees' continued loyalty and thus the long-term value growth of the company. Further  the Board of Directors considers that the Share Rights Program 2022 will have a positive effect on the future development of the Hansa Biopharma group and will consequently be beneficial for both the company and its shareholders.Terms and conditionsA Share Right may be exercised provided that the participant  with certain exceptions  from the start date of the Share Rights Program 2022 for each participant  up until and including the date three (3) years thereafter (the ""Vesting Period"")  is still employed by the Hansa Biopharma group. The last date for the start of the Share Rights Program 2022 shall be the day before the Annual General Meeting of Hansa Biopharma in 2023.In addition to the requirement for the participant's continued employment according to the above  the final number of Performance Shares that each participant is entitled to receive shall also be conditional upon the following performance conditions being met during the Vesting Period (together  the ""Performance Conditions""):22 per cent of the Performance Shares in the event the U.S. FDA has approved imlifidase in the U.S. in any indication (""Performance Condition 1"")  11 per cent of the Performance Shares in the event that imlifidase has been approved  or a Marketing Authorization Application/Biologics License Application has been submitted  in any jurisdiction in an indication outside kidney transplant (""Performance Condition 2"")  11 per cent of the Performance Shares in the event that more than 80 per cent of the targeted transplantation centers in Europe had repeat business  i.e. used Idefirix more than once (""Performance Condition 3"")  and 56 per cent of the Performance Shares related to the total shareholder return (the return to shareholders through an increased share price and reinvestments of any dividends during the Vesting Period) on the company's ordinary shares (""Performance Condition 4"").The above distribution of the number of Performance Shares is based on a valuation of each instrument and corresponds to a value-based distribution of approximately 24 per cent to Performance Condition 1  12 per cent to Performance Condition 2  12 per cent to Performance Condition 3 and 52 per cent to Performance Condition 4  respectively. This entails that participants will be entitled to 22 per cent of the Performance Shares if Performance Condition 1 is achieved  11 per cent of the Performance Shares if Performance Condition 2 is achieved and 11 per cent of the Performance Shares if Performance Condition 3 is achieved. In addition  participants will under Performance Condition 4 be entitled to 56 per cent of the Performance Shares if the total shareholder return for the company's ordinary share during the Vesting Period reaches or exceeds 75 per cent. If the total shareholder return during the Vesting Period is less than 25 per cent  no allotment of Performance Shares will be made under Performance Condition 4. In between the percentages  allotment will be made linearly. The baseline for assessing the total shareholder return under Performance Condition 4 should be the volume weighted average share price during the 30 trading days immediately preceding the respective allotment of the Share Rights  (the ""TSR Baseline""). In the event that the Performance Conditions  after the initial allotment  are not considered to be relevant incentives for Share Rights allotted in subsequent allocations under the program  these Performance Conditions may be replaced by other strategic goals for the company and further that the TSR Baseline may be the same as for the initial allocation.The Share Rights shall  in addition to what is set out above  be governed by the following terms and conditions:Share Rights are allotted free of charge no later than the day before the Annual General Meeting 2023.Share Rights vest during the Vesting Period.Share Rights may not be transferred or pledged.Each Share Right entitles the participant to receive one Performance Share free of charge after the end of the Vesting Period (with certain exceptions where the Vesting Period may be accelerated) if the participant  with certain exceptions  is still employed by the Hansa Biopharma group by the end of the Vesting Period.In order to align the interests of the participant and the shareholders'  the company will also compensate the participants for dividends paid by increasing the number of Performance Shares that each Share Right entitle to after the Vesting Period.Preparation of the program  design and administrationThe Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the board  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the Share Rights Program 2022  in accordance with the presented terms and guidelines including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the Hansa Biopharma group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the Share Rights Program 2022 no longer fulfils their objectives or the rationale for the proposal including  inter alia  that adjustments may be decided with respect to the terms and conditions for measuring performance  and the basis for such calculation.Allotment of Share RightsThe participants are divided into different categories and  in accordance with the above  the Share Rights under the Share Rights Program 2022 may be allotted to the following participants in the different categories:Category Maximum number of persons Maximum number of Share Rights Maximum number of Share Rights per person in the category CEO 1 80 000 80 000 Others 44 544 615 50 000In total  no more than 624 615 Share Rights may be allotted.Delivery of Performance Shares and hedging arrangementsThe Board of Directors has considered different methods for transfer of ordinary shares under the Share Rights Program 2022 in order to implement the program in a cost-effective and flexible manner and to limit dilution. The Board of Directors has found and therefore propose the structure including class C shares that have been implemented for the Outstanding Incentive Programs is the best option. The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves in accordance with item 17(b) below  to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve to issue and repurchase class C shares which  after reclassification to ordinary shares  may be transferred to participants and be sold to cover social costs. If the majority required for resolution in accordance with item 17(b) is not met  the Share Rights Program 2022 shall instead be hedged through a resolution to conclude an equity swap-agreement  in accordance with the Board of Director's proposal under item 17(c) below.Scope and costs for the Share Rights Program 2022The Share Rights Program 2022 will be reported in accordance with IFRS 2  which means that the Share Rights will be expensed as non-cash personnel costs over the Vesting Period. The costs for the Share Rights Program 2022 is estimated to amount to SEK 21.8 million  excluding social contributions  accounted in accordance with IFRS 2 based on the following assumptions: (i) that 624 615 Share Rights are allotted  (ii) that the volume-weighted average share price at the beginning of the Share Rights Program 2022 is SEK 56 per ordinary share  (iii) that the performance conditions are fully met  and (iv) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 5 per cent. Based on the same assumptions as above  and subject to social contributions of approximately 30 per cent and a share price increase of 75 per cent from the start of the Share Rights Program 2022 until the participants are allotted shares  the costs for social contributions are estimated to amount to SEK 15.7 million. The total cost in accordance with IFRS 2 for the Share Rights Program 2022  including social security costs  is therefore estimated at SEK 12.5 million per year over the Vesting Period  based on the same assumptions as above.Dilution and effects on key ratiosUpon maximum allotment of Share Rights and provided that (i) the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 17(b) below are adopted  it is estimated that not more than 624 615 ordinary shares will be allotted to participants under the Share Rights Program 2022  and that 187 385 ordinary shares will be used to secure social contributions arising as a result of the Share Rights Program 2022 from already existing C-shares  the incremental dilution effect would amount to approximately 1.3 per cent of the total number of ordinary shares in the company.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and under the assumption that the Share Rights Program 2022 was introduced in 2020  it is estimated that the key figure earnings per share for full year 2021 would have decreased from SEK -12.33 to approximately SEK -12.61.The preparation of the proposalThe Share Rights Program 2022 has been prepared by the company's Board of Directors and its Remuneration Committee in consultation with external advisors. The Share Rights Program 2022 has been discussed by the Board of Directors at meetings held in May 2022.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to issue new class C shares  authorization to repurchase issued class C shares  transfer own ordinary shares to participants in the programs and the market (item 17(b))The resolutions under this item 17(b) regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to issue new class C shares  authorization to repurchase issued class C shares  transfer own ordinary shares to participants in the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 (as proposed and defined under item 18) and the Outstanding Incentive Programs as well as in the market are proposed to be passed as one resolution.Authorization for the Board of Directors to issue class C sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 624 615 by the issue of not more than 624 615 class C shares  each with a quota value of SEK one (1). With deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  the participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares to employees under the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs  as well as to secure potential social contributions arising as a result of the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs.Authorization for the Board of Directors to repurchase class C sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to repurchase class C shares. The repurchase may only be effected through an offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. Repurchases shall be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the acquired class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to ensure delivery of shares to participants in the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs in accordance with the adopted terms and conditions and in order to secure possible social contributions arising as a result of the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs.Resolution to transfer own ordinary sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the class C shares that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase its own class C shares in accordance with the proposal under this item 17(b) and class C shares issued pursuant to the proposal in item 18(b) as well as the class C shares currently held by the Company  following reclassification into ordinary shares  amounting to a total maximum of 2 712 678 ordinary shares (for avoidance of doubt  in total under the resolution to transfer own ordinary shares pursuant to this proposal and the proposal under item 18(b))  may be transferred free of charge to participants in the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022  if approved  and/or to participants in the Outstanding Incentive Programs  in accordance with the approved terms and conditions  as well as be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the registered price range at the relevant time  to cover any social contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022  if approved  and/or to participants in the Outstanding Incentive Programs. The number of shares to be transferred is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue and/or other similar events.Proposal on equity swap arrangements with third parties (item 17(c))In the event that the required majority for item 17(b) above cannot be achieved  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to hedge the Share Rights Program 2022 by allowing Hansa Biopharma to enter into equity swap arrangements with third parties on market terms  where the third party in its own name will be able to acquire and transfer ordinary shares in Hansa Biopharma to the participants.Proposal to adopt a long-term incentive program based on employee stock options for employees at Hansa Biopharma (item 18)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive program for employees of the Hansa Biopharma group  within the framework of LTIP 2022  (""Option Program 2022"") in accordance with items 18(a) below. The decision to adopt the Option Program 2022 in accordance with item 18(a) shall further be conditional upon that the general meeting resolves on hedging measures in accordance with item 18(b) or  if the majority required for resolution in accordance with item 18(b) is not met  in accordance with the proposal according to item 18(c) below.Proposal regarding the adoption of Option Program 2022 (item 18(a))The program in briefThe Option Program 2022 consist of employee stock options that can be allotted to the CEO  other senior executives and key employees  limited to a total maximum of 15 employees within the Hansa Biopharma group. The employee stock options have a vesting period of three (3) years (the ""Vesting Period"")  after which the holder is entitled to exercise the options for ordinary shares during a period of three (3) years in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below. The last day for allotment under the Option Program 2022 shall be the day before the Annual General Meeting for Hansa Biopharma 2023.The background and rationale for the proposalThe purpose of the Option Program 2022 is to create the conditions for motivating and retaining competent employees within the Hansa Biopharma group and to increase the coherence between the employees'  shareholders' and the company's objectives  as well as to increase the motivation to reach and exceed the company's financial and non-financial targets. The Option Program 2022 has been designed so that the program includes both current and future senior executives.By offering options that are based on the share price development  the participants are premiered for increased shareholder value.

Further  the Board of Directors considers that the Option Program 2022 will have a positive effect on the future development of the Hansa Biopharma group and will consequently be beneficial for both the company and its shareholders.Terms and conditionsThe company may allot employee stock options to the CEO  other senior executives and key employees. Each option entitles the participant to acquire one share in Hansa Biopharma in accordance with the following terms and conditions:The employee stock options will be allotted free of charge.Allotment requires that an acquisition of employee stock options can take place legally and that  according to the Board of Director's assessment  it can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial efforts. The last day for allotment of employee stock options shall be the day before the Annual General Meeting 2023.The employee stock options carry a Vesting Period of three (3) years from the time when allotment to the participants has taken place. The employee stock options entitle  after vesting in accordance with the terms and conditions including  with certain exceptions  that the participant is still employed throughout the Vesting Period  the participant to subscribe for shares during a three (3) year period following vesting.The participant must  with certain exceptions  be employed within the group when the participant acquires shares on the basis of the Option Program 2022. For terminated employees acquisition of shares must occur within three (3) months of notice of termination.Each employee stock option that is transferred entitles the participant to acquire one share in the company at an exercise price corresponding to 125 per cent of the volume-weighted average share price during the 30 trading days immediately preceding the respective allotment of the employee stock options (the "" Exercise Price ""). In the event that the Exercise Price  after the initial allotment  is not considered to be appropriate for stock options allotted in subsequent allocations under the program  the Exercise Price may be decided to be the same as for the initial allocation.The Option Program 2022 shall be settled by using a net share-settlement method  as further described below.The employee stock options shall not constitute securities and may not be transferred or pledged.The exercise price for employee stock options  determined as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10  whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded downwards. The exercise price and the number of shares that each employee stock option entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue and/or similar measures in accordance with market practice.Preparation of the program  design and administrationThe Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the Option Program 2022  in accordance with the presented terms and guidelines including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the Hansa Biopharma group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the Option Program 2022 no longer fulfils their objectives or the rationale for the proposal.Allocation of employee stock optionsThe right to receive employee stock options shall accrue to the CEO  senior executives and key employees  current and future  within the limits outlined in below table:Category Maximum number of persons Maximum number of employee stock options Maximum number of employee stock options per person within the category CEO 1 120 000 120 000 Other senior executives and key employees 14 332 307 70 000In total  not more than 452 307 employee stock options may be allotted.Board members shall not be eligible to participate in the Option Program 2022.Net share-settlement method for Option Program 2022The Option Program 2022 shall be settled by using a net share-settlement method (""Net share-settlement""). The Net share-settlement entails that stock options are settled by delivering a number of shares corresponding to the Stock Option Value (as defined below) to the participants free of charge without any payment of the exercise price. The number of shares to be delivered is calculated by deducting the exercise price of the exercised options from the prevailing share price of the Hansa Biopharma common shares on the stock market at the time of exercise (""Market Price"") (the ""Stock Option Value"") and dividing the Stock Option Value with the Market Price.Illustrative example of Net share-settlementA participant in Option Program 2022 holds 100 stock options with Market Price of the common shares of SEK 75 and Exercise Price of SEK 50. The difference between the Market Price and the Exercise Price is SEK 25 per option (""Stock Option Value""). Instead of the participant paying the Exercise Price (number of stock options (100) multiplied by the Exercise Price (SEK 50)) and the company delivering 100 shares worth 75 SEK each (Market Price)  the company would use Net-settlement by delivering shares in an amount corresponding to the Stock Option Value divided with the Market Price ((25*100)/75) – i.e. the company would deliver 33.33 shares meaning 33 shares and SEK 25 in cash.Scope and costs for the Option Program 2022The Option Program 2022 will be reported in accordance with IFRS 2  which means that the option rights will be expensed as non-cash personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Costs related to the employee stock options are estimated to amount to SEK 7.2 million  excluding social contributions  accounted in accordance with IFRS 2 based on the following assumptions: (i) that 452 307 employee stock options are allotted  (ii) that the volume-weighted average share price  at the beginning of the Option Program 2022  is SEK 56 per ordinary share  and (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 5 per cent. Based on the same assumptions as above  and subject to social contributions of 30 per cent  and a share price increase of 75 per cent from the start of the Option Program 2022 until the employee stock options are exercised  the costs for social contributions are estimated to amount to SEK 3.3 million. The total cost in accordance with IFRS 2  including social security costs  is therefore estimated at SEK 3.5 million per year over the Vesting Period  based on the same assumptions as above.Dilution and effects on key ratiosUpon maximum allotment of employee stock options and provided that (i) the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 18(b) below are adopted  it is estimated that not more than 226 154 ordinary shares will be allotted to participants under the Option Program 2022 using the Net-share-settlement  and that 67 846 ordinary shares will be used to secure social contributions arising as a result of the Option Program 2022 from already existing C-shares  which would entail an incremental dilution effect of approximately 0.5 per cent of the total number of ordinary shares in the company.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and that Option Program 2022 was introduced in 2020 instead  it is estimated that the key figure earnings per share for full year 2021 would have decreased from SEK -12.33 to approximately SEK -12.41.The preparation of the proposalOption Program 2022 has been prepared by the company's Board of Directors and its Remuneration Committee in consultation with external advisors. Option Program 2022 has been discussed by the Board of Directors at meetings held in May 2022.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to issue new class C shares  authorization to repurchase issued class C shares  transfer own ordinary shares to participants in the programs and the market (item 18(b))The resolutions under this item 18(b) regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to issue new class C shares  authorization to repurchase issued class C shares  transfer own ordinary shares to participants in the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022 and the Outstanding Incentive Programs as well as in the market are proposed to be passed as one resolution.Authorization for the Board of Directors to issue class C sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 226 154 by the issue of not more than 226 154 class C shares  each with a quota value of SEK one (1). With deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  the participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares to employees under the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs  as well as to secure potential social contributions arising as a result of the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs.Authorization for the Board of Directors to repurchase class C sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to repurchase class C shares. The repurchase may only be effected through an offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. Repurchases shall be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the acquired class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to ensure delivery of shares to participants in the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs in accordance with the adopted terms and conditions and in order to secure possible social contributions arising as a result of the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs.Resolution to transfer own ordinary sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the class C shares that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase its own class C shares in accordance with the proposal under this item 18(b) and class C shares issued pursuant to the proposal in item 17(b) as well as the class C shares currently held by the Company  following reclassification into ordinary shares  amounting to a total maximum of 2 712 678 ordinary shares (for avoidance of doubt  in total under the resolution to transfer own ordinary shares pursuant to this proposal and the proposal under item 17(b))  may be transferred free of charge to participants in the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022  if approved  and/or to participants in the Outstanding Incentive Programs  in accordance with the approved terms and conditions  as well as be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the registered price range at the relevant time  to cover any social contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022  if approved  and/or to participants in the Outstanding Incentive Programs. The number of shares to be transferred is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue and/or other similar events.Proposal on equity swap arrangements with third parties (item 18(c))In the event that the required majority for item 18(b) above cannot be achieved  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to hedge the Option Program 2022 by allowing Hansa Biopharma to enter into equity swap arrangements with third parties on market terms  where the third party in its own name will be able to acquire and transfer ordinary shares in Hansa Biopharma to the participants.Proposal regarding resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on new issue of ordinary shares and warrants and/or convertibles (item 19)Main proposal (item 19(a))Hansa Biopharma is currently launching its lead asset  imlifidase for enabling kidney transplants in highly sensitized patients  in Europe and continues implementing efforts to potentially enable future regulatory approval and market access for this indication in other important markets while pursuing multiple pipeline building projects within transplantation  autoimmune diseases and gene therapy based on its validated technology platform. In this situation  it is important for the Company's ability to build and maximize shareholder value to have  and it is the purpose of the proposed authorization to provide  sufficient financial flexibility and a broad acting scope to the board of directors  in particular to match significant commercial and pipeline growth acceleration opportunities with the available financing mandate  provide flexibility to quickly respond to strategic opportunities such as partnerships or collaborations or to expand the shareholder constituency in certain investor markets or in connection with the listing of the shares on a U.S. stock exchange.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting renews its previous authorization  which has not been used due to overall stock market conditions and to protect existing shareholders' interests  and resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to  until the next Annual General Meeting  on one or more occasions  decide upon issuances of new ordinary shares  issuance of warrants and/or convertibles. New issues of ordinary shares and issues of warrants and/or convertibles may occur with or without preferential rights for shareholders of the Company and may be made either in cash and/or by way of set-off or contribution in kind or otherwise on specific terms. The number of shares issued  or number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  may not correspond to a dilution of more than 20 per cent of the total number of shares outstanding at the Annual General Meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  after full exercise of the hereby proposed authorization.Alternative proposal (item 19(b))If the proposal in item 19(a) above does not get the required supportive votes from the Annual General Meeting to be passed  the Board of Directors proposes that it is given an authorization to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertibles corresponding to a dilution of not more than 10 per cent  on the same terms and conditions as stated above in item 19(a).Majority requirementsResolutions in accordance with items 16 and 19 above requires approval of at least two thirds (2/3) of the shares represented and votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.

Furthermore  it is proposed that the performance criteria  weighting and targets for the individual objectives under the STI are to be proposed  evaluated and approved annually by the CEO as manager for members of the executive committee or  if it is not the CEO  then the respective manager for such members of the executive committee  and for the CEO the Remuneration Committee. The proposed adjustments have been reflected in these guidelines which will be subject to the shareholders' approval at the annual general meeting 2022.During 2021  neither the Remuneration Committee nor the Board of Directors received any comments or questions from the shareholders on the remuneration guidelines adopted at the annual general meeting 2021.Proposal regarding the amendment of the articles of association (item 16)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a new § 14  with the wording set out below  is included in the Articles of Association  subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declaring the registration statement on Form F-1 relating to a potential initial public offering of American Depositary Shares in the U.S. representing common shares in Hansa Biopharma effective. The proposal entails  subject to the mentioned condition being fulfilled  that the Articles of Association will set out the forum for resolving certain U.S. securities related complaints.§ 14Without any infringement on Swedish forum provisions and without applying Chapter 7  Section 54 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551)  the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933  as amended  and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder  unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum.Proposal for a long-term incentive program 2022 (item 17 - 18)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive program for employees at Hansa Biopharma (""LTIP 2022""). LTIP 2022 includes two elements; one performance-based share rights program (item 17)  and one employee stock option program (item 18). LTIP 2022 is generally structured in line with the previously adopted and outstanding incentive programs approved by the annual general meetings held 2018  2019  2020 and 2021 (the ""Outstanding Incentive Programs""). For a description of the Outstanding Incentive Programs  please refer to the company's Annual Report for 2021  pages 95-100 (Eng. version)  and the company's webpage  www.hansabiopharma.com. In addition to the described incentive programs  there are no other long-term incentive programs in Hansa Biopharma.Proposal to adopt a long-term incentive program based on performance-based share rights for employees at Hansa Biopharma (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive program based on performance-based share rights for employees of the Hansa Biopharma group  within the framework of LTIP 2022  (the ""Share Rights Program 2022"") in accordance with item 17(a). The decision to adopt the Share Rights Program 2022 in accordance with item 17(a) shall further be conditional upon that the general meeting resolves on hedging measures in accordance with item 17(b) or  if the majority required for resolution in accordance with item 17(b) is not met  in accordance with the proposal according to item 17(c) below.Proposal to adopt the Share Rights Program 2022 (item 17(a))The program in briefThe Share Rights Program 2022 is proposed to include the CEO  the broader leadership team and other key employees  meaning that a maximum of 45 individuals within the Hansa Biopharma group will be able to participate. Participants will be given the opportunity to receive ordinary shares free of charge within the framework of the Share Rights Program 2022  so-called ""Performance Shares""  in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below.Within the framework of the Share Rights Program 2022  the company may allot participants rights to Performance Shares which means that  subject to certain conditions being met  the right to receive a Performance Share free of charge (""Share Rights"").The background and rationale for the proposalThe purpose of the Share Rights Program 2022 is to create the conditions for motivating and retaining competent employees within the Hansa Biopharma group and to increase the coherence between the employees'  shareholders' and the company's objectives  as well as to increase the motivation to reach and exceed the company's financial and non-financial targets. The Share Rights Program 2022 has been designed so that the program includes both current and future senior executives and other key employees.By offering Share Rights that are based on a combination of both  share price development and strategic goals  the participants are premiered for increased shareholder value/value-creating measures. The Share Rights Program 2022 also rewards employees' continued loyalty and thus the long-term value growth of the company. Further  the Board of Directors considers that the Share Rights Program 2022 will have a positive effect on the future development of the Hansa Biopharma group and will consequently be beneficial for both the company and its shareholders.Terms and conditionsA Share Right may be exercised provided that the participant  with certain exceptions  from the start date of the Share Rights Program 2022 for each participant  up until and including the date three (3) years thereafter (the ""Vesting Period"")  is still employed by the Hansa Biopharma group. The last date for the start of the Share Rights Program 2022 shall be the day before the Annual General Meeting of Hansa Biopharma in 2023.In addition to the requirement for the participant's continued employment according to the above  the final number of Performance Shares that each participant is entitled to receive shall also be conditional upon the following performance conditions being met during the Vesting Period (together  the ""Performance Conditions""):22 per cent of the Performance Shares in the event the U.S. FDA has approved imlifidase in the U.S. in any indication (""Performance Condition 1"")  11 per cent of the Performance Shares in the event that imlifidase has been approved  or a Marketing Authorization Application/Biologics License Application has been submitted  in any jurisdiction in an indication outside kidney transplant (""Performance Condition 2"")  11 per cent of the Performance Shares in the event that more than 80 per cent of the targeted transplantation centers in Europe had repeat business  i.e. used Idefirix more than once (""Performance Condition 3"")  and 56 per cent of the Performance Shares related to the total shareholder return (the return to shareholders through an increased share price and reinvestments of any dividends during the Vesting Period) on the company's ordinary shares (""Performance Condition 4"").The above distribution of the number of Performance Shares is based on a valuation of each instrument and corresponds to a value-based distribution of approximately 24 per cent to Performance Condition 1  12 per cent to Performance Condition 2  12 per cent to Performance Condition 3 and 52 per cent to Performance Condition 4  respectively. This entails that participants will be entitled to 22 per cent of the Performance Shares if Performance Condition 1 is achieved  11 per cent of the Performance Shares if Performance Condition 2 is achieved and 11 per cent of the Performance Shares if Performance Condition 3 is achieved. In addition  participants will under Performance Condition 4 be entitled to 56 per cent of the Performance Shares if the total shareholder return for the company's ordinary share during the Vesting Period reaches or exceeds 75 per cent. If the total shareholder return during the Vesting Period is less than 25 per cent  no allotment of Performance Shares will be made under Performance Condition 4. In between the percentages  allotment will be made linearly. The baseline for assessing the total shareholder return under Performance Condition 4 should be the volume weighted average share price during the 30 trading days immediately preceding the respective allotment of the Share Rights  (the ""TSR Baseline""). In the event that the Performance Conditions  after the initial allotment  are not considered to be relevant incentives for Share Rights allotted in subsequent allocations under the program  these Performance Conditions may be replaced by other strategic goals for the company and further that the TSR Baseline may be the same as for the initial allocation.The Share Rights shall  in addition to what is set out above  be governed by the following terms and conditions:Share Rights are allotted free of charge no later than the day before the Annual General Meeting 2023.Share Rights vest during the Vesting Period.Share Rights may not be transferred or pledged.Each Share Right entitles the participant to receive one Performance Share free of charge after the end of the Vesting Period (with certain exceptions where the Vesting Period may be accelerated) if the participant  with certain exceptions  is still employed by the Hansa Biopharma group by the end of the Vesting Period.In order to align the interests of the participant and the shareholders'  the company will also compensate the participants for dividends paid by increasing the number of Performance Shares that each Share Right entitle to after the Vesting Period.Preparation of the program  design and administrationThe Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the board  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the Share Rights Program 2022  in accordance with the presented terms and guidelines including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the Hansa Biopharma group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the Share Rights Program 2022 no longer fulfils their objectives or the rationale for the proposal including  inter alia  that adjustments may be decided with respect to the terms and conditions for measuring performance  and the basis for such calculation.Allotment of Share RightsThe participants are divided into different categories and  in accordance with the above  the Share Rights under the Share Rights Program 2022 may be allotted to the following participants in the different categories:Category Maximum number of persons Maximum number of Share Rights Maximum number of Share Rights per person in the category CEO 1 80 000 80 000 Others 44 544 615 50 000In total  no more than 624 615 Share Rights may be allotted.Delivery of Performance Shares and hedging arrangementsThe Board of Directors has considered different methods for transfer of ordinary shares under the Share Rights Program 2022 in order to implement the program in a cost-effective and flexible manner and to limit dilution. The Board of Directors has found and therefore propose the structure including class C shares that have been implemented for the Outstanding Incentive Programs is the best option. The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves in accordance with item 17(b) below  to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve to issue and repurchase class C shares which  after reclassification to ordinary shares  may be transferred to participants and be sold to cover social costs. If the majority required for resolution in accordance with item 17(b) is not met  the Share Rights Program 2022 shall instead be hedged through a resolution to conclude an equity swap-agreement  in accordance with the Board of Director's proposal under item 17(c) below.Scope and costs for the Share Rights Program 2022The Share Rights Program 2022 will be reported in accordance with IFRS 2  which means that the Share Rights will be expensed as non-cash personnel costs over the Vesting Period. The costs for the Share Rights Program 2022 is estimated to amount to SEK 21.8 million  excluding social contributions  accounted in accordance with IFRS 2 based on the following assumptions: (i) that 624 615 Share Rights are allotted  (ii) that the volume-weighted average share price at the beginning of the Share Rights Program 2022 is SEK 56 per ordinary share  (iii) that the performance conditions are fully met  and (iv) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 5 per cent. Based on the same assumptions as above  and subject to social contributions of approximately 30 per cent and a share price increase of 75 per cent from the start of the Share Rights Program 2022 until the participants are allotted shares  the costs for social contributions are estimated to amount to SEK 15.7 million. The total cost in accordance with IFRS 2 for the Share Rights Program 2022  including social security costs  is therefore estimated at SEK 12.5 million per year over the Vesting Period  based on the same assumptions as above.Dilution and effects on key ratiosUpon maximum allotment of Share Rights and provided that (i) the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 17(b) below are adopted  it is estimated that not more than 624 615 ordinary shares will be allotted to participants under the Share Rights Program 2022  and that 187 385 ordinary shares will be used to secure social contributions arising as a result of the Share Rights Program 2022 from already existing C-shares  the incremental dilution effect would amount to approximately 1.3 per cent of the total number of ordinary shares in the company.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and under the assumption that the Share Rights Program 2022 was introduced in 2020  it is estimated that the key figure earnings per share for full year 2021 would have decreased from SEK -12.33 to approximately SEK -12.61.The preparation of the proposalThe Share Rights Program 2022 has been prepared by the company's Board of Directors and its Remuneration Committee in consultation with external advisors. The Share Rights Program 2022 has been discussed by the Board of Directors at meetings held in May 2022.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to issue new class C shares  authorization to repurchase issued class C shares  transfer own ordinary shares to participants in the programs and the market (item 17(b))The resolutions under this item 17(b) regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to issue new class C shares  authorization to repurchase issued class C shares  transfer own ordinary shares to participants in the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 (as proposed and defined under item 18) and the Outstanding Incentive Programs as well as in the market are proposed to be passed as one resolution.Authorization for the Board of Directors to issue class C sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 624 615 by the issue of not more than 624 615 class C shares  each with a quota value of SEK one (1). With deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  the participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares to employees under the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs  as well as to secure potential social contributions arising as a result of the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs.Authorization for the Board of Directors to repurchase class C sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to repurchase class C shares. The repurchase may only be effected through an offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. Repurchases shall be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the acquired class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to ensure delivery of shares to participants in the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs in accordance with the adopted terms and conditions and in order to secure possible social contributions arising as a result of the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs.Resolution to transfer own ordinary sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the class C shares that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase its own class C shares in accordance with the proposal under this item 17(b) and class C shares issued pursuant to the proposal in item 18(b) as well as the class C shares currently held by the Company  following reclassification into ordinary shares  amounting to a total maximum of 2 712 678 ordinary shares (for avoidance of doubt  in total under the resolution to transfer own ordinary shares pursuant to this proposal and the proposal under item 18(b))  may be transferred free of charge to participants in the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022  if approved  and/or to participants in the Outstanding Incentive Programs  in accordance with the approved terms and conditions  as well as be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the registered price range at the relevant time  to cover any social contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022  if approved  and/or to participants in the Outstanding Incentive Programs. The number of shares to be transferred is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue and/or other similar events.Proposal on equity swap arrangements with third parties (item 17(c))In the event that the required majority for item 17(b) above cannot be achieved  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to hedge the Share Rights Program 2022 by allowing Hansa Biopharma to enter into equity swap arrangements with third parties on market terms  where the third party in its own name will be able to acquire and transfer ordinary shares in Hansa Biopharma to the participants.Proposal to adopt a long-term incentive program based on employee stock options for employees at Hansa Biopharma (item 18)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive program for employees of the Hansa Biopharma group  within the framework of LTIP 2022  (""Option Program 2022"") in accordance with items 18(a) below. The decision to adopt the Option Program 2022 in accordance with item 18(a) shall further be conditional upon that the general meeting resolves on hedging measures in accordance with item 18(b) or  if the majority required for resolution in accordance with item 18(b) is not met  in accordance with the proposal according to item 18(c) below.Proposal regarding the adoption of Option Program 2022 (item 18(a))The program in briefThe Option Program 2022 consist of employee stock options that can be allotted to the CEO  other senior executives and key employees  limited to a total maximum of 15 employees within the Hansa Biopharma group. The employee stock options have a vesting period of three (3) years (the ""Vesting Period"")  after which the holder is entitled to exercise the options for ordinary shares during a period of three (3) years in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below. The last day for allotment under the Option Program 2022 shall be the day before the Annual General Meeting for Hansa Biopharma 2023.The background and rationale for the proposalThe purpose of the Option Program 2022 is to create the conditions for motivating and retaining competent employees within the Hansa Biopharma group and to increase the coherence between the employees'  shareholders' and the company's objectives  as well as to increase the motivation to reach and exceed the company's financial and non-financial targets. The Option Program 2022 has been designed so that the program includes both current and future senior executives.By offering options that are based on the share price development  the participants are premiered for increased shareholder value. The Option Program 2022 also rewards employees' continued loyalty and thus the long-term value growth of the company. Further  the Board of Directors considers that the Option Program 2022 will have a positive effect on the future development of the Hansa Biopharma group and will consequently be beneficial for both the company and its shareholders.Terms and conditionsThe company may allot employee stock options to the CEO  other senior executives and key employees. Each option entitles the participant to acquire one share in Hansa Biopharma in accordance with the following terms and conditions:The employee stock options will be allotted free of charge.Allotment requires that an acquisition of employee stock options can take place legally and that  according to the Board of Director's assessment  it can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial efforts. The last day for allotment of employee stock options shall be the day before the Annual General Meeting 2023.The employee stock options carry a Vesting Period of three (3) years from the time when allotment to the participants has taken place. The employee stock options entitle  after vesting in accordance with the terms and conditions including  with certain exceptions  that the participant is still employed throughout the Vesting Period  the participant to subscribe for shares during a three (3) year period following vesting.The participant must  with certain exceptions  be employed within the group when the participant acquires shares on the basis of the Option Program 2022. For terminated employees acquisition of shares must occur within three (3) months of notice of termination.Each employee stock option that is transferred entitles the participant to acquire one share in the company at an exercise price corresponding to 125 per cent of the volume-weighted average share price during the 30 trading days immediately preceding the respective allotment of the employee stock options (the "" Exercise Price ""). In the event that the Exercise Price  after the initial allotment  is not considered to be appropriate for stock options allotted in subsequent allocations under the program  the Exercise Price may be decided to be the same as for the initial allocation.""). In the event that the Exercise Price  after the initial allotment  is not considered to be appropriate for stock options allotted in subsequent allocations under the program  the Exercise Price may be decided to be the same as for the initial allocation. The Option Program 2022 shall be settled by using a net share-settlement method  as further described below.The employee stock options shall not constitute securities and may not be transferred or pledged.The exercise price for employee stock options  determined as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10   whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded downwards. The exercise price and the number of shares that each employee stock option entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue and/or similar measures in accordance with market practice.Preparation of the program  design and administrationThe Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the Option Program 2022  in accordance with the presented terms and guidelines including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the Hansa Biopharma group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the Option Program 2022 no longer fulfils their objectives or the rationale for the proposal.Allocation of employee stock optionsThe right to receive employee stock options shall accrue to the CEO  senior executives and key employees  current and future  within the limits outlined in below table:Category Maximum number of persons Maximum number of employee stock options Maximum number of employee stock options per person within the category CEO 1 120 000 120 000 Other senior executives and key employees 14 332 307 70 000In total  not more than 452 307 employee stock options may be allotted.Board members shall not be eligible to participate in the Option Program 2022.Net share-settlement method for Option Program 2022The Option Program 2022 shall be settled by using a net share-settlement method (""Net share-settlement""). The Net share-settlement entails that stock options are settled by delivering a number of shares corresponding to the Stock Option Value (as defined below) to the participants free of charge without any payment of the exercise price. The number of shares to be delivered is calculated by deducting the exercise price of the exercised options from the prevailing share price of the Hansa Biopharma common shares on the stock market at the time of exercise (""Market Price"") (the ""Stock Option Value"") and dividing the Stock Option Value with the Market Price.Illustrative example of Net share-settlementA participant in Option Program 2022 holds 100 stock options with Market Price of the common shares of SEK 75 and Exercise Price of SEK 50. The difference between the Market Price and the Exercise Price is SEK 25 per option (""Stock Option Value""). Instead of the participant paying the Exercise Price (number of stock options (100) multiplied by the Exercise Price (SEK 50)) and the company delivering 100 shares worth 75 SEK each (Market Price)  the company would use Net-settlement by delivering shares in an amount corresponding to the Stock Option Value divided with the Market Price ((25*100)/75) – i.e. the company would deliver 33.33 shares meaning 33 shares and SEK 25 in cash.Scope and costs for the Option Program 2022The Option Program 2022 will be reported in accordance with IFRS 2  which means that the option rights will be expensed as non-cash personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Costs related to the employee stock options are estimated to amount to SEK 7.2 million  excluding social contributions  accounted in accordance with IFRS 2 based on the following assumptions: (i) that 452 307 employee stock options are allotted  (ii) that the volume-weighted average share price  at the beginning of the Option Program 2022  is SEK 56 per ordinary share  and (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 5 per cent. Based on the same assumptions as above  and subject to social contributions of 30 per cent  and a share price increase of 75 per cent from the start of the Option Program 2022 until the employee stock options are exercised  the costs for social contributions are estimated to amount to SEK 3.3 million. The total cost in accordance with IFRS 2  including social security costs  is therefore estimated at SEK 3.5 million per year over the Vesting Period  based on the same assumptions as above.Dilution and effects on key ratiosUpon maximum allotment of employee stock options and provided that (i) the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 18(b) below are adopted  it is estimated that not more than 226 154 ordinary shares will be allotted to participants under the Option Program 2022 using the Net-share-settlement  and that 67 846 ordinary shares will be used to secure social contributions arising as a result of the Option Program 2022 from already existing C-shares  which would entail an incremental dilution effect of approximately 0.5 per cent of the total number of ordinary shares in the company.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and that Option Program 2022 was introduced in 2020 instead  it is estimated that the key figure earnings per share for full year 2021 would have decreased from SEK -12.33 to approximately SEK -12.41.The preparation of the proposalOption Program 2022 has been prepared by the company's Board of Directors and its Remuneration Committee in consultation with external advisors.

By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  NOXXON’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses against the immune system and enable greater therapeutic impact. NOXXON’s lead program NOX-A12 has delivered final top-line data from a Keytruda® combination trial in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients published at the ESMO conference in September 2020 and in July 2021 the company announced its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. NOXXON is also studying NOX-A12 in brain cancer in combination with radiotherapy which has been granted orphan drug status in the US and EU for the treatment of certain brain cancers. GLORIA  a trial of NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy has delivered top-line data from all three dose-escalation cohorts showing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA has been expanded to assess the benefit of NOX-A12 with other treatment combinations  radiotherapy + bevacizumab and radiotherapy + pembrolizumab.

The purpose of the incentive scheme is to enhance the Company’s ability to attract  retain and motivate management who are expected to make important contributions to the Company and by providing the Chief Executive Officer with equity ownership opportunities that are intended to better align the interests of the Chief Executive Officer with those of the shareholders of the Company. The Major Shareholder consider that the adoption of the incentive program as described herein is in the favour of the Group and the shareholders of the Company. The proposed incentive program means that the Chief Executive Officer will be granted stock options free of charge. The program comprises a maximum of 7 000 000 stock options  representing approximately 3.0 per cent of the share capital and votes after dilution  based on the current number of shares in the Company.

Each option entitles the Chief Executive Officer to purchase one common stock in the Company at a price equal to 120 per cent of the average volume weighted closing price of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq Stockholm for each trading day during the period from 20 June 2022 up to and including 4 July 2022. The Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of the incentive scheme  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments of the incentive program to meet foreign regulations or market conditions.

Furthermore  in case of special circumstances  the Board of Directors shall be authorised to resolve that stock options will be kept and exercised despite the fact that employment in the Company has ceased  for example due to illness. The incentive scheme allows employees of to be granted stock options entitling them to acquire shares in the Company.

The options granted to the Chairman will vest and become exercisable on a pro rata basis  with 1/36 per month  until all options have vested after three years and can be exercised three years after the date of grant of the options. The options may not be exercised unless the Chairman  at the time he or she exercises the options  is  and has been at all times since the date of grant of the options  appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company or any company of which the Company holds at least 20 per cent of the votes for all the shares or the Company’s subsidiary or the Company with one or more subsidiaries or several subsidiaries together holds at least 20 per cent of the votes.

With the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the new shares may be subscribed for by a bank or securities company at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value.

Repurchases may only be made through an acquisition offer addressed to all holders of Series C shares and shall comprise all outstanding Series C shares. Acquisitions shall be made at a price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. Payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the above authorisations is to be able to resolve on repurchase of Series C shares in order to ensure delivery of shares to participants in the Company’s outstanding incentive programs and secure payment of social security contributions attributable to such incentive programs.

The purpose of this authorisation and the reason for any disapplication of the shareholders' preferential rights is to increase the flexibility of the Company to finance the ongoing business and at the same time extend and strengthen the Company’s shareholder base of strategic or long term investors. The basis for the issue price shall be according to the prevailing market conditions at the time when shares  warrants and/or convertible bonds are issued. A valid resolution by the AGM pursuant to the proposal above requires that the resolution be supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the AGM. Resolution to initiate legal proceedings against the auditing company Grant Thornton in respect of unpaid audit and advisory services (item 17) The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to initiate legal proceedings against the auditing company Grant Thornton in relation to an ongoing dispute regarding unpaid auditing and advisory services.

Such programs have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. The program includes  among others  the CEO and other senior executives in the company. The performance criteria used to assess the outcome of the plans are distinctly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the company's long-term value creation  including its sustainability.For more information regarding these incentive programs  including the criteria which the outcome depends on  please see https://hansabiopharma.com/this-is-hansa/corporate-governance/.This policy enables the company to offer senior executives a competitive remuneration. The remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed base salary  variable cash remuneration (including STI)  pension benefits and other benefits. The components  their purpose and link to the company's business strategy are described below.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the policyThe Board of Directors has established a Committee within the Board (the Remuneration Committee)  with the tasks of preparing  within the Board of Directors  the policy for remuneration for senior executives. The Board of Directors shall propose a revised policy at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for senior executives  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company.

The Remuneration Committee and the CEO  as applicable  shall continuously report to the Board of Directors. The CEO and the other senior executives shall not be present when their respective remuneration terms are decided.Additionally  the general meeting may – irrespective of this policy – resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration.Fixed Base SalaryPurpose and link to strategy Supports the attraction and retention of the best talent. Ensures competitiveness while controlling fixed costs to maximise efficiency. Operational Details Normally reviewed annually and increases will usually be effective from 1 April or following a change in responsibilities.The Remuneration Committee will consider  among other things  the following parameters when reviewing fixed base salary:Economic and salary conditions and trends.The individual's performance and responsibilities.Base salaries and total remuneration at other companies that operate in the same markets  typically benchmarked against similar roles.Variable Cash RemunerationA portion of the total remuneration for the senior executives are linked to business performance so that total remuneration will increase or decrease in line with performance  thus promoting the company's business strategy and long-term interests (see ""Annual Short-Term Incentive (STI)"" below).For retention or recruitment purposes or extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks the Remuneration Committee  based on proposal of CEO  may  on an individual basis  decide on an additional variable cash remuneration. Such remuneration may not exceed an annual amount corresponding to 30 percent of the total fixed annual cash salary and may not be paid more than once each year per individual.Annual Short-Term Incentive (STI)Purpose and link to strategy To incentivise and create focus on the delivery of corporate objectives and strategic criteria.

The performance criteria  weighting and targets for the individual objectives are to be proposed  evaluated and approved annually by the CEO as manager for members of the executive committee or  if it is not the CEO  then the respective manager for such members of the executive committee  and for the CEO the Remuneration Committee. The outcome of criteria for awarding STI is to be measured over a period of one year and depend on the degree of fulfilment of predetermined targets. The Board of Directors shall have the possibility  under applicable law or contractual provisions  subject to the restrictions that may apply under law or contract  to reclaim in whole or in part STI paid on incorrect grounds (claw-back). Opportunity Levels The maximum opportunity for STI can amount up to max 75 percent of fixed base salary.The Remuneration Committee shall have the possibility to review the opportunity levels in order to ensure market competitiveness. Performance criteria The STI plan awards shall be based on corporate objectives and individual objectives and be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria.The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests.For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the company.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for this remuneration policy  salary and employment conditions for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time.Derogation from the policyThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the policy  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the policy.Description of material changes to the guidelines and how the views of shareholders' have been taken into considerationIn order to drive the business outcomes through a tailored employee incentive program that balances individual achievement and organisational contribution it is proposed that the performance criteria for the ""Annual Short-Term Incentive (""STI"") shall include both corporate and individual objectives. Furthermore  it is proposed that the performance criteria  weighting and targets for the individual objectives under the STI are to be proposed  evaluated and approved annually by the CEO as manager for members of the executive committee or  if it is not the CEO  then the respective manager for such members of the executive committee  and for the CEO the Remuneration Committee. The proposed adjustments have been reflected in these guidelines which will be subject to the shareholders' approval at the annual general meeting 2022.During 2021  neither the Remuneration Committee nor the Board of Directors received any comments or questions from the shareholders on the remuneration guidelines adopted at the annual general meeting 2021.Proposal regarding the amendment of the articles of association (item 16)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a new § 14  with the wording set out below  is included in the Articles of Association  subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declaring the registration statement on Form F-1 relating to a potential initial public offering of American Depositary Shares in the U.S. representing common shares in Hansa Biopharma effective. The proposal entails  subject to the mentioned condition being fulfilled  that the Articles of Association will set out the forum for resolving certain U.S. securities related complaints.§ 14Without any infringement on Swedish forum provisions and without applying Chapter 7  Section 54 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551)  the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933  as amended  and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder  unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum.Proposal for a long-term incentive program 2022 (item 17 - 18)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive program for employees at Hansa Biopharma (""LTIP 2022""). LTIP 2022 includes two elements; one performance-based share rights program (item 17)  and one employee stock option program (item 18). LTIP 2022 is generally structured in line with the previously adopted and outstanding incentive programs approved by the annual general meetings held 2018  2019  2020 and 2021 (the ""Outstanding Incentive Programs""). For a description of the Outstanding Incentive Programs  please refer to the company's Annual Report for 2021  pages 95-100 (Eng. version)  and the company's webpage  www.hansabiopharma.com. In addition to the described incentive programs  there are no other long-term incentive programs in Hansa Biopharma.Proposal to adopt a long-term incentive program based on performance-based share rights for employees at Hansa Biopharma (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive program based on performance-based share rights for employees of the Hansa Biopharma group  within the framework of LTIP 2022  (the ""Share Rights Program 2022"") in accordance with item 17(a). The decision to adopt the Share Rights Program 2022 in accordance with item 17(a) shall further be conditional upon that the general meeting resolves on hedging measures in accordance with item 17(b) or  if the majority required for resolution in accordance with item 17(b) is not met  in accordance with the proposal according to item 17(c) below.Proposal to adopt the Share Rights Program 2022 (item 17(a))The program in briefThe Share Rights Program 2022 is proposed to include the CEO  the broader leadership team and other key employees  meaning that a maximum of 45 individuals within the Hansa Biopharma group will be able to participate. Participants will be given the opportunity to receive ordinary shares free of charge within the framework of the Share Rights Program 2022  so-called ""Performance Shares""  in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below.Within the framework of the Share Rights Program 2022  the company may allot participants rights to Performance Shares which means that  subject to certain conditions being met  the right to receive a Performance Share free of charge (""Share Rights"").The background and rationale for the proposalThe purpose of the Share Rights Program 2022 is to create the conditions for motivating and retaining competent employees within the Hansa Biopharma group and to increase the coherence between the employees'  shareholders' and the company's objectives  as well as to increase the motivation to reach and exceed the company's financial and non-financial targets. The Share Rights Program 2022 has been designed so that the program includes both current and future senior executives and other key employees.By offering Share Rights that are based on a combination of both  share price development and strategic goals  the participants are premiered for increased shareholder value/value-creating measures. The Share Rights Program 2022 also rewards employees' continued loyalty and thus the long-term value growth of the company. Further  the Board of Directors considers that the Share Rights Program 2022 will have a positive effect on the future development of the Hansa Biopharma group and will consequently be beneficial for both the company and its shareholders.Terms and conditionsA Share Right may be exercised provided that the participant  with certain exceptions  from the start date of the Share Rights Program 2022 for each participant  up until and including the date three (3) years thereafter (the ""Vesting Period"")  is still employed by the Hansa Biopharma group. The last date for the start of the Share Rights Program 2022 shall be the day before the Annual General Meeting of Hansa Biopharma in 2023.In addition to the requirement for the participant's continued employment according to the above  the final number of Performance Shares that each participant is entitled to receive shall also be conditional upon the following performance conditions being met during the Vesting Period (together  the ""Performance Conditions""):22 per cent of the Performance Shares in the event the U.S. FDA has approved imlifidase in the U.S. in any indication (""Performance Condition 1"")  11 per cent of the Performance Shares in the event that imlifidase has been approved  or a Marketing Authorization Application/Biologics License Application has been submitted  in any jurisdiction in an indication outside kidney transplant (""Performance Condition 2"")  11 per cent of the Performance Shares in the event that more than 80 per cent of the targeted transplantation centers in Europe had repeat business  i.e. used Idefirix more than once (""Performance Condition 3"")  and 56 per cent of the Performance Shares related to the total shareholder return (the return to shareholders through an increased share price and reinvestments of any dividends during the Vesting Period) on the company's ordinary shares (""Performance Condition 4"").The above distribution of the number of Performance Shares is based on a valuation of each instrument and corresponds to a value-based distribution of approximately 24 per cent to Performance Condition 1  12 per cent to Performance Condition 2  12 per cent to Performance Condition 3 and 52 per cent to Performance Condition 4  respectively. This entails that participants will be entitled to 22 per cent of the Performance Shares if Performance Condition 1 is achieved  11 per cent of the Performance Shares if Performance Condition 2 is achieved and 11 per cent of the Performance Shares if Performance Condition 3 is achieved. In addition  participants will under Performance Condition 4 be entitled to 56 per cent of the Performance Shares if the total shareholder return for the company's ordinary share during the Vesting Period reaches or exceeds 75 per cent. If the total shareholder return during the Vesting Period is less than 25 per cent  no allotment of Performance Shares will be made under Performance Condition 4. In between the percentages  allotment will be made linearly. The baseline for assessing the total shareholder return under Performance Condition 4 should be the volume weighted average share price during the 30 trading days immediately preceding the respective allotment of the Share Rights  (the ""TSR Baseline""). In the event that the Performance Conditions  after the initial allotment  are not considered to be relevant incentives for Share Rights allotted in subsequent allocations under the program  these Performance Conditions may be replaced by other strategic goals for the company and further that the TSR Baseline may be the same as for the initial allocation.The Share Rights shall  in addition to what is set out above  be governed by the following terms and conditions:Share Rights are allotted free of charge no later than the day before the Annual General Meeting 2023.Share Rights vest during the Vesting Period.Share Rights may not be transferred or pledged.Each Share Right entitles the participant to receive one Performance Share free of charge after the end of the Vesting Period (with certain exceptions where the Vesting Period may be accelerated) if the participant  with certain exceptions  is still employed by the Hansa Biopharma group by the end of the Vesting Period.In order to align the interests of the participant and the shareholders'  the company will also compensate the participants for dividends paid by increasing the number of Performance Shares that each Share Right entitle to after the Vesting Period.Preparation of the program  design and administrationThe Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the board  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the Share Rights Program 2022  in accordance with the presented terms and guidelines including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the Hansa Biopharma group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the Share Rights Program 2022 no longer fulfils their objectives or the rationale for the proposal including  inter alia  that adjustments may be decided with respect to the terms and conditions for measuring performance  and the basis for such calculation.Allotment of Share RightsThe participants are divided into different categories and  in accordance with the above  the Share Rights under the Share Rights Program 2022 may be allotted to the following participants in the different categories:Category Maximum number of persons Maximum number of Share Rights Maximum number of Share Rights per person in the category CEO 1 80 000 80 000 Others 44 544 615 50 000In total  no more than 624 615 Share Rights may be allotted.Delivery of Performance Shares and hedging arrangementsThe Board of Directors has considered different methods for transfer of ordinary shares under the Share Rights Program 2022 in order to implement the program in a cost-effective and flexible manner and to limit dilution. The Board of Directors has found and therefore propose the structure including class C shares that have been implemented for the Outstanding Incentive Programs is the best option. The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves in accordance with item 17(b) below  to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve to issue and repurchase class C shares which  after reclassification to ordinary shares  may be transferred to participants and be sold to cover social costs. If the majority required for resolution in accordance with item 17(b) is not met  the Share Rights Program 2022 shall instead be hedged through a resolution to conclude an equity swap-agreement  in accordance with the Board of Director's proposal under item 17(c) below.Scope and costs for the Share Rights Program 2022The Share Rights Program 2022 will be reported in accordance with IFRS 2  which means that the Share Rights will be expensed as non-cash personnel costs over the Vesting Period. The costs for the Share Rights Program 2022 is estimated to amount to SEK 21.8 million  excluding social contributions  accounted in accordance with IFRS 2 based on the following assumptions: (i) that 624 615 Share Rights are allotted  (ii) that the volume-weighted average share price at the beginning of the Share Rights Program 2022 is SEK 56 per ordinary share  (iii) that the performance conditions are fully met  and (iv) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 5 per cent. Based on the same assumptions as above  and subject to social contributions of approximately 30 per cent and a share price increase of 75 per cent from the start of the Share Rights Program 2022 until the participants are allotted shares  the costs for social contributions are estimated to amount to SEK 15.7 million. The total cost in accordance with IFRS 2 for the Share Rights Program 2022  including social security costs  is therefore estimated at SEK 12.5 million per year over the Vesting Period  based on the same assumptions as above.Dilution and effects on key ratiosUpon maximum allotment of Share Rights and provided that (i) the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 17(b) below are adopted  it is estimated that not more than 624 615 ordinary shares will be allotted to participants under the Share Rights Program 2022  and that 187 385 ordinary shares will be used to secure social contributions arising as a result of the Share Rights Program 2022 from already existing C-shares  the incremental dilution effect would amount to approximately 1.3 per cent of the total number of ordinary shares in the company.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and under the assumption that the Share Rights Program 2022 was introduced in 2020  it is estimated that the key figure earnings per share for full year 2021 would have decreased from SEK -12.33 to approximately SEK -12.61.The preparation of the proposalThe Share Rights Program 2022 has been prepared by the company's Board of Directors and its Remuneration Committee in consultation with external advisors. The Share Rights Program 2022 has been discussed by the Board of Directors at meetings held in May 2022.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to issue new class C shares  authorization to repurchase issued class C shares  transfer own ordinary shares to participants in the programs and the market (item 17(b))The resolutions under this item 17(b) regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to issue new class C shares  authorization to repurchase issued class C shares  transfer own ordinary shares to participants in the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 (as proposed and defined under item 18) and the Outstanding Incentive Programs as well as in the market are proposed to be passed as one resolution.Authorization for the Board of Directors to issue class C sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 624 615 by the issue of not more than 624 615 class C shares  each with a quota value of SEK one (1). With deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  the participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares to employees under the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs  as well as to secure potential social contributions arising as a result of the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs.Authorization for the Board of Directors to repurchase class C sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to repurchase class C shares. The repurchase may only be effected through an offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. Repurchases shall be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the acquired class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to ensure delivery of shares to participants in the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs in accordance with the adopted terms and conditions and in order to secure possible social contributions arising as a result of the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs.Resolution to transfer own ordinary sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the class C shares that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase its own class C shares in accordance with the proposal under this item 17(b) and class C shares issued pursuant to the proposal in item 18(b) as well as the class C shares currently held by the Company  following reclassification into ordinary shares  amounting to a total maximum of 2 712 678 ordinary shares (for avoidance of doubt  in total under the resolution to transfer own ordinary shares pursuant to this proposal and the proposal under item 18(b))  may be transferred free of charge to participants in the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022  if approved  and/or to participants in the Outstanding Incentive Programs  in accordance with the approved terms and conditions  as well as be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the registered price range at the relevant time  to cover any social contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Share Rights Program 2022  the Option Program 2022  if approved  and/or to participants in the Outstanding Incentive Programs. The number of shares to be transferred is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue and/or other similar events.Proposal on equity swap arrangements with third parties (item 17(c))In the event that the required majority for item 17(b) above cannot be achieved  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to hedge the Share Rights Program 2022 by allowing Hansa Biopharma to enter into equity swap arrangements with third parties on market terms  where the third party in its own name will be able to acquire and transfer ordinary shares in Hansa Biopharma to the participants.Proposal to adopt a long-term incentive program based on employee stock options for employees at Hansa Biopharma (item 18)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive program for employees of the Hansa Biopharma group  within the framework of LTIP 2022  (""Option Program 2022"") in accordance with items 18(a) below.

In the event that the Exercise Price  after the initial allotment  is not considered to be appropriate for stock options allotted in subsequent allocations under the program  the Exercise Price may be decided to be the same as for the initial allocation. The Option Program 2022 shall be settled by using a net share-settlement method  as further described below.The employee stock options shall not constitute securities and may not be transferred or pledged.The exercise price for employee stock options  determined as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10  whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded downwards. The exercise price and the number of shares that each employee stock option entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue and/or similar measures in accordance with market practice.Preparation of the program  design and administrationThe Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the Option Program 2022  in accordance with the presented terms and guidelines including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the Hansa Biopharma group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the Option Program 2022 no longer fulfils their objectives or the rationale for the proposal.Allocation of employee stock optionsThe right to receive employee stock options shall accrue to the CEO  senior executives and key employees  current and future  within the limits outlined in below table:Category Maximum number of persons Maximum number of employee stock options Maximum number of employee stock options per person within the category CEO 1 120 000 120 000 Other senior executives and key employees 14 332 307 70 000In total  not more than 452 307 employee stock options may be allotted.Board members shall not be eligible to participate in the Option Program 2022.Net share-settlement method for Option Program 2022The Option Program 2022 shall be settled by using a net share-settlement method (""Net share-settlement""). The Net share-settlement entails that stock options are settled by delivering a number of shares corresponding to the Stock Option Value (as defined below) to the participants free of charge without any payment of the exercise price. The number of shares to be delivered is calculated by deducting the exercise price of the exercised options from the prevailing share price of the Hansa Biopharma common shares on the stock market at the time of exercise (""Market Price"") (the ""Stock Option Value"") and dividing the Stock Option Value with the Market Price.Illustrative example of Net share-settlementA participant in Option Program 2022 holds 100 stock options with Market Price of the common shares of SEK 75 and Exercise Price of SEK 50. The difference between the Market Price and the Exercise Price is SEK 25 per option (""Stock Option Value""). Instead of the participant paying the Exercise Price (number of stock options (100) multiplied by the Exercise Price (SEK 50)) and the company delivering 100 shares worth 75 SEK each (Market Price)  the company would use Net-settlement by delivering shares in an amount corresponding to the Stock Option Value divided with the Market Price ((25*100)/75) – i.e. the company would deliver 33.33 shares meaning 33 shares and SEK 25 in cash.Scope and costs for the Option Program 2022The Option Program 2022 will be reported in accordance with IFRS 2  which means that the option rights will be expensed as non-cash personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Costs related to the employee stock options are estimated to amount to SEK 7.2 million  excluding social contributions  accounted in accordance with IFRS 2 based on the following assumptions: (i) that 452 307 employee stock options are allotted  (ii) that the volume-weighted average share price  at the beginning of the Option Program 2022  is SEK 56 per ordinary share  and (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 5 per cent. Based on the same assumptions as above  and subject to social contributions of 30 per cent  and a share price increase of 75 per cent from the start of the Option Program 2022 until the employee stock options are exercised  the costs for social contributions are estimated to amount to SEK 3.3 million. The total cost in accordance with IFRS 2  including social security costs  is therefore estimated at SEK 3.5 million per year over the Vesting Period  based on the same assumptions as above.Dilution and effects on key ratiosUpon maximum allotment of employee stock options and provided that (i) the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 18(b) below are adopted  it is estimated that not more than 226 154 ordinary shares will be allotted to participants under the Option Program 2022 using the Net-share-settlement  and that 67 846 ordinary shares will be used to secure social contributions arising as a result of the Option Program 2022 from already existing C-shares  which would entail an incremental dilution effect of approximately 0.5 per cent of the total number of ordinary shares in the company.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and that Option Program 2022 was introduced in 2020 instead  it is estimated that the key figure earnings per share for full year 2021 would have decreased from SEK -12.33 to approximately SEK -12.41.The preparation of the proposalOption Program 2022 has been prepared by the company's Board of Directors and its Remuneration Committee in consultation with external advisors. Option Program 2022 has been discussed by the Board of Directors at meetings held in May 2022.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to issue new class C shares  authorization to repurchase issued class C shares  transfer own ordinary shares to participants in the programs and the market (item 18(b))The resolutions under this item 18(b) regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to issue new class C shares  authorization to repurchase issued class C shares  transfer own ordinary shares to participants in the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022 and the Outstanding Incentive Programs as well as in the market are proposed to be passed as one resolution.Authorization for the Board of Directors to issue class C sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 226 154 by the issue of not more than 226 154 class C shares  each with a quota value of SEK one (1). With deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  the participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares to employees under the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs  as well as to secure potential social contributions arising as a result of the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs.Authorization for the Board of Directors to repurchase class C sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to repurchase class C shares. The repurchase may only be effected through an offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. Repurchases shall be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the acquired class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to ensure delivery of shares to participants in the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs in accordance with the adopted terms and conditions and in order to secure possible social contributions arising as a result of the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022 and/or the Outstanding Incentive Programs.Resolution to transfer own ordinary sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the class C shares that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase its own class C shares in accordance with the proposal under this item 18(b) and class C shares issued pursuant to the proposal in item 17(b) as well as the class C shares currently held by the Company  following reclassification into ordinary shares  amounting to a total maximum of 2 712 678 ordinary shares (for avoidance of doubt  in total under the resolution to transfer own ordinary shares pursuant to this proposal and the proposal under item 17(b))  may be transferred free of charge to participants in the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022  if approved  and/or to participants in the Outstanding Incentive Programs  in accordance with the approved terms and conditions  as well as be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the registered price range at the relevant time  to cover any social contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Option Program 2022  the Share Rights Program 2022  if approved  and/or to participants in the Outstanding Incentive Programs. The number of shares to be transferred is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue and/or other similar events.Proposal on equity swap arrangements with third parties (item 18(c))In the event that the required majority for item 18(b) above cannot be achieved  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to hedge the Option Program 2022 by allowing Hansa Biopharma to enter into equity swap arrangements with third parties on market terms  where the third party in its own name will be able to acquire and transfer ordinary shares in Hansa Biopharma to the participants.Proposal regarding resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on new issue of ordinary shares and warrants and/or convertibles (item 19)Main proposal (item 19(a))Hansa Biopharma is currently launching its lead asset  imlifidase for enabling kidney transplants in highly sensitized patients  in Europe and continues implementing efforts to potentially enable future regulatory approval and market access for this indication in other important markets while pursuing multiple pipeline building projects within transplantation  autoimmune diseases and gene therapy based on its validated technology platform. In this situation  it is important for the Company's ability to build and maximize shareholder value to have  and it is the purpose of the proposed authorization to provide  sufficient financial flexibility and a broad acting scope to the board of directors  in particular to match significant commercial and pipeline growth acceleration opportunities with the available financing mandate  provide flexibility to quickly respond to strategic opportunities such as partnerships or collaborations or to expand the shareholder constituency in certain investor markets or in connection with the listing of the shares on a U.S. stock exchange.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting renews its previous authorization  which has not been used due to overall stock market conditions and to protect existing shareholders' interests  and resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to  until the next Annual General Meeting  on one or more occasions  decide upon issuances of new ordinary shares  issuance of warrants and/or convertibles. New issues of ordinary shares and issues of warrants and/or convertibles may occur with or without preferential rights for shareholders of the Company and may be made either in cash and/or by way of set-off or contribution in kind or otherwise on specific terms. The number of shares issued  or number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  may not correspond to a dilution of more than 20 per cent of the total number of shares outstanding at the Annual General Meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  after full exercise of the hereby proposed authorization.Alternative proposal (item 19(b))If the proposal in item 19(a) above does not get the required supportive votes from the Annual General Meeting to be passed  the Board of Directors proposes that it is given an authorization to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertibles corresponding to a dilution of not more than 10 per cent  on the same terms and conditions as stated above in item 19(a).Majority requirementsResolutions in accordance with items 16 and 19 above requires approval of at least two thirds (2/3) of the shares represented and votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.

The Pando Crypto Basket 6 Index contains the six largest crypto assets. The weight per asset is proportional to the square root of its market capitalization. The purpose of the ETP is to provide a diversified portfolio where the two largest assets are not overpowering the basket. This product is focusing on letting investors enjoy diversification while benefiting from the higher growth potential of relatively small market cap crypto assets. The index is rebalanced quarterly. As of today  the index contains ADA  BTC  ETH  BNB and SOL. The Pando6 crypto product (PNDS) is the only largely covered ETP on the market that did not take the dramatic hit from Luna’s incident.The Pando6 product has partnered with the largest custodian Coinbase and is 100% fully collateralized  providing investors with institutional grade security using a variety of safety measures including multiple signature authorization  whitelisting addresses  cold storage  and audit trails.Pando Asset is domiciled in Switzerland and is built by a group of industry professionals from finance  blockchain technology  and crypto asset space  such as Huobi Group  21 Shares AG  and Deutsche Boerse AG. The company has the mission to let investors be able to participate in crypto assets without worrying about the risk of missing a private key or password  or facing any loss from hackers or system security issues.Pando Asset has obtained the ETP issuer qualification from the SIX exchange  the largest exchange in Switzerland  and is obtaining the EU passport to market through the rest of Europe and America  e.g. Deutsche Boerse  Euronext Amsterdam  Euronext Paris  Boerse Duesseldorf  Nasdaq  etc.More information of the index can be found at https://methodology.vinter.co/pando/vinter-pando-crypto-indexesMedia Contact:Contact Person: Jen YouEmail: [email protected]Website: www.pandoasset.comSOURCE: Pando Asset AGView source version on accesswire.com:https://www.accesswire.com/703212/Swiss-ETP-Issuer-Pando-Asset-AG-to-Launch-Pando-6-PNDS-in-June-2022,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.03,0.96,True,English,"['Swiss ETP Issuer', 'Pando Asset AG', 'PNDS', 'June', 'small market cap crypto assets', 'TOP6 digital asset index product', 'The Pando Crypto Basket 6 Index', 'The Pando6 crypto product', 'six largest crypto assets', 'The Pando6 product', 'crypto asset space', 'two largest assets', 'higher growth potential', 'largest custodian Coinbase', 'institutional grade security', 'multiple signature authorization', 'system security issues', 'crypto-indexes Media Contact', 'ETP issuer qualification', 'Pando Asset AG', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Swiss ETP issuer', 'SIX exchange', 'largest exchange', 'market capitalization', 'Contact Person', '21 Shares AG', 'Boerse Duesseldorf', 'NEW YORK', 'square root', 'diversified portfolio', 'dramatic hit', 'safety measures', 'whitelisting addresses', 'cold storage', 'audit trails', 'industry professionals', 'blockchain technology', 'private key', 'EU passport', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Euronext Paris', 'More information', 'methodology.vinter', 'Jen You', 'Huobi Group', 'source version', 'NY', 'ACCESSWIRE', 'May', 'PNDS', 'June', 'weight', 'purpose', 'investors', 'diversification', 'today', 'ADA', 'BTC', 'BNB', 'SOL', 'Luna', 'incident', 'variety', 'Switzerland', 'finance', 'mission', 'risk', 'password', 'loss', 'hackers', 'rest', 'Europe', 'America', 'Nasdaq', 'Email', 'Website', 'pandoasset', 'ETP-Issuer-Pando-Asset']",2022-05-30,2022-05-30,digitaljournal.com

That is the trillion-dollar question at the moment. Wilson pointed out that no one truly knows  but we are seeing a reversal of the relative prosperity seen over the past couple of decades.""We are now in a different phase  with inflation and interest rates going up. To me  it's going to be a more difficult period.""An investor after a previous presentation summed it up perfectly with the following accusation:""Geez Geoff  you sounded pretty bearish""But experience maketh the man  and in this case  Wilson has carried ""the scars of '87 and the GFC"" with him. Ultimately he is following a long held philosophy where he ""plans for the worst and hopes for the best.""Investors also heard from WAM's Lead Portfolio Managers on markets and how that links to their strategies. Catriona Burns sees the current dip in markets as a long-overdue ""reset "" opening up an exciting 6 months ahead for those that stay invested. Dania Zinurova is similarly confident for the upcoming year  with the prospect of cycling mature capital into exciting new alternative assets on the horizon.The wire also features an insight from Future Generation. We hear from Jun Bei Liu  a manager involved in this charitable endeavour. She shares how she is approaching markets as well as 2 of her favourite stock picks.Geoff Wilson with Matthew Haupt  Catriona Burns and Oscar ObergSpeakers covered:Funds Watch WAM Vault and Future Generation Live ViewWAM Global sees market crash as a 'reset' opportunityCatriona Burns is charged with managing WAM's global strategy out of their New York office. ""Messy"" is the word she used to describe global equity markets at the moment  and this would be an understatement. With COVID-19 hanging around  there have been continual issues with the fragility of supply chains  the Ukraine conflict and endless 0-COVID policies in China.Interest rates have been a hot topic too  with an ongoing period of lowering rates leading to ""an enormous divergence in what sectors have worked  and which haven't.""Burns remarks that while this accommodative policy has been positive for markets  this ""era of free money"" has been the core driver of enormous escalation in asset prices - whether that is equities  house prices  crypto and so on. Accordingly  a market reset could actually be a positive.""What we are seeing in terms of interest rates going up is actually really healthy for asset prices that are totally inflated on the basis of not very much. I am actually very positive in that we are seeing a reset in some of these insane valuations.""A perfect example of this recent exuberance is Snapchat (NASDAQ: SNAP). The company's share price has fallen approximately 40% this week  yet still trades on ""250 times earnings. It could halve again and again  and you still would struggle to justify the valuation.""This market-wide rerating has shifted the focus of investors back towards reasonable valuations and the durability of a company's earnings. This renewed emphasis is healthy  in the eyes of Burns  and opens a set of new opportunities.""None of us like seeing markets go down - that is painful for all. But in terms of the opportunities that we are going see over the next 6 months compared to the past 5 years  its going to be very exciting.Exciting companiesA common theme of stock-picking at the moment is finding companies that can withstand the seemingly endless headwinds. Whether that be labour inflation  energy price hikes  or supply chain disruptions  Burns is committed to finding companies that can still perform in this operating environment.""It's about making sure you are in businesses with pricing power. If costs are going up  they are able to push it on to the end customer. This leads to companies that may demonstrate market leading positions  or who have input cost components are actually really low.""An example of the type of company that exhibits this characteristic is market exchanges. In particular  she singles out Deutsche Boerse (ETR: DB1)  owner of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Eurex (derivatives exchange).Equities 4 companies with the pricing power to combat inflation ViewThe thesis behind this company includes its favourable cost structure and earnings momentum.While there are high initial fixed costs (for technology infrastructure)  once that is covered every incremental trade realises very high margins.Continued volatility in markets leads to more trading volume  a positive for the company as they take a clip on every trade.They benefit from the structural shift of more fixed income and derivatives trading moving from off-market to on-exchange transactions.Ability to take ownership over their prices  as opposed to being a price-taker.In terms of broader thematics  WAM Global has a focus on a number of globally imperative trends including the following two:Health & wellness: Focused on the 'picks and shovels' of this sector as opposed to taking bets on biotech trials and approvals. Favourite companies include Avantor (NYSE: AVTR) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO).Focused on the 'picks and shovels' of this sector as opposed to taking bets on biotech trials and approvals. Favourite companies include and Automation: Labour risk is a massive global issue at the moment  and businesses are trying to remove the pressure of such costs involved. Favourite companies include Zebra Technologies (NASDAQ: ZBRA) and Concentrics (Nasdaq: CNXC).The unique opportunities of WAM Alternative AssetsEducation Introduction to the WAM Alternative Assets Megatrends Series ViewThe Dania Zinurova-managed LIC came under the spotlight  given its unique investment approach and current discount to NTA. Trading at 87 cents on the dollar  Wilson believes it is one of the most interesting ""value"" opportunities on the market.WMA is currently the only LIC that provides retail investors with access to alternative assets on the market. This has led to Zinurova labelling it as the fund that ""democratises alternative investing.""Its mandate is quite broad  giving it an extensive investible universe to uncover value. It has current holdings across:Real estatePrivate equityInfrastructureReal assets (such as water rights  agriculture)The portfolio currently holds 26 investments  with contrasting risk-return characteristics that cover risk mitigation and income as well as capital appreciation.In terms of the future outlook  the portfolio is focused on understanding the macroeconomic environment  with an emphasis towards 4 themes:Ageing populationDigitisationIncreasing demand for foodClimateOver the coming 12 months  around 60% of the portfolio is set to mature. All exits to date have happened at ""over carrying value of the investments""  and Zinurova is expecting this to continue over the next 12 months. As for what comes next:""Thinking about reinvesting this (realised) capital  the current time is a really good period for alternative assets. The key is quality  and following our thematic trends.""Helping Future Generations with future market winnersThe webinar concluded with a discussion on Future Generation (ASX: FGG & ASX: FGX)  the Geoff Wilson founded LICs that combine the investment power of the industry's finest. This vehicle collects no management fees  instead donating 1% of NAV to charity each year. Les Nadine Lutherborrow  CEO of Youth Off The Streets  shared the impact of Future Generation's donations.Also featured on the panel was Jun Bei Liu  Portfolio Manager at Tribeca's Alpha Plus Fund. She shared her view on the market and 2 favourite stock picks.""A lot of investors in the market are short-term focused at the moment...Things do look a little bit tough  but we have gone through a tremendous amount of growth in the last couple of years because of stimulus.Despite all of the concerns around (you guessed it)  inflation  supply chains and reopenings  Liu believes we are almost at the bottom""A lot of the bad news in markets has been priced in. As an investor focused on the long term  this is an amazing opportunity to buy sold off companies. Our market outlook is very positive - we think the australian share market looks very good.As for what her favourite stock picks are at the moment? Amongst all of them  two local icons stand out:CSL (ASX: CSL): As one of Australia's biggest success stories  CSL continues to be a market leader in pharmaceuticals. It has sustained double-digit growth for decades  and this is showing no sign of slowing. In the current environment  there has been a lot of market nervousness and the resultant ""tunnel vision"" triggered a sell-off of 20-25% in January.But if you are looking for a company that will continue to grow earnings at double-digit percentages  regardless of the macroeconomic environment  then CSL could be a compelling opportunity at an incredibly cheap price.Xero (ASX: XRO): Another market leader  Xero's accounting software provides a wonderful platform with proven execution. They have managed to replicate their NZ success in Australia and Britain  becoming a dominant player in both these markets. They have recently expanded into the United States  and Liu is confident in its ability to continue its run of success.It is a business that will undoubtedly be larger in the next 5 years - you aren't buying today's earnings  Liu emphasies.""They have shown you they can replicate their business model in NZ  in Australia in the US - it could be global dominance!""",negative,0.08,0.09,0.83,mixed,0.27,0.14,0.59,True,English,"[""insane' valuations"", 'exciting opportunities', 'annual WAM Vault Live panel session', 'Future Generation Live View', 'high initial fixed costs', 'exciting new alternative assets', 'most finance presentations', 'Lead Portfolio Managers', 'Jun Bei Liu', 'favourite stock picks', 'New York office', 'input cost components', 'favourable cost structure', 'endless 0-COVID policies', 'energy price hikes', 'supply chain disruptions', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'market leading positions', 'Wilson Asset Management', 'Geoff Wilson AO', 'global equity markets', 'high margins', 'WAM Global', 'supply chains', 'share price', 'new opportunities', 'endless headwinds', 'derivatives exchange', 'Geez Geoff', 'global strategy', 'asset prices', 'firms founder', 'particular quip', 'central theme', 'trillion-dollar question', 'relative prosperity', 'past couple', 'different phase', 'difficult period', 'previous presentation', 'current dip', 'Dania Zinurova', 'upcoming year', 'mature capital', 'charitable endeavour', 'Matthew Haupt', 'Oscar Oberg', 'continual issues', 'Ukraine conflict', 'hot topic', 'ongoing period', 'enormous divergence', 'accommodative policy', 'free money', 'core driver', 'enormous escalation', 'house prices', 'insane valuations', 'recent exuberance', 'market-wide rerating', 'reasonable valuations', 'next 6 months', 'past 5 years', 'common theme', 'operating environment', 'pricing power', 'end customer', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'technology infrastructure', 'Continued volatility', 'trading volume', 'Exciting companies', 'interest rates', 'market crash', 'market exchanges', ""reset' opportunity"", '250 times earnings', 'earnings momentum', 'specific companies', 'Catriona Burns', 'perfect example', 'incremental trade', 'market reset', 'labour inflation', 'Equities 4 companies', 'chairman', 'scene', 'disclaimer', 'fact', 'views', 'minute', 'reversal', 'decades', 'investor', 'following', 'accusation', 'experience', 'case', 'scars', 'GFC', 'philosophy', 'strategies', 'prospect', 'horizon', 'wire', 'insight', 'Speakers', 'Funds', 'Messy', 'word', 'understatement', 'fragility', 'China', 'lowering', 'sectors', 'crypto', 'terms', 'basis', 'Snapchat', 'NASDAQ', 'company', 'focus', 'durability', 'emphasis', 'eyes', 'stock-picking', 'businesses', 'type', 'characteristic', 'ETR', 'DB', 'owner', 'Eurex', 'thesis', 'clip']",2022-05-30,2022-05-30,livewiremarkets.com

This important company milestone  highlighted in previously announced timelines  has now been completed. PXT3003 is the Company's lead program to treat CMT1A  a debilitating disease with currently no existing approved therapies.The PREMIER trial is an international  randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  pivotal Phase III study  where the primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 versus placebo in mild-to-moderate CMT1A patients  over a 15-month period. The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the high dose (‘HD') tested in the prior Phase III clinical study  the PLEO-CMT trial  and the ongoing open-label extension Phase III study  the PLEOCMT-FU trial. As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint will be the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') which measures functional motor disability. For more information on the PREMIER trial please refer to the ""About the PREMIER Trial"" paragraph below.Patient enrollment in the PREMIER trial took place in 52 centers across the US  Canada  Europe and Israel  with the final number of patients randomized exceeding the target of 350 patients defined in the protocol. Top line data are expected to be announced in Q4 2023.Dr. David Horn Solomon  Chief Executive Officer of Pharnext  commented: ""Completing enrollment of the Pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  represents a significant milestone for Pharnext and we are delighted that the study has completed enrollment on schedule across an international range of trial centers. It brings us one step closer to a potential treatment for those with CMT1A  a debilitating disease which affects around 1.5 million people globally.""Story continuesDr. Burkhard Blank  Chief Medical Officer at Pharnext commented: ""We are excited to complete the enrollment of our PREMIER trial in Q2 2022 as planned and look forward to reporting top line data  expected in Q4 2023. We are grateful to the patients and investigators participating in this trial. If approved  PXT3003 has the potential to help transform the lives of those who live with CMT1A.""About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (‘CMT1A')Charcot-Marie-Tooth (‘CMT') disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery.

The three individual components of PXT3003 were selected to downregulate the overexpression of PMP22 protein  leading to improvement of neuronal signaling in dysfunctional peripheral nerves that are an essential part of the pathophysiology of this disease. PXT3003 could also have a positive effect on other cellular types of the motor unit such as the axon (direct protection)  neuromuscular junctions or muscle cells. PXT3003 has shown promising and consistent results across preclinical and clinical studies in Phase II and Phase III (PLEO-CMT and PLEO-CMT-FU). More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/pipeline/pxt3003 .About the PREMIER TrialThe PREMIER trial is an international  randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  pivotal Phase III study  evaluating the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 versus placebo in mild-to-moderate CMT1A patients  over a 15-month period. The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the high dose (‘HD') tested in the prior Phase III trial (‘PLEO-CMT'). As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint will be the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') which measures functional motor disability. The secondary endpoints include the following outcome measures: 1) 10-Meter Walk Test (‘10mWT')  2) Quantified Muscular Testing (bilateral foot dorsiflexion dynamometry)  3) Patient Global Impression of Severity (‘PGI-S')  4) Patient Global Impression of Change (‘PGI-C')  5) Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score  version 2 (‘CMTNS-v2')  and 6) Quantified Muscular Testing (hand grip). Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Further information on the PREMIER trial can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (study identification number: NCT04762758) here .About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases that currently lack curative and/or disease-modifying treatments.

ADA started the day worth $0.4774; it was changing hands for $0.534 by midday ET.Every other top 10 digital asset was also in the green  at least for today. Ether (ETH) and rival avalanche (AVAX) were up 6% at press time while bitcoin (BTC) had added 4.5%  claiming $30 000 for the first time in a week.Dogecoin (DOGE) rose nearly 4% as Solana (SOL)  polkadot (DOT)  binance coin (BNB) and XRP clinched about 3%.On the other hand  dominance of leading stablecoins Tether and Circle’s USD Coin fell 4%. Bitcoin dominance stayed flat while ether’s increased by 1.6%.US markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq were indeed shuttered for the day but European benchmark indices improved alongside crypto.Germany’s DAX rose 0.8%; the Europe-wide Euronext 100 popped 0.7% while the FTSE 100 added 0.2%.Overall  crypto markets are now worth 4.5% more than on Sunday  having gained $53 billion  according to TradingView’s total crypto index  which currently prices all digital assets at nearly $1.26 trillion.That’s still 43% lower than crypto’s collective capitalization recorded at the start of the year  when digital assets were altogether valued at $2.19 trillion. It’s also 25% below crypto’s market value at the start of May.So  while today’s gains are surely welcome to crypto investors  not everything is rosy when zooming out.Just three of the top 10 cryptocurrencies – TRX  DOT and BTC – are positive over the past week  and all by less than 5%. AVAX and SOL have performed the worst  over the past week  throughout May and in 2022  having respectively shed 53% and 46% in the month-to-date and 75% since January 1.And despite today’s rallies across crypto  TRX is still the best performing top cryptocurrency in 2022. Not only is TRX up 30% in May while every other top 10 token is down  it’s also the only one to increase in price over the year-to-date  having added nearly 9%.All the other top 10 cryptocurrencies (again  excluding stablecoins  wrapped ether  and lido staked eth) have on average collapsed 48% so far in 2022.Get the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening.

The new contract  based on the ESG version of the French national benchmark index  provides institutional investors with an additional tool to contribute to the accelerating development of sustainable investment.Supported by BNP Paribas and Société Générale as market makers  firms that are strongly committed to the transition towards sustainable finance  the contract will enable market participants to manage and hedge ESG portfolios efficiently and in compliance with ESG principles  and to lower the cost of trading through the use of a futures contract.The new contract will facilitate the ongoing reallocation of assets from the CAC 40® index to its ESG version. Launched in March 2021  the CAC 40 ESG index gained immediate traction  as it represents a highly liquid solution for asset owners looking for cost-effective ways to integrate sustainable factors at the core of their investments. One year later  a quarter of the assets under management of the CAC 40 index have been transferred to the CAC 40 ESG index.The CAC 40 ESG index methodology  powered by Moody’s ESG Solutions data  combines Environmental  Social and Governance considerations with the French SRI label and the UN Global Compact principles  and excludes companies involved in coal  controversial weapons and tobacco activities.Stéphane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said: “After the strong success of the ESG version of the CAC 40 index  we are proud to provide investors today with a powerful tool to reallocate their investment flows towards sustainable finance  since they play a key role in making this transition of flows a reality. As the CAC 40 index future is the most traded index future on Euronext  we are opening a new avenue in the development of responsible finance by launching the ESG version of this blue-chip index futures contract”.Alexandre Benech  Global Head of flow trading at BNP Paribas Global Markets: “BNP Paribas supports the growth of ESG benchmarks as an important driver to increased transparency in this market  and as such will be a liquidity provider on the new CAC 40 ESG index future. BNP Paribas also provides liquidity on existing CAC ESG ETFs onto exchanges and for our clients”.Euronext is a leading ESG index provider  with ESG indices making up over 80% of all its indices.
