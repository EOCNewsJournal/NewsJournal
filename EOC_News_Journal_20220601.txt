The transaction process is described in more detail below.As a first step  the DSM shareholders will be given the opportunity to exchange their DSM shares for DSM-Firmenich shares through a public exchange offer (the ""Offer""). The consideration under the Offer will be one ordinary share in the capital of DSM-Firmenich for each tendered ordinary share in the capital of DSM. The terms and conditions of such an offer will be set out in an offer memorandum (such document  together with the listing prospectus  the ""Offering Circular"") which is expected to be published in the second half of 2022. Subject to regulatory approvals  the Offer will be extended only to eligible ordinary shareholders. Non-eligible shareholders will be US persons that do not qualify as an institutional buyer or qualified purchaser under US securities laws and/or that are not tax resident in the EU  the EEA  the overseas parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  or in a jurisdiction that has concluded a double tax treaty with the Netherlands that includes a dividend clause.Furthermore  DSM and Firmenich have agreed that if DSM-Firmenich  after settlement of the Offer  holds less than 95%  but at least 80% of the ordinary share capital of DSM  DSM-Firmenich may decide to implement a customary pre-wired back-end structure. This first step consists of a legal triangular merger involving DSM and two newly incorporated subsidiaries of DSM (""Company Holdco"" and ""Company Sub""). In this legal triangular merger  DSM (as disappearing company) merges with and into Company Sub (as acquiring company)  and Company Holdco issues shares to the shareholders of DSM. Subsequently Company Holdco sells its shares in Company Sub to DSM-Firmenich (the ""Share Sale"") for a consideration consisting of a note (the ""Note"") that gives the holder of the note the right to require DSM-Firmenich to deliver to it  on first demand  such number of DSM-Firmenich shares that is equal to the number of DSM ordinary shares held by DSM-Firmenich plus the DSM ordinary shares held by the non-tendering DSM shareholders (the ""Share Sale Consideration""). As a final step  Company Holdco is liquidated  and as soon as practicable after completion of the Share Sale  the liquidator will arrange for an (advance) liquidation distribution. For the non-tendering DSM shareholders the gross (advance) liquidation distribution will  subject to regulatory restrictions  consist of ordinary shares in the capital of DSM-Firmenich plus an amount in cash reflecting the amount of Dutch dividend withholding tax due in respect of the distribution and a cash payment in lieu of any fractional DSM-Firmenich ordinary shares. Company Holdco will receive such ordinary shares in the capital of DSM-Firmenich and cash through a settlement of part of the Note. Non-tendering DSM shareholders are advised that such distribution will be subject to a Dutch dividend withholding tax that will be deducted from the gross (advance) liquidation distribution. The (advance) liquidation distribution to DSM-Firmenich will consist of the (remaining part of) the Note (such merger  Share Sale and liquidation  together the ""Post-Closing Merger""). Further details of the Post-Closing Merger will be set out in the Offering Circular.Furthermore  if after settlement of the Offer  DSM-Firmenich holds at least 95% of the ordinary shares in the capital of DSM  DSM-Firmenich will commence a statutory buy-out procedure in accordance with Dutch law.After settlement of the shares tendered in the post-acceptance period of the Offer  the Firmenich shareholders will contribute 100% of the shares in the capital of Firmenich to DSM-Firmenich in exchange for DSM-Firmenich shares and ‚Ç¨3.5bn in cash (subject to potential adjustments) (the ""Contribution""). Immediately following completion of the Contribution  the various Firmenich shareholders would own in aggregate 34.5% of DSM-Firmenich's issued capital. Shareholders of Firmenich will be long-term  committed shareholders of DSM-Firmenich. With this in mind  DSM-Firmenich has entered into relationship agreements with different Firmenich shareholders setting out the conditions and mechanisms for nominating DSM-Firmenich's board members.The DSM-Firmenich shares will be admitted to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam on or shortly after the settlement of the Offer.2 Figures based on share price of ‚Ç¨145.65  174m DSM fully diluted share count. 3 As per broker SOTP value of Materials of ‚Ç¨4.7bn  and based on ‚Ç¨1.0bn Net Debt. 4 Reflects organic growth at constant currency. 5 Reflects organic growth at constant currency. 6 Pro-forma EBITDA includes the 12-month pro-forma impact of acquisitions that have been completed during FY22 with an acquisition spend of c.

This condition for completion of the Offer is thus met.Acceleration and acquisition of optionsThe completion of the Offer is also conditional upon that Aspire Global  prior to the end of the acceptance period in the Offer  resolves to accelerate the current incentive programs in Aspire Global  and that all outstanding options thereunder  as well as any other warrants/options issued by Aspire Global  are converted into new shares in Aspire Global resulting in the creation of not more than 828 094 new shares in Aspire Global. Aspire Global has resolved to accelerate unvested options which together with all other outstanding options in Aspire Global could be converted into not more than 809 264 new shares in Aspire Global.NeoGames has  with the approval by Aspire Global's independent bid committee  entered into option purchase agreements with 53 employees and consultants in Aspire Global who in aggregate held all outstanding options under Aspire Global's various incentive programs. The purchase agreements were subject to the Offer being declared unconditional. All of the options remain unexercised. The purchase price for the options corresponds to the value that the option holders had received should they have exercised the options and tendered the underlying shares in Aspire Global in the Offer (SEK 111.00 in cash or 0.320 shares in NeoGames in the form of Swedish depository receipts per share in Aspire Global in accordance with the Base Case Alternative and Mix & Match Facility  as defined in the offer announcement published by NeoGames on 17 January 2022; the ""Offer Announcement"").

Should the options acquired by NeoGames be exercised  NeoGames would together with the tendered shares control 46 664 516 shares in Aspire Global representing 98.27 percent of the shares and votes in Aspire Global on a fully diluted basis. Considering that the Offer has been accepted to such extent that NeoGames has become the owner of shares representing not less than 90 percent of the total number of outstanding shares in Aspire Global  the condition regarding a 90 percent minimum acceptance level has been fulfilled. Accordingly  and as all other conditions for completion are met  the Offer is declared unconditional in all respects and NeoGames will complete the acquisition of the shares in Aspire Global tendered in the Offer.Settlement Settlement of the shares in Aspire Global tendered in the Offer under the original acceptance period will commence on or about 14 June 2022  to allow for simultaneous settlement against cash and/or newly issued shares in NeoGames in the form of Swedish depository receipts. Squeeze-out and delisting NeoGames will initiate compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares in Aspire Global and propose that Aspire Global's board of directors applies for delisting of Aspire Global's shares from Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market. Extension of the acceptance period In order to provide the remaining shareholders in Aspire Global the opportunity to accept the Offer  NeoGames has decided to extend the acceptance period of the Offer until and including 14 June 2022 at 5.00 p.m. (CEST). Shareholders in Aspire Global accepting the Offer during the extension of the acceptance period will receive the Base Case Alternative  as defined in the Offer Announcement  consisting of 50 percent cash and 50 percent NeoGames shares in the form of Swedish depository receipts.

""So this is good that we now de-SWIFT Sberbank.""The latest array of sanctions included plans for a completewhen it was proposed this month along with the SWIFT ban for Sberbank  possibly showing that the council had pushed for the measures to be weakened while the energy crisis hangs over Europe.The oil ban was imposed after weeks of debate over the economic backlash that would result from turning off the taps of an important EU oil source. The ban should be implemented by the end of the year. The SWIFT ban for Sberbank will also be included in the sixth sanctions package.""This is an important step forward "" von der Leyen said. ""We will soon return to the issue of the remaining 10% of pipeline oil.""Sberbank said in response that the SWIFT ban does not change its situation in international settlements and does not affect its domestic finances.""We are working as normal ‚Äî the major restrictions are already in place "" the bank said in a statement in Russian. ""Our intra-Russian operations do not depend on SWIFT and will be carried out by the bank as standard.""The sixth EU sanctions package also shuts out Russian companies from ""a whole range of business services."" This measure follows an announcement at the start of the month by the U.K. government that it would completelyfrom using a large part of the country's professional services industry  including accounting  auditing and public relations.The EU has already shut outfrom SWIFT  acting in March to send a ""very clear signal to Putin and the Kremlin."" SWIFT is particularly important in Europe  by far Russia's largest trading partner  where it is the message provider for systemically important payment systems such as Euroclear PLC and Clearstream.SWIFT  the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication   is a Belgian-based financial messaging network that allows banks to make rapid cross-border payments for financial transactions and trade financing.Europe has moved quickly to intensify sanctions against the Kremlin since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The bloc has proposed plans to standardize criminal law on violating sanctions in Europe so that states mete outfor breaches.EU regulators have also introduced new guidance for companies suddenly caught holding  including allowing investment funds to segregate Russian investments into ""side pockets"" so they can restart their business without violating sanctions.--Additional reporting by Joel Poultney and Najiyya Budaly.

Prokhorov also intends to close the London office and other hubs such as Johannesburg as well. A dozen people will be sacked in New York and some 60 people fired in London  according to people familiar with the decision who asked not to be identified. Only a skeleton crew will be left in London to winddown operations there.Regardless of which scenario is underway  other sources told bne IntelliNews that managers are working on a new ownership structure  which will see the closure of existing holdings and the potential opening of new companies in London  New York and Africa.‚ÄúThe Moscow team are desperately trying to arrange an MBO so they can keep the structure intact ‚Äù a source close to the firm told bne IntelliNews. ‚ÄúProkhorov is 100% out and has given all the management teams a few days to find either a buyer or a backer ‚Äì after which he pulls all life support.‚ÄùEven as negotiations moved towards the deadline  Rencap emailed its clients announcing it had terminated analyst coverage in all of its sectors and all its geographies  from Russia to Rwanda and from the United Arab Emirates to Uganda.One senior RenCap banker told bne IntelliNews: ""We all got fired. If there's a new structure  they can knock on my door like everyone else.""A Rencap spokeswoman in Moscow declined to immediately comment. A spokesman for Prokhorov‚Äôs Onexim vehicle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Times of Israel reported on April 4 that Prokhorov had emigrated to Israel and received citizenship. Prokhorov‚Äôs maternal grandmother  Anna Belkina  a prominent Russian microbiologist  was Jewish  making him eligible for Israeli citizenship.Prokhorov  who is listed by Bloomberg as Russia‚Äôs 12th richest individual  with a net worth of $13.8bn  has distanced himself from the Kremlin over the last decade since running against Vladimir Putin for the Russian presidency as a proxy opposition candidate in 2012.Prokhorov has not been sanctioned by the US  EU or UK in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine  nor has he expressed any public opposition to the war. Some of his oligarch contemporaries  notably Mikhail Fridman of Alfa Group and Rusal‚Äôs Oleg Deripaska  have publicly come out against the invasion.Dubbed the ""Great Gatsby oligarch"" in a bne IntelliNews profile  Prokhorov fell foul of Putin following a series of investigative reports by his RBC media holding into individuals close to the Kremlin.One source at Rencap insisted the bank was just undergoing ""a restructuring"" and is still operating as normal and was even running a client event in Moscow today. Staff still hope to retain their jobs in a potential reboot of the business  but any new owners may take a different view.Rencap has survived many crises in the past  but the market is in unprecedented territory since the Kremlin made Russia into an investment pariah by invading Ukraine.Mergers and bond sales have completely disappeared  while investment bankers say it may be decades before we see another Russian initial public offering (IPO). Many of the remaining financiers in the city are busy trying to wind down investment positions or offload loan books  but it is proving difficult due to the lack of buyers and the fact that the country‚Äôs financial plumbing has been disabled. Crippling sanctions against the Central Bank  capital controls and exclusion from the SWIFT payment system have combined to put much of the financial system into a deep freeze.If Rencap survives in some form  it may have a future as a niche player offering a window into Russia via investment grey schemes. Unlike the state-controlled lenders Sberbank and VTB  Rencap has so far been untouched by sanctions.The bank has already suffered from big changes in the market. Rencap made its money in the 1990s and early noughties by acting as an intermediary for international investors that wanted exposure to the Russian market  but after Russia‚Äôs capital markets were hooked up to the international system when it joined the Clearstream settlements and payments system  that business disappeared.In what turned into Rencap‚Äôs last big investment conference then-CEO Stephen Jennings said that the market had become shaped like a ‚Äúbarbell‚Äù. Sberbank CIB and VTB Capital (VTBC)  the investment arms of Russia‚Äôs two biggest state-owned banks  and niche players would form the two sets of weights at each end of the barbell. Jennings had assumed that Rencap was at the bulbous end of the barbell  but actually the bank was in the middle and its business rapidly atrophied.Rencap is the most legendary investment bank in Moscow. In its heyday  the firm paid the biggest salaries and the biggest bonuses and held the best investor conferences and the wildest parties.It was set up in the 1990s by two young  Western pioneering investment bankers Boris Jordan and Stephen Jennings.Jordan  an American scion of Czarist Russians  and New Zealander Jennings arrived in Moscow with Credit Suisse First Boston and made their name by persuading their bank to buy privatisation vouchers. These were later converted into shares in some of Russia's biggest companies and the bank made a $100mn profit on the deals  a third of its global total for that year. Jordan and Jennings took their bonuses  hired a room in the Penta hotel (now appropriately renamed the Renaissance Moscow Olympic Hotel) and set up the bank.The pair quickly hooked up with Vladimir Potanin  owner of Norilsk Nickel  who funded their expansion and through him they met Prokhorov  who was the manager at the metal mine at the time.The idea was to create a ""Russian bank with a western face"" that could bring capital in from outside by speaking the language of international finance  but thanks to its boots on the ground could ensure international investors were not ripped off in the rough and tumble of Russia in the 1990s. That included the launch of the highly successful Sputnik Funds at this time ‚Äì among the very first Russia-dedicated investment vehicles to target international investors.Rencap shot to stardom. The bank's annual conference became a classic fixture on the calendar  held in those days in the Grecian Moscow Chamber of Commerce and Industry building just off Red Square where Stalin was laid in state in the first days after his death. It is a relatively small building and investors  oligarchs and journalists were packed shoulder to shoulder to listen to the likes of German Gref and Anatoly Chubais talk about reform and Russia's future.One of the most memorable was held in 2000 just after President Vladimir Putin came to power  where oligarch Boris Berezovsky spoke and was harangued by investors who accused him of stealing their money. Media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky was also due to speak  but he was already fighting Putin and in the middle of the event the news broke that Gusinsky had fled the country  never to return. Berezovsky was gone a few weeks later.The bank was also a key broker in the privatisation of a 25%-1 share stake in Russia's fixed-line operator Svyazinvest for over $1bn  working with international financier George Soros ‚Äì a deal that went sour and ended up as ""the worst deal of my life "" according to Soros.Rencap only just survived the 1998 crisis. Jordan left  taking the Sputnik Funds with him to concentrate on things like insurance  selling his stake to Jennings  who became the majority owner.In 2000  the economy started booming. The economy grew by 10% in that year alone ‚Äì a record yet to be bettered ‚Äì and by 2005 Russia was in a full-blooded boom. As the specialist broker focused on international investors  Rencap was making money hand over fist.Jennings re-engineered the bank as a leading player  first in Russia  but rapidly moving into the other markets of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). He also made the bank respectable  putting aside its cowboy image that some had associated with the bank under Jordan‚Äôs tenure. His aspiration was to create a ‚ÄúGoldman Sachs of Emerging Markets.‚ÄùBetween 2005 and 2008  big offices were opened in Ukraine  Kazakhstan and a Hong Kong office added in 2010 as the bank spread its wings as far as Mongolia. Jennings also astutely bought a retail operation  Renaissance Credit  right at the beginning of the consumer-lending boom  which today is one of the three biggest retail lenders in the country.But the biggest gamble was to branch out into Africa in 2006. Jennings told me at the time: ""It is the last untouched emerging market. It looks a lot like Russia: a huge country with plentiful natural resources  but with all the problems that Russia had in the 1990s. We know how to do this sort of business."" It was a ballsy move  but one that has since paid dividends  as Africa now accounts for a quarter of the bank's bottom line.Jennings was on a roll. The bank launched a series of adverts on CNN describing itself as the leading emerging market investment bank that didn't mention the world ""Russia"" once.Jennings told me that he turned down several offers from Russian banks  including one from state-controlled VTB to buy Rencap out at the top of the market for a reported $4bn.Russia's second big crisis in 2008 nearly broke the bank again. The African adventure was a good idea  but the bank was spread very thin as a result. As the economy went into meltdown  legal counsel Stephen Konigsberg was on the phone trying to stave off another disaster.Jennings eventually caved into the inevitable and agreed to sell a 49% stake to Prokhorov to stave off collapse. ""It had to be done  and the bank is back in business "" a Rencap vice president told me in the following days  ""but the dream of becoming an international emerging markets investment bank is over. Now we are only an investment bank that wants to make a lot of money for its shareholders.""In November 2012  the Kiwi Oligarch was ousted after his billionaire partner Prokhorov rebuffed his requests for more cash for the operation  which was bleeding money  and threatened to withdraw millions he held on deposit with the bank that could have caused it to collapse.Legend has it that Jennings lost the keys to the business after a showdown meeting with Prokhorov and Suleiman Kerimov  another tycoon who had substantial funds on account at Rencap. Jennings requested more funds to cover the firm's losses and the tycoons turned on him  demanding he hand over his 50% stake plus one share.Rencap sources say Jennings  then 52  faked a heart attack to escape. An ambulance arrived and the driver was handsomely paid to divert to Sheremetyevo Airport so Jennings could escape to London. He hasn't been back since.Neither Prokhorov  Kerimov nor Jennings have ever spoken about what went down. Jennings eventually signed the papers  surrendering control of the investment bank and the consumer lender RenCredit to Prokhorov while retaining ownership of the group's African assets.Even before the invasion  Prokhorov has sought to exit the business and reportedly held protracted negotiations with the Chinese conglomerate Fosun about a potential sale in 2016.Meanwhile  his former business partner Potanin has been acquiring banks on the cheap.

5791,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/VTB-BANK-PUBLIC-JOINT-ST-6499155/news/RenCap-New-York-office-may-face-closure-amidst-an-eleventh-hour-MBO-bid-40596067/,RenCap New York office may face closure amidst an eleventh-hour MBO bid,1 day ago,"Renaissance Capital   the Moscow -based investment bank controlled by billionaire oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov   may close unless an eleventh-hour deal can be struck by managers to buy out the business  bne IntelliNews can reveal.Sources close to Rencap  as it is known  said Prokhorov had set a deadline of this week for its closure if a management buyout (MBO) does not succeed.A second source at Rencap told bne IntelliNews that the bank is actually restructuring and that it does not face immediate closure but intends to remake its ownership structure entirely  and some offices will be closed.bne IntelliNews sources said that the New York office will be closed and several employees have already left the company  as confirmed in comments to bne IntelliNews by staffers. Prokhorov also intends to close the London office and other hubs such as Johannesburg as well. A dozen people will be sacked in New York and some 60 people fired in London   according to people familiar with the decision who asked not to be identified. Only a skeleton crew will be left in London to winddown operations there.Regardless of which scenario is underway  other sources told bne IntelliNews that managers are working on a new ownership structure  which will see the closure of existing holdings and the potential opening of new companies in London   New York and Africa .‚ÄúThe Moscow team are desperately trying to arrange an MBO so they can keep the structure intact ‚Äù a source close to the firm told bne IntelliNews. ‚ÄúProkhorov is 100% out and has given all the management teams a few days to find either a buyer or a backer ‚Äì after which he pulls all life support.‚ÄùEven as negotiations moved towards the deadline  Rencap emailed its clients announcing it had terminated analyst coverage in all of its sectors and all its geographies  from Russia to Rwanda and from the United Arab Emirates to Uganda .One senior RenCap banker told bne IntelliNews: ""We all got fired. If there's a new structure  they can knock on my door like everyone else.""A Rencap spokeswoman in Moscow declined to immediately comment. A spokesman for Prokhorov‚Äôs Onexim vehicle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Times of Israel reported on April 4 that Prokhorov had emigrated to Israel and received citizenship. Prokhorov‚Äôs maternal grandmother  Anna Belkina   a prominent Russian microbiologist  was Jewish  making him eligible for Israeli citizenship.Prokhorov  who is listed by Bloomberg as Russia‚Äôs 12th richest individual  with a net worth of $13.8bn   has distanced himself from the Kremlin over the last decade since running against Vladimir Putin for the Russian presidency as a proxy opposition candidate in 2012.Prokhorov has not been sanctioned by the US  EU or UK in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine   nor has he expressed any public opposition to the war. Some of his oligarch contemporaries  notably Mikhail Fridman of Alfa Group and Rusal‚Äôs Oleg Deripaska   have publicly come out against the invasion.Dubbed the ""Great Gatsby oligarch"" in a bne IntelliNews profile  Prokhorov fell foul of Putin following a series of investigative reports by his RBC media holding into individuals close to the Kremlin.One source at Rencap insisted the bank was just undergoing ""a restructuring"" and is still operating as normal and was even running a client event in Moscow today. Staff still hope to retain their jobs in a potential reboot of the business  but any new owners may take a different view.Rencap has survived many crises in the past  but the market is in unprecedented territory since the Kremlin made Russia into an investment pariah by invading Ukraine .Mergers and bond sales have completely disappeared  while investment bankers say it may be decades before we see another Russian initial public offering (IPO). Many of the remaining financiers in the city are busy trying to wind down investment positions or offload loan books  but it is proving difficult due to the lack of buyers and the fact that the country‚Äôs financial plumbing has been disabled. Crippling sanctions against the Central Bank   capital controls and exclusion from the SWIFT payment system have combined to put much of the financial system into a deep freeze.If Rencap survives in some form  it may have a future as a niche player offering a window into Russia via investment grey schemes. Unlike the state-controlled lenders Sberbank and VTB   Rencap has so far been untouched by sanctions.The bank has already suffered from big changes in the market. Rencap made its money in the 1990s and early noughties by acting as an intermediary for international investors that wanted exposure to the Russian market  but after Russia‚Äôs capital markets were hooked up to the international system when it joined the Clearstream settlements and payments system  that business disappeared.In what turned into Rencap‚Äôs last big investment conference then-CEO Stephen Jennings said that the market had become shaped like a ‚Äúbarbell‚Äù. Sberbank CIB and VTB Capital (VTBC)  the investment arms of Russia‚Äôs two biggest state-owned banks  and niche players would form the two sets of weights at each end of the barbell. Jennings had assumed that Rencap was at the bulbous end of the barbell  but actually the bank was in the middle and its business rapidly atrophied.Rencap is the most legendary investment bank in Moscow . In its heyday  the firm paid the biggest salaries and the biggest bonuses and held the best investor conferences and the wildest parties.It was set up in the 1990s by two young  Western pioneering investment bankers Boris Jordan and Stephen Jennings .Jordan  an American scion of Czarist Russians  and New Zealander Jennings arrived in Moscow with Credit Suisse First Boston and made their name by persuading their bank to buy privatisation vouchers. These were later converted into shares in some of Russia's biggest companies and the bank made a $100mn profit on the deals  a third of its global total for that year. Jordan and Jennings took their bonuses  hired a room in the Penta hotel (now appropriately renamed the Renaissance Moscow Olympic Hotel ) and set up the bank.The pair quickly hooked up with Vladimir Potanin   owner of Norilsk Nickel   who funded their expansion and through him they met Prokhorov  who was the manager at the metal mine at the time.The idea was to create a ""Russian bank with a western face"" that could bring capital in from outside by speaking the language of international finance  but thanks to its boots on the ground could ensure international investors were not ripped off in the rough and tumble of Russia in the 1990s. That included the launch of the highly successful Sputnik Funds at this time ‚Äì among the very first Russia -dedicated investment vehicles to target international investors.Rencap shot to stardom. The bank's annual conference became a classic fixture on the calendar  held in those days in the Grecian Moscow Chamber of Commerce and Industry building just off Red Square where Stalin was laid in state in the first days after his death. It is a relatively small building and investors  oligarchs and journalists were packed shoulder to shoulder to listen to the likes of German Gref and Anatoly Chubais talk about reform and Russia's future.One of the most memorable was held in 2000 just after President Vladimir Putin came to power  where oligarch Boris Berezovsky spoke and was harangued by investors who accused him of stealing their money. Media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky was also due to speak  but he was already fighting Putin and in the middle of the event the news broke that Gusinsky had fled the country  never to return. Berezovsky was gone a few weeks later.The bank was also a key broker in the privatisation of a 25%-1 share stake in Russia's fixed-line operator Svyazinvest for over $1bn   working with international financier George Soros ‚Äì a deal that went sour and ended up as ""the worst deal of my life "" according to Soros.Rencap only just survived the 1998 crisis. Jordan left  taking the Sputnik Funds with him to concentrate on things like insurance  selling his stake to Jennings  who became the majority owner.In 2000  the economy started booming. The economy grew by 10% in that year alone ‚Äì a record yet to be bettered ‚Äì and by 2005 Russia was in a full-blooded boom. As the specialist broker focused on international investors  Rencap was making money hand over fist.Jennings re-engineered the bank as a leading player  first in Russia   but rapidly moving into the other markets of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). He also made the bank respectable  putting aside its cowboy image that some had associated with the bank under Jordan‚Äôs tenure. His aspiration was to create a ‚ÄúGoldman Sachs of Emerging Markets.‚ÄùBetween 2005 and 2008  big offices were opened in Ukraine   Kazakhstan and a Hong Kong office added in 2010 as the bank spread its wings as far as Mongolia . Jennings also astutely bought a retail operation  Renaissance Credit  right at the beginning of the consumer-lending boom  which today is one of the three biggest retail lenders in the country.But the biggest gamble was to branch out into Africa in 2006. Jennings told me at the time: ""It is the last untouched emerging market. It looks a lot like Russia : a huge country with plentiful natural resources  but with all the problems that Russia had in the 1990s. We know how to do this sort of business."" It was a ballsy move  but one that has since paid dividends  as Africa now accounts for a quarter of the bank's bottom line.Jennings was on a roll. The bank launched a series of adverts on CNN describing itself as the leading emerging market investment bank that didn't mention the world ""Russia"" once.Jennings told me that he turned down several offers from Russian banks  including one from state-controlled VTB to buy Rencap out at the top of the market for a reported $4bn .Russia's second big crisis in 2008 nearly broke the bank again. The African adventure was a good idea  but the bank was spread very thin as a result. As the economy went into meltdown  legal counsel Stephen Konigsberg was on the phone trying to stave off another disaster.Jennings eventually caved into the inevitable and agreed to sell a 49% stake to Prokhorov to stave off collapse. ""It had to be done  and the bank is back in business "" a Rencap vice president told me in the following days  ""but the dream of becoming an international emerging markets investment bank is over. Now we are only an investment bank that wants to make a lot of money for its shareholders.""In November 2012   the Kiwi Oligarch was ousted after his billionaire partner Prokhorov rebuffed his requests for more cash for the operation  which was bleeding money  and threatened to withdraw millions he held on deposit with the bank that could have caused it to collapse.Legend has it that Jennings lost the keys to the business after a showdown meeting with Prokhorov and Suleiman Kerimov   another tycoon who had substantial funds on account at Rencap. Jennings requested more funds to cover the firm's losses and the tycoons turned on him  demanding he hand over his 50% stake plus one share.Rencap sources say Jennings  then 52  faked a heart attack to escape. An ambulance arrived and the driver was handsomely paid to divert to Sheremetyevo Airport so Jennings could escape to London . He hasn't been back since.Neither Prokhorov  Kerimov nor Jennings have ever spoken about what went down. Jennings eventually signed the papers  surrendering control of the investment bank and the consumer lender RenCredit to Prokhorov while retaining ownership of the group's African assets.Even before the invasion  Prokhorov has sought to exit the business and reportedly held protracted negotiations with the Chinese conglomerate Fosun about a potential sale in 2016.Meanwhile  his former business partner Potanin has been acquiring banks on the cheap. His Interros group bought Rosbank after Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale  a French lender that bought the business from Potanin in 2008  opted for a quick exit from Russia . Potanin also snapped Oleg Tinkov's stake in Tinkoff Bank after the banker was forced to sell following his criticism of the war.""It would be a bitter pill for Prokhorov if Potanin ended up taking Rencap too or whatever is left of it "" said a former banker.

The transfer to the Euronext Growth market in Paris would simplify the company's operations and reduce its listing costs  while allowing it to continue to benefit from the advantages of a listing on a financial market.Transfer requirementsThe proposed transfer must be approved by the company's shareholders at a combined general meeting to be held on June 30  2022  on first notice. The approval of the market operator Euronext is also required prior to the delisting of Egide's shares from the regulated market of Euronext Paris and their listing on the Euronext Growth market in Paris.Egide meets the eligibility requirements for such a transfer to Euronext Growth  which include a market capitalization of less than ‚Ç¨1 billion and a free float of over ‚Ç¨2.5 million.Terms of transferThis listing by direct admission on Euronext Growth in Paris will be carried out through an accelerated procedure of direct admission to trading of Egide's existing shares  which will cease to be listed on Euronext Paris at the same time. No new shares will be issued on this transfer.Egide will be supported in its planned transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris by Atout Capital  as Listing Sponsor.Consequences of the transferIn accordance with the regulations  the company wishes to inform its shareholders of some of the possible consequences of such a transfer.Story continuesIn terms of periodic financial information:the annual accounts (corporate and consolidated)  the management report and the auditors' reports on these accounts would be published no later than four months after the end of the financial year.From the 2023 financial year onwards  the half-yearly report  including the half-yearly financial statements and the activity report  would be published within 4 months after the end of the half-year (instead of the 3-month period in force on Euronext) and would no longer be subject to a limited review by the statutory auditors.Egide has a free choice of accounting standards (French standards or IFRS) for the preparation of its consolidated accounts. Nevertheless  Egide has decided to continue to prepare its accounts in accordance with IFRS.Ongoing information:As Euronext Growth is an organized multilateral trading facility  Egide would remain subject to the applicable provisions on ongoing market disclosure and more particularly to the provisions of the European Market Abuse Regulation (EU No. 596/2014 of 16 April 2014  known as the ""MAR Regulation"").Egide's managers (and related persons) would continue to be subject to the obligation to report transactions in the company's shares and debt securities.In terms of protection of minority shareholders:Egide would remain subject  for a period of three years from the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris  to the regime of mandatory public offers and to the maintenance of disclosure requirements relating to the crossing of thresholds as applicable to companies listed on Euronext.Beyond this three-year period  the mandatory public offer mechanism would apply  unless an exception is made  if a shareholder  directly or indirectly  alone or in concert  crosses the threshold of 50% of the capital or voting rights. The thresholds for notifying the crossing of thresholds would then also be limited to the crossing of 50% and 95%.The company draws attention to the fact that the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris could result in a different trend in the liquidity of the share than that observed on the regulated market of Euronext.Beyond this  Egide would ensure that it maintains the quality of the relationships it has always sought to establish with its shareholders and investors.Provisional timetable for the transfer (subject to approval by Euronext Paris)May 2  2022: Decision of the Board of Directors to submit to the Annual General Meeting the proposed transfer to Euronext Growth Paris.June 1st  2022: Public information on the proposed transfer of listing on Euronext Growth Paris (1st press release).June 30  2022: Ordinary General Meeting of Egide and holding of the Board of Directors to implement the transfer of the shares to Euronext Growth. In the event of a favorable vote by the Board of Directors  immediate information to the public on the final decision to transfer the shares (2nd press release). Application to delist the shares from Euronext Paris and application for their direct listing on Euronext Growth Paris.No earlier thanAugust 30  2022: Effective transfer: delisting of the shares from Euronext Paris and listing on Euronext Growth Paris.The mnemonic code of Egide's shares (GID) would be modified on the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris. The ISIN code (FR0000072373) would remain unchanged.In addition  Egide shares will remain eligible for PEA and PEA-PME after the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris.About Egide - www.egide-group.comEgide is a group with an international dimension. specialized in the manufacture of hermetic packages and heat dissipation solutions for sensitive electronic components.

This aims to support the circular economy  promote outdoor advertising as a catalyst for ecological and social transition and work towards the decarbonisation of the economy and society. This aligns with the French National Low-Carbon Strategy  through the Climate & Resilience law provisions for more sustainable public procurement  the Green Pact for Europe and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).Since 1964  JCDecaux has championed a virtuous model to design  install and maintain infrastructure (bus shelters  self-cleaning public toilets  self-service bicycles  etc.) in public spaces and transport areas. These valuable and innovative services are financed by brand advertising. In line with the company‚Äôs goal to sustainably improve the quality of life for people wherever they live  work and travel - JCDecaux places social requirements and environmental quality at the heart of its business solutions.This extended commitment by JCDecaux in favour of the environment and the public interest realises its full potential  at a time when throughout the world  new public orders based around sustainability are accelerators of the ecological transition and our economic recovery.Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer of JCDecaux  said: ‚ÄúThe recognition of our sustainable development approach by extra-financial rating agencies are proof-points of the excellence of our environmental  social and governance practices with JCDecaux included in the Carbon Disclosure Project's (CDP) ""A List"" and achieving a ""Gold"" rating from EcoVadis. This underscores the importance that we place upon transparency for all our stakeholders.‚ÄùStory continuesJean-Fran√ßois Decaux  Co-Chief Executive Officer of JCDecaux  said: ‚ÄúESG is part of our DNA and is shown through everything we do. Almost 40% of our revenue is eligible under the European Union's Green Taxonomy  which classifies activities according to their contribution to the ecological transition and this reaches 55% if we take into account our activities in Public transport  which though not eligible  nevertheless contributes to the ecological transition.‚ÄùThree goals for a new strategic ESG 2030 roadmapThe new ESG 2030 strategic roadmap is based on the materiality analysis that began in 2013  the definition of our strategic priorities in 2014 and the prioritisation of the expectations of our stakeholders.1. Towards more sustainable living spacesSustainable development is a key factor in driving the Group‚Äôs innovation and competitiveness as shown by the range of public utility furniture and services developed since our earliest days. Our teams are committed to promoting low-impact products and solutions across their lifecycle  embedding eco-design throughout our business. A tool for measuring the environmental footprint of sustainable innovation is underway and will be unveiled by 2025.With a highly visible presence in public spaces  JCDecaux Media practices and promotes responsible outdoor advertising. With a daily audience of more than 850 million people worldwide  the Group sets the highest standards in Out-of-Home media to promote and display responsible advertising campaigns. We will implement a Code of Ethics for Out-Of-Home display in 100% of the countries where we operate by the end of 2022  safeguard our digital furniture and facilitate public interest communication serving the United Nations' 2030 Agenda.2. Towards an optimised environmental footprintLike France  with its contribution to carbon neutrality for all its activities from end-2021  JCDecaux is rolling out an ambitious climate strategy aligned with the Paris Agreement for all the Group‚Äôs activities  enabling action on our entire emissions‚Äô scope from 2023. As part of this approach  100% of the Group's electricity consumption will be covered by green electricity by the end of 2022. As our digital transformation increases and our media continues to grow  the Group pledges to reduce by 5% its carbon emissions relating to the electricity consumption of its furniture in absolute value by 2030 (vs. 2019) and by 10% based on consumption per advertising m¬≤ by 2030 (vs. 2019).JCDecaux pledges to curb its other environmental impacts through targeted actions in the areas of waste management  water consumption and protection of biodiversity. As JCDecaux street furniture and vehicles are cleaned using rainwater and our ongoing maintenance extends their lifespan  the Group is committed to zero landfill for all waste generated in countries with appropriate facilities by 2035. Reuse  recycling and even incineration with or without energy recovery will be prioritised.3. Towards a responsible business environmentAs a family-owned company  JCDecaux's priority is to be a responsible employer. We respect fundamental social values  provide an exemplary health and safety culture and promote employee development  diversity and inclusion. The Group aims  more specifically  to reduce the accident frequency rate by 25% by 2030 (vs. 2019). JCDecaux is also committed to having 40% female representation on its executive management committees by 2027 (vs. 33% in 2021). Reaching these targets will involve assisting the Group‚Äôs suppliers to implement even more responsible practices. The Group intends to pursue exemplary business practices  through the continued application of its ethical charter defined in 2001. This will help fight against corruption  improve the environmental and social footprint of its suppliers and strengthen personal data protection. From 2023  30% of sustainable development criteria will be integrated into supplier qualification and evaluation policies. By 2025  100% of JCDecaux's European subsidiaries will be assessed on the management and use of personal data.The ESG 2030 strategy in actionShared with internal teams through a ESG communications plan  the strategy will be monitored and guaranteed by sponsors via an annual commitment plan in all relevant company business units. To reinforce this ESG strategy everywhere we operate  the share of ESG criteria in the variable remuneration of members of the Executive Board and operational managers  introduced in 2017  will be increased from 10% to 15% in 2022. The support of JCDecaux's external stakeholders is at the heart of this strategic ambition  to create ever more sustainable and inclusive places to live.Jean-Charles Decaux and Jean-Fran√ßois Decaux  Co-Chief Executive Officers of JCDecaux  said: ‚ÄúJCDecaux's strategic ESG roadmap towards 2030 is an inspirational model that combines economic performance  environmental and social responsibility  ethical business conduct and employee development. JCDecaux works with its various stakeholders and is committed to supporting those involved in public and private procurement so that this can become a powerful and effective impact for sustainable development.‚ÄùKey Figures for JCDecaux2021 revenue: ‚Ç¨2 745m (a)N¬∞1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of more than 850 million people in more than 80 countries957 706 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 518 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants10 720 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (4.2/5)  CDP (A Leadership)  MSCI (AAA) and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100 (committed to 100% renewable energy)Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN¬∞1 worldwide in street furniture (530 143 advertising panels)N¬∞1 worldwide in transport advertising with 154 airports and 215 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (340 753 advertising panels)N¬∞1 in Europe for billboards (72 611 advertising panels)N¬∞1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (596 831 advertising panels)N¬∞1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (232 268 advertising panels)N¬∞1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (64 893 advertising panels)N¬∞1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (20 808 advertising panels)N¬∞1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (14 177 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   Linkedin   Facebook   Instagram and Youtube .Communications Department: Albert Ass√©raf+33 (0) 1 30 79 35 68 ‚Äì albert.asseraf@jcdecaux.comInvestor Relations: R√©mi Grisard+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 93 ‚Äì remi.grisard@jcdecaux.comAttachment",neutral,0.04,0.95,0.02,positive,0.56,0.37,0.06,True,English,"['new strategic CSR roadmap', 'JCDecaux', ""United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals"", 'French National Low-Carbon Strategy', 'new strategic ESG roadmap', 'new strategic ESG 2030 roadmap', 'new ESG 2030 strategic roadmap', 'one outdoor advertising company', ""United Nations' 2030 Agenda"", 'new public orders', 'next eight years', 'Resilience law provisions', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'sustainable public procurement', 'self-cleaning public toilets', 'extra-financial rating agencies', 'Jean-Fran√ßois Decaux', 'entire emissions‚Äô scope', 'digital transformation increases', 'sustainable development approach', 'Carbon Disclosure Project', 'sustainable living spaces', 'responsible outdoor advertising', 'responsible advertising campaigns', 'other environmental impacts', 'public interest communication', 'ambitious climate strategy', 'public utility furniture', 'world Environment Day', 'responsible business environment', 'JCDecaux street furniture', 'ESG strategy', 'Three goals', 'strategic priorities', 'public spaces', 'carbon emissions', 'digital furniture', 'responsible employer', 'Executive Board', 'Public transport', 'brand advertising', 'Jean-Charles Decaux', 'Gold"" rating', 'sustainable innovation', 'carbon neutrality', 'family-owned company', 'environmental, social', 'environmental footprint', 'social transition', 'Green Pact', 'virtuous model', 'bus shelters', 'self-service bicycles', 'social requirements', 'extended commitment', 'full potential', 'economic recovery', 'governance practices', 'European Union', 'Green Taxonomy', 'materiality analysis', 'key factor', 'earliest days', 'low-impact products', 'visible presence', 'daily audience', 'highest standards', 'green electricity', 'absolute value', 'targeted actions', 'ongoing maintenance', 'zero landfill', 'appropriate facilities', 'energy recovery', 'ecological transition', 'electricity consumption', 'water consumption', 'environmental quality', 'Euronext Paris', 'Paris Agreement', 'circular economy', 'transport areas', 'innovative services', 'business solutions', '850 million people', 'waste management', 'JCDecaux SA', 'Home media', 'JCDecaux Media', '31 May', 'number', 'catalyst', 'decarbonisation', 'society', 'SDG', 'infrastructure', 'valuable', 'line', 'life', 'heart', 'favour', 'time', 'sustainability', 'accelerators', 'Chairman', 'recognition', 'points', 'excellence', 'EcoVadis', 'importance', 'transparency', 'stakeholders', 'Story', 'part', 'DNA', 'everything', 'revenue', 'activities', 'contribution', 'account', 'definition', 'prioritisation', 'expectations', 'Group', 'competitiveness', 'range', 'teams', 'eco-design', 'tool', 'Code', 'Ethics', 'display', 'countries', 'France', 'vs', 'protection', 'biodiversity', 'vehicles', 'rainwater', 'Reuse', 'recycling', 'incineration', 'priority', '2022']",2022-05-31,2022-06-01,finance.yahoo.com

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized microbiotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infections  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI - code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010.

The shares purchased un‚Ä¶,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) has appointed an investment-services provider to purchase 125 000 Ipsen S.A. shares  or about 0.15% of the share capital  over a maximum period of three months. The shares purchased under this agreement will be allocated mainly to cover its employee free share-allocation plan.This program is made pursuant to the authorization granted by the Combined Shareholders‚Äô meeting  held on May 24th  2022.About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience. With Specialty Care sales of ‚Ç¨2.6bn in FY 2021  Ipsen sells medicines in over 100 countries.

For more information  visit www.ipsen.com.Forward-looking statementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen‚Äôs management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen‚Äôs business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers.

""The synergy between our iCRO and iBiopsy¬Æ businesses is perfect to respond to this change: iBiopsy¬Æ develops software as medical device  integrating AI technologies  which allow the diagnosis of diseases at a very early stage  when patients are still asymptomatic. At the same time  iCRO has extensive knowledge of image processing and its management in clinical trials. The cross-fertilization of our two businesses will enable us to leverage imaging data in conjunction with other clinical information in an unparalleled way and provide biopharmaceutical companies with tools for Go/No-Go decisions in trials "" adds Fredrik Brag.Imaging Lab will provide new answers in four areas that determine the success of clinical trials: selection of patients included in trials  especially inclusion of patients diagnosed at early stages of disease thanks to AI technologies  prediction of response to therapy  measurement of disease progression  and evaluation of the safety of drug candidates. The goal is to optimize development plans  including facilitating Go/No-Go decisions to increase the success rate of clinical trials. This rate is especially low in oncology  generating an average development cost of $2.8 billion to take a new molecule to market  compared with an average of $1 billion per new molecule brought to market for other therapeutic areas1.""Our experience of image management in clinical trials has shown that trial data is vastly underutilized. We can extract much more information from images through the widescale use of data mining  AI  and radiomics and use these technologies to better support our customers and biopharmaceutical partners in their clinical developments "" says Nicolas Dano  COO iCRO of Median Technologies.The Imaging Lab team will be present from June 4-6 (exhibition dates) at the ASCO Annual Conference in Chicago   Median‚Äôs booth #2098  Exhibit Hall A  to meet the pharmaceutical community.About Median Technologies: Median Technologies provides innovative imaging solutions and services to advance healthcare for everyone.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP‚Äôs share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.Story continuesABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

Further  the abstract on these phase 2a data has been selected for a poster presentation at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology  EULAR 2022. The presentation will be given by principal investigator Claire Daien  M.D.  Ph.D.  on Wednesday  June 1  2022 at 8:40 p.m. CEST (2:40 p.m. EST - accessible for registered EULAR participants only).Prof. Claire Daien  M.D.  Ph.D.  rheumatologist at the University Hospital at Montpellier and principal investigator of the study  said: ""I am very excited that our phase 2a clinical data with ABX464  now obefazimod  in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis have been published in the prestigious peer-reviewed journal ARD and have further been selected for a poster presentation at EULAR 2022. I am looking forward to presenting obefazimod and its promising results to the international expert community  also taking into account the recently published very encouraging phase 2a one-year maintenance results in RA. There is still a high unmet medical need for safe and durably efficient therapies for rheumatoid arthritis patients. Therefore  alternative treatment options based on a novel mechanism of action  such as obefazimod  are needed.""Story continuesProf. Paul Emery  M.D.  FMedSci  Versus Arthritis Professor of Rheumatology  Director of the Leeds Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Centre  Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust  Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine  UK  commented: ""Beyond the promising data of the phase 2a induction study presented at EULAR  the high levels of maintained response rates of the phase 2a maintenance trial with obefazimod in rheumatoid arthritis patients  especially when it comes to ACR50 and ACR70 responses  look also very encouraging. The molecule also demonstrated a good safety profile  and no serious infections were observed. Along with its very different mode of action and clinical profile  obefazimod has the potential to play an important role in the future management of rheumatoid arthritis patients.""Prof. Hartmut J. Ehrlich  M.D.  CEO of Abivax  added: ""We are very pleased that the results of the phase 2a study in RA clearly confirm the excellent anti-inflammatory effects and favorable safety of obefazimod that have already been demonstrated in phase 2a and 2b trials in ulcerative colitis. The publication of our RA phase 2a induction data in the journal ARD and the selection for a presentation at EULAR are very important for Abivax  as they scientifically validate the capacity of our drug candidate to address RA  in addition to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease  and therefore a broad range of chronic inflammatory diseases. Importantly  obefazimod did not only show a potent and rapid onset of action during the induction studies but  in both our RA and UC maintenance trials  demonstrated a durable efficacy over time. Millions of patients suffering from these chronic and very debilitating diseases are in need of new  safe drugs with long lasting efficacy. The Abivax team is therefore committed to making obefazimod available to these patients as quickly as possible.""The clinical phase 2a induction study was designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and preliminary efficacy of two oral dose levels of obefazimod administered once daily  in combination with methotrexate (MTX). 60 patients who had an inadequate response to MTX and/or to one or more anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFŒ±) biological therapeutics participated in this randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial. Patients received obefazimod (50mg or 100mg) or placebo during the 12-week induction treatment phase. The study was conducted in 21 study centers across four European countries (France  Belgium  Poland and Hungary). The treatment groups were well balanced in terms of disease severity as well as patient demographics.In June 2021  Abivax communicated the results of the induction phase of its phase 2a clinical study. The primary endpoint of this study  safety and tolerability  was met with 50mg obefazimod once daily  demonstrating good safety and tolerability profile in the overall patient population during the 12-week induction phase.67% (40/60) of the patients who completed the induction study enrolled in the open-label extension maintenance study to receive 50mg obefazimod orally once a day for an additional year.In March this year  Abivax reported exciting results from the phase 2a maintenance trial in RA.58% of the patients (23/40) suffering from moderate to severe active RA completed 52 weeks of chronic treatment with obefazimod. Efficacy of 50mg once daily obefazimod was assessed by the DAS28-CRP remission (DAS28-CRP < 2.6[2]) and the ACR20/50/70[3] rates.57% of the patients (13/23) were in remission at week 52  assessed by the DAS28-CRP (< 2.6)  corresponding to 33% (13/40) using the full analysis set (FAS).All 23 patients (100%) who completed 52 weeks of treatment achieved at least an ACR20 response  which translates into 58% (23/40) in the FAS. It is remarkable  that according to the observed cases population  83% (19/23) and 52% (12/23) achieved even an ACR50 and ACR70 response respectively  corresponding to 48% (19/40) and 30% (12/40) according to the FAS.20/23 patients were eligible to continue their treatment after week 52 and are at present in their second year of continued daily oral treatment with 50mg obefazimod.Obefazimod was safe and the nature of the adverse events is consistent with what has been observed in more than 1 000 subjects who have so far been treated in other clinical trials with obefazimod across different indications.Abivax currently focuses on the development of obefazimod for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and recently reported excellent phase 2b one-year maintenance data in this indication. A phase 3 clinical program in ulcerative colitis is under finalization and the first patient is planned to be included in Q3 2022.The outcome of the clinical studies conducted in UC  along with the promising results of the obefazimod phase 2a induction as well as the maintenance study after one year of continued treatment in RA patients  underpin the potential of obefazimod to treat a broad range of chronic inflammatory diseases.""Obefazimod"" registered as INN for ABX464Abivax further announces today that ""obefazimod"" has been confirmed as international nonproprietary name (INN) for drug-candidate ABX464. Obefazimod has officially been registered and published at the WHO as well as the USAN (United States Adopted Names).*****About Abivax (www.abivax.com)Abivax  a clinical stage biotechnology company  is developing novel therapies that modulate the body's natural immune machinery to treat patients with chronic inflammatory diseases  viral infections  and cancer.

It is designed to ensure that connectivity and security at the edge  applications  equipment  and user experience are all performing at optimal levels to meet customers‚Äô business needs.Enterprise information systems rely on a multitude of interconnected services from various suppliers. Measuring the performance of these IT services is critical to keeping day-to-day operations running smoothly. Monitoring and measuring  however  are increasingly complex as IT estates expand  potentially resulting in lack of global visibility to identify root causes of issues or recurring glitches  inability to anticipate incidents  and poor alert management. Traditional monitoring tools take a siloed approach based on one tool per service  proving inadequate for today‚Äôs distributed infrastructure.Service Manage-Watch differentiates itself from other offers on the market by delivering end-to-end real-time visibility via a single dashboard. In addition  the service is bolstered by a team of dedicated experts at Orange Business Services to fine-tune the correlation rules and work closely with service desk agents for advanced troubleshooting adapted to the specific customer requirements. This continuously improves global IT performance supervision. Metrics from monitoring tools are harvested into the Orange Data Lake and correlated for analysis using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate proactive and predictive alerts.Service Manage-Watch covers the entire enterprise‚Äôs IT ecosystem. Working independently of existing suppliers and service desks  it interfaces with monitoring tools that are already deployed and IT service management (ITSM) software that manages the provision and lifecycle of IT services. It covers the full Orange portfolio and can additionally integrate any customer-owned monitoring tool. Moreover  Orange Business Services consulting teams can further support customers in their AIOps journeys.""Service Manage-Watch adds genuine predictive AI power to Orange‚Äôs performance monitoring portfolio.

Sanofi and Sobi¬Æ collaborate on the development and commercialization of efanesoctocog alfa.Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs in the US that target serious or life-threatening conditions. Drugs qualifying for this designation must show preliminary clinical evidence that the drug may demonstrate a substantial improvement on clinically significant endpoints over available therapies.John Reed  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Research and Development at Sanofi‚ÄúThe Breakthrough Therapy designation highlights efanesoctocog alfa‚Äôs potential to transform treatment for people with hemophilia A by providing higher protection for longer duration. This potential new class of factor VIII therapy represents how we are boldly advancing science to address unmet needs for the hemophilia community. We are excited to work with regulatory authorities during the filing and review of this innovative therapy.‚ÄùAnders Ullman  MD  PhDHead of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer at Sobi‚ÄúThis designation supports the innovation of efanesoctocog alfa and acknowledges its potential to fulfill an unmet medical need for people living with hemophilia A. We are committed to transforming lives for people living with rare diseases  and this is a testament to the medical innovation that science can bring.‚ÄùStory continuesTopline results from the pivotal XTEND-1 Phase 3 study demonstrate efanesoctocog alfa met the primary endpoint  showing a clinically meaningful prevention of bleeds in people with severe hemophilia A over a 52-week period. Importantly  the key secondary endpoint was also met  demonstrating that efanesoctocog alfa was superior to prior prophylactic factor VIII replacement therapy in preventing bleeding events based on an intra-patient comparison. Efanesoctocog alfa was well-tolerated  and inhibitor development to factor VIII was not detected. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>5% of participants overall) were headache  arthralgia  fall  and back pain.Data from the XTEND-1 Phase 3 study are expected to be shared at an upcoming medical meeting  and those data will serve as the basis for submission to FDA mid-year 2022. The FDA granted efanesoctocog alfa Orphan Drug designation in August 2017 and Fast Track designation in February 2021. The European Commission also granted efanesoctocog alfa Orphan Drug designation in June 2019. Regulatory submission in the EU will follow availability of data from the ongoing XTEND-Kids pediatric study  expected in 2023.Hemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. It is a lifelong condition in which the ability of a person‚Äôs blood to clot is impaired due to a coagulation factor deficiency. People with hemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage  and life-threatening hemorrhages. Unmet medical needs remain for people with hemophilia to strengthen protection  reduce treatment burden  and improve quality of life.About efanesoctocog alfa (BIVV001)Efanesoctocog alfa is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for people with hemophilia A. It builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN¬Æ polypeptides to extend its time in circulation. It is the first investigational factor VIII therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. Efanesoctocog alfa is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialization of Alprolix¬Æ and Elocta¬Æ/Eloctate¬Æ. The companies also collaborate on the development and commercialization of efanesoctocog alfa  an investigational factor VIII therapy with the potential to provide high sustained factor activity levels with once-weekly dosing for people with hemophilia A.

Some orders from these countries have been canceled without leading to inventory impairment. One of the two sites belonging to the Holmer Ukraine subsidiary is located in the war zone: damage to buildings  which have been severely hit by Russian attacks  led to a ‚Ç¨1.3 million loss recorded under non-recurring items. We have identified no additional risks to date  and EXEL Industries is maintaining as much business as possible in compliance with European rules.Story continuesAs a reminder  Russia  Belarus  and Ukraine accounted for 4% of Group sales in FY 2020‚Äì2021.AcquisitionOn February 15  2022  the Group announced the strategic acquisition of G.F.  a long-standing Italian manufacturer of garden equipment including watering  irrigation  gardening  and outdoor living products.

After a strong first quarter with growth across all businesses  the second quarter saw mixed trends: some businesses  including industry and sugar beet harvesting  posted growth in terms of both volume and price. Agricultural spraying achieved growth due to higher prices offsetting ongoing consecutive cost increases since the beginning of 2021 (steel  mechanical components  and electronics‚Ä¶). Volumes are affected by supply chain disruption in all regions. Lastly  the Leisure business benefited from the perimeter entrance of the Nautical industry but hampered by the decline in the gardening market (down 15% over the January-March 2022 period). This was exacerbated by the disruption stemming from the IT system migration at Hozelock during the second quarter.During the first half  the Group posted strong commercial results across different regions (Australia  Asia  North America). Europe proved resilient but slightly decreased  mainly due to the gardening business.ResultsAt ‚Ç¨17.4 million (4.3% of sales)  reported recurring EBITDA was down ‚Ç¨14.4 million compared to the record performance in H1 2020-2021. This decline can be explained by several factors:Primarily in the Agricultural Spraying business  the Group endeavored to manage supply shortages throughout the first half against a backdrop of hyperinflation that affected margins. The fall in volumes in the gardening business  linked to a slowdown in its underlying market following two years of strong growth (during the pandemic in 2020  and further growth in 2021) and to the challenging migration of IT systems  sharply impacted EBITDA. Lastly  after two years of heavy restrictions  overheads have increased in order to support business growth and contribute to the Group‚Äôs operational transformation.Net income totaled ‚Ç¨1.9 million  versus ‚Ç¨14.3 million in 2021.The ‚Ç¨1.9 million net non-recurring loss mainly includes impairment of damaged or destroyed assets located in the Ukrainian war zone.Net financial income is stable at ‚Ç¨0.3 million : foreign exchange gains came to ‚Ç¨2 million  similar to the previous year  despite contrasting evolutions for some currencies; this foreign exchange gain was offset by financial expenses linked to the increase in debt.The recognized tax expense of ‚Ç¨3.8 million  although high compared to Group profit before tax  is due to the varied results posted by the different businesses.Balance sheetNet financial debt at March 31  2022 was ‚Ç¨155 million  compared to ‚Ç¨119 million in 2021. The increase in net debt stems from three events: dividend payment for the first time in two fiscal years  totaling ‚Ç¨11 million  the G.F. acquisition and the increase in inventory (mainly work-in-progress) due to supply shortages. During the first half  supply shortages disrupted production at Group plants and significantly increased the inventory of semi-finished products. During the second half  EXEL Industries will strive to significantly reduce inventory and generate cash flow.Furthermore  the Group continues to refinance its lines of credit by diversifying issuers and extending maturities in order to meet operational and external growth requirements without disrupting the balance sheet structure over the long term.PerspectivesCaring about the impact of inflation on its employees‚Äô daily life  EXEL Industries has decided to grant all of them an exceptional bonus for solidarity purposes and purchasing power. This bonus  which represents overall an estimated cost of ‚Ç¨3 million for the Group  will be the same amount for each eligible employee in the world.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING Agricultural commodity prices are expected to remain at high levels  encouraging farmers to renew their machines  especially for large-scale crops farmers. Commercial brands are adjusting their sales prices  to offset the steel and components costs increases and to try to limit the impact on margins. The order book is rising ahead of its 2020-2021 levels  but supply chain disruptions (components) persist and will continue to affect productivity and the pace of deliveries. Some of the orders initially earmarked for the Ukrainian and Russian markets are redirected to other regions.S UGAR-BEET HARVESTERS Stabilization of new machine sales expected in the fiscal year  despite canceled/delayed orders in Ukraine and Russia. Confirmation that the diversification into the Terra Variant range can act as a driver of growth into new regions. Sales of spare parts and used machines remain strong.LEISURE As anticipated  volumes are gradually recovering  following the change of ERP software implemented in the second quarter (migration to SAP). The gardening business fell after an exceptional year in 2021. The new Easy-Mix composter  which has won a string of awards from different organizations  looks set to grow sales. After briefly stabilizing  commodity prices are rising up again. The commercial and industrial restructuring of the nautical activity continues.INDUSTR Y The automotive market is difficult in all regions  with carmakers showing signs of a wait-and-see attitude and experiencing supply shortages.

5850,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/dutch-dsm-and-swiss-firmenich-join-forces-in-cash-and-shares-deal-1018083,Dutch DSM and Swiss Firmenich join forces in cash and shares deal,AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -   Dutch specialty chemicals maker DSM on Tuesday said it would merge with Swiss peer Firmenich in a deal involving shares and cash  to become a leading supplier of food ingredients and beauty and well-being products.,Shares in DSM jumped as much as 12.6% after the company said on Tuesday that its shareholders will take 65.5% of the shares in a new group called DSM-Firmenich  while the owners of unlisted Firmenich will receive a 34.5% stake of the combined entity plus 3.5 billion euros in cash from DSM.Analysts at brokerage Stifel said the transaction would ‚Äúcreate a new giant in the nutrition space  and the only one to combine flavours and fragrances with nutritional benefits‚Äù.Firmenich‚Äôs businesses include making food ingredients and scents for detergents and creating fragrances for brands such as Calvin Klein and Mugler.At about 11.4 billion euros ($12.3 billion) in combined 2021 revenue  the new player will contest IFF Inc‚Äôs leadership in the market for fragrances  flavours and ingredients for food and cosmetics. IFF  which last year combined with DuPont‚Äôs Nutrition and Biosciences business  had $11.7 billion in 2021 sales.In a back-to-back deal that concludes DSM‚Äôs exit from industrial materials  DSM also agreed to sell its engineering plastics division to German peer Lanxess and private-equity firm Advent for 3.85 billion euros including assumed debt.Stifel analysts said the Firmenich deal values the Swiss company at 19.2 billion euros including debt  based on DSM‚Äôs closing price on Monday. Also based on that price  DSM said its contribution to the merged entity had an implied value of 21.6 billion.

The transaction process is described in more detail below.As a first step  the DSM shareholders will be given the opportunity to exchange their DSM shares for DSM-Firmenich shares through a public exchange offer (the ""Offer""). The consideration under the Offer will be one ordinary share in the capital of DSM-Firmenich for each tendered ordinary share in the capital of DSM. The terms and conditions of such an offer will be set out in an offer memorandum (such document  together with the listing prospectus  the ""Offering Circular"") which is expected to be published in the second half of 2022.

As a final step  Company Holdco is liquidated  and as soon as practicable after completion of the Share Sale  the liquidator will arrange for an (advance) liquidation distribution. For the non-tendering DSM shareholders the gross (advance) liquidation distribution will  subject to regulatory restrictions  consist of ordinary shares in the capital of DSM-Firmenich plus an amount in cash reflecting the amount of Dutch dividend withholding tax due in respect of the distribution and a cash payment in lieu of any fractional DSM-Firmenich ordinary shares. Company Holdco will receive such ordinary shares in the capital of DSM-Firmenich and cash through a settlement of part of the Note. Non-tendering DSM shareholders are advised that such distribution will be subject to a Dutch dividend withholding tax that will be deducted from the gross (advance) liquidation distribution. The (advance) liquidation distribution to DSM-Firmenich will consist of the (remaining part of) the Note (such merger  Share Sale and liquidation  together the ""Post-Closing Merger""). Further details of the Post-Closing Merger will be set out in the Offering Circular.Furthermore  if after settlement of the Offer  DSM-Firmenich holds at least 95% of the ordinary shares in the capital of DSM  DSM-Firmenich will commence a statutory buy-out procedure in accordance with Dutch law.After settlement of the shares tendered in the post-acceptance period of the Offer  the Firmenich shareholders will contribute 100% of the shares in the capital of Firmenich to DSM-Firmenich in exchange for DSM-Firmenich shares and ‚Ç¨3.5bn in cash (subject to potential adjustments) (the ""Contribution"").

5853,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-fda-accepts-dupixent-050000077.html,Press Release: FDA accepts Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) for priority review in adults with prurigo nodularis,FDA accepts Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) for priority review in adults with prurigo nodularis Dupixent would be the first and only medicine specifically indicated...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeFDA accepts Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) for priority review in adults with prurigo nodularisDupixent would be the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the U.S.  if approvedAcceptance marks another important step in advancing Dupixent for a broad range of diseases with underlying type 2 inflammationParis and Tarrytown  N.Y. May 31  2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) to treat adults with prurigo nodularis  a chronic inflammatory skin disease that causes extreme itch and skin lesions. The target action date for the FDA decision is September 30  2022.The sBLA is supported by data from two pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients 18 years and older with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis (PRIME2 and PRIME). Both trials met the primary and key secondary endpoints  showing Dupixent significantly improved disease signs and symptoms compared to placebo  including reduction in itch and skin lesions. The safety results from these trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. The adverse event more commonly observed with Dupixent was conjunctivitis.The FDA grants priority review to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Additional regulatory filings outside of the US are also planned in 2022. The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long term. There are approximately 75 000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option.Story continuesAbout DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent is approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis in different age populations in a number of countries around the world. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in the European Union  Japan and more than 60 countries.

Since then  Guess has grown from a denim pioneer into a global brand with over 1 600 retail stores worldwide and offers collections for men  women and children  as well as a wide range of accessories  from jewelry  fragrances  eyewear  to watches  shoes and bags.Guess was on a path to replace Excel spreadsheets for buying and merchandising with an end-to-end digital solution to manage their 8 000-SKU-collections  with 4 collections released per year.Then  the pandemic hit  bringing with it uncertainty. Capital spending came to a halt. Guess faced the same issues as the rest of the fashion industry  however in a bold move  the company decided to invest in technology during a time of market disruption  to bolster planning with Centric Planning. Says Daniel Botey  VP of Global Inventory Management at Guess Europe Sagl  ""...Our need for a tool was even more urgent under the circumstances. So we revived the [planning] project during the first lockdown.""Their foresight paid off. Margins have gone up even though foot traffic in their retail stores is still down. This was due in large part to Guess' pre-pandemic game plan to increase margins  but the ability to shift merchandise across channels‚Äîsomething that was very difficult to do in a timely manner prior to Centric Planning‚Äîalso played a role. Mr. Botey points out  ""If we had had a lot of inventory  we could not have done it.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ Medical (dupilumab) to treat adults with prurigo nodularis  a chronic skin disease that causes extreme itch and inflammatory skin lesions (nodules). The target action date for the FDA decision is September 30  2022.The sBLA is supported by data from two pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients 18 years and older with prurigo nodularis (PRIME2 and PRIME). Both trials met the primary and key secondary endpoints  showing Dupixent significantly improved disease signs and symptoms compared to placebo  including reduction in itch and skin lesions. The safety results from these trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indications. The adverse event more commonly observed with Dupixent was conjunctivitis.The FDA grants Priority Review to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Additional regulatory filings around the world are also planned in 2022.The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. There are approximately 75 000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option.Story continuesAbout DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent is approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or eosinophilic esophagitis in different age populations in a number of countries around the world. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in the European Union and Japan and more than 60 countries. More than 400 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age)  prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

June 1  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- With mounting societal pressure to be constantly busy  rapid adoption of new work technology and a‚Ä¶,"HEINEKEN¬Æ is addressing this growing work life imbalance with The Closer  an outlandish high-tech bottle opener that immediately shuts all work applications when a bottle of Heineken is opened with it. Dramatized in a campaign film as the antidote to the increasing demands of our always-on work culture  The Closer bottle opener itself is a satirical symbol for the power every worker has to close down at the end of the day.""As a brand  we have always stood for creating moments of shared connections with others "" said Bram Westenbrink  Global Head Heineken¬Æ Brand at HEINEKEN. ""With the once-rigid boundaries between work and personal time rapidly deteriorating following the COVID-19 pandemic  we want to spark a much-needed conversation about the importance of resisting the societal pressures to be in a constant state of busy work and encourage workers around the world to reprioritize social and leisure time with the people who matter most.""The Closer bottle opener will be announced at an exclusive launch event reminiscent of iconic tech announcements. A keynote address by Billy Eichner will unveil the only gadget that can help solve a core problem caused by other remote-work enabling technologies. By overemphasizing the necessity of such a high-tech marvel  Eichner will remind us all that everyone already has everything they need to close down right at their fingertips.Workers in the United States will be able to enter for their chance to win a Closer bottle opener on June 8  2022 at www.heineken.com/closer. But fans will have to act quickly  as the promotion will only be open from 10 am - 11:59 pm ET. More devices will be made available in additional markets in the coming months.Once all the Closer bottle openers are claimed  HEINEKEN¬Æ will encourage workers in the United States to block their calendars at the end of the day with a Calendar Closer to prevent coworkers from scheduling meetings after working hours. Workers who are first to use the Calendar Closer at www.heineken.com/closer will be rewarded with beer money to enjoy social time with their friends.""As people continue to feel like they have to work all the time  they're forgetting that disconnecting is even an option "" said Bruno Bertelli  Global Chief Creative Officer of Publicis Worldwide  the lead agency that created the campaign. ""That's why we created The Closer. It's not just technology; it's a social provocation to help people see that the pressure to work all the time is getting a little ridiculous and we all have the power to log off and go hang out with our friends again.""As a business with over 80 000 employees around the world  HEINEKEN¬Æ has not been immune to the increased demands placed on its vast workforce. An employee wellbeing program was established in 2021 to identify causes of work life imbalance around the world  with a dedicated team responsible for identifying and sharing best practices to address them. This year and beyond  the team plans to host over 1 000 workshops in 80+ countries to find new ways of working to better support the professional  emotional  social and physical wellbeing of all employees. This campaign was created to spark conversation  and for HEINEKEN¬Æ  it starts by empowering its own employees.""While work life imbalance is an issue felt around the world  it can't be solved with just one policy change "" said Yolanda Talamo  Global Head of Human Resources at HEINEKEN. ""This high-tech bottle opener is a symbol that acts as a catalyst for change  but the work is ahead of us. We are asking all of our employees to help us identify practical solutions that take into account the cultural nuances in each of the countries we operate in so everyone can enjoy more balance between their work and personal time.""This is the first campaign from HEINEKEN¬Æ that launches ""For a Fresher World "" a new creative expression that aims to refresh the world by showing life tastes better with an open mind. With this new approach  campaigns will strive to challenge the obvious  reconsider stereotypes and oppose tired cliches.

The target action date for the FDA decision is September 30  2022.The sBLA is supported by data from two pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in patients 18 years and older with prurigo nodularis (PRIME2 and PRIME). Both trials met the primary and key secondary endpoints  showing Dupixent significantly improved disease signs and symptoms compared to placebo  including reduction in itch and skin lesions. The safety results from these trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indications. The adverse event more commonly observed with Dupixent was conjunctivitis.The FDA grants Priority Review to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Additional regulatory filings around the world are also planned in 2022.The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. There are approximately 75 000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent is approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or eosinophilic esophagitis in different age populations in a number of countries around the world. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in the European Union and Japan and more than 60 countries. More than 400 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age)  prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The free float at the time of admission was 15.62% and the market capitalisation at IPO was ‚Ç¨64 million.Alberto Abbo  CEO and Co-founder of Bifire  said: ‚ÄúThe debut on Euronext Growth Milan represents an important milestone for Bifire  of which we are very proud. At the same time  however  we also consider it the beginning of a new development path which  through a structured growth  will allow us greater visibility in the sector of the production of products for thermal insulation and fire protection. We believe that the listing on the EGM market will allow us to strengthen and improve our production capacity thanks to the resources collected and will also allow us to accelerate development in high-growth and high-margin segments.‚ÄùAlfredo Varini  Co-founder of Bifire  Technical Sales and R&D Director  said: ""Our goal  thanks to the new financial resources  is to accelerate the expansion of the company which today can count on the plants in Desio  Paderno Dugnano and Varedo to create 100% Made in Italy products. The capital raised during the IPO will also support the green revolution that Bifire has been carrying out for years by continuing to invest in research and development. Attention to environmental issues is a mission that is expressed in the adoption of ESG (Environmental  Social  Governance) parameters and in the drafting of the Sustainability Report.‚ÄùCaption: Alberto Abbo  CEO and Co-founder of Bifire  Alfredo Varini  Co-founder of Bifire  Technical Sales and R&D Director  rang the bell during the market open ceremony this morning to celebrate the Initial Public Offering of the company.About Bifire Bifire is a company active in the production of materials for fire protection and thermal insulation in the construction and industry sectors. Bifire materials are mostly used in the field of building renovations  in particular in the market of renovations carried out with so-called ‚Äúdry‚Äù techniques. The diffusion of dry construction techniques has made it possible to reduce construction times and costs without this entailing a loss of performance. In fact  with dry construction techniques it is possible to accurately predict the times and phases of work  minimizing dead times in the construction  which inevitably cause an increase in construction costs. In addition  dry systems are more environmentally friendly  as the elements  thanks to the ease of assembly-disassembly  can be recycled  replaced (in case of degraded elements) or reused  making any future disposal less impactful. This type of technology gives the possibility to design and build the parts of the building in places other than the one where the building will be built. It is therefore possible to carry out the final assembly phase on site  which will then take place in a short and controlled time.",neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.29,0.25,0.45,True,English,"['Euronext Growth Milan', 'Bifire Lists', 'R&D Director', 'Euronext Growth Milan', 'final assembly phase', 'medium sized companies', 'new financial resources', 'Initial Public Offering', 'Total placement volume', 'market open ceremony', 'new development path', 'dry construction techniques', 'dry‚Äù techniques', 'placement phase', 'Euronext Group', 'structured growth', 'dry systems', 'total number', 'Borsa Italiana', 'fire protection', 'thermal insulation', 'industry sectors', 'free float', 'Alberto Abbo', 'important milestone', 'greater visibility', 'high-margin segments', 'Alfredo Varini', 'Technical Sales', 'Paderno Dugnano', 'green revolution', 'environmental issues', 'Sustainability Report', 'future disposal', 'market capitalisation', 'EGM market', 'same time', 'dead times', 'controlled time', 'construction times', 'Fifth listing', 'Italy products', 'degraded elements', 'construction costs', 'production capacity', 'building renovations', 'Bifire materials', 'Bifire Bifire', 'part', 'company', 'beginning', 'year', 'small', 'firms', 'admission', 'IPO', 'CEO', 'founder', 'debut', 'high-growth', 'goal', 'expansion', 'plants', 'Desio', 'Varedo', '100% Made', 'research', 'Attention', 'adoption', 'ESG', 'Governance', 'parameters', 'drafting', 'Caption', 'bell', 'field', 'diffusion', 'loss', 'performance', 'fact', 'phases', 'work', 'increase', 'addition', 'assembly-disassembly', 'case', 'type', 'technology', 'possibility', 'places', 'site', 'short']",2022-06-01,2022-06-01,mondovisione.com

Please refer to Section 1 (""Risk factors""). ii INFORMATION DOCUMENT INFORMATION TO DISTRIBUTORS Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments  as amended (""MiFID II""); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together  the ""MiFID II Product Governance Requirements"")  and disclaiming all and any liability  which any ""manufacturer"" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto  the Shares have been subject to a product approval process  which has determined that they each are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties  each as defined in MiFID II (the ""Positive Target Market""); and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the ""Appropriate Channels for Distribution""). Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment  distributors should note that: the price of the Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection  who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. Conversely  an investment in the Shares is not compatible with investors looking for full capital protection or full repayment of the amount invested or having no risk tolerance  or investors requiring a fully guaranteed income or fully predictable return profile (the ""Negative Target Market""  and  together with the Positive Target Market  the ""Target Market Assessment""). For the avoidance of doubt  the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in  or purchase  or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels. ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES The Company is a public limited liability company (soci√©t√© anonyme) incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. As a result  the rights of holders of the Shares will be governed by Luxembourg law and the Company's articles of association (the ""Articles of Association""). The rights of shareholders under Luxembourg law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. With four exemptions  the members of the Company's board of directors (the ""Board Members"" and the ""Board of Directors"" respectively) are not residents of the United States of America (the ""United States"" or ""US""). As a result of the Company being a Luxembourg public limited company  it may be difficult for investors in the United States to effect service of process on the Company or its Board Members in the United States or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in U.S. courts against the Company or its Board Members  including judgments based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any State or territory within the United States. Uncertainty exists as to whether courts in Norway or Luxembourg will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions  including the United States  against the Company or its Board Members under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Norway or Luxembourg against the Company or its Board Members under the securities laws of other jurisdictions. In addition  awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may not be enforceable in Norway or in Luxembourg. The United States does not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgements (other than arbitral awards) in civil and commercial matters with Norway or Luxembourg. Similar restrictions may apply in other jurisdictions. iii TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 RISK FACTORS

5875,EuroNext,Google API,https://spacenews.com/astrocast-buying-hiber-to-boost-funding-and-expansion-plans/,Astrocast buying Hiber to boost funding and expansion plans,1 day ago,TAMPA  Fla. ‚Äî Cash-strapped smallsat operator Astrocast announced plans May 30 to buy Dutch connectivity solutions provider Hiber  which scrapped plans for its own constellation last year following failures on its initial satellites.Switzerland-based Astrocast said the deal would give it spectrum in the Americas to enable its growing constellation for connecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices to operate globally.Astrocast plans to issue new shares to fund the acquisition. Hiber has also agreed to invest around $11 million in Astrocast‚Äôs second stock market listing later this year to help the Swiss startup meet near-term funding needs.Astrocast hopes to raise 60-80 million euros ($64-86 million) by listing shares on the Euronext Growth Paris junior stock market in France.The startup said it needs more funds to expand its constellation of 12 satellites ‚Äî including two test spacecraft ‚Äî to 20 before the end of 2022  and to 40 in 2023 to improve coverage.By 2025  Astrocast aims to be operating 100 satellites in low Earth orbit.While the first 20 will be three-unit cubesats  Astrocast has said later models could be larger six-unit cubesats.Astrocast became a public company in August when it raised about $42 million by listing shares on Euronext Growth Oslo in Norway.The operator launched commercially in February for regions outside the Americas which  according to Astrocast spokesperson Fatima Vigil-Perez  currently receive services with a typical two-hour latency.However  Astrocast estimated in its May 13 annual financial report that it needs to raise 43 million Swiss Francs ($45 million) in 2022 for expansion plans that would enable it to improve coverage and satellite revisit rates.The company reported a 21.4 million Swiss Franc loss for 2021.Established operators ‚Äî and other startups that include SpaceX-owned Swarm ‚Äî are also seeking a share of a space-based IoT market that typically uses satellites to connect small devices out the reach of terrestrial networks.Astrocast says its services are focused on connecting customers in industrial markets that include agriculture  maritime and utilities.Hiber also targets industrial customers ‚Äî particularly those in the oil & gas  mining  logistics and agriculture markets ‚Äî and provides satellite-connected devices and solutions that enable customers to monitor and track assets in remote locations.The Dutch company‚Äôs business is based on multi-year subscriptions that cover sensors  network hardware  satellite connectivity and a user interface.In October  Hiber announced a partnership to use Inmarsat‚Äôs satellites for its IoT solutions after giving up on its own constellation.The Dutch company had surrendered a license to operate a network of 24 IoT smallsats just weeks before  blaming technical issues on four initial satellites it had deployed and financial issues.Astrocast said acquiring Hiber would give the Swiss company access to L-band spectrum for covering the Americas that is part of an agreement with Inmarsat.Astrocast‚Äôs satellites already use L-band to provide services.‚ÄúOur satellites are designed to provide connectivity globally so there‚Äôs no need to wait for the launch of future satellites to provide connectivity in the Americas ‚Äù Vigil-Perez said.Astrocast plans to buy Hiber with newly issued shares that currently represent a 16.5% stake in Astrocast.The acquisition is dependent on Astrocast completing its Euronext Growth Paris stock market listing.,neutral,0.06,0.91,0.03,negative,0.01,0.04,0.95,True,English,"['expansion plans', 'Astrocast', 'Hiber', 'funding', 'Euronext Growth Paris junior stock market', 'Euronext Growth Paris stock market listing', 'second stock market listing', 'May 13 annual financial report', '21.4 million Swiss Franc loss', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'Dutch connectivity solutions provider', 'space-based IoT market', '60-80 million euros', '43 million Swiss Francs', 'near-term funding needs', 'two test spacecraft', 'low Earth orbit', 'typical two-hour latency', 'larger six-unit cubesats', 'satellite revisit rates', 'Cash-strapped smallsat operator', 'The Dutch company', 'four initial satellites', 'financial issues', 'Swiss company', 'IoT solutions', 'three-unit cubesats', 'satellite connectivity', 'IoT) devices', 'Swiss startup', '24 IoT smallsats', 'public company', 'Established operators', 'other startups', 'SpaceX-owned Swarm', 'small devices', 'terrestrial networks', 'industrial markets', 'satellite-connected devices', 'remote locations', 'multi-year subscriptions', 'user interface', 'technical issues', 'Fatima Vigil-Perez', 'agriculture markets', 'network hardware', 'future satellites', 'expansion plans', 'industrial customers', 'growing constellation', 'new shares', 'Switzerland-based Astrocast', 'Astrocast spokesperson', 'L-band spectrum', '12 satellites', '100 satellites', 'TAMPA', 'Fla.', 'Hiber', 'failures', 'deal', 'Americas', 'Internet', 'Things', 'acquisition', 'France', 'funds', 'end', 'coverage', 'models', 'August', 'Norway', 'February', 'regions', 'services', 'reach', 'maritime', 'utilities', 'oil', 'gas', 'mining', 'logistics', 'assets', 'business', 'sensors', 'October', 'partnership', 'Inmarsat', 'license', 'access', 'agreement', 'launch', '16.5% stake', '2025']",2022-05-31,2022-06-01,spacenews.com

The transfer to the Euronext Growth market in Paris would simplify the company's operations and reduce its listing costs  while allowing it to continue to benefit from the advantages of a listing on a financial market.Transfer requirementsThe proposed transfer must be approved by the company's shareholders at a combined general meeting to be held on June 30  2022  on first notice. The approval of the market operator Euronext is also required prior to the delisting of Egide's shares from the regulated market of Euronext Paris and their listing on the Euronext Growth market in Paris.Egide meets the eligibility requirements for such a transfer to Euronext Growth  which include a market capitalization of less than ‚Ç¨1 billion and a free float of over ‚Ç¨2.5 million.Terms of transferThis listing by direct admission on Euronext Growth in Paris will be carried out through an accelerated procedure of direct admission to trading of Egide's existing shares  which will cease to be listed on Euronext Paris at the same time. No new shares will be issued on this transfer.Egide will be supported in its planned transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris by Atout Capital  as Listing Sponsor.Consequences of the transferIn accordance with the regulations  the company wishes to inform its shareholders of some of the possible consequences of such a transfer.In terms of periodic financial information:the annual accounts (corporate and consolidated)  the management report and the auditors' reports on these accounts would be published no later than four months after the end of the financial year.From the 2023 financial year onwards  the half-yearly report  including the half-yearly financial statements and the activity report  would be published within 4 months after the end of the half-year (instead of the 3-month period in force on Euronext) and would no longer be subject to a limited review by the statutory auditors.Egide has a free choice of accounting standards (French standards or IFRS) for the preparation of its consolidated accounts. Nevertheless  Egide has decided to continue to prepare its accounts in accordance with IFRS.Ongoing information:As Euronext Growth is an organized multilateral trading facility  Egide would remain subject to the applicable provisions on ongoing market disclosure and more particularly to the provisions of the European Market Abuse Regulation (EU No. 596/2014 of 16 April 2014  known as the 'MAR Regulation').Egide's managers (and related persons) would continue to be subject to the obligation to report transactions in the company's shares and debt securities.In terms of protection of minority shareholders:Egide would remain subject  for a period of three years from the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris  to the regime of mandatory public offers and to the maintenance of disclosure requirements relating to the crossing of thresholds as applicable to companies listed on Euronext.Beyond this three-year period  the mandatory public offer mechanism would apply  unless an exception is made  if a shareholder  directly or indirectly  alone or in concert  crosses the threshold of 50% of the capital or voting rights. The thresholds for notifying the crossing of thresholds would then also be limited to the crossing of 50% and 95%.The company draws attention to the fact that the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris could result in a different trend in the liquidity of the share than that observed on the regulated market of Euronext.Beyond this  Egide would ensure that it maintains the quality of the relationships it has always sought to establish with its shareholders and investors.Provisional timetable for the transfer (subject to approval by Euronext Paris)May 2  2022 : Decision of the Board of Directors to submit to the Annual General Meeting the proposed transfer to Euronext Growth Paris.June 1 st   2022 : Public information on the proposed transfer of listing on Euronext Growth Paris (1st press release).June 30  2022 : Ordinary General Meeting of Egide and holding of the Board of Directors to implement the transfer of the shares to Euronext Growth. In the event of a favorable vote by the Board of Directors  immediate information to the public on the final decision to transfer the shares (2nd press release). Application to delist the shares from Euronext Paris and application for their direct listing on Euronext Growth Paris.No earlier thanAugust 30  2022 : Effective transfer: delisting of the shares from Euronext Paris and listing on Euronext Growth Paris.The mnemonic code of Egide's shares (GID) would be modified on the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris. The ISIN code (FR0000072373) would remain unchanged.In addition  Egide shares will remain eligible for PEA and PEA-PME after the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris.About Egide -Egide is a group with an international dimension. specialized in the manufacture of hermetic packages and heat dissipation solutions for sensitive electronic components.
