Genio® 2.1’s upgrades are entirely related to the external components of the Genio® system  as the implantable stimulator remains unchanged.Genio® 2.1 further demonstrates Nyxoah’s patient-centric approach to addressing the needs of those suffering from moderate-to-severe OSA. The system features updates to the Genio® activation chip and a new smartphone application to enable daily reporting of therapy usage  which will support therapy acclimation and long-term compliance. Additional features of Genio® 2.1 include an improved user interface and the ability for clinicians to make more incremental stimulation adjustments. This is particularly meaningful for patients who are more sensitive to neurostimulation  as with Genio® 2.1 physicians can fine-tune stimulation amplitude to determine the optimal level of comfort for patients without compromising therapy efficacy.“Genio® 2.1’s features  along with existing full-body 3.0T MRI compatibility  illustrate Nyxoah’s patient-first mission in OSA product development ” commented Olivier Taelman  Nyxoah’s Chief Executive Officer. “The updated activation chip and new smartphone app  combined with our upgraded user interface and increased stimulation resolution  represent key next steps in optimizing patient outcomes. We are excited to make these important new features available to patients in our DREAM trial.”Story continuesAbout NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Nyxoah’s lead solution is the Genio® system  a patient-centered  leadless and battery-free hypoglossal neurostimulation therapy for OSA  the world’s most common sleep disordered breathing condition that is associated with increased mortality risk and cardiovascular comorbidities.

The shares purchased under this agreement will be allocated mainly to cover its employee free share-allocation plan.This program is made pursuant to the authorization granted by the Combined Shareholders’ meeting  held on May 24th  2022.About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

For more information  visit www.ipsen.com.Forward-looking statementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Further  the abstract on these phase 2a data has been selected for a poster presentation at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology  EULAR 2022. The presentation will be given by principal investigator Claire Daien  M.D.  Ph.D.  on Wednesday  June 1  2022 at 8:40 p.m. CEST (2:40 p.m. EST - accessible for registered EULAR participants only).Prof. Claire Daien  M.D.  Ph.D.  rheumatologist at the University Hospital at Montpellier and principal investigator of the study  said: ""I am very excited that our phase 2a clinical data with ABX464  now obefazimod  in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis have been published in the prestigious peer-reviewed journal ARD and have further been selected for a poster presentation at EULAR 2022. I am looking forward to presenting obefazimod and its promising results to the international expert community  also taking into account the recently published very encouraging phase 2a one-year maintenance results in RA. There is still a high unmet medical need for safe and durably efficient therapies for rheumatoid arthritis patients. Therefore  alternative treatment options based on a novel mechanism of action  such as obefazimod  are needed.""Story continuesProf. Paul Emery  M.D.  FMedSci  Versus Arthritis Professor of Rheumatology  Director of the Leeds Musculoskeletal Biomedical Research Centre  Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust  Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine  UK  commented: ""Beyond the promising data of the phase 2a induction study presented at EULAR  the high levels of maintained response rates of the phase 2a maintenance trial with obefazimod in rheumatoid arthritis patients  especially when it comes to ACR50 and ACR70 responses  look also very encouraging. The molecule also demonstrated a good safety profile  and no serious infections were observed. Along with its very different mode of action and clinical profile  obefazimod has the potential to play an important role in the future management of rheumatoid arthritis patients.""Prof. Hartmut J. Ehrlich  M.D.  CEO of Abivax  added: ""We are very pleased that the results of the phase 2a study in RA clearly confirm the excellent anti-inflammatory effects and favorable safety of obefazimod that have already been demonstrated in phase 2a and 2b trials in ulcerative colitis. The publication of our RA phase 2a induction data in the journal ARD and the selection for a presentation at EULAR are very important for Abivax  as they scientifically validate the capacity of our drug candidate to address RA  in addition to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease  and therefore a broad range of chronic inflammatory diseases. Importantly  obefazimod did not only show a potent and rapid onset of action during the induction studies but  in both our RA and UC maintenance trials  demonstrated a durable efficacy over time. Millions of patients suffering from these chronic and very debilitating diseases are in need of new  safe drugs with long lasting efficacy. The Abivax team is therefore committed to making obefazimod available to these patients as quickly as possible.""The clinical phase 2a induction study was designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and preliminary efficacy of two oral dose levels of obefazimod administered once daily  in combination with methotrexate (MTX). 60 patients who had an inadequate response to MTX and/or to one or more anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) biological therapeutics participated in this randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial. Patients received obefazimod (50mg or 100mg) or placebo during the 12-week induction treatment phase. The study was conducted in 21 study centers across four European countries (France  Belgium  Poland and Hungary). The treatment groups were well balanced in terms of disease severity as well as patient demographics.In June 2021  Abivax communicated the results of the induction phase of its phase 2a clinical study. The primary endpoint of this study  safety and tolerability  was met with 50mg obefazimod once daily  demonstrating good safety and tolerability profile in the overall patient population during the 12-week induction phase.67% (40/60) of the patients who completed the induction study enrolled in the open-label extension maintenance study to receive 50mg obefazimod orally once a day for an additional year.In March this year  Abivax reported exciting results from the phase 2a maintenance trial in RA.58% of the patients (23/40) suffering from moderate to severe active RA completed 52 weeks of chronic treatment with obefazimod. Efficacy of 50mg once daily obefazimod was assessed by the DAS28-CRP remission (DAS28-CRP < 2.6[2]) and the ACR20/50/70[3] rates.57% of the patients (13/23) were in remission at week 52  assessed by the DAS28-CRP (< 2.6)  corresponding to 33% (13/40) using the full analysis set (FAS).All 23 patients (100%) who completed 52 weeks of treatment achieved at least an ACR20 response  which translates into 58% (23/40) in the FAS. It is remarkable  that according to the observed cases population  83% (19/23) and 52% (12/23) achieved even an ACR50 and ACR70 response respectively  corresponding to 48% (19/40) and 30% (12/40) according to the FAS.20/23 patients were eligible to continue their treatment after week 52 and are at present in their second year of continued daily oral treatment with 50mg obefazimod.Obefazimod was safe and the nature of the adverse events is consistent with what has been observed in more than 1 000 subjects who have so far been treated in other clinical trials with obefazimod across different indications.Abivax currently focuses on the development of obefazimod for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and recently reported excellent phase 2b one-year maintenance data in this indication. A phase 3 clinical program in ulcerative colitis is under finalization and the first patient is planned to be included in Q3 2022.The outcome of the clinical studies conducted in UC  along with the promising results of the obefazimod phase 2a induction as well as the maintenance study after one year of continued treatment in RA patients  underpin the potential of obefazimod to treat a broad range of chronic inflammatory diseases.""Obefazimod"" registered as INN for ABX464Abivax further announces today that ""obefazimod"" has been confirmed as international nonproprietary name (INN) for drug-candidate ABX464. Obefazimod has officially been registered and published at the WHO as well as the USAN (United States Adopted Names).*****About Abivax (www.abivax.com)Abivax  a clinical stage biotechnology company  is developing novel therapies that modulate the body's natural immune machinery to treat patients with chronic inflammatory diseases  viral infections  and cancer.

Sanofi and Sobi® collaborate on the development and commercialization of efanesoctocog alfa.Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs in the US that target serious or life-threatening conditions. Drugs qualifying for this designation must show preliminary clinical evidence that the drug may demonstrate a substantial improvement on clinically significant endpoints over available therapies.John Reed  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Research and Development at Sanofi“The Breakthrough Therapy designation highlights efanesoctocog alfa’s potential to transform treatment for people with hemophilia A by providing higher protection for longer duration. This potential new class of factor VIII therapy represents how we are boldly advancing science to address unmet needs for the hemophilia community. We are excited to work with regulatory authorities during the filing and review of this innovative therapy.”Anders Ullman  MD  PhDHead of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer at Sobi“This designation supports the innovation of efanesoctocog alfa and acknowledges its potential to fulfill an unmet medical need for people living with hemophilia A. We are committed to transforming lives for people living with rare diseases  and this is a testament to the medical innovation that science can bring.”Story continuesTopline results from the pivotal XTEND-1 Phase 3 study demonstrate efanesoctocog alfa met the primary endpoint  showing a clinically meaningful prevention of bleeds in people with severe hemophilia A over a 52-week period. Importantly  the key secondary endpoint was also met  demonstrating that efanesoctocog alfa was superior to prior prophylactic factor VIII replacement therapy in preventing bleeding events based on an intra-patient comparison. Efanesoctocog alfa was well-tolerated  and inhibitor development to factor VIII was not detected. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>5% of participants overall) were headache  arthralgia  fall  and back pain.Data from the XTEND-1 Phase 3 study are expected to be shared at an upcoming medical meeting  and those data will serve as the basis for submission to FDA mid-year 2022. The FDA granted efanesoctocog alfa Orphan Drug designation in August 2017 and Fast Track designation in February 2021. The European Commission also granted efanesoctocog alfa Orphan Drug designation in June 2019. Regulatory submission in the EU will follow availability of data from the ongoing XTEND-Kids pediatric study  expected in 2023.Hemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. It is a lifelong condition in which the ability of a person’s blood to clot is impaired due to a coagulation factor deficiency. People with hemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage  and life-threatening hemorrhages. Unmet medical needs remain for people with hemophilia to strengthen protection  reduce treatment burden  and improve quality of life.About efanesoctocog alfa (BIVV001)Efanesoctocog alfa is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for people with hemophilia A. It builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to extend its time in circulation. It is the first investigational factor VIII therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. Efanesoctocog alfa is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialization of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®. The companies also collaborate on the development and commercialization of efanesoctocog alfa  an investigational factor VIII therapy with the potential to provide high sustained factor activity levels with once-weekly dosing for people with hemophilia A. Sobi has final development and commercialization rights in the Sobi territory (essentially Europe  North Africa  Russia and most Middle Eastern markets). Sanofi has final development and commercialization rights in North America and all other regions in the world excluding the Sobi territory.About Sobi®Sobi is a specialized international biopharmaceutical company transforming the lives of people with rare diseases.

June 1  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- With mounting societal pressure to be constantly busy  rapid adoption of new work technology and a…,"HEINEKEN® is addressing this growing work life imbalance with The Closer  an outlandish high-tech bottle opener that immediately shuts all work applications when a bottle of Heineken is opened with it. Dramatized in a campaign film as the antidote to the increasing demands of our always-on work culture  The Closer bottle opener itself is a satirical symbol for the power every worker has to close down at the end of the day.""As a brand  we have always stood for creating moments of shared connections with others "" said Bram Westenbrink  Global Head Heineken® Brand at HEINEKEN. ""With the once-rigid boundaries between work and personal time rapidly deteriorating following the COVID-19 pandemic  we want to spark a much-needed conversation about the importance of resisting the societal pressures to be in a constant state of busy work and encourage workers around the world to reprioritize social and leisure time with the people who matter most.""The Closer bottle opener will be announced at an exclusive launch event reminiscent of iconic tech announcements. A keynote address by Billy Eichner will unveil the only gadget that can help solve a core problem caused by other remote-work enabling technologies. By overemphasizing the necessity of such a high-tech marvel  Eichner will remind us all that everyone already has everything they need to close down right at their fingertips.Workers in the United States will be able to enter for their chance to win a Closer bottle opener on June 8  2022 at www.heineken.com/closer. But fans will have to act quickly  as the promotion will only be open from 10 am - 11:59 pm ET. More devices will be made available in additional markets in the coming months.Once all the Closer bottle openers are claimed  HEINEKEN® will encourage workers in the United States to block their calendars at the end of the day with a Calendar Closer to prevent coworkers from scheduling meetings after working hours. Workers who are first to use the Calendar Closer at www.heineken.com/closer will be rewarded with beer money to enjoy social time with their friends.""As people continue to feel like they have to work all the time  they're forgetting that disconnecting is even an option "" said Bruno Bertelli  Global Chief Creative Officer of Publicis Worldwide  the lead agency that created the campaign. ""That's why we created The Closer. It's not just technology; it's a social provocation to help people see that the pressure to work all the time is getting a little ridiculous and we all have the power to log off and go hang out with our friends again.""As a business with over 80 000 employees around the world  HEINEKEN® has not been immune to the increased demands placed on its vast workforce. An employee wellbeing program was established in 2021 to identify causes of work life imbalance around the world  with a dedicated team responsible for identifying and sharing best practices to address them. This year and beyond  the team plans to host over 1 000 workshops in 80+ countries to find new ways of working to better support the professional  emotional  social and physical wellbeing of all employees. This campaign was created to spark conversation  and for HEINEKEN®  it starts by empowering its own employees.""While work life imbalance is an issue felt around the world  it can't be solved with just one policy change "" said Yolanda Talamo  Global Head of Human Resources at HEINEKEN. ""This high-tech bottle opener is a symbol that acts as a catalyst for change  but the work is ahead of us. We are asking all of our employees to help us identify practical solutions that take into account the cultural nuances in each of the countries we operate in so everyone can enjoy more balance between their work and personal time.""This is the first campaign from HEINEKEN® that launches ""For a Fresher World "" a new creative expression that aims to refresh the world by showing life tastes better with an open mind. With this new approach  campaigns will strive to challenge the obvious  reconsider stereotypes and oppose tired cliches. With this first effort  HEINEKEN® is inspiring people around the world to stop overworking and open their minds to what can happen after the work stops.To learn more about the The Closer global campaign  visit www.heineken.com/closer.See credits list from the campaign film – HereAbout HEINEKENHEINEKEN is the world's most international brewer.

Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment  distributors should note that: the price of the Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection  who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. Conversely  an investment in the Shares is not compatible with investors looking for full capital protection or full repayment of the amount invested or having no risk tolerance  or investors requiring a fully guaranteed income or fully predictable return profile (the ""Negative Target Market""  and  together with the Positive Target Market  the ""Target Market Assessment""). For the avoidance of doubt  the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in  or purchase  or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Shares. Each distributor is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Shares and determining appropriate distribution channels. ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES The Company is a public limited liability company (société anonyme) incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. As a result  the rights of holders of the Shares will be governed by Luxembourg law and the Company's articles of association (the ""Articles of Association""). The rights of shareholders under Luxembourg law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. With four exemptions  the members of the Company's board of directors (the ""Board Members"" and the ""Board of Directors"" respectively) are not residents of the United States of America (the ""United States"" or ""US""). As a result of the Company being a Luxembourg public limited company  it may be difficult for investors in the United States to effect service of process on the Company or its Board Members in the United States or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in U.S. courts against the Company or its Board Members  including judgments based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any State or territory within the United States. Uncertainty exists as to whether courts in Norway or Luxembourg will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions  including the United States  against the Company or its Board Members under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Norway or Luxembourg against the Company or its Board Members under the securities laws of other jurisdictions. In addition  awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may not be enforceable in Norway or in Luxembourg. The United States does not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgements (other than arbitral awards) in civil and commercial matters with Norway or Luxembourg. Similar restrictions may apply in other jurisdictions. iii TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 RISK FACTORS

5895,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.bne.eu/russia-edges-closer-to-bond-default-246258/?source=russia,Russia edges closer to bond default,7 hours ago,After months of manoeuvring on the sanctions minefield  the Russian finance ministry seems to have slipped up for the first time after it missed a $1.9mn interest payment that has triggered the first default event on Russian sovereign debt since the one that followed the 1917 revolution.As followed by bne IntelliNews  as of May 27 Russia is back on a 30-day countdown to default only two days after the US Treasury decided not to extend its ability to service sovereign debt in US dollars. But now there is a new problem: the ministry appears to have forgotten to add $1.9mn of interest payments to a delayed coupon payment made last month. The latest developments are likely to complicate the finance ministry’s efforts to outwit the restrictions  including the latest bonds-for-rubles proposal.On June 1 the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees (CDDC) of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) ruled that said a “failure-to-pay” event occurred on credit-default swaps because Russia didn’t include the additional interest in a late bond payment made at the start of May.The CDDC is the committee that rules when a default event has happened that can trigger the decision to pay out on credit default swaps  a kind of insurance bond investors can take out to protect themselves against a bond’s default. The committee has declared that a default event has occurred  but will meet at the start of next week to decide if this triggers CDS payouts.Russia has already narrowly escaped a default once this year  only hours before the May 4 deadline. But the $1.9mn interest accrued during the 30-day grace period has not reached the investors. It appears that the ministry forgot to add this sum to the payment.“On May 11  2022  bondholders of the 4.5% 2022 Russian sovereign bonds submitted a default notice via Euroclear demanding the payment of approximately $1.9mn in accrued interest payments in respect of the delayed principal repayment upon maturity of the bonds. The bonds matured on April 4  2022 but the payment of principal and interest due at maturity was not made until May 2. The bond documents provide for interest to continue accruing on the principal until the principal is discharged at the 4.5% coupon on a 30/360 day count  resulting in approximately $1.9mn in additional interest being owed upon discharge of the bonds. Russia did not include accrued interest beyond April 4  2022 in its payment  putting it in default under the bonds. Following the demand from bondholders  Russia has not paid the interest owed ” CDDC concluded.Another CDDC meeting on the “failure-to-pay” event by the Russian Federation is scheduled for June 6  2022.The ruling by the CDDC could trigger all of Russia’s outstanding credit default swaps. According to Bloomberg  citing the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp data  credit default swaps covered a net $1.5bn of Russian debt as of end-May  compared with $3.2bn at end-April.Russia has some $400mn of bond obligations to pay in June and a total of about $1bn is due by the end of this year in 14 more bond payments from the total of about $40bn in outstanding Russian debt obligations.Investors rushed into credit default swaps after Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine amid sharply collapsing bond prices. Under the instrument two investors swap credit risk  with one party agreeing to reimburse another in the case the borrower defaults. US bond investment house Pimco is especially exposed and is said to have sold more than $100mn of such guarantees as protection to banks such as Barclays and JPMorgan & Chase.However  notably  the failure to pay $1.9mn interest isn’t sufficient to trigger a cross-default across other sovereign instruments  as the minimum threshold for unpaid debt is at least $75mn  according to documents for other Russian Eurobonds reviewed by Bloomberg.Still  it is likely to upset the investors and fuel resistance to the latest finance ministry’s efforts to outmanoeuvre the restrictions of the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that supervises sanctions. As followed by bne IntelliNews  similarly to the controversial “gas-for-rubles” scheme enforced by President Vladimir Putin  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov recently suggested a similar “bonds-for-rubles” scheme.Bondholders would have to open dual ruble-dollar accounts in Russian banks  transfer a ruble equivalent of their coupon payments to their accounts  and immediately convert that into US dollars on the market in the second forex account.The gas-for-rubles scheme has proved controversial  with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen initially saying that it breaks EU sanctions rules on Russia  but increasingly European companies have adopted the scheme which meets the sanctions requirements under the letter of the law  if not the spirit. Some countries like Hungary have agreed to meet their gas bill obligations by paying rubles directly to the Russian state and can expect to be rewarded by the Kremlin with attractive energy deals as a result.Earlier reports suggested that the two specific issues due for payment on May 27 potentially allow for other payment options  such as using rubles as a last resort and paying in euros  Swiss francs or pound sterling for “reasons beyond the control” of the Russian Federation.Two bonds for $183.75mn and $51.1mn due on June 23 also have provisions for payment in euros  sterling and francs  so it could be possible for the finance ministry to avoid sanctions in this instance. The first really problematic bond will be a June 24 coupon payment on a $159.4mn bond that matures in 2028 that can only be paid in dollars. Russia is likely to break the terms of the covenant in this case  as it is almost certain to offer payment in rubles and could go into a clear default after the 30-day grace period expires in July.,neutral,0.03,0.53,0.44,mixed,0.03,0.13,0.84,True,English,"['bond default', 'Russia', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees', 'US bond investment house', 'outstanding Russian debt obligations', 'outstanding credit default swaps', 'President Vladimir Putin', '30/360 day count', 'Clearing Corp data', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'second forex account', 'attractive energy deals', 'other Russian Eurobonds', 'other sovereign instruments', '30-day grace period', 'collapsing bond prices', 'Russian sovereign debt', 'Russian finance ministry', 'dual ruble-dollar accounts', 'EU sanctions rules', 'gas bill obligations', 'latest finance ministry', 'late bond payment', 'insurance bond investors', '4.5% 2022 Russian sovereign bonds', 'first default event', '$1.9mn interest payment', 'bond obligations', 'credit risk', 'Derivatives Association', 'Russian Federation', 'Russian state', 'International Swaps', 'credit-default swaps', 'unpaid debt', 'first time', '30-day countdown', 'bond payments', 'US Treasury', 'US dollars', 'Russian banks', 'latest developments', 'default notice', 'sanctions minefield', 'bne IntelliNews', 'new problem', 'next week', 'CDS payouts', 'bond documents', 'Depository Trust', 'military invasion', 'one party', 'minimum threshold', 'controversial “gas', 'ruble equivalent', 'European Commission', 'European companies', 'sanctions requirements', 'Earlier reports', 'interest payments', 'additional interest', 'latest bonds', 'coupon payments', 'two investors', 'rubles proposal', 'The CDDC', 'CDDC meeting', 'accrued interest', 'principal repayment', 'May 4 deadline', 'rubles scheme', '4.5% coupon', 'months', 'manoeuvring', '1917 revolution', 'ability', 'efforts', 'restrictions', 'June', 'ISDA', 'failure', 'start', 'decision', 'kind', 'sum', 'bondholders', 'Euroclear', 'respect', 'maturity', 'April', 'discharge', 'demand', 'ruling', 'Bloomberg', 'net $', 'end-May', 'total', 'year', 'Ukraine', 'case', 'borrower', 'Pimco', 'guarantees', 'protection', 'Barclays', 'JPMorgan', 'Chase', 'cross-default', 'resistance', 'Office', 'OFAC', 'similar', 'market', 'letter', 'law', 'spirit', 'countries', 'Hungary', 'Kremlin', 'result', '14']",2022-06-02,2022-06-02,bne.eu

The committee has declared that a default event has occurred  but will meet at the start of next week to decide if this triggers CDS payouts.Russia has already narrowly escaped a default once this year  only hours before the May 4 deadline. But the $1.9mn interest accrued during the 30-day grace period has not reached the investors. It appears that the ministry forgot to add this sum to the payment.“On May 11  2022  bondholders of the 4.5% 2022 Russian sovereign bonds submitted a default notice via Euroclear demanding the payment of approximately $1.9mn in accrued interest payments in respect of the delayed principal repayment upon maturity of the bonds. The bonds matured on April 4  2022 but the payment of principal and interest due at maturity was not made until May 2. The bond documents provide for interest to continue accruing on the principal until the principal is discharged at the 4.5% coupon on a 30/360 day count  resulting in approximately $1.9mn in additional interest being owed upon discharge of the bonds. Russia did not include accrued interest beyond April 4  2022 in its payment  putting it in default under the bonds. Following the demand from bondholders  Russia has not paid the interest owed ” CDDC concluded.Another CDDC meeting on the “failure-to-pay” event by the Russian Federation is scheduled for June 6  2022.The ruling by the CDDC could trigger all of Russia’s outstanding credit default swaps. According to Bloomberg  citing the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp data  credit default swaps covered a net $1.5bn of Russian debt as of end-May  compared with $3.2bn at end-April.Russia has some $400mn of bond obligations to pay in June and a total of about $1bn is due by the end of this year in 14 more bond payments from the total of about $40bn in outstanding Russian debt obligations.Investors rushed into credit default swaps after Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine amid sharply collapsing bond prices. Under the instrument two investors swap credit risk  with one party agreeing to reimburse another in the case the borrower defaults. US bond investment house Pimco is especially exposed and is said to have sold more than $100mn of such guarantees as protection to banks such as Barclays and JPMorgan & Chase.However  notably  the failure to pay $1.9mn interest isn’t sufficient to trigger a cross-default across other sovereign instruments  as the minimum threshold for unpaid debt is at least $75mn  according to documents for other Russian Eurobonds reviewed by Bloomberg.Still  it is likely to upset the investors and fuel resistance to the latest finance ministry’s efforts to outmanoeuvre the restrictions of the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that supervises sanctions. As followed by bne IntelliNews  similarly to the controversial “gas-for-rubles” scheme enforced by President Vladimir Putin  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov recently suggested a similar “bonds-for-rubles” scheme.Bondholders would have to open dual ruble-dollar accounts in Russian banks  transfer a ruble equivalent of their coupon payments to their accounts  and immediately convert that into US dollars on the market in the second forex account.The gas-for-rubles scheme has proved controversial  with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen initially saying that it breaks EU sanctions rules on Russia  but increasingly European companies have adopted the scheme which meets the sanctions requirements under the letter of the law  if not the spirit. Some countries like Hungary have agreed to meet their gas bill obligations by paying rubles directly to the Russian state and can expect to be rewarded by the Kremlin with attractive energy deals as a result.Earlier reports suggested that the two specific issues due for payment on May 27 potentially allow for other payment options  such as using rubles as a last resort and paying in euros  Swiss francs or pound sterling for “reasons beyond the control” of the Russian Federation.Two bonds for $183.75mn and $51.1mn due on June 23 also have provisions for payment in euros  sterling and francs  so it could be possible for the finance ministry to avoid sanctions in this instance. The first really problematic bond will be a June 24 coupon payment on a $159.4mn bond that matures in 2028 that can only be paid in dollars. Russia is likely to break the terms of the covenant in this case  as it is almost certain to offer payment in rubles and could go into a clear default after the 30-day grace period expires in July.,negative,0.01,0.06,0.93,mixed,0.03,0.13,0.84,True,English,"['FinMin', 'maneuvering', 'Russia', 'default', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees', 'US bond investment house', 'outstanding Russian debt obligations', 'outstanding credit default swaps', 'President Vladimir Putin', '30/360 day count', 'Clearing Corp data', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'second forex account', 'attractive energy deals', 'other Russian Eurobonds', 'other sovereign instruments', '30-day grace period', 'collapsing bond prices', 'Russian sovereign debt', 'Russian finance ministry', 'dual ruble-dollar accounts', 'EU sanctions rules', 'gas bill obligations', 'latest finance ministry', 'late bond payment', 'insurance bond investors', '4.5% 2022 Russian sovereign bonds', 'first default event', '$1.9mn interest payment', 'bond obligations', 'credit risk', 'Derivatives Association', 'Russian Federation', 'Russian state', 'International Swaps', 'credit-default swaps', 'unpaid debt', 'first time', '30-day countdown', 'bond payments', 'US Treasury', 'US dollars', 'Russian banks', 'latest developments', 'default notice', 'sanctions minefield', 'bne IntelliNews', 'new problem', 'next week', 'CDS payouts', 'bond documents', 'Depository Trust', 'military invasion', 'one party', 'minimum threshold', 'controversial “gas', 'ruble equivalent', 'European Commission', 'European companies', 'sanctions requirements', 'Earlier reports', 'interest payments', 'additional interest', 'latest bonds', 'coupon payments', 'two investors', 'rubles proposal', 'The CDDC', 'CDDC meeting', 'accrued interest', 'principal repayment', 'May 4 deadline', 'rubles scheme', '4.5% coupon', 'months', 'manoeuvring', '1917 revolution', 'ability', 'efforts', 'restrictions', 'June', 'ISDA', 'failure', 'start', 'decision', 'kind', 'sum', 'bondholders', 'Euroclear', 'respect', 'maturity', 'April', 'discharge', 'demand', 'ruling', 'Bloomberg', 'net $', 'end-May', 'total', 'year', 'Ukraine', 'case', 'borrower', 'Pimco', 'guarantees', 'protection', 'Barclays', 'JPMorgan', 'Chase', 'cross-default', 'resistance', 'Office', 'OFAC', 'similar', 'market', 'letter', 'law', 'spirit', 'countries', 'Hungary', 'Kremlin', 'result', '14']",2022-06-02,2022-06-02,bne.eu

Trustee U.S. Bank Trust Company  National Association (as successor to U.S. Bank National Association).S-3RISK FACTORSBefore making any investment decision  including whether to participate in this offer  you should carefully consider the risk factors below as well as the risk factors discussed in Part II  Item 1A  “Risk Factors ” as well as Part I  Item 2  “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” in the Quarterly Report  and Part I  Item 1A  “Risk Factors ” as well as Part II  Item 7  “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” in the Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K  which are both incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement. See “Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference.” Based on the information currently known to us  we believe that the foregoing and the following information identifies all known material risk factors relating to the Notes and affecting this offer. However  the risks and uncertainties are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors referred to above and described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be less significant than these risk factors may also adversely affect our business. In addition  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. References in this section to “Norfolk Southern ” “we ” “our ” “us” or the “Company” refer to Norfolk Southern Corporation only unless the context otherwise requires.Risks Relating to the NotesWe may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event.Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event  each holder of Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but not including  the date of repurchase. If we experience a Change of Control Repurchase Event  we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy our obligations to repurchase the Notes. Furthermore  debt agreements to which we are a party at such time may contain restrictions and provisions limiting our ability to repurchase the Notes  and our ability to repurchase the Notes may also be limited by law. Our failure to repurchase the Notes as required under the indenture governing the Notes would result in a default under such indenture  which could have material adverse consequences to us and the holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control Repurchase Event.”The Change of Control Repurchase Event provision applicable to the Notes provides only limited protection.The definition of the term “Change of Control Repurchase Event” in the indenture governing the Notes is limited and does not cover a variety of transactions (such as acquisitions by us and recapitalizations or “going private” transactions by our affiliates) that could negatively affect the value of the Notes. A Change of Control under the indenture governing the Notes may only occur if there is a change in the controlling interest in our business. For a Change of Control Repurchase Event to occur  there must be not only a Change of Control as defined in that indenture  but also a ratings downgrade to below investment grade resulting therefrom. If we were to enter into a significant corporate transaction that negatively affects the value of the Notes  but would not result in a Change of Control Repurchase Event  you would not have any rights to require us to repurchase the Notes prior to their maturity and may be required to hold the Notes despite the occurrence of such a transaction  which could materially and adversely affect your investment. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control Repurchase Event.”We conduct our operations through our subsidiaries  and claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to those of creditors and any preferred equity holders of our subsidiaries.We are a holding company  and we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. We perform management  legal  financial  tax  consulting  administrative and other services for our subsidiaries.Our principal sources of cash are from external financings  dividends and advances from our subsidiaries  investments  payments by our subsidiaries for services rendered  and interest payments from our subsidiaries on cash advances. The amount of dividends available to us from our subsidiaries largely depends upon eachS-4subsidiary’s earnings and operating capital requirements. The ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments to us will depend upon the terms of any credit facilities or other debt instruments of the subsidiaries  upon the subsidiaries’ earnings  business and tax considerations and legal restrictions.As a result of our holding company structure  the Notes effectively rank junior to all existing and future debt  trade payables and other liabilities  and preferred equity of our subsidiaries. Our right and the right of our creditors to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon any liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors  including trade creditors and preferred equity holders  except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor of such a subsidiary. As of March 31  2022  total liabilities (other than intercompany liabilities) of our railroad subsidiaries were approximately $11.6 billion and total debt of our railroad subsidiaries was approximately $184 million.We cannot assure you that active trading markets will develop or be maintained for the Notes.The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no trading market. We cannot guarantee:· the liquidity or sustainability of any market that may develop for the Notes;· your ability to sell your Notes; or· the price at which you might be able to sell your Notes.Liquidity of any market for the Notes  and future trading price of the Notes  will depend on many factors  including:· prevailing interest rates;· any redemption by us of the Notes;· our operating results; and· the market for similar securities.The underwriters have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes  but they are not obligated to do so and may cease any market-making at any time without notice. In addition  the underwriters’ market-making activities will be subject to limits imposed by the Securities Act of 1933  as amended (the “Securities Act”)  and the Exchange Act. It may be difficult for you to find a buyer for the Notes at the time you want to sell them and  even if you find a buyer  you might not receive the price you want.S-5USE OF PROCEEDSOur net proceeds from the sale of the Notes after deducting the underwriting discount and our estimated offering expenses will be approximately $ million. We intend to use the net proceeds of the sale of the Notes for general corporate purposes.S-6DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTESThe following description of the Notes we are offering supplements and  to the extent applicable  supersedes the description of the general terms and provisions of our debt securities set forth in the accompanying prospectus under “Description of Debt Securities.” References in this section to “Norfolk Southern ” “we ” “our ” “us” or the “Company” refer to Norfolk Southern Corporation only unless the context otherwise requires.The Notes will be senior debt issued under an indenture  dated as of February 28  2018  as supplemented by a supplemental indenture thereto to be entered into on the settlement date of this offering (together  the “Indenture”)  between Norfolk Southern and U.S. Bank Trust Company  National Association (as successor to U.S. Bank National Association)   as trustee (the “Trustee”).GeneralThe Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per year  with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on and of each year  beginning on   20 (the “interest payment dates”). Interest on the Notes will be paid to holders of record on the or   as the case may be  immediately before the applicable interest payment date.If any interest payment date  redemption date or the maturity date falls on a day that is not a Business Day  the required payment shall be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due  and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such interest payment date  redemption date or the maturity date  as the case may be. “Business Day” means any day  other than a Saturday  a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York  New York are authorized or obligated by law  regulation  executive order or governmental decree to close. Interest  principal and any premium will be payable in U.S. dollars at the Trustee’s New York corporate trust office  which is located at 100 Wall Street  Suite 1600  New York  New York 10005. The Notes will mature on   2053. The Notes will be issued only in denominations of $2 000 and integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof. There will be no sinking fund payments for the Notes.RankingThe Notes will be our direct  unsecured unsubordinated obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of March 31  2022  prior to giving effect to the offering of the Notes  we had $15.0 billion of outstanding senior indebtedness (none of which is secured indebtedness) not including the debt of our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company  the Notes effectively will rank junior to all liabilities and preferred equity of our subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We conduct our operations through our subsidiaries  and claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to those of creditors and any preferred equity holders of our subsidiaries.” As of March 31  2022  total liabilities (other than intercompany liabilities) of our railroad subsidiaries were approximately $11.6 billion and debt of our railroad subsidiaries was approximately $184 million.Optional RedemptionPrior to   (six months prior to their maturity date) (the “Par Call Date”)  the Company may redeem the Notes at its option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of:(1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the Notes matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus basis points less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption  and(2) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus  in either case  accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.S-7On or after the Par Call Date  the Company may redeem the Notes  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.“Treasury Rate” means  with respect to any redemption date  the yield determined by the Company in accordance with the following two paragraphs.The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Company after 4:15 p.m.  New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)  on the third business day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as “Selected Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15” (or any successor designation or publication) (“H.15”) under the caption “U.S. government securities–Treasury constant maturities–Nominal” (or any successor caption or heading). In determining the Treasury Rate  the Company shall select  as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the redemption date to the Par Call Date (the “Remaining Life”); or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life  the two yields – one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life – and shall interpolate to the Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life  the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph  the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years  as applicable  of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date.If on the third business day preceding the redemption date H.15 or any successor designation or publication is no longer published  the Company shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  on the second business day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on  or with a maturity that is closest to  the Par Call Date  as applicable. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the Par Call Date  one with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the Par Call Date  the Company shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the Par Call Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence  the Company shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph  the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  of such United States Treasury security  and rounded to three decimal places.The Company’s actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes  absent manifest error.Notice of any redemption will be mailed or electronically delivered (or otherwise transmitted in accordance with the depositary’s procedures) at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed.In the case of a partial redemption  selection of the Notes for redemption will be made pro rata  by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems appropriate and fair. No Notes of a principal amount of $2 000 or less will be redeemed in part. If any note is to be redeemed in part only  the notice of redemption that relates to the note will state the portion of the principal amount of the note to be redeemed. A new note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the note will be issued in the name of the holder of the note upon surrender for cancellation of the original note. For so long as the Notes are held by DTC (or another depositary)  the redemption of the Notes shall be done in accordance with the policies and procedures of the depositary.S-8Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price  on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.Change of Control Repurchase EventIf a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs with respect to the Notes  unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described above  the Company will make an offer to each holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1 000) of that holder’s Notes at a repurchase price (the “repurchase price”) in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to  but not including  the repurchase date. Within 30 days following a Change of Control Repurchase Event or  at the Company’s option  prior to a Change of Control  but after the public announcement of such Change of Control  the Company will mail  or cause to be mailed  a notice to each holder of the Notes  with a copy to the Trustee  describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the payment date specified in the notice (such offer the “repurchase offer” and such date the “repurchase date”)  which repurchase date will be a Business Day that is no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice shall  if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control  state that the repurchase offer is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the repurchase date.The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act  and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes  the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.On the repurchase date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event  the Company will  to the extent lawful:(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the repurchase offer;(2) deposit with the Trustee  or with such paying agent as the Trustee may designate  an amount equal to the aggregate repurchase price for all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and(3) deliver  or cause to be delivered  to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted  together with an Officers’ Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes being repurchased by the Company pursuant to the repurchase offer and that all conditions precedent to the repurchase by the Company of Notes pursuant to the repurchase offer have been complied with.The Trustee will promptly mail  or cause the paying agent to promptly mail  to each holder of Notes  or portions of Notes  properly tendered the repurchase price for such Notes  or portions of such Notes  and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered  as applicable; provided that each new note will be in a principal amount equal to $2 000 and integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof.The Company will not be required to make a repurchase offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner  at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a repurchase at the option of holders  the following definitions are applicable:“Below Investment Grade Ratings Event” means  with respect to the Notes  on any day within the 60-day period (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any Rating Agency) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a ChangeS-9of Control; or (2) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the intention by the Company to effect a Change of Control  the Notes are rated below investment grade by each and every Rating Agency.Notwithstanding the foregoing  a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company’s request that the reduction was the result  in whole or in part  of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of  or in respect of  the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Ratings Event).“Change of Control” means the consummation of any transaction (including  without limitation  any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act)  other than the Company or its subsidiaries  becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act)  directly or indirectly  of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company’s voting stock or other voting stock into which the Company’s voting stock is reclassified  consolidated  exchanged or changed measured by voting power rather than number of shares.“Change of Control Repurchase Event” means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event with respect to the Notes.“Investment grade” means  with respect to Moody’s  a rating of Baa3 or better (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of Moody’s); with respect to S&P  a rating of BBB- or better (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of S&P); and  with respect to any additional Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Company  the equivalent investment grade credit rating.“Moody’s” means Moody’s Investors Service  Inc.  a subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation  and its successors.“Rating Agency” means (1) each of Moody’s and S&P; and (2) if either of Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Company’s control  a “nationally recognized statistical rating organization” as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act  selected by the Company (as certified by a Board Resolution) as a replacement agency for Moody’s or S&P  or both of them  as the case may be.“S&P” means S&P Global Ratings  a division of S&P Global Inc.  and its successors.“voting stock” of any specified “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date means the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.The Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company and  thus  the removal of incumbent management. We could  in the future  enter into certain transactions  including acquisitions  refinancings or other recapitalizations  that would not constitute a Change of Control Repurchase Event under the Notes  but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings on the Notes.If we experience a Change of Control Repurchase Event  we may not have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy our obligations to repurchase all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered. Furthermore  debt agreements to which we are a party at such time may contain restrictions and provisions limiting our ability to repurchase the Notes. Our failure to repurchase the Notes as required under the Indenture would result in a default under the Indenture  which could have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the Notes.The definition of the term “Change of Control Repurchase Event” is limited and does not cover a variety of transactions (such as acquisitions by us and recapitalizations or “going private” transactions by our affiliates) that could negatively affect the value of the Notes. A Change of Control may only occur if there is a change in theS-10controlling interest in our business. For a Change of Control Repurchase Event to occur  there must be not only a Change of Control  but also a ratings downgrade to below investment grade resulting therefrom. If we were to enter into a significant corporate transaction that negatively affects the value of the Notes  but would not result in a Change of Control Repurchase Event  you would not have any rights to require us to repurchase the Notes prior to their maturity and may be required to hold the Notes despite the event  which could materially and adversely affect your investment.Concerning the TrusteeThe holders of a majority  in aggregate principal amount  of the Notes will have the right to direct the time  method and place to conduct any proceeding to exercise any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes  subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that if an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) occurs (and is not cured) with respect to the Notes  the Trustee will be required  in the exercise of its power  to use the same degree of care and skill a prudent person would use in the conduct of that person’s own affairs. Subject to this standard  the Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its powers under the Indenture at the request of a holder of Notes  unless the holder offers to indemnify the Trustee against any loss  liability or expense  and then only to the extent required by the terms of the Indenture.Further IssuesWe may from time to time  without notice to or the consent of the registered holders of the Notes  create and issue further notes ranking pari passu with the Notes in all respects (or in all respects except for the issue date  price to public  payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such further notes or the first payment of interest following the issue date of such further notes) so that such further notes may be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes and have the same terms as to status  redemption or otherwise as the Notes; provided  however  if such further notes are not fungible with the original Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes  such further notes will have a different CUSIP number than the original Notes and will trade separately from the original Notes.Governing LawThe Indenture and the Notes will be governed by  and construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York  except to the extent the Trust Indenture Act of 1939  as amended  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  shall be applicable.Book-Entry SystemThe following are summaries of certain rules and operating procedures of DTC that affect the payment of principal and interest and the transfers of interests in the global notes (the “Global Notes”). Upon issuance  the Notes will be issued only in the form of one or more definitive global securities which will be deposited with  or on behalf of  DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co.  as nominee of DTC. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Notes in definitive form under the limited circumstances described below  a Global Note may not be transferred except as a whole (1) by DTC to a nominee  (2) by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC or (3) by DTC or any such nominee to a successor of DTC or a nominee of such successor.Ownership of beneficial interests in a Global Note will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC for such Global Note (“participants”) or persons that may hold interests through participants. Upon the issuance of a Global Note  DTC will credit  on its book-entry registration and transfer system  the participants’ accounts with the respective principal amounts of the Notes represented by such Global Note beneficially owned by such participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on  and the transfer of such ownership interests will be effected only through  records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of participants). The laws of some states may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may limit or impair the ability to own  transfer or pledge beneficial interests in the Global Notes.S-11So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of a Global Note  DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture. Except as set forth below  owners of beneficial interests in a Global Note will not be entitled to have Notes represented by such Global Note registered in their names  will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of such Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or holders thereof under the Indenture. Accordingly  each person owning a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of DTC and  if such person is not a participant  on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest  to exercise any rights of a holder under the Indenture. We understand that under existing industry practices  if we request any action of holders or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture  DTC would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take such action  and such participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants to give or to take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners holding through them.Principal and interest payments on interests represented by a Global Note will be made to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered owner of such Global Note. None of Norfolk Southern  the Trustee or any other agent of Norfolk Southern or agent of the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any facet of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership of interests. We expect that DTC  upon receipt of any payment of principal or interest in respect of a Global Note  will immediately credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in such Global Note as shown on the records of DTC. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing customer instructions and customary practice  as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name ” and will be the responsibility of such participants.A Global Note will be exchangeable for Notes in definitive form only if (i) we deliver to the Trustee a notice from DTC that (A) DTC is no longer willing or able to continue as depositary for such Global Note or (B) DTC ceases to be a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act and  in either case  we are unable to locate a qualified successor within 90 days  (ii) we  at our option  notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of such Notes in definitive form or (iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing a Default or an Event of Default (each as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes. Any Global Note that is so exchangeable will  upon surrender by DTC  be exchangeable for Notes registered in such names as DTC shall direct in writing. It is expected that such directions will be based upon directions received by DTC from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes.DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the Banking Law of the State of New York  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold the securities of its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations  some of which (and/or their representatives) own DTC. Access to the DTC book-entry system is also available to others  such as banks  brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant  either directly or indirectly.Same-Day Settlement and PaymentSettlement for the Notes will be made by the underwriters in immediately available funds. All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes will be made by us in immediately available funds.The Notes will trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System until maturity and secondary market trading activity in the Notes will settle in immediately available funds. No assurance can be given as to the effect  if any  of settlement in immediately available funds on trading activity in the Notes.S-12U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERSThe following discussion is a summary of United States federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the ownership and disposition of the Notes by a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below). This discussion does not address specific tax consequences that may be relevant to particular persons in light of their individual circumstances (including  for example  entities treated as partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes or partners or members therein  banks or other financial institutions  broker-dealers  insurance companies  regulated investment companies  tax-exempt entities  common trust funds  certain expatriates  controlled foreign corporations  dealers in securities or currencies  accrual method taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of their use of financial statements  and persons in special situations  such as those who hold the Notes as part of a straddle  hedge  synthetic security  conversion transaction or other integrated investment comprised of the Notes and one or more other investments). This discussion is limited to Non-U.S. Holders that purchase the Notes in this offering at their issue price and that hold such Notes as capital assets for United States federal income tax purposes. In addition  this discussion does not describe any tax consequences arising under United States federal gift and estate tax  the Medicare tax on net investment income or other U.S. federal tax laws or under the tax laws of any state  local or foreign jurisdiction. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the “Code”)  the Treasury Regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”) promulgated thereunder  and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof  all as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change  possibly with retroactive effect.Prospective purchasers of the Notes are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the United States federal income tax consequences to them of acquiring  owning and disposing of the Notes  as well as the application of state  local and foreign income and other tax laws.For purposes of this discussion  a Non-U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of the Notes  other than a partnership (or entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes)  that is not a U.S. person. A “U.S. person” means (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation (including an entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States  any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate  the income of which is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of the source; or (iv) a trust  if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all its substantial decisions.Payments of Interest. Subject to the discussion under “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” and “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ” payments of interest on the Notes made by us or our agent to a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal withholding tax  provided that:(1) the Non-U.S. Holder does not actually or constructively own 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote;(2) the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us  directly or indirectly  through stock ownership; and(3) either (A) the beneficial owner of the Notes certifies to the applicable withholding agent on Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form)  under penalties of perjury  that it is not a U.S. person  provides its name and address and renews the certificate periodically as required by the applicable Treasury Regulations  or (B) the Notes are held through certain foreign intermediaries and the beneficial owner of the Notes satisfies certain certification requirements of the applicable Treasury Regulations and  in either case  such withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such beneficial owner is a U.S. person.S-13If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements of the exemption described above  payments of interest made to such Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to a 30% withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the Notes provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed:(1) IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) claiming an exemption from withholding or reduced rate of tax under an applicable tax treaty (a “Treaty Exemption”)  or(2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) stating that interest paid on the Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the beneficial owner  each such form to be renewed periodically as required by the Treasury Regulations.If interest on the Notes is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the beneficial owner (and  if certain tax treaties apply  is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder within the United States)  the Non-U.S. Holder  although exempt from the withholding tax described above  will generally be subject to United States federal income tax on the receipt or accrual of such interest on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a U.S. person. In addition  if such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation  it may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year  subject to adjustments. For this purpose  interest on the Notes will be included in such foreign corporation’s earnings and profits.Disposition of the Notes. No withholding of United States federal income tax generally will be required with respect to any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder upon the sale  exchange or other taxable disposition of the Notes.In addition  a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to United States federal income tax on gain realized on the sale  exchange or other taxable disposition of the Notes unless (i) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 or more days in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are met  or (ii) such gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. trade or business and  if certain tax treaties apply  is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder within the United States.Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. In general  backup withholding and information reporting will not apply to a payment of interest on a Note to a Non-U.S. Holder  or to proceeds from the disposition of a Note by a Non-U.S. Holder  in each case  if the holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a Non-U.S. Holder and the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know to the contrary. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be refunded or credited against the Non-U.S. Holder’s United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. In certain circumstances  if a Note is not held through a qualified intermediary  the amount of payments made on such Note  the name and address of the beneficial owner and the amount  if any  of tax withheld may be reported to the IRS.Foreign Account Tax Compliance ActSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (commonly referred to as the “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act” or “FATCA”) generally impose withholding at a rate of 30% in certain circumstances on interest payable on the Notes held by or through certain financial institutions (including investment funds)  unless such institution certifies that it has entered into  and complies with  an agreement with the IRS to report  on an annual basis  information with respect to certain interests in  and accounts maintained by  the institution that are owned by certain U.S. persons or by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons and to withhold on certain payments. Similarly  interest payable on the Notes held by an investor that is a non-financial non-U.S. entity that does not qualify under certain exemptions generally will be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%  unless such entity either (y) certifies that such entity does not have any “substantial United States owners” or (z) provides certain information regarding the entity’s “substantial United States owners ” which will in turn be provided to the United States Department of the Treasury. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these rules on an investment in the Notes.S-14UNDERWRITINGUnder the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus supplement  the underwriters named below  for whom BofA Securities  Inc.  Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  and Wells Fargo Securities  LLC are acting as representatives  have severally and not jointly agreed to purchase  and we have agreed to sell to them  severally  the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their names below:Underwriters Principal Amount of Notes BofA Securities  Inc. $ Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Wells Fargo Securities  LLC Total $The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes offered hereby are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to take and pay for all of the Notes if any Notes are taken. The offering of the Notes by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.The underwriters have advised us that they propose initially to offer the Notes to the public at the public offering price on the cover page of this prospectus supplement  and to dealers at that price less a concession not in excess of % of the principal amount of the Notes. The underwriters may allow  and the dealers may reallow  a discount not in excess of % of the principal amount of the Notes to other dealers. After the Notes are released to the public  the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the underwriters.The expenses of the offering payable by us  not including the underwriting discount  are estimated to be $ .We have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities  including liabilities under the Securities Act  or to contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.In order to facilitate the offering of these securities  the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize  maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes or any other notes the prices of which may be used to determine payments on the Notes. Specifically  the underwriters may sell more Notes than they are obligated to purchase in connection with the offering  creating a short position for their own accounts. A short sale is covered by purchasing the Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. As an additional means of facilitating the offering  the underwriters may bid for  and purchase  the Notes or any other notes in the open market to stabilize the price of the Notes or of any other notes. Finally  in any offering of the Notes through a syndicate of underwriters or dealer group  the underwriters acting on behalf of the underwriting syndicate or for themselves may impose a penalty bid  whereby the underwriters reclaim selling concessions allowed to an underwriter or a dealer for distributing the Notes in the offering  if the underwriters repurchase previously distributed Notes to cover syndicate short positions or to stabilize the price of the Notes. Any of these activities may raise or maintain the market price of the Notes above independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of the Notes. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities  and may end any of these activities at any time without notice.In general  purchases of a Note for the purpose of stabilizing or reducing a syndicate short position could cause the price of the Note to be higher than it might otherwise be in the absence of such purchases without notice.S-15Neither we nor the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes.The underwriters and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities  which may include securities trading  commercial and investment banking  financial advisory  investment management  investment research  principal investment  hedging  financing and brokerage activities. Each of the underwriters and/or its affiliates may have performed certain investment banking  commercial banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and expenses. Certain of the underwriters and/or their affiliates are lenders under our existing unsecured revolving credit facility. The underwriters may  from time to time  engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they will receive customary fees and expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities  the underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers  and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Company. If any of the underwriters or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us  certain of those underwriters and their affiliates routinely hedge  and certain other of those underwriters or their affiliates may hedge  their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically  such underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities  including potentially the Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading price of the Notes offered hereby. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold  or recommend to clients that they acquire  long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on the cover page of this prospectus supplement  which will be the seventh business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being referred to herein as “T+7”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next four business days will be required  by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+7  to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next four business days should consult their own advisor.Selling RestrictionsCanadaThe Notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing  or deemed to be purchasing  as principal that are accredited investors  as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario)  and are permitted clients  as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements  Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the Notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from  or in a transaction not subject to  the prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or damages if this prospectus supplement (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation  provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105)  the underwriters are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.S-16European Economic AreaProhibition of Sales to EEA Retail InvestorsThe Notes may not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA.

Trustee U.S. Bank Trust Company  National Association (as successor to U.S. Bank National Association).S-3RISK FACTORSBefore making any investment decision  including whether to participate in this offer  you should carefully consider the risk factors below as well as the risk factors discussed in Part II  Item 1A  “Risk Factors ” as well as Part I  Item 2  “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” in the Quarterly Report  and Part I  Item 1A  “Risk Factors ” as well as Part II  Item 7  “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” in the Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K  which are both incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement. See “Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference.” Based on the information currently known to us  we believe that the foregoing and the following information identifies all known material risk factors relating to the Notes and affecting this offer. However  the risks and uncertainties are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors referred to above and described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be less significant than these risk factors may also adversely affect our business. In addition  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. References in this section to “Norfolk Southern ” “we ” “our ” “us” or the “Company” refer to Norfolk Southern Corporation only unless the context otherwise requires.Risks Relating to the NotesWe may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event.Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event  each holder of Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but not including  the date of repurchase. If we experience a Change of Control Repurchase Event  we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy our obligations to repurchase the Notes. Furthermore  debt agreements to which we are a party at such time may contain restrictions and provisions limiting our ability to repurchase the Notes  and our ability to repurchase the Notes may also be limited by law. Our failure to repurchase the Notes as required under the indenture governing the Notes would result in a default under such indenture  which could have material adverse consequences to us and the holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control Repurchase Event.”The Change of Control Repurchase Event provision applicable to the Notes provides only limited protection.The definition of the term “Change of Control Repurchase Event” in the indenture governing the Notes is limited and does not cover a variety of transactions (such as acquisitions by us and recapitalizations or “going private” transactions by our affiliates) that could negatively affect the value of the Notes. A Change of Control under the indenture governing the Notes may only occur if there is a change in the controlling interest in our business. For a Change of Control Repurchase Event to occur  there must be not only a Change of Control as defined in that indenture  but also a ratings downgrade to below investment grade resulting therefrom. If we were to enter into a significant corporate transaction that negatively affects the value of the Notes  but would not result in a Change of Control Repurchase Event  you would not have any rights to require us to repurchase the Notes prior to their maturity and may be required to hold the Notes despite the occurrence of such a transaction  which could materially and adversely affect your investment. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control Repurchase Event.”We conduct our operations through our subsidiaries  and claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to those of creditors and any preferred equity holders of our subsidiaries.We are a holding company  and we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. We perform management  legal  financial  tax  consulting  administrative and other services for our subsidiaries.Our principal sources of cash are from external financings  dividends and advances from our subsidiaries  investments  payments by our subsidiaries for services rendered  and interest payments from our subsidiaries on cash advances. The amount of dividends available to us from our subsidiaries largely depends upon eachS-4subsidiary’s earnings and operating capital requirements. The ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments to us will depend upon the terms of any credit facilities or other debt instruments of the subsidiaries  upon the subsidiaries’ earnings  business and tax considerations and legal restrictions.As a result of our holding company structure  the Notes effectively rank junior to all existing and future debt  trade payables and other liabilities  and preferred equity of our subsidiaries. Our right and the right of our creditors to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon any liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary will be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors  including trade creditors and preferred equity holders  except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor of such a subsidiary. As of March 31  2022  total liabilities (other than intercompany liabilities) of our railroad subsidiaries were approximately $11.6 billion and total debt of our railroad subsidiaries was approximately $184 million.We cannot assure you that active trading markets will develop or be maintained for the Notes.The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no trading market. We cannot guarantee:· the liquidity or sustainability of any market that may develop for the Notes;· your ability to sell your Notes; or· the price at which you might be able to sell your Notes.Liquidity of any market for the Notes  and future trading price of the Notes  will depend on many factors  including:· prevailing interest rates;· any redemption by us of the Notes;· our operating results; and· the market for similar securities.The underwriters have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes  but they are not obligated to do so and may cease any market-making at any time without notice. In addition  the underwriters’ market-making activities will be subject to limits imposed by the Securities Act of 1933  as amended (the “Securities Act”)  and the Exchange Act. It may be difficult for you to find a buyer for the Notes at the time you want to sell them and  even if you find a buyer  you might not receive the price you want.S-5USE OF PROCEEDSOur net proceeds from the sale of the Notes after deducting the underwriting discount and our estimated offering expenses will be approximately $ million. We intend to use the net proceeds of the sale of the Notes for general corporate purposes.S-6DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTESThe following description of the Notes we are offering supplements and  to the extent applicable  supersedes the description of the general terms and provisions of our debt securities set forth in the accompanying prospectus under “Description of Debt Securities.” References in this section to “Norfolk Southern ” “we ” “our ” “us” or the “Company” refer to Norfolk Southern Corporation only unless the context otherwise requires.The Notes will be senior debt issued under an indenture  dated as of February 28  2018  as supplemented by a supplemental indenture thereto to be entered into on the settlement date of this offering (together  the “Indenture”)  between Norfolk Southern and U.S. Bank Trust Company  National Association (as successor to U.S. Bank National Association)   as trustee (the “Trustee”).GeneralThe Notes will bear interest at a rate of % per year  with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on and of each year  beginning on   20 (the “interest payment dates”). Interest on the Notes will be paid to holders of record on the or   as the case may be  immediately before the applicable interest payment date.If any interest payment date  redemption date or the maturity date falls on a day that is not a Business Day  the required payment shall be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due  and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such interest payment date  redemption date or the maturity date  as the case may be. “Business Day” means any day  other than a Saturday  a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York  New York are authorized or obligated by law  regulation  executive order or governmental decree to close. Interest  principal and any premium will be payable in U.S. dollars at the Trustee’s New York corporate trust office  which is located at 100 Wall Street  Suite 1600  New York  New York 10005. The Notes will mature on   2053. The Notes will be issued only in denominations of $2 000 and integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof. There will be no sinking fund payments for the Notes.RankingThe Notes will be our direct  unsecured unsubordinated obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of March 31  2022  prior to giving effect to the offering of the Notes  we had $15.0 billion of outstanding senior indebtedness (none of which is secured indebtedness) not including the debt of our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company  the Notes effectively will rank junior to all liabilities and preferred equity of our subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We conduct our operations through our subsidiaries  and claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to those of creditors and any preferred equity holders of our subsidiaries.” As of March 31  2022  total liabilities (other than intercompany liabilities) of our railroad subsidiaries were approximately $11.6 billion and debt of our railroad subsidiaries was approximately $184 million.Optional RedemptionPrior to   (six months prior to their maturity date) (the “Par Call Date”)  the Company may redeem the Notes at its option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of:(1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the Notes matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus basis points less (b) interest accrued to the date of redemption  and(2) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus  in either case  accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.S-7On or after the Par Call Date  the Company may redeem the Notes  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.“Treasury Rate” means  with respect to any redemption date  the yield determined by the Company in accordance with the following two paragraphs.The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Company after 4:15 p.m.  New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)  on the third business day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as “Selected Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15” (or any successor designation or publication) (“H.15”) under the caption “U.S. government securities–Treasury constant maturities–Nominal” (or any successor caption or heading). In determining the Treasury Rate  the Company shall select  as applicable: (1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the redemption date to the Par Call Date (the “Remaining Life”); or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life  the two yields – one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life – and shall interpolate to the Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life  the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph  the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years  as applicable  of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date.If on the third business day preceding the redemption date H.15 or any successor designation or publication is no longer published  the Company shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  on the second business day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on  or with a maturity that is closest to  the Par Call Date  as applicable. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the Par Call Date but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the Par Call Date  one with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the Par Call Date  the Company shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the Par Call Date or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence  the Company shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph  the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  of such United States Treasury security  and rounded to three decimal places.The Company’s actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes  absent manifest error.Notice of any redemption will be mailed or electronically delivered (or otherwise transmitted in accordance with the depositary’s procedures) at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed.In the case of a partial redemption  selection of the Notes for redemption will be made pro rata  by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems appropriate and fair. No Notes of a principal amount of $2 000 or less will be redeemed in part. If any note is to be redeemed in part only  the notice of redemption that relates to the note will state the portion of the principal amount of the note to be redeemed. A new note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the note will be issued in the name of the holder of the note upon surrender for cancellation of the original note. For so long as the Notes are held by DTC (or another depositary)  the redemption of the Notes shall be done in accordance with the policies and procedures of the depositary.S-8Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price  on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.Change of Control Repurchase EventIf a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs with respect to the Notes  unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described above  the Company will make an offer to each holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1 000) of that holder’s Notes at a repurchase price (the “repurchase price”) in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to  but not including  the repurchase date. Within 30 days following a Change of Control Repurchase Event or  at the Company’s option  prior to a Change of Control  but after the public announcement of such Change of Control  the Company will mail  or cause to be mailed  a notice to each holder of the Notes  with a copy to the Trustee  describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the Notes on the payment date specified in the notice (such offer the “repurchase offer” and such date the “repurchase date”)  which repurchase date will be a Business Day that is no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice shall  if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control  state that the repurchase offer is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the repurchase date.The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act  and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes  the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes by virtue of such conflict.On the repurchase date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event  the Company will  to the extent lawful:(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the repurchase offer;(2) deposit with the Trustee  or with such paying agent as the Trustee may designate  an amount equal to the aggregate repurchase price for all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and(3) deliver  or cause to be delivered  to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted  together with an Officers’ Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes being repurchased by the Company pursuant to the repurchase offer and that all conditions precedent to the repurchase by the Company of Notes pursuant to the repurchase offer have been complied with.The Trustee will promptly mail  or cause the paying agent to promptly mail  to each holder of Notes  or portions of Notes  properly tendered the repurchase price for such Notes  or portions of such Notes  and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Notes surrendered  as applicable; provided that each new note will be in a principal amount equal to $2 000 and integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof.The Company will not be required to make a repurchase offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner  at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such an offer made by the Company and such third party purchases all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a repurchase at the option of holders  the following definitions are applicable:“Below Investment Grade Ratings Event” means  with respect to the Notes  on any day within the 60-day period (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any Rating Agency) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a ChangeS-9of Control; or (2) public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control or the intention by the Company to effect a Change of Control  the Notes are rated below investment grade by each and every Rating Agency.Notwithstanding the foregoing  a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company’s request that the reduction was the result  in whole or in part  of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of  or in respect of  the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Below Investment Grade Ratings Event).“Change of Control” means the consummation of any transaction (including  without limitation  any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act)  other than the Company or its subsidiaries  becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act)  directly or indirectly  of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company’s voting stock or other voting stock into which the Company’s voting stock is reclassified  consolidated  exchanged or changed measured by voting power rather than number of shares.“Change of Control Repurchase Event” means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event with respect to the Notes.“Investment grade” means  with respect to Moody’s  a rating of Baa3 or better (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of Moody’s); with respect to S&P  a rating of BBB- or better (or its equivalent under any successor rating categories of S&P); and  with respect to any additional Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Company  the equivalent investment grade credit rating.“Moody’s” means Moody’s Investors Service  Inc.  a subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation  and its successors.“Rating Agency” means (1) each of Moody’s and S&P; and (2) if either of Moody’s or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Company’s control  a “nationally recognized statistical rating organization” as defined in Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act  selected by the Company (as certified by a Board Resolution) as a replacement agency for Moody’s or S&P  or both of them  as the case may be.“S&P” means S&P Global Ratings  a division of S&P Global Inc.  and its successors.“voting stock” of any specified “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date means the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.The Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Company and  thus  the removal of incumbent management. We could  in the future  enter into certain transactions  including acquisitions  refinancings or other recapitalizations  that would not constitute a Change of Control Repurchase Event under the Notes  but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings on the Notes.If we experience a Change of Control Repurchase Event  we may not have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy our obligations to repurchase all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered. Furthermore  debt agreements to which we are a party at such time may contain restrictions and provisions limiting our ability to repurchase the Notes. Our failure to repurchase the Notes as required under the Indenture would result in a default under the Indenture  which could have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the Notes.The definition of the term “Change of Control Repurchase Event” is limited and does not cover a variety of transactions (such as acquisitions by us and recapitalizations or “going private” transactions by our affiliates) that could negatively affect the value of the Notes. A Change of Control may only occur if there is a change in theS-10controlling interest in our business. For a Change of Control Repurchase Event to occur  there must be not only a Change of Control  but also a ratings downgrade to below investment grade resulting therefrom. If we were to enter into a significant corporate transaction that negatively affects the value of the Notes  but would not result in a Change of Control Repurchase Event  you would not have any rights to require us to repurchase the Notes prior to their maturity and may be required to hold the Notes despite the event  which could materially and adversely affect your investment.Concerning the TrusteeThe holders of a majority  in aggregate principal amount  of the Notes will have the right to direct the time  method and place to conduct any proceeding to exercise any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes  subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that if an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) occurs (and is not cured) with respect to the Notes  the Trustee will be required  in the exercise of its power  to use the same degree of care and skill a prudent person would use in the conduct of that person’s own affairs. Subject to this standard  the Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its powers under the Indenture at the request of a holder of Notes  unless the holder offers to indemnify the Trustee against any loss  liability or expense  and then only to the extent required by the terms of the Indenture.Further IssuesWe may from time to time  without notice to or the consent of the registered holders of the Notes  create and issue further notes ranking pari passu with the Notes in all respects (or in all respects except for the issue date  price to public  payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of such further notes or the first payment of interest following the issue date of such further notes) so that such further notes may be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes and have the same terms as to status  redemption or otherwise as the Notes; provided  however  if such further notes are not fungible with the original Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes  such further notes will have a different CUSIP number than the original Notes and will trade separately from the original Notes.Governing LawThe Indenture and the Notes will be governed by  and construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York  except to the extent the Trust Indenture Act of 1939  as amended  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  shall be applicable.Book-Entry SystemThe following are summaries of certain rules and operating procedures of DTC that affect the payment of principal and interest and the transfers of interests in the global notes (the “Global Notes”). Upon issuance  the Notes will be issued only in the form of one or more definitive global securities which will be deposited with  or on behalf of  DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co.  as nominee of DTC. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Notes in definitive form under the limited circumstances described below  a Global Note may not be transferred except as a whole (1) by DTC to a nominee  (2) by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC or (3) by DTC or any such nominee to a successor of DTC or a nominee of such successor.Ownership of beneficial interests in a Global Note will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC for such Global Note (“participants”) or persons that may hold interests through participants. Upon the issuance of a Global Note  DTC will credit  on its book-entry registration and transfer system  the participants’ accounts with the respective principal amounts of the Notes represented by such Global Note beneficially owned by such participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on  and the transfer of such ownership interests will be effected only through  records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of participants). The laws of some states may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may limit or impair the ability to own  transfer or pledge beneficial interests in the Global Notes.S-11So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of a Global Note  DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture. Except as set forth below  owners of beneficial interests in a Global Note will not be entitled to have Notes represented by such Global Note registered in their names  will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of such Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or holders thereof under the Indenture. Accordingly  each person owning a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of DTC and  if such person is not a participant  on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest  to exercise any rights of a holder under the Indenture. We understand that under existing industry practices  if we request any action of holders or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture  DTC would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take such action  and such participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants to give or to take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners holding through them.Principal and interest payments on interests represented by a Global Note will be made to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered owner of such Global Note. None of Norfolk Southern  the Trustee or any other agent of Norfolk Southern or agent of the Trustee will have any responsibility or liability for any facet of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership of interests. We expect that DTC  upon receipt of any payment of principal or interest in respect of a Global Note  will immediately credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in such Global Note as shown on the records of DTC. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing customer instructions and customary practice  as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name ” and will be the responsibility of such participants.A Global Note will be exchangeable for Notes in definitive form only if (i) we deliver to the Trustee a notice from DTC that (A) DTC is no longer willing or able to continue as depositary for such Global Note or (B) DTC ceases to be a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act and  in either case  we are unable to locate a qualified successor within 90 days  (ii) we  at our option  notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of such Notes in definitive form or (iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing a Default or an Event of Default (each as defined in the Indenture) with respect to the Notes. Any Global Note that is so exchangeable will  upon surrender by DTC  be exchangeable for Notes registered in such names as DTC shall direct in writing. It is expected that such directions will be based upon directions received by DTC from participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes.DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the Banking Law of the State of New York  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold the securities of its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations  some of which (and/or their representatives) own DTC. Access to the DTC book-entry system is also available to others  such as banks  brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant  either directly or indirectly.Same-Day Settlement and PaymentSettlement for the Notes will be made by the underwriters in immediately available funds. All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes will be made by us in immediately available funds.The Notes will trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System until maturity and secondary market trading activity in the Notes will settle in immediately available funds. No assurance can be given as to the effect  if any  of settlement in immediately available funds on trading activity in the Notes.S-12U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERSThe following discussion is a summary of United States federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the ownership and disposition of the Notes by a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined below). This discussion does not address specific tax consequences that may be relevant to particular persons in light of their individual circumstances (including  for example  entities treated as partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes or partners or members therein  banks or other financial institutions  broker-dealers  insurance companies  regulated investment companies  tax-exempt entities  common trust funds  certain expatriates  controlled foreign corporations  dealers in securities or currencies  accrual method taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of their use of financial statements  and persons in special situations  such as those who hold the Notes as part of a straddle  hedge  synthetic security  conversion transaction or other integrated investment comprised of the Notes and one or more other investments). This discussion is limited to Non-U.S. Holders that purchase the Notes in this offering at their issue price and that hold such Notes as capital assets for United States federal income tax purposes. In addition  this discussion does not describe any tax consequences arising under United States federal gift and estate tax  the Medicare tax on net investment income or other U.S. federal tax laws or under the tax laws of any state  local or foreign jurisdiction. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the “Code”)  the Treasury Regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”) promulgated thereunder  and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof  all as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change  possibly with retroactive effect.Prospective purchasers of the Notes are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the United States federal income tax consequences to them of acquiring  owning and disposing of the Notes  as well as the application of state  local and foreign income and other tax laws.For purposes of this discussion  a Non-U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of the Notes  other than a partnership (or entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes)  that is not a U.S. person. A “U.S. person” means (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation (including an entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States  any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate  the income of which is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of the source; or (iv) a trust  if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all its substantial decisions.Payments of Interest. Subject to the discussion under “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” and “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ” payments of interest on the Notes made by us or our agent to a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal withholding tax  provided that:(1) the Non-U.S. Holder does not actually or constructively own 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote;(2) the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us  directly or indirectly  through stock ownership; and(3) either (A) the beneficial owner of the Notes certifies to the applicable withholding agent on Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form)  under penalties of perjury  that it is not a U.S. person  provides its name and address and renews the certificate periodically as required by the applicable Treasury Regulations  or (B) the Notes are held through certain foreign intermediaries and the beneficial owner of the Notes satisfies certain certification requirements of the applicable Treasury Regulations and  in either case  such withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such beneficial owner is a U.S. person.S-13If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements of the exemption described above  payments of interest made to such Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to a 30% withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the Notes provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed:(1) IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) claiming an exemption from withholding or reduced rate of tax under an applicable tax treaty (a “Treaty Exemption”)  or(2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) stating that interest paid on the Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the beneficial owner  each such form to be renewed periodically as required by the Treasury Regulations.If interest on the Notes is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the beneficial owner (and  if certain tax treaties apply  is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder within the United States)  the Non-U.S. Holder  although exempt from the withholding tax described above  will generally be subject to United States federal income tax on the receipt or accrual of such interest on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a U.S. person. In addition  if such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation  it may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year  subject to adjustments. For this purpose  interest on the Notes will be included in such foreign corporation’s earnings and profits.Disposition of the Notes. No withholding of United States federal income tax generally will be required with respect to any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder upon the sale  exchange or other taxable disposition of the Notes.In addition  a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to United States federal income tax on gain realized on the sale  exchange or other taxable disposition of the Notes unless (i) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 or more days in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are met  or (ii) such gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. trade or business and  if certain tax treaties apply  is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder within the United States.Information Reporting and Backup Withholding. In general  backup withholding and information reporting will not apply to a payment of interest on a Note to a Non-U.S. Holder  or to proceeds from the disposition of a Note by a Non-U.S. Holder  in each case  if the holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is a Non-U.S. Holder and the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know to the contrary. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be refunded or credited against the Non-U.S. Holder’s United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. In certain circumstances  if a Note is not held through a qualified intermediary  the amount of payments made on such Note  the name and address of the beneficial owner and the amount  if any  of tax withheld may be reported to the IRS.Foreign Account Tax Compliance ActSections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (commonly referred to as the “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act” or “FATCA”) generally impose withholding at a rate of 30% in certain circumstances on interest payable on the Notes held by or through certain financial institutions (including investment funds)  unless such institution certifies that it has entered into  and complies with  an agreement with the IRS to report  on an annual basis  information with respect to certain interests in  and accounts maintained by  the institution that are owned by certain U.S. persons or by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons and to withhold on certain payments. Similarly  interest payable on the Notes held by an investor that is a non-financial non-U.S. entity that does not qualify under certain exemptions generally will be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%  unless such entity either (y) certifies that such entity does not have any “substantial United States owners” or (z) provides certain information regarding the entity’s “substantial United States owners ” which will in turn be provided to the United States Department of the Treasury. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these rules on an investment in the Notes.S-14UNDERWRITINGUnder the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus supplement  the underwriters named below  for whom BofA Securities  Inc.

After the Notes are released to the public  the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the underwriters.The expenses of the offering payable by us  not including the underwriting discount  are estimated to be $ .We have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities  including liabilities under the Securities Act  or to contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.In order to facilitate the offering of these securities  the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize  maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes or any other notes the prices of which may be used to determine payments on the Notes. Specifically  the underwriters may sell more Notes than they are obligated to purchase in connection with the offering  creating a short position for their own accounts. A short sale is covered by purchasing the Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. As an additional means of facilitating the offering  the underwriters may bid for  and purchase  the Notes or any other notes in the open market to stabilize the price of the Notes or of any other notes. Finally  in any offering of the Notes through a syndicate of underwriters or dealer group  the underwriters acting on behalf of the underwriting syndicate or for themselves may impose a penalty bid  whereby the underwriters reclaim selling concessions allowed to an underwriter or a dealer for distributing the Notes in the offering  if the underwriters repurchase previously distributed Notes to cover syndicate short positions or to stabilize the price of the Notes. Any of these activities may raise or maintain the market price of the Notes above independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of the Notes. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities  and may end any of these activities at any time without notice.In general  purchases of a Note for the purpose of stabilizing or reducing a syndicate short position could cause the price of the Note to be higher than it might otherwise be in the absence of such purchases without notice.S-15Neither we nor the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes.The underwriters and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities  which may include securities trading  commercial and investment banking  financial advisory  investment management  investment research  principal investment  hedging  financing and brokerage activities. Each of the underwriters and/or its affiliates may have performed certain investment banking  commercial banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and expenses. Certain of the underwriters and/or their affiliates are lenders under our existing unsecured revolving credit facility. The underwriters may  from time to time  engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they will receive customary fees and expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities  the underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers  and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Company. If any of the underwriters or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us  certain of those underwriters and their affiliates routinely hedge  and certain other of those underwriters or their affiliates may hedge  their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically  such underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities  including potentially the Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading price of the Notes offered hereby. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold  or recommend to clients that they acquire  long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on the cover page of this prospectus supplement  which will be the seventh business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being referred to herein as “T+7”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next four business days will be required  by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+7  to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next four business days should consult their own advisor.Selling RestrictionsCanadaThe Notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing  or deemed to be purchasing  as principal that are accredited investors  as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario)  and are permitted clients  as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements  Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations.

Since the early 2000s  JCDecaux has worked to bring self-service bikes to as many people as possible. Today  the Group operates more than 25 000 bikes in 10 countries and 73 cities  with a particularly well-developed network in France. For the last 20 years  JCDecaux’s initiatives have contributed to changing behaviour and the development of eco-friendly mobility worldwide.As a trusted partner of local authorities in championing intermodal travel  JCDecaux leverages its expertise and powers of innovation to help cities and citizens meet the challenges of mobility. Over 753 million journeys have been made since 2003 using self-service bikes operated by JCDecaux.This success is based on several factors  which highlight the strength of JCDecaux’s “eco-friendly mobility” model:JCDecaux’s ability to develop solutions in partnership with cities   as part of public contracts;an offering of traditional and/or electrically assisted bikes which are innovative  robust and proven in public spaces;an extensive range of services (self-service bikes  long-term rental  adapted bikes  parking solutions  etc.);an omnichannel customer experience which allows each user to manage their use of self-service bikes from their smartphone;fully in-house expertise to deliver continuous scalability of our systems and full control of the value chain from application to the choice of features such as mud guards;self-service bike-share services using a station system and individual bike stands to provide a reliable and optimised user experience;an expert and responsible approach to operations related to bike services (cleaning using rainwater  recycling  zero-emission vehicle fleets);excellence in regulation and maintenance operations  in terms of user safety and through the use of data to match demand to the availability of bikes throughout the day.Story continuesBy listening to cities and citizens  JCDecaux continues to reimagine the future of shared bikes to enhance users’ experience and facilitate their daily travel. This includes the following initiatives: inclusive and cargo bikes  autonomous  solar-powered stations  Mobility as a Service (MaaS – supplying all available mobility services for a region within a single platform as illustrated in Mulhouse)  bike reservations in advance  and introducing an electronic locking system in Lyon that enables users to leave their bikes at a station even if it is full.Thanks to its quality of service  JCDecaux’s bike schemes in France recorded an average satisfaction rate for 2021 of over 92% (satisfaction with the service  ease of use  quality of maintenance  availability of bikes and the level of recommendation).Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer of JCDecaux  said : “We have just unveiled our new strategic ESG roadmap for 2030 and are proud to have led the way for shared eco-friendly urban mobility for the last 20 years. In line with the Group’s business model  we are delighted to finance our bike networks with advertising street furniture so that we can keep subscription and users fees as low as possible without impacting tax payers.

In this study  performed in an immuno-compromised patient population  MaaT033 presented a good safety and tolerability profile  evaluated as the primary endpoint. The topline results also show rapid and persistent engraftment of MaaT033 in the patients’ gut. The study data support the Company’s preparation to initiate a Phase 2/3 trial later this year to evaluate MaaT033’s ability to improve survival and prevent complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in patients with blood cancers. Every year  approximately 22 000 patients require allo-HSCT in the seven major markets2. MaaT033’s oral formulation is designed to support long-term  ambulatory use  opening up new potential development opportunities for the Company. Today’s announcement confirms previously-announced promising interim results of the trial  which allowed early completion of the study.“Parallel to the clinical successes of our lead candidate MaaT013  we developed MaaT033 as our first oral formulation  and the strength of the engraftment we have seen in these cohorts exceeds our expectations. Together with a good safety profile  this solid evidence for our first oral candidate is a crucial milestone for MaaT Pharma ” commented Hervé Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. “Allo-HSCT is a curative treatment of liquid tumors  that is unfortunately negatively impacted by two primary complications  graft-versus-host disease and severe infections  which hinder overall survival. We view the prevention of these adverse effects as the key to a better prognosis for these patients.”MaaT033 is designed to restore and maintain a healthy gut microbiome in patients with severe dysbiosis3 as a result of intensive chemotherapy and antibiotic treatment. Developed as an oral formulation in lyophilized capsules  its proprietary targeted-delivery design is conceived to optimize the product’s engraftment in the patient’s gut and its interaction with the immune system. Thanks to its high bacterial richness and Butycore™4 content  the product aims to reorient the gut microbial network towards immune homeostasis and restore the microbiome’s intestinal barrier function against infections.“We know from previous studies that AML patients are highly dysbiotic as a result of intensive chemotherapy and antibiotic therapy. From the CIMON trial data  we can be confident that MaaT033 results in robust levels of engraftment in the gut of AML patients at the targeted dose ” said Prof. Christian Recher  Professor of Hematology at the Toulouse University Hospital/IUCT-Oncopole (France) and Principal Investigator of the study. “This strong foundational data supports the launch of the next phase evaluating MaaT033 in preventing allo-HSCT complications in this patient population.”The CIMON Phase 1b trial (NCT04150393) was an open-label  dose-ranging study investigating the maximum tolerated dose of MaaT033 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome who have undergone intensive chemotherapy. The trial enrolled 21 patients in four dose escalation cohorts (up to three capsules a day for 14 days) across six sites in France. The trial allowed to select the recommended dose for MaaT033  which remains confidential at this stage. MaaT033 showed rapid and persistent engraftment with the detection of more than 60% of the MaaT033 microbial communities (OTUs5) in the patient’s gut post-exposure at the selected dose. Substantial engraftment was maintained during the treatment period and for at least three weeks after the end of treatment (last measure). Good tolerability of the candidate was also observed in this immunocompromised population  with only four serious adverse events (SAE) considered as unrelated to the treatment and one possibly related SAE (an infectious diarrhea event with no detection of the causal pathogen in the administered MaaT033 and patient recovery within four days). This is in line with the expected AE profile with standard of care treatments in this fragile population.MaaT Pharma has performed a Scientific Advice procedure with the European Medicine Agency and will move forward with preparations for a Phase 2/3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study in 340 patients  that will assess safety and tolerability of MaaT033 before and after allo-HSCT  as well as the efficacy of the candidate in improving overall survival and prevention of allo-HSCT complications. The trial initiation is planned by end of 2022. This is in line with the program announced during the Company’s IPO in November 2021  and part of the funding raised during the IPO is allocated to the clinical development of MaaT033.The Phase 1b CIMON topline data will be presented and discussed by Prof. Mohamad Mohty (Professor at Sorbonne University and Head of the Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department  Saint-Antoine Hospital  AP-HP  France) during the Company’s upcoming Virtual R&D Day  which will be held on Tuesday June 7  2022 (register here).Complete trial results will be submitted for presentation and/or publication in a peer-reviewed forum.About MaaT033MaaT033 is an oral  full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  high-richness Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy™. MaaT033 is designed to restore the gut ecosystem to full functionality to improve clinical outcomes as well as to control adverse events related to conventional treatments for liquid tumors.

The Group reaped the full benefits of rapid growth in new consumption trends  including in particular upmarket movement and the rise of mixology.Current Operating Profit came in at €334.4 million  equating to exceptional organic growth of +39.9% (+56.9% compared to 2019-20). This resulted in strong growth in the Current Operating Margin  up +2.3 percentage points (pp) on an organic basis to an all-time high of 25.5% (up +4.6 pp compared to 2019-20).Rémy Cointreau’s Chief Executive Officer  Eric Vallat  said  “Rémy Cointreau has posted record results that demonstrate the relevance and potential of its brands  backed by genuine savoir-faire  up to three hundred years of history and exceptional terroirs. Progress against our strategic priorities and increased investment in marketing and communications to pave the way for future growth have also played a decisive role. Above all  we are very proud to have reached a new sustainable development milestone: Rémy Cointreau  whose top priority remains to lower its emissions  is the first spirits group to achieve carbon neutrality under its #APlanetOfException plan. In an uncertain environment  Rémy Cointreau is now perfectly equipped and ideally placed to deliver another year of strong growth. On the strength of our progress against our strategic goals  new consumption trends and our robust pricing power  we are starting the year 2022-23 with confidence.”Key figures in €m (unless otherwise stated) 2021-22 2020-21 Change Reported Organic change vs. 2020-21 vs. 2019-20 Sales 1 312.9 1 010.2 +30.0% +27.3% +29.4% Gross margin (%) 68.6% 67.3% +1.3 pp +1.5 pp +2.1 pp Current Operating Profit 334.4 236.1 +41.6% +39.9% +56.9% Current Operating Margin (%) 25.5% 23.4% +2.1 pp +2.3 pp +4.6 pp Net profit – Group share 212.5 144.5 +47.0% +45.7% 86.0% Net profit – Group share excl. non-recurring items 228.1 148.2 +53.9% +52.6% 82.4% Net margin excl. non-recurring items (%) 17.4% 14.7% +2.7 pp +2.9 pp +5.2 pp EPS Group share (€) 4.21 2.89 +45.9% - - EPS Group share excl. non-recurring items (€) 4.52 2.96 +52.8% - - Net debt/EBITDA ratio 0.79 1.33 -0.54 - -Current Operating Profit by division€m (unless otherwise stated) 2021-22 2020-21 Change Reported Organic change vs. 2020-21 vs. 2019-20 Cognac 323.0 221.0 +46.2% +43.8% +58.9% As % of sales 34.1% 30.1% +4.0 pp +4.2 pp +6.1 pp Liqueurs & Spirits 35.5 33.0 +7.4% +10.6% +16.5% As % of sales 10.6% 13.3% -2.7 pp -2.1 pp -1.2 pp Subtotal: Group Brands 358.4 254.0 +41.1% +39.5% +52.7% As % of sales 28.0% 25.8% +2.1 pp +2.4 pp +4.3 pp Partner Brands - (0.8) - - - As % of sales - - - - - Holding company costs (24.0) (17.1) +40.4% +39.9% +19.2% Total 334.4 236.1 +41.6% +39.9% +56.9% As % of sales 25.5% 23.4% +2.1 pp +2.3 pp +4.6 ppCognacSales at the Cognac division grew a remarkable +26.3% on an organic basis in 2021-22 (+30.7% compared to 2019-20)  with volume growth contributing +12.5% and price/mix effects +13.8% thanks to the growing contribution from high-end and mid-range products (Club in China and 1738 in the United States) and price increases. All regions contributed to this excellent performance.Current Operating Profit rose +43.8% on an organic basis to €323.0 million (+58.9% compared to 2019-20). Consequently  the margin rose +4.2 pp on an organic basis to 34.1% (+6.1 pp compared to 2019-20). The significant increase in marketing and communications investment was largely absorbed by very strong growth in the division’s gross margin (evenly split between volume and price/mix effects) and its high operating leverage.Liqueurs & SpiritsSales at the Liqueurs & Spirits division grew +31.7% in 2021-22 (+27.5% compared to 2019-20)  with volume growth contributing +24.6% and price/mix effects +7.1%. The division benefited in particular from excellent performance by Cointreau and Bruichladdich whiskies and the ramp-up in sales of The Botanist.Current Operating Profit came in at €35.5 million  up +10.6% on an organic basis (+16.5% compared to 2019-20). The current operating margin came in at 10.6% (down -2.1 pp on an organic basis). On the strength of its progress against its strategic priorities  the Group opted to reinvest much of its gross margin gains (up +1.5 pp vs. 2020-21 and +3.5 pp vs. 2019-20) in marketing and communications to boost brand awareness and desirability (notably for Cointreau  The Botanist and Bruichladdich whiskies) and pave the way for future growth. At the same time  the Group maintained strict control over its overhead costs.Partner BrandsPartner Brand sales grew +15.2% on an organic basis in 2021-22 (+13.5% compared to 2019-20)  supported by favourable trends in Europe  their main market.In terms of Current Operating Profit  Partner Brands broke even in 2021-22 after posting a -€0.8 million loss in 2020-21.Consolidated resultsCurrent Operating Profit (COP) came in at €334.4 million  up +39.9% on an organic basis (up +41.6% on a reported basis). This performance was mainly driven by exceptional growth in Current Operating Profit from Group Brands (up +39.5% on an organic basis) and takes into account a €6.9 million increase in holding company costs consisting of a €2.0 million donation to the Rémy Cointreau Foundation and €4.9 million in respect of medium- and long-term retention measures  employee savings and the employee share ownership plan.This performance also includes favourable currency effects (+€6.4 million)  mainly as a result of the favourable trend in the euro/yuan exchange rate. Furthermore  the average euro/dollar conversion rate improved from 1.17 in 2020-21 to 1.16 in 2021-22  while the average collection rate (linked to the Group’s hedging policy) came out at 1.17 in 2021-22  stable year on year.Lastly  this performance takes into account adverse consolidation scope effects of -€2.4 million arising from the acquisition of Brillet and Telmont.The Current Operating Margin thus rose sharply  up +2.1 pp on a reported basis to an all-time high of 25.5% (up +2.3 pp on an organic basis). This strong organic growth reflects the following:a +1.5 pp increase in the gross margin (up +2.1 pp vs. 2019-20) to its highest ever level of 68.6%  driven by very favourable price/mix effects and strong growth in volumes(up +2.1 pp vs. 2019-20) to its highest ever level of 68.6%  driven by very favourable price/mix effects and strong growth in volumes excellent absorption of overheads (with the overhead ratio down 2.3 pp on an organic basis)(with the overhead ratio down 2.3 pp on an organic basis) increased investment in marketing and communications (with the ratio up 1.5 pp on an organic basis) to boost brands’ medium-term growth potential(with the ratio up 1.5 pp on an organic basis) to boost brands’ medium-term growth potential neutral currency effects and adverse consolidation scope effects (-0.2 pp)Operating profit came in at €320.3 million  up +35.8% on a reported basis  after taking into account -€14.1 million in non-recurring items.The net financial expense improved from -€14.6 million in 2020-21 to -€13.2 million in 2021-22.The tax expense totalled €95.6 million  giving an effective tax rate of 31.1% (29.3% excluding non-recurring items)  a significant improvement on 2020-21 (35.1% on a reported basis and 33.5% excluding non-recurring items). This improvement was mainly the result of a reduction in the tax rate in France and a favourable geographical mix.After taking into account the Group’s share of net income from associates  net profit attributable to the Group came in at €212.5 million  up +47.0% on a reported basis (up +45.7% on an organic basis).Excluding non-recurring items  net profit attributable to the Group came in at €228.1 million  up +53.9% on a reported basis (up +52.6% on an organic basis)  giving a net margin of 17.4%  up +2.7 pp on a reported basis (up +2.9 pp on an organic basis).Earnings per share (excluding non-recurring items) came out at €4.52  up +52.8% on a reported basis.Net debt stood at €353.3 million  up €39.0 million from the position at 31 March 2021. In addition to free cash flow  this improvement in net debt mainly reflects the non-cash effect of the early conversion of €154.6 million of OCEANE debt  offset by the share buyback programme (€169.5 million) and the payment of a cash dividend (€93.7 million). This resulted in a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.79x at 31 March 2022  compared with 1.33x at 31 March 2021.The return on capital employed (ROCE) came out at 22.2% for the year ended 31 March 2022  up +5.1 pp year on year (up +4.9 pp on an organic basis). Continued strategic purchases of eaux-de-vie adversely affecting capital employed were offset by a significant improvement in the profitability of Group Brands.At the annual general meeting to be held on 21 July 2022  the Board of Directors of Rémy Cointreau will propose the payment of an ordinary dividend of €1.85 per share in cash and an exceptional dividend of €1.0 per share payable in cash or shares. This dividend reflects the Board’s and the management team’s high level of confidence in the Group’s growth outlook.2022-23 outlookIdeally positioned to take advantage of new consumption trends and on the strength of progress against its strategic plan  Rémy Cointreau is starting financial year 2022-23 with confidence.The Group intends to continue implementing its strategy focused on medium-term brand development and underpinned by a policy of sustained investment in marketing and communications. The Group reaffirms its desire to continue to win market share in the exceptional spirits sector and anticipates another year of strong growth. In particular  Rémy Cointreau is forecasting strong first-quarter sales despite a very high base effect and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in China.Helped by excellent pricing power  the improvement in the Current Operating Margin will be driven by the solid resilience of the Group’s gross margin despite the inflationary environment and by strict control over overhead costs.For the full year  the Group expects currency effects to be positive for Current Operating Profit  which it forecasts should be in the range €30-40 million.2030 guidance confirmedOver the last year  Rémy Cointreau has benefited from very strong consumption  reflecting the structural acceleration in consumption trends observed since 2020 in an environment marked by the pandemic: the outperformance of high-end segments  at-home consumption  the rise of mixology  growth in online sales and growing interest in corporate social and environmental responsibility.Rémy Cointreau reiterates its financial and non-financial guidance for 2029-30.On financials  the Group is targeting a gross margin of 72% and a Current Operating Margin of 33% (based on 2019-20 consolidation scope and exchange rates).Through its Sustainable Exception plan  the Group aims to achieve sustainable agriculture across all land on which its spirits depend  as well as a 50% reduction in carbon emissions per bottle by 2030. This will be a first step towards the Group’s ambition of achieving “net zero carbon” by 2050.Rémy Cointreau reaffirms its ambition of becoming the global leader in exceptional spirits.AppendicesSales and Current Operating Profit by division€m (unless otherwise stated) 2021-22 2020-21 Change Reported A Organic B Reported C Reported A/C-1 Organic B/C-1 Sales Cognac 948.3 928.2 735.0 +29.0% +26.3% Liqueurs & Spirits 333.2 327.1 248.3 +34.2% +31.7% Subtotal: Group Brands 1 281.5 1 255.3 983.3 +30.3% +27.7% Partner Brands 31.3 31.0 26.9 +16.3% +15.2% Total 1 312.9 1 286.4 1 010.2 +30.0% +27.3% Current Operating Profit Cognac 323.0 317.8 221.0 +46.2% +43.8% As % of sales 34.1% 34.2% 30.1% +4.0 pp +4.2 pp Liqueurs & Spirits 35.5 36.5 33.0 +7.4% +10.6% As % of sales 10.6% 11.2% 13.3% -2.7 pp -2.1 pp Subtotal: Group Brands 358.4 354.3 254.0 +41.1% +39.5% As % of sales 28.0% 28.2% 25.8% +2.1 pp +2.4 pp Partner Brands - - (0.8) - - As % of sales - - - - - Holding company costs (24.0) (23.9) (17.1) +40.4% +39.9% Total 334.4 330.3 236.1 +41.6% +39.9% As % of sales 25.5% 25.7% 23.4% +2.1 pp +2.3 ppSummary income statement€m (unless otherwise stated) 2021-22 2020-21 Change Reported Organic Reported Reported Organic A B C A/C-1 B/C-1 Sales 1 312.9 1 286.4 1 010.2 +30.0% +27.3% Gross profit 901.1 885.3 680.1 +32.5% +30.2% Gross margin (%) 68.6% 68.8% 67.3% +1.3 pp +1.5 pp Current Operating Profit 334.4 330.3 236.1 +41.6% +39.9% Current operating margin (%) 25.5% 25.7% 23.4% +2.1 pp +2.3 pp Other operating income and expenses (14.1) (14.1) (0.2) - - Operating profit 320.3 316.3 235.9 +35.8% +34.1% Net financial income (expense) (13.2) (13.0) (14.6) -9.4% -11.3% Corporate income tax (95.6) (93.6) (77.6) +23.1% +20.7% Tax rate (%) (31.1%) (30.9%) (35.1%) -4.0 pp -4.2 pp Share in profit (loss) of associates/minority interests 1.0 1.0 0.9 - - Net profit attributable to the Group 212.5 210.6 144.5 +47.0% +45.7% Net profit excluding non-recurring items 228.1 226.2 148.2 +53.9% +52.6% Net profit (excluding non-recurring items)/sales 17.4% 17.6% 14.7% +2.7 pp +2.9 pp EPS Group share (€) 4.21 4.18 2.89 +45.9% - EPS Group share excluding non-recurring items (€) 4.52 4.48 2.96 +52.8% -Reconciliation of net profit and net profit excluding non-recurring items€m 2021-22 2020-21 Net profit attributable to the Group 212.5 144.5 Other operating income and expenses 14.1 0.2 Non-recurring tax items (3.4) (0.1) Effect of changes in the tax rate on deferred taxes in France  the UK and Greece 4.9 3.6 Net profit Group share excluding non-recurring items 228.1 148.2Definitions of alternative performance indicatorsRémy Cointreau’s management process is based on the following alternative performance indicators  selected for planning and reporting purposes. The Group’s management considers that these indicators provide users of the financial statements with useful additional information to help them understand the Group’s performance. These alternative performance indicators should be considered as supplementing those included in the consolidated financial statements and the resulting movements.Organic growth in sales and Current Operating ProfitOrganic growth is calculated excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  acquisitions and disposals. This indicator serves to focus on Group performance common to both financial years  which local management is more directly capable of measuring.The impact of exchange rates is calculated by converting sales and Current Operating Profit for the current financial year using average exchange rates (or  for Current Operating Profit  the hedged exchange rate) from the previous financial year.For acquisitions in the current financial year  sales and Current Operating Profit of acquired entities are not included in organic growth calculations. For acquisitions in the previous financial year  sales and Current Operating Profit of acquired entities are included in the previous financial year; however  they are only included in current year organic growth calculations with effect from the anniversary date of the acquisition.For significant disposals  data is post-application of IFRS 5  under which results of entities disposed of are systematically reclassified under “Net earnings from discontinued operations”.Indicators “excluding non-recurring items”The two items set out below constitute key indicators for measuring recurring business performance  since they exclude significant items which  by virtue of their unusual nature  cannot be considered inherent to the Group’s ongoing performance:Current Operating Profit consists of operating profit before other non-recurring operating income and expenses.Net profit attributable to the Group excluding non-recurring items consists of net profit attributable to the Group adjusted to exclude other non-recurring operating income and expenses  associated tax effects  profit from deconsolidated  divested and discontinued operations and the contribution from dividends paid in cash.Gross operating profit (EBITDA)This measure  which is used in particular to calculate certain ratios  equates to Current Operating Profit less amortisation and depreciation expenses on intangible assets and property  plant and equipment for the period  expenses arising from stock option plans  and dividends received from associates during the period.Net debtNet financial debt as defined and used by the Group is equal to the sum of long- and short-term financial debt and accrued interest  less cash and cash equivalents.About Rémy CointreauAll around the world  there are clients seeking exceptional experiences; clients for whom a wide range of terroirs means a variety of flavors.

Among the Act's provisions are those that would: expand automatic enrollment in 401(k) and 403(b) plans; increase the age at which participants are required to begin receiving mandatory distributions  from age 72 to age 75; increase the catch-up contribution limits for retirement plans and SIMPLE plans for individuals who have attained ages 62  63  and 64; reduce the period of service a long-time  part-time worker must perform in order to be eligible to participate in an employer's 401(k) plan; promote and enhance the Saver's Credit; require all catch-up contributions to qualified retirement plans to be subject to Roth tax treatment; and allow 401(k)  403(b)  and governmental 457(b) plans to provide participants with the option of receiving employer matching contributions on a Roth basis.In addition  the Act would: allow student loan payments to be treated as elective deferrals eligible for matching contributions; authorize penalty-free withdrawals from eligible retirement plans to victims of domestic abuse; provide a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $500 for small employers that allow for immediate plan eligibility for military spouses; increase the tax credit available to small employers for starting a pension plan  from 50% to 100% of qualified start-up costs; and allow employers to provide de minimis financial incentives (e.g.  gift cards) to employees to participate in a retirement plan.Who: Glenn Sulzer  J.D.

June 2  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Monos  the travel lifestyle company  has selected Centric Software®'s Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solution. Centric Software provides …,"Founded in 2018 and based in Vancouver  Canada  Monos targeted an underserved section of the travel market in terms of high quality  well-designed luggage that stands the test of time  all at an affordable price point. The DTC brand's philosophy is mindful travel.Hubert Chan  Chief Creative Officer and co-founder says  ""We started by creating the suitcase we always wanted  but couldn't find. Since those early days  we've expanded our product lineup beyond luggage  branching out into other product categories including bags and apparel. We consider ourselves to be not just a luggage brand  but a travel lifestyle brand. For us  travel is an all-encompassing experience and we want to offer a diverse range of products that reflects that.""The timing of the company's inception unfortunately intersected with the COVID-19 outbreak. Chan acknowledges  ""Not long after we launched Monos  and we were starting to see some traction and momentum  the global pandemic essentially shut down worldwide travel. It was a scary time for us as a company.""But in an innovative move  Monos changed gears and came up with a tool that matched the global situation. Chan says  ""We knew we had a great team  so rather than dwelling on the situation  we pivoted and shifted our resources into creating the CleanPod UVC Sterilizer  a portable travel wand that uses ultraviolet-C light to disinfect surfaces. With all of our efforts focused on that  we were able to bring it to market in about six weeks. It found an immediate market fit at the height of the pandemic  and generated a lot of PR coverage. That really helped us stay afloat during this time when no one was thinking about travel. From there  we were able to parlay that success into marketing at a time when other travel brands had essentially stopped—through that  we were able to capture market share  and we saw luggage sales pick up again. We also accelerated our product roadmap  launching the Metro collection of bags—the Metro Backpack  Duffel  Folio Kit and Sling—as well as the Kiyo  a travel water bottle that uses UVC technology to purify drinking water. So we were able to not only survive the pandemic  but thrive. And now we're coming out stronger than ever with a lot of exciting new products in the works.""Kathleen Westerhout  Director of Product says  ""I recently joined Monos and saw right away that we could use a tool like PLM to help centralize everything in one place. I have 10 years of product design and development experience and have worked at large companies with PLM systems. So I understand how foundational PLM is for a company to be able to grow and scale.One area that Monos wants to improve is vendor communication. Westerhout says  ""Our vendors need to be able to see what we're seeing—the exact same format  exact same information because at the moment  we're using a lot of different tools that don't connect with each other and don't synchronize  so there's a lot of information in different places. It's challenging to stay organized and be on the same page with our vendors.""She describes the PLM selection. ""It really came down to a couple of things. First was Centric's option for emerging brands. It fits the stage we're at as a smaller company. Second  is customer experience. From the very beginning  the communication with Centric has been super clear and very professional. They answered all our questions; we feel like a valued customer. What also made the difference  besides choosing the right platform for us  was that we felt like we'd have the support to actually see this project through and be able to build the tool the way that we want. I already have trust in the [Centric] team that they're going to support us for the whole journey.""Chan outlines the expectations for Centric PLM. ""To have one source of truth for everything. We'll have all of our materials  trims  everything centralized. We'll get our vendors on board. Even product information on our online site—if something gets updated  we won't have to think of everywhere that it lives on the website to make the changes since we'll have that single source of truth "" says Chan.President and CEO of Centric Software  Chris Groves  says  ""We are delighted that Monos  our 20th customer in Canada  has chosen to partner with Centric. They've already proven how innovative and agile they are and we can't wait to see their continued success in the future.""Learn more about Centric PLMRequest a DemoMonos is a Canadian travel and lifestyle brand offering high quality  beautifully designed suitcases  bags  and accessories  and inspiring people to travel in a mindful and present way – to embrace the journey as much as the destination.

Among the Act's provisions are those that would: expand automatic enrollment in 401(k) and 403(b) plans; increase the age at which participants are required to begin receiving mandatory distributions  from age 72 to age 75; increase the catch-up contribution limits for retirement plans and SIMPLE plans for individuals who have attained ages 62  63  and 64; reduce the period of service a long-time  part-time worker must perform in order to be eligible to participate in an employer's 401(k) plan; promote and enhance the Saver's Credit; require all catch-up contributions to qualified retirement plans to be subject to Roth tax treatment; and allow 401(k)  403(b)  and governmental 457(b) plans to provide participants with the option of receiving employer matching contributions on a Roth basis.In addition  the Act would: allow student loan payments to be treated as elective deferrals eligible for matching contributions; authorize penalty-free withdrawals from eligible retirement plans to victims of domestic abuse; provide a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $500 for small employers that allow for immediate plan eligibility for military spouses; increase the tax credit available to small employers for starting a pension plan  from 50% to 100% of qualified start-up costs; and allow employers to provide de minimis financial incentives (e.g.  gift cards) to employees to participate in a retirement plan.Who: Glenn Sulzer  J.D.

The transfer to the Euronext Growth market in Paris would simplify the company's operations and reduce its listing costs  while allowing it to continue to benefit from the advantages of a listing on a financial market.Transfer requirementsThe proposed transfer must be approved by the company's shareholders at a combined general meeting to be held on June 30  2022  on first notice. The approval of the market operator Euronext is also required prior to the delisting of Egide's shares from the regulated market of Euronext Paris and their listing on the Euronext Growth market in Paris.Egide meets the eligibility requirements for such a transfer to Euronext Growth  which include a market capitalization of less than €1 billion and a free float of over €2.5 million.Terms of transferThis listing by direct admission on Euronext Growth in Paris will be carried out through an accelerated procedure of direct admission to trading of Egide's existing shares  which will cease to be listed on Euronext Paris at the same time. No new shares will be issued on this transfer.Egide will be supported in its planned transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris by Atout Capital  as Listing Sponsor.Consequences of the transferIn accordance with the regulations  the company wishes to inform its shareholders of some of the possible consequences of such a transfer.Story continuesIn terms of periodic financial information:the annual accounts (corporate and consolidated)  the management report and the auditors' reports on these accounts would be published no later than four months after the end of the financial year.From the 2023 financial year onwards  the half-yearly report  including the half-yearly financial statements and the activity report  would be published within 4 months after the end of the half-year (instead of the 3-month period in force on Euronext) and would no longer be subject to a limited review by the statutory auditors.Egide has a free choice of accounting standards (French standards or IFRS) for the preparation of its consolidated accounts. Nevertheless  Egide has decided to continue to prepare its accounts in accordance with IFRS.Ongoing information:As Euronext Growth is an organized multilateral trading facility  Egide would remain subject to the applicable provisions on ongoing market disclosure and more particularly to the provisions of the European Market Abuse Regulation (EU No. 596/2014 of 16 April 2014  known as the ""MAR Regulation"").Egide's managers (and related persons) would continue to be subject to the obligation to report transactions in the company's shares and debt securities.In terms of protection of minority shareholders:Egide would remain subject  for a period of three years from the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris  to the regime of mandatory public offers and to the maintenance of disclosure requirements relating to the crossing of thresholds as applicable to companies listed on Euronext.Beyond this three-year period  the mandatory public offer mechanism would apply  unless an exception is made  if a shareholder  directly or indirectly  alone or in concert  crosses the threshold of 50% of the capital or voting rights. The thresholds for notifying the crossing of thresholds would then also be limited to the crossing of 50% and 95%.The company draws attention to the fact that the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris could result in a different trend in the liquidity of the share than that observed on the regulated market of Euronext.Beyond this  Egide would ensure that it maintains the quality of the relationships it has always sought to establish with its shareholders and investors.Provisional timetable for the transfer (subject to approval by Euronext Paris)May 2  2022: Decision of the Board of Directors to submit to the Annual General Meeting the proposed transfer to Euronext Growth Paris.June 1st  2022: Public information on the proposed transfer of listing on Euronext Growth Paris (1st press release).June 30  2022: Ordinary General Meeting of Egide and holding of the Board of Directors to implement the transfer of the shares to Euronext Growth. In the event of a favorable vote by the Board of Directors  immediate information to the public on the final decision to transfer the shares (2nd press release). Application to delist the shares from Euronext Paris and application for their direct listing on Euronext Growth Paris.No earlier thanAugust 30  2022: Effective transfer: delisting of the shares from Euronext Paris and listing on Euronext Growth Paris.The mnemonic code of Egide's shares (GID) would be modified on the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris. The ISIN code (FR0000072373) would remain unchanged.In addition  Egide shares will remain eligible for PEA and PEA-PME after the transfer to Euronext Growth in Paris.About Egide - www.egide-group.comEgide is a group with an international dimension. specialized in the manufacture of hermetic packages and heat dissipation solutions for sensitive electronic components.

The front month had edged higher earlier  consolidating after a 3.6% slide on Tuesday as traders saw prospects for fresh demand in a tender by top importer Egypt.However  another steep fall for Chicago wheat  which was about 5% lower in US trading following a 6% plunge on Tuesday  later dragged Euronext downwards. “There is some heavy liquidation going on by funds on the US market ” one futures dealer said.Sluggish US wheat exports  rain relief for drought-affected US winter wheat and forecasts of better weather for North American spring wheat dampened price sentiment on the US market  traders said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was hopeful of an easing the food crisis prompted by the war in Ukraine  but cautioned that any agreement to unblock shipments of commodities such as grain was still some way off.Traders were awaiting the outcome of a tender being held by Egypt  the importer’s first for shipment in the 2022/23 season that starts in July. Bulgarian  French  Romanian and Russian wheat were offered with French supplies facing stiff competition despite the fall on Euronext and weakness in the euro. US wheat was not offered.Financial investors had raised their net long position in Euronext’s wheat futures and options last week  data published by the exchange on Wednesday showed.,negative,0.04,0.46,0.5,negative,0.01,0.13,0.85,True,English,"['EU wheat', 'Chicago liquidation', 'Markets', 'UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres', 'North American spring wheat', 'Sluggish US wheat exports', 'drought-affected US winter wheat', 'uncertain global supply', 'net long position', 'one futures dealer', 'top importer Egypt', 'wheat futures', 'US crops', 'US trading', 'US market', 'wheat positions', 'Russian wheat', 'second day', 'record-breaking rallies', 'risk-off mood', 'financial markets', 'inflation concerns', 'diplomatic talks', 'Ukrainian ports', 'September milling', 'front month', 'fresh demand', 'Chicago wheat', 'rain relief', 'price sentiment', 'food crisis', '2022/23 season', 'stiff competition', 'Euronext wheat', 'steep fall', 'heavy liquidation', 'French supplies', 'Financial investors', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'Tuesday', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'signs', 'weather', 'traders', 'losses', '378.50 euros', '1617 GMT', 'one-month', '374.75 euros', '3.6% slide', 'prospects', 'tender', '6% plunge', 'funds', 'forecasts', 'agreement', 'shipments', 'commodities', 'grain', 'way', 'outcome', 'July', 'Bulgarian', 'Romanian', 'weakness', 'options', 'data', 'exchange', 'Wednesday']",2022-06-02,2022-06-02,brecorder.com
