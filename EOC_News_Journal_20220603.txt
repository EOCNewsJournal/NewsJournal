5895,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.bne.eu/russia-edges-closer-to-bond-default-246258/?source=russia,Russia edges closer to bond default,1 day ago,After months of manoeuvring on the sanctions minefield  the Russian finance ministry seems to have slipped up for the first time after it missed a $1.9mn interest payment that has triggered the first default event on Russian sovereign debt since the one that followed the 1917 revolution.As followed by bne IntelliNews  as of May 27 Russia is back on a 30-day countdown to default only two days after the US Treasury decided not to extend its ability to service sovereign debt in US dollars. But now there is a new problem: the ministry appears to have forgotten to add $1.9mn of interest payments to a delayed coupon payment made last month. The latest developments are likely to complicate the finance ministry’s efforts to outwit the restrictions  including the latest bonds-for-rubles proposal.On June 1 the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees (CDDC) of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) ruled that said a “failure-to-pay” event occurred on credit-default swaps because Russia didn’t include the additional interest in a late bond payment made at the start of May.The CDDC is the committee that rules when a default event has happened that can trigger the decision to pay out on credit default swaps  a kind of insurance bond investors can take out to protect themselves against a bond’s default. The committee has declared that a default event has occurred  but will meet at the start of next week to decide if this triggers CDS payouts.Russia has already narrowly escaped a default once this year  only hours before the May 4 deadline. But the $1.9mn interest accrued during the 30-day grace period has not reached the investors. It appears that the ministry forgot to add this sum to the payment.“On May 11  2022  bondholders of the 4.5% 2022 Russian sovereign bonds submitted a default notice via Euroclear demanding the payment of approximately $1.9mn in accrued interest payments in respect of the delayed principal repayment upon maturity of the bonds. The bonds matured on April 4  2022 but the payment of principal and interest due at maturity was not made until May 2. The bond documents provide for interest to continue accruing on the principal until the principal is discharged at the 4.5% coupon on a 30/360 day count  resulting in approximately $1.9mn in additional interest being owed upon discharge of the bonds. Russia did not include accrued interest beyond April 4  2022 in its payment  putting it in default under the bonds. Following the demand from bondholders  Russia has not paid the interest owed ” CDDC concluded.Another CDDC meeting on the “failure-to-pay” event by the Russian Federation is scheduled for June 6  2022.The ruling by the CDDC could trigger all of Russia’s outstanding credit default swaps. According to Bloomberg  citing the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp data  credit default swaps covered a net $1.5bn of Russian debt as of end-May  compared with $3.2bn at end-April.Russia has some $400mn of bond obligations to pay in June and a total of about $1bn is due by the end of this year in 14 more bond payments from the total of about $40bn in outstanding Russian debt obligations.Investors rushed into credit default swaps after Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine amid sharply collapsing bond prices. Under the instrument two investors swap credit risk  with one party agreeing to reimburse another in the case the borrower defaults. US bond investment house Pimco is especially exposed and is said to have sold more than $100mn of such guarantees as protection to banks such as Barclays and JPMorgan & Chase.However  notably  the failure to pay $1.9mn interest isn’t sufficient to trigger a cross-default across other sovereign instruments  as the minimum threshold for unpaid debt is at least $75mn  according to documents for other Russian Eurobonds reviewed by Bloomberg.Still  it is likely to upset the investors and fuel resistance to the latest finance ministry’s efforts to outmanoeuvre the restrictions of the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that supervises sanctions. As followed by bne IntelliNews  similarly to the controversial “gas-for-rubles” scheme enforced by President Vladimir Putin  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov recently suggested a similar “bonds-for-rubles” scheme.Bondholders would have to open dual ruble-dollar accounts in Russian banks  transfer a ruble equivalent of their coupon payments to their accounts  and immediately convert that into US dollars on the market in the second forex account.The gas-for-rubles scheme has proved controversial  with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen initially saying that it breaks EU sanctions rules on Russia  but increasingly European companies have adopted the scheme which meets the sanctions requirements under the letter of the law  if not the spirit. Some countries like Hungary have agreed to meet their gas bill obligations by paying rubles directly to the Russian state and can expect to be rewarded by the Kremlin with attractive energy deals as a result.Earlier reports suggested that the two specific issues due for payment on May 27 potentially allow for other payment options  such as using rubles as a last resort and paying in euros  Swiss francs or pound sterling for “reasons beyond the control” of the Russian Federation.Two bonds for $183.75mn and $51.1mn due on June 23 also have provisions for payment in euros  sterling and francs  so it could be possible for the finance ministry to avoid sanctions in this instance. The first really problematic bond will be a June 24 coupon payment on a $159.4mn bond that matures in 2028 that can only be paid in dollars. Russia is likely to break the terms of the covenant in this case  as it is almost certain to offer payment in rubles and could go into a clear default after the 30-day grace period expires in July.,neutral,0.03,0.53,0.44,mixed,0.03,0.13,0.84,True,English,"['bond default', 'Russia', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees', 'US bond investment house', 'outstanding Russian debt obligations', 'outstanding credit default swaps', 'President Vladimir Putin', '30/360 day count', 'Clearing Corp data', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'second forex account', 'attractive energy deals', 'other Russian Eurobonds', 'other sovereign instruments', '30-day grace period', 'collapsing bond prices', 'Russian sovereign debt', 'Russian finance ministry', 'dual ruble-dollar accounts', 'EU sanctions rules', 'gas bill obligations', 'latest finance ministry', 'late bond payment', 'insurance bond investors', '4.5% 2022 Russian sovereign bonds', 'first default event', '$1.9mn interest payment', 'bond obligations', 'credit risk', 'Derivatives Association', 'Russian Federation', 'Russian state', 'International Swaps', 'credit-default swaps', 'unpaid debt', 'first time', '30-day countdown', 'bond payments', 'US Treasury', 'US dollars', 'Russian banks', 'latest developments', 'default notice', 'sanctions minefield', 'bne IntelliNews', 'new problem', 'next week', 'CDS payouts', 'bond documents', 'Depository Trust', 'military invasion', 'one party', 'minimum threshold', 'controversial “gas', 'ruble equivalent', 'European Commission', 'European companies', 'sanctions requirements', 'Earlier reports', 'interest payments', 'additional interest', 'latest bonds', 'coupon payments', 'two investors', 'rubles proposal', 'The CDDC', 'CDDC meeting', 'accrued interest', 'principal repayment', 'May 4 deadline', 'rubles scheme', '4.5% coupon', 'months', 'manoeuvring', '1917 revolution', 'ability', 'efforts', 'restrictions', 'June', 'ISDA', 'failure', 'start', 'decision', 'kind', 'sum', 'bondholders', 'Euroclear', 'respect', 'maturity', 'April', 'discharge', 'demand', 'ruling', 'Bloomberg', 'net $', 'end-May', 'total', 'year', 'Ukraine', 'case', 'borrower', 'Pimco', 'guarantees', 'protection', 'Barclays', 'JPMorgan', 'Chase', 'cross-default', 'resistance', 'Office', 'OFAC', 'similar', 'market', 'letter', 'law', 'spirit', 'countries', 'Hungary', 'Kremlin', 'result', '14']",2022-06-03,2022-06-03,bne.eu

Since the early 2000s  JCDecaux has worked to bring self-service bikes to as many people as possible. Today  the Group operates more than 25 000 bikes in 10 countries and 73 cities  with a particularly well-developed network in France.

Over 753 million journeys have been made since 2003 using self-service bikes operated by JCDecaux.This success is based on several factors  which highlight the strength of JCDecaux’s “eco-friendly mobility” model:JCDecaux’s ability to develop solutions in partnership with cities   as part of public contracts;an offering of traditional and/or electrically assisted bikes which are innovative  robust and proven in public spaces;an extensive range of services (self-service bikes  long-term rental  adapted bikes  parking solutions  etc.);an omnichannel customer experience which allows each user to manage their use of self-service bikes from their smartphone;fully in-house expertise to deliver continuous scalability of our systems and full control of the value chain from application to the choice of features such as mud guards;self-service bike-share services using a station system and individual bike stands to provide a reliable and optimised user experience;an expert and responsible approach to operations related to bike services (cleaning using rainwater  recycling  zero-emission vehicle fleets);excellence in regulation and maintenance operations  in terms of user safety and through the use of data to match demand to the availability of bikes throughout the day.Story continuesBy listening to cities and citizens  JCDecaux continues to reimagine the future of shared bikes to enhance users’ experience and facilitate their daily travel. This includes the following initiatives: inclusive and cargo bikes  autonomous  solar-powered stations  Mobility as a Service (MaaS – supplying all available mobility services for a region within a single platform as illustrated in Mulhouse)  bike reservations in advance  and introducing an electronic locking system in Lyon that enables users to leave their bikes at a station even if it is full.Thanks to its quality of service  JCDecaux’s bike schemes in France recorded an average satisfaction rate for 2021 of over 92% (satisfaction with the service  ease of use  quality of maintenance  availability of bikes and the level of recommendation).Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer of JCDecaux  said : “We have just unveiled our new strategic ESG roadmap for 2030 and are proud to have led the way for shared eco-friendly urban mobility for the last 20 years. In line with the Group’s business model  we are delighted to finance our bike networks with advertising street furniture so that we can keep subscription and users fees as low as possible without impacting tax payers.

The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company is leveraging its proprietary nanoparticle platform  including its lead product candidate  radiotherapy activated NBTXR3  to develop a pipeline of therapeutic options designed to enhance local and systemic control of solid tumors with an initial focus on the treatment of head and neck cancers.For more information about Nanobiotix  visit us at www.nanobiotix.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter._______________________1 For the purposes of specificity  the agenda published on the Company’s website includes an added draft resolution(n°37)  which will be reflected in the updated agenda to be published in the BALO by June 8  2022.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,positive,0.79,0.18,0.03,True,English,"['NANOBIOTIX Annual Shareholders’ General Meeting', 'June', '60 Rue de Wattignies (5th Floor', 'Annual Combined Shareholders General Meeting', 'Annonces Légales Obligatoires', 'functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles', '9.30 AM Central European Time', 'significant tumor cell death', 'late-stage clinical biotechnology company', 'disruptive, physics-based therapeutic approaches', 'Annual General Meeting', 'Eastern Standard Time', 'Extraordinary Annual Meeting', 'one-time intratumoral injection', 'adaptive immune response', 'long-term anti-cancer memory', 'immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'proprietary nanoparticle platform', 'class oncology product', 'lead product candidate', 'French official bulletin', 'physics-based approaches', 'shareholders’ meeting', 'therapeutic combination', 'therapeutic options', 'solid tumor', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'Regulatory News', 'detailed resolutions', 'principal details', 'applicable law', 'registered office', 'regular basis', 'final terms', 'regulatory requirements', 'Financial Update', 'Third Quarter', 'physical mechanism', 'systemic control', 'initial focus', 'neck cancers', 'treatment possibilities', 'treatment outcomes', 'legal notices', '2022 Financial Agenda', '2022 Half-Year Corporate', 'physical MoA', 'draft resolution', 'updated agenda', 'PARIS', 'CAMBRIDGE', 'Mass', 'NANOBIOTIX', 'Euronext', 'NASDAQ', 'NBTX', 'patients', 'June', 'CET', 'offices', 'France', 'BALO', 'May', 'documents', 'information', 'regulations', 'website', 'annual-general-meetings', 'request', 'email', 'investors', 'modalities', 'participation', 'accordance', 'November', 'radiotherapy', 'action', 'millions', 'people', 'difference', 'humanity', 'pipeline', 'local', 'head', 'LinkedIn', 'Twitter', 'purposes', 'specificity', '3.30']",2022-06-02,2022-06-03,businesswire.com

In this study  performed in an immuno-compromised patient population  MaaT033 presented a good safety and tolerability profile  evaluated as the primary endpoint. The topline results also show rapid and persistent engraftment of MaaT033 in the patients’ gut. The study data support the Company’s preparation to initiate a Phase 2/3 trial later this year to evaluate MaaT033’s ability to improve survival and prevent complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in patients with blood cancers. Every year  approximately 22 000 patients require allo-HSCT in the seven major markets2. MaaT033’s oral formulation is designed to support long-term  ambulatory use  opening up new potential development opportunities for the Company. Today’s announcement confirms previously-announced promising interim results of the trial  which allowed early completion of the study.“Parallel to the clinical successes of our lead candidate MaaT013  we developed MaaT033 as our first oral formulation  and the strength of the engraftment we have seen in these cohorts exceeds our expectations. Together with a good safety profile  this solid evidence for our first oral candidate is a crucial milestone for MaaT Pharma ” commented Hervé Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. “Allo-HSCT is a curative treatment of liquid tumors  that is unfortunately negatively impacted by two primary complications  graft-versus-host disease and severe infections  which hinder overall survival. We view the prevention of these adverse effects as the key to a better prognosis for these patients.”MaaT033 is designed to restore and maintain a healthy gut microbiome in patients with severe dysbiosis3 as a result of intensive chemotherapy and antibiotic treatment. Developed as an oral formulation in lyophilized capsules  its proprietary targeted-delivery design is conceived to optimize the product’s engraftment in the patient’s gut and its interaction with the immune system. Thanks to its high bacterial richness and Butycore™4 content  the product aims to reorient the gut microbial network towards immune homeostasis and restore the microbiome’s intestinal barrier function against infections.“We know from previous studies that AML patients are highly dysbiotic as a result of intensive chemotherapy and antibiotic therapy. From the CIMON trial data  we can be confident that MaaT033 results in robust levels of engraftment in the gut of AML patients at the targeted dose ” said Prof. Christian Recher  Professor of Hematology at the Toulouse University Hospital/IUCT-Oncopole (France) and Principal Investigator of the study. “This strong foundational data supports the launch of the next phase evaluating MaaT033 in preventing allo-HSCT complications in this patient population.”The CIMON Phase 1b trial (NCT04150393) was an open-label  dose-ranging study investigating the maximum tolerated dose of MaaT033 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome who have undergone intensive chemotherapy. The trial enrolled 21 patients in four dose escalation cohorts (up to three capsules a day for 14 days) across six sites in France. The trial allowed to select the recommended dose for MaaT033  which remains confidential at this stage. MaaT033 showed rapid and persistent engraftment with the detection of more than 60% of the MaaT033 microbial communities (OTUs5) in the patient’s gut post-exposure at the selected dose. Substantial engraftment was maintained during the treatment period and for at least three weeks after the end of treatment (last measure). Good tolerability of the candidate was also observed in this immunocompromised population  with only four serious adverse events (SAE) considered as unrelated to the treatment and one possibly related SAE (an infectious diarrhea event with no detection of the causal pathogen in the administered MaaT033 and patient recovery within four days).

The Group reaped the full benefits of rapid growth in new consumption trends  including in particular upmarket movement and the rise of mixology.Current Operating Profit came in at €334.4 million  equating to exceptional organic growth of +39.9% (+56.9% compared to 2019-20). This resulted in strong growth in the Current Operating Margin  up +2.3 percentage points (pp) on an organic basis to an all-time high of 25.5% (up +4.6 pp compared to 2019-20).Rémy Cointreau’s Chief Executive Officer  Eric Vallat  said  “Rémy Cointreau has posted record results that demonstrate the relevance and potential of its brands  backed by genuine savoir-faire  up to three hundred years of history and exceptional terroirs. Progress against our strategic priorities and increased investment in marketing and communications to pave the way for future growth have also played a decisive role. Above all  we are very proud to have reached a new sustainable development milestone: Rémy Cointreau  whose top priority remains to lower its emissions  is the first spirits group to achieve carbon neutrality under its #APlanetOfException plan. In an uncertain environment  Rémy Cointreau is now perfectly equipped and ideally placed to deliver another year of strong growth. On the strength of our progress against our strategic goals  new consumption trends and our robust pricing power  we are starting the year 2022-23 with confidence.”Key figures in €m (unless otherwise stated) 2021-22 2020-21 Change Reported Organic change vs. 2020-21 vs. 2019-20 Sales 1 312.9 1 010.2 +30.0% +27.3% +29.4% Gross margin (%) 68.6% 67.3% +1.3 pp +1.5 pp +2.1 pp Current Operating Profit 334.4 236.1 +41.6% +39.9% +56.9% Current Operating Margin (%) 25.5% 23.4% +2.1 pp +2.3 pp +4.6 pp Net profit – Group share 212.5 144.5 +47.0% +45.7% 86.0% Net profit – Group share excl. non-recurring items 228.1 148.2 +53.9% +52.6% 82.4% Net margin excl. non-recurring items (%) 17.4% 14.7% +2.7 pp +2.9 pp +5.2 pp EPS Group share (€) 4.21 2.89 +45.9% - - EPS Group share excl. non-recurring items (€) 4.52 2.96 +52.8% - - Net debt/EBITDA ratio 0.79 1.33 -0.54 - -Current Operating Profit by division€m (unless otherwise stated) 2021-22 2020-21 Change Reported Organic change vs. 2020-21 vs. 2019-20 Cognac 323.0 221.0 +46.2% +43.8% +58.9% As % of sales 34.1% 30.1% +4.0 pp +4.2 pp +6.1 pp Liqueurs & Spirits 35.5 33.0 +7.4% +10.6% +16.5% As % of sales 10.6% 13.3% -2.7 pp -2.1 pp -1.2 pp Subtotal: Group Brands 358.4 254.0 +41.1% +39.5% +52.7% As % of sales 28.0% 25.8% +2.1 pp +2.4 pp +4.3 pp Partner Brands - (0.8) - - - As % of sales - - - - - Holding company costs (24.0) (17.1) +40.4% +39.9% +19.2% Total 334.4 236.1 +41.6% +39.9% +56.9% As % of sales 25.5% 23.4% +2.1 pp +2.3 pp +4.6 ppCognacSales at the Cognac division grew a remarkable +26.3% on an organic basis in 2021-22 (+30.7% compared to 2019-20)  with volume growth contributing +12.5% and price/mix effects +13.8% thanks to the growing contribution from high-end and mid-range products (Club in China and 1738 in the United States) and price increases. All regions contributed to this excellent performance.Current Operating Profit rose +43.8% on an organic basis to €323.0 million (+58.9% compared to 2019-20). Consequently  the margin rose +4.2 pp on an organic basis to 34.1% (+6.1 pp compared to 2019-20). The significant increase in marketing and communications investment was largely absorbed by very strong growth in the division’s gross margin (evenly split between volume and price/mix effects) and its high operating leverage.Liqueurs & SpiritsSales at the Liqueurs & Spirits division grew +31.7% in 2021-22 (+27.5% compared to 2019-20)  with volume growth contributing +24.6% and price/mix effects +7.1%. The division benefited in particular from excellent performance by Cointreau and Bruichladdich whiskies and the ramp-up in sales of The Botanist.Current Operating Profit came in at €35.5 million  up +10.6% on an organic basis (+16.5% compared to 2019-20). The current operating margin came in at 10.6% (down -2.1 pp on an organic basis). On the strength of its progress against its strategic priorities  the Group opted to reinvest much of its gross margin gains (up +1.5 pp vs. 2020-21 and +3.5 pp vs. 2019-20) in marketing and communications to boost brand awareness and desirability (notably for Cointreau  The Botanist and Bruichladdich whiskies) and pave the way for future growth. At the same time  the Group maintained strict control over its overhead costs.Partner BrandsPartner Brand sales grew +15.2% on an organic basis in 2021-22 (+13.5% compared to 2019-20)  supported by favourable trends in Europe  their main market.In terms of Current Operating Profit  Partner Brands broke even in 2021-22 after posting a -€0.8 million loss in 2020-21.Consolidated resultsCurrent Operating Profit (COP) came in at €334.4 million  up +39.9% on an organic basis (up +41.6% on a reported basis). This performance was mainly driven by exceptional growth in Current Operating Profit from Group Brands (up +39.5% on an organic basis) and takes into account a €6.9 million increase in holding company costs consisting of a €2.0 million donation to the Rémy Cointreau Foundation and €4.9 million in respect of medium- and long-term retention measures  employee savings and the employee share ownership plan.This performance also includes favourable currency effects (+€6.4 million)  mainly as a result of the favourable trend in the euro/yuan exchange rate. Furthermore  the average euro/dollar conversion rate improved from 1.17 in 2020-21 to 1.16 in 2021-22  while the average collection rate (linked to the Group’s hedging policy) came out at 1.17 in 2021-22  stable year on year.Lastly  this performance takes into account adverse consolidation scope effects of -€2.4 million arising from the acquisition of Brillet and Telmont.The Current Operating Margin thus rose sharply  up +2.1 pp on a reported basis to an all-time high of 25.5% (up +2.3 pp on an organic basis). This strong organic growth reflects the following:a +1.5 pp increase in the gross margin (up +2.1 pp vs. 2019-20) to its highest ever level of 68.6%  driven by very favourable price/mix effects and strong growth in volumes(up +2.1 pp vs. 2019-20) to its highest ever level of 68.6%  driven by very favourable price/mix effects and strong growth in volumes excellent absorption of overheads (with the overhead ratio down 2.3 pp on an organic basis)(with the overhead ratio down 2.3 pp on an organic basis) increased investment in marketing and communications (with the ratio up 1.5 pp on an organic basis) to boost brands’ medium-term growth potential(with the ratio up 1.5 pp on an organic basis) to boost brands’ medium-term growth potential neutral currency effects and adverse consolidation scope effects (-0.2 pp)Operating profit came in at €320.3 million  up +35.8% on a reported basis  after taking into account -€14.1 million in non-recurring items.The net financial expense improved from -€14.6 million in 2020-21 to -€13.2 million in 2021-22.The tax expense totalled €95.6 million  giving an effective tax rate of 31.1% (29.3% excluding non-recurring items)  a significant improvement on 2020-21 (35.1% on a reported basis and 33.5% excluding non-recurring items). This improvement was mainly the result of a reduction in the tax rate in France and a favourable geographical mix.After taking into account the Group’s share of net income from associates  net profit attributable to the Group came in at €212.5 million  up +47.0% on a reported basis (up +45.7% on an organic basis).Excluding non-recurring items  net profit attributable to the Group came in at €228.1 million  up +53.9% on a reported basis (up +52.6% on an organic basis)  giving a net margin of 17.4%  up +2.7 pp on a reported basis (up +2.9 pp on an organic basis).Earnings per share (excluding non-recurring items) came out at €4.52  up +52.8% on a reported basis.Net debt stood at €353.3 million  up €39.0 million from the position at 31 March 2021. In addition to free cash flow  this improvement in net debt mainly reflects the non-cash effect of the early conversion of €154.6 million of OCEANE debt  offset by the share buyback programme (€169.5 million) and the payment of a cash dividend (€93.7 million). This resulted in a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.79x at 31 March 2022  compared with 1.33x at 31 March 2021.The return on capital employed (ROCE) came out at 22.2% for the year ended 31 March 2022  up +5.1 pp year on year (up +4.9 pp on an organic basis). Continued strategic purchases of eaux-de-vie adversely affecting capital employed were offset by a significant improvement in the profitability of Group Brands.At the annual general meeting to be held on 21 July 2022  the Board of Directors of Rémy Cointreau will propose the payment of an ordinary dividend of €1.85 per share in cash and an exceptional dividend of €1.0 per share payable in cash or shares. This dividend reflects the Board’s and the management team’s high level of confidence in the Group’s growth outlook.2022-23 outlookIdeally positioned to take advantage of new consumption trends and on the strength of progress against its strategic plan  Rémy Cointreau is starting financial year 2022-23 with confidence.The Group intends to continue implementing its strategy focused on medium-term brand development and underpinned by a policy of sustained investment in marketing and communications. The Group reaffirms its desire to continue to win market share in the exceptional spirits sector and anticipates another year of strong growth. In particular  Rémy Cointreau is forecasting strong first-quarter sales despite a very high base effect and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in China.Helped by excellent pricing power  the improvement in the Current Operating Margin will be driven by the solid resilience of the Group’s gross margin despite the inflationary environment and by strict control over overhead costs.For the full year  the Group expects currency effects to be positive for Current Operating Profit  which it forecasts should be in the range €30-40 million.2030 guidance confirmedOver the last year  Rémy Cointreau has benefited from very strong consumption  reflecting the structural acceleration in consumption trends observed since 2020 in an environment marked by the pandemic: the outperformance of high-end segments  at-home consumption  the rise of mixology  growth in online sales and growing interest in corporate social and environmental responsibility.Rémy Cointreau reiterates its financial and non-financial guidance for 2029-30.On financials  the Group is targeting a gross margin of 72% and a Current Operating Margin of 33% (based on 2019-20 consolidation scope and exchange rates).Through its Sustainable Exception plan  the Group aims to achieve sustainable agriculture across all land on which its spirits depend  as well as a 50% reduction in carbon emissions per bottle by 2030. This will be a first step towards the Group’s ambition of achieving “net zero carbon” by 2050.Rémy Cointreau reaffirms its ambition of becoming the global leader in exceptional spirits.AppendicesSales and Current Operating Profit by division€m (unless otherwise stated) 2021-22 2020-21 Change Reported A Organic B Reported C Reported A/C-1 Organic B/C-1 Sales Cognac 948.3 928.2 735.0 +29.0% +26.3% Liqueurs & Spirits 333.2 327.1 248.3 +34.2% +31.7% Subtotal: Group Brands 1 281.5 1 255.3 983.3 +30.3% +27.7% Partner Brands 31.3 31.0 26.9 +16.3% +15.2% Total 1 312.9 1 286.4 1 010.2 +30.0% +27.3% Current Operating Profit Cognac 323.0 317.8 221.0 +46.2% +43.8% As % of sales 34.1% 34.2% 30.1% +4.0 pp +4.2 pp Liqueurs & Spirits 35.5 36.5 33.0 +7.4% +10.6% As % of sales 10.6% 11.2% 13.3% -2.7 pp -2.1 pp Subtotal: Group Brands 358.4 354.3 254.0 +41.1% +39.5% As % of sales 28.0% 28.2% 25.8% +2.1 pp +2.4 pp Partner Brands - - (0.8) - - As % of sales - - - - - Holding company costs (24.0) (23.9) (17.1) +40.4% +39.9% Total 334.4 330.3 236.1 +41.6% +39.9% As % of sales 25.5% 25.7% 23.4% +2.1 pp +2.3 ppSummary income statement€m (unless otherwise stated) 2021-22 2020-21 Change Reported Organic Reported Reported Organic A B C A/C-1 B/C-1 Sales 1 312.9 1 286.4 1 010.2 +30.0% +27.3% Gross profit 901.1 885.3 680.1 +32.5% +30.2% Gross margin (%) 68.6% 68.8% 67.3% +1.3 pp +1.5 pp Current Operating Profit 334.4 330.3 236.1 +41.6% +39.9% Current operating margin (%) 25.5% 25.7% 23.4% +2.1 pp +2.3 pp Other operating income and expenses (14.1) (14.1) (0.2) - - Operating profit 320.3 316.3 235.9 +35.8% +34.1% Net financial income (expense) (13.2) (13.0) (14.6) -9.4% -11.3% Corporate income tax (95.6) (93.6) (77.6) +23.1% +20.7% Tax rate (%) (31.1%) (30.9%) (35.1%) -4.0 pp -4.2 pp Share in profit (loss) of associates/minority interests 1.0 1.0 0.9 - - Net profit attributable to the Group 212.5 210.6 144.5 +47.0% +45.7% Net profit excluding non-recurring items 228.1 226.2 148.2 +53.9% +52.6% Net profit (excluding non-recurring items)/sales 17.4% 17.6% 14.7% +2.7 pp +2.9 pp EPS Group share (€) 4.21 4.18 2.89 +45.9% - EPS Group share excluding non-recurring items (€) 4.52 4.48 2.96 +52.8% -Reconciliation of net profit and net profit excluding non-recurring items€m 2021-22 2020-21 Net profit attributable to the Group 212.5 144.5 Other operating income and expenses 14.1 0.2 Non-recurring tax items (3.4) (0.1) Effect of changes in the tax rate on deferred taxes in France  the UK and Greece 4.9 3.6 Net profit Group share excluding non-recurring items 228.1 148.2Definitions of alternative performance indicatorsRémy Cointreau’s management process is based on the following alternative performance indicators  selected for planning and reporting purposes. The Group’s management considers that these indicators provide users of the financial statements with useful additional information to help them understand the Group’s performance. These alternative performance indicators should be considered as supplementing those included in the consolidated financial statements and the resulting movements.Organic growth in sales and Current Operating ProfitOrganic growth is calculated excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  acquisitions and disposals. This indicator serves to focus on Group performance common to both financial years  which local management is more directly capable of measuring.The impact of exchange rates is calculated by converting sales and Current Operating Profit for the current financial year using average exchange rates (or  for Current Operating Profit  the hedged exchange rate) from the previous financial year.For acquisitions in the current financial year  sales and Current Operating Profit of acquired entities are not included in organic growth calculations. For acquisitions in the previous financial year  sales and Current Operating Profit of acquired entities are included in the previous financial year; however  they are only included in current year organic growth calculations with effect from the anniversary date of the acquisition.For significant disposals  data is post-application of IFRS 5  under which results of entities disposed of are systematically reclassified under “Net earnings from discontinued operations”.Indicators “excluding non-recurring items”The two items set out below constitute key indicators for measuring recurring business performance  since they exclude significant items which  by virtue of their unusual nature  cannot be considered inherent to the Group’s ongoing performance:Current Operating Profit consists of operating profit before other non-recurring operating income and expenses.Net profit attributable to the Group excluding non-recurring items consists of net profit attributable to the Group adjusted to exclude other non-recurring operating income and expenses  associated tax effects  profit from deconsolidated  divested and discontinued operations and the contribution from dividends paid in cash.Gross operating profit (EBITDA)This measure  which is used in particular to calculate certain ratios  equates to Current Operating Profit less amortisation and depreciation expenses on intangible assets and property  plant and equipment for the period  expenses arising from stock option plans  and dividends received from associates during the period.Net debtNet financial debt as defined and used by the Group is equal to the sum of long- and short-term financial debt and accrued interest  less cash and cash equivalents.About Rémy CointreauAll around the world  there are clients seeking exceptional experiences; clients for whom a wide range of terroirs means a variety of flavors.

Among the Act's provisions are those that would: expand automatic enrollment in 401(k) and 403(b) plans; increase the age at which participants are required to begin receiving mandatory distributions  from age 72 to age 75; increase the catch-up contribution limits for retirement plans and SIMPLE plans for individuals who have attained ages 62  63  and 64; reduce the period of service a long-time  part-time worker must perform in order to be eligible to participate in an employer's 401(k) plan; promote and enhance the Saver's Credit; require all catch-up contributions to qualified retirement plans to be subject to Roth tax treatment; and allow 401(k)  403(b)  and governmental 457(b) plans to provide participants with the option of receiving employer matching contributions on a Roth basis.In addition  the Act would: allow student loan payments to be treated as elective deferrals eligible for matching contributions; authorize penalty-free withdrawals from eligible retirement plans to victims of domestic abuse; provide a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $500 for small employers that allow for immediate plan eligibility for military spouses; increase the tax credit available to small employers for starting a pension plan  from 50% to 100% of qualified start-up costs; and allow employers to provide de minimis financial incentives (e.g.  gift cards) to employees to participate in a retirement plan.Who: Glenn Sulzer  J.D.

The proposals have wide bipartisan support and could very well be passed into law during the current legislative session. Given the scope of the proposed amendments  and the attendant administrative costs  plan sponsors and administrators should consider planning for the changes now."" – Glenn Sulzer  J.D.

5923,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/monos-selects-centric-plm-to-go-the-distance-301559362.html,Monos Selects Centric PLM™ to Go the Distance,Innovative lifestyle travel company sets digital foundation for growth CAMPBELL  Calif.  June 2  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Monos  the travel lifestyle company  has selected Centric Software®'s Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solution. Centric Software provides …,"Founded in 2018 and based in Vancouver  Canada  Monos targeted an underserved section of the travel market in terms of high quality  well-designed luggage that stands the test of time  all at an affordable price point. The DTC brand's philosophy is mindful travel.Hubert Chan  Chief Creative Officer and co-founder says  ""We started by creating the suitcase we always wanted  but couldn't find. Since those early days  we've expanded our product lineup beyond luggage  branching out into other product categories including bags and apparel. We consider ourselves to be not just a luggage brand  but a travel lifestyle brand. For us  travel is an all-encompassing experience and we want to offer a diverse range of products that reflects that.""The timing of the company's inception unfortunately intersected with the COVID-19 outbreak. Chan acknowledges  ""Not long after we launched Monos  and we were starting to see some traction and momentum  the global pandemic essentially shut down worldwide travel. It was a scary time for us as a company.""But in an innovative move  Monos changed gears and came up with a tool that matched the global situation. Chan says  ""We knew we had a great team  so rather than dwelling on the situation  we pivoted and shifted our resources into creating the CleanPod UVC Sterilizer  a portable travel wand that uses ultraviolet-C light to disinfect surfaces. With all of our efforts focused on that  we were able to bring it to market in about six weeks. It found an immediate market fit at the height of the pandemic  and generated a lot of PR coverage. That really helped us stay afloat during this time when no one was thinking about travel. From there  we were able to parlay that success into marketing at a time when other travel brands had essentially stopped—through that  we were able to capture market share  and we saw luggage sales pick up again. We also accelerated our product roadmap  launching the Metro collection of bags—the Metro Backpack  Duffel  Folio Kit and Sling—as well as the Kiyo  a travel water bottle that uses UVC technology to purify drinking water. So we were able to not only survive the pandemic  but thrive. And now we're coming out stronger than ever with a lot of exciting new products in the works.""Kathleen Westerhout  Director of Product says  ""I recently joined Monos and saw right away that we could use a tool like PLM to help centralize everything in one place. I have 10 years of product design and development experience and have worked at large companies with PLM systems. So I understand how foundational PLM is for a company to be able to grow and scale.One area that Monos wants to improve is vendor communication. Westerhout says  ""Our vendors need to be able to see what we're seeing—the exact same format  exact same information because at the moment  we're using a lot of different tools that don't connect with each other and don't synchronize  so there's a lot of information in different places. It's challenging to stay organized and be on the same page with our vendors.""She describes the PLM selection. ""It really came down to a couple of things. First was Centric's option for emerging brands. It fits the stage we're at as a smaller company. Second  is customer experience. From the very beginning  the communication with Centric has been super clear and very professional. They answered all our questions; we feel like a valued customer. What also made the difference  besides choosing the right platform for us  was that we felt like we'd have the support to actually see this project through and be able to build the tool the way that we want. I already have trust in the [Centric] team that they're going to support us for the whole journey.""Chan outlines the expectations for Centric PLM. ""To have one source of truth for everything. We'll have all of our materials  trims  everything centralized. We'll get our vendors on board. Even product information on our online site—if something gets updated  we won't have to think of everywhere that it lives on the website to make the changes since we'll have that single source of truth "" says Chan.President and CEO of Centric Software  Chris Groves  says  ""We are delighted that Monos  our 20th customer in Canada  has chosen to partner with Centric. They've already proven how innovative and agile they are and we can't wait to see their continued success in the future.""Learn more about Centric PLMRequest a DemoMonos is a Canadian travel and lifestyle brand offering high quality  beautifully designed suitcases  bags  and accessories  and inspiring people to travel in a mindful and present way – to embrace the journey as much as the destination.

The proposals have wide bipartisan support and could very well be passed into law during the current legislative session.

Resolution on the merger of Evli and EAB Group PlcIntroductionOn April 22  2022  Evli announced that it has signed a letter of intent on the combination of Evli and EAB Group Plc (the Combination). The objective of the Combination is to create a company that would be one of the leading companies on the Helsinki Stock Exchange to offer investing and wealth management services with a broad expertise and whose clientele would cover institutions  corporations  and private persons. The combined company has a strong financial position and good capabilities for future growth according to the Company’s strategy. The combined company would have the ability to conduct the businesses of current Evli and EAB with better operative efficiency enabling to achieve synergies. After the combination  a broader range of products and services and a wider range of expertise will be available to clients.The Combination will be carried out by way of a statutory absorption merger pursuant to Chapter 16 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act (624/2006 as amended) (the Finnish Companies Act) whereby EAB Group Plc merges into Evli so that all assets and liabilities of EAB Group Plc are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure (the Merger). EAB Group Plc shall automatically dissolve as a result of the completion of the Merger. In the Merger  the shareholders of EAB Group Plc will receive as merger consideration new class B shares in Evli and a cash consideration.Story continuesSimultaneously  the parties intend to execute an arrangement pursuant to which EAB Asset Management Ltd  a fully owned subsidiary of EAB Group Plc  will merge into Evli by way of a statutory absorption merger pursuant to Chapter 16 of the Finnish Companies Act whereby all assets and liabilities of EAB Asset Management Ltd are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure (the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger). EAB Asset Management Ltd shall automatically dissolve as a result of the completion of the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger.More detailed information on the Combination Agreement and the mergers and their reasons are available in the stock exchange release published by Evli on May 31  2022.The contemplated Effective Date of the Merger between Evli and EAB Group Plc is October 1  2022. The merger of Evli and EAB Asset Management Ltd will be completed after the completion of the merger of Evli and EAB Group Plc on or about October 3  2022. The Effective Dates of the Merger can still change in accordance with the merger plans.Holders of Evli’s series A shares representing approximately 85 percent of series A shares in Evli and approximately 82 percent of the votes produced by all Evli shares have undertaken to vote in favour of the Merger at the General Meeting.The General Meeting can only approve or reject the proposed resolutions because the merger plans cannot be altered.Resolution on the merger of Evli and EAB Group PlcThe Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting resolve on the Merger of EAB Group Plc into Evli as set forth in the merger plan approved and signed by the Boards of Directors of Evli and EAB Group Plc on May 31  2022 (the Merger Plan) whereby all assets and liabilities of EAB Group Plc are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure on the Effective Date and that the General Meeting approve the Merger Plan.In addition to the other matters described in the Merger Plan  the resolution on the merger includes  among other things  the following key matters described in more detail below in points (a) and (b):(a) Merger considerationPursuant to the Merger Plan  the shareholders of EAB Group Plc will receive as merger consideration 0.172725 new class B shares in Evli for each share they own in EAB Group Plc and a cash consideration for a total amount of EUR three (3) million  which shall be equally distributed between the outstanding shares of EAB Group Plc. Based on the current amount of outstanding shares the cash consideration would amount to EUR 0.217196 per share (jointly the Merger Consideration). Pursuant to Chapter 16  section 16  subsection 3 of the Finnish Companies Act  shares in EAB Group Plc held by EAB Group Plc or Evli do not carry the right to the Merger Consideration.In case the number of shares received by a shareholder of EAB Group Plc as Merger Consideration is a fractional number (per each book-entry account)  the fractions shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Fractional entitlements to the shares will be aggregated and sold in trading on Nasdaq Helsinki  and the proceeds will be distributed to the shareholders of EAB Group Plc entitled to receive such fractional entitlements in proportion to holding of such fractional entitlements. Any costs related to the sale and distribution of fractional entitlements shall be borne by Evli.As at the date of the notice convening the General Meeting  the aggregate number of shares in EAB Group Plc is 13 843 272 shares. EAB Group Plc holds 30 877 of its own shares. Evli does not hold any shares in EAB Group Plc. Based on the situation on the date of the notice convening the General Meeting  the total number of shares in Evli to be issued as Merger Consideration would therefore be 2 385 745 B shares at maximum. As a result  after the Merger  the shareholders of Evli would own approximately 91 percent of the shares and 99 percent of the votes in Evli  and the shareholders of EAB Group Plc would own approximately 9 percent of the shares and one percent of the votes in Evli.The new shares issued as Merger Consideration will be applied to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Helsinki.(b) Increase of share capitalPursuant to the Merger Plan  the share capital of Evli shall be increased by EUR 30 000 000 in connection with the registration of the completion of the Merger. After the increase  the share capital of Evli is EUR 53 745 459.66.7. Resolution on the Evli/EAB Asset Management MergerIn accordance with the introduction of item 6 above  the Board of Directors of Evli proposes that the General Meeting resolve on the merger of EAB Asset Management Ltd into Evli as set forth in the merger plan approved and signed by the Boards of Directors of Evli and EAB Asset Management Ltd on May 31  2022 (the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger Plan) whereby all assets and liabilities of EAB Asset Management Ltd are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure on the Effective Date in the manner set forth in the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger Plan and that the General Meeting approve the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger Plan. As the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger is completed after the merger of Evli and EAB Group Plc has been completed  EAB Asset Management Ltd shall be a fully owned subsidiary of Evli at the time of completion and no merger consideration shall be issued.8.

Resolution on the merger of Evli and EAB Group PlcIntroductionOn April 22  2022  Evli announced that it has signed a letter of intent on the combination of Evli and EAB Group Plc (the Combination). The objective of the Combination is to create a company that would be one of the leading companies on the Helsinki Stock Exchange to offer investing and wealth management services with a broad expertise and whose clientele would cover institutions  corporations  and private persons. The combined company has a strong financial position and good capabilities for future growth according to the Company’s strategy. The combined company would have the ability to conduct the businesses of current Evli and EAB with better operative efficiency enabling to achieve synergies. After the combination  a broader range of products and services and a wider range of expertise will be available to clients.The Combination will be carried out by way of a statutory absorption merger pursuant to Chapter 16 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act (624/2006 as amended) (the Finnish Companies Act) whereby EAB Group Plc merges into Evli so that all assets and liabilities of EAB Group Plc are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure (the Merger). EAB Group Plc shall automatically dissolve as a result of the completion of the Merger. In the Merger  the shareholders of EAB Group Plc will receive as merger consideration new class B shares in Evli and a cash consideration.Simultaneously  the parties intend to execute an arrangement pursuant to which EAB Asset Management Ltd  a fully owned subsidiary of EAB Group Plc  will merge into Evli by way of a statutory absorption merger pursuant to Chapter 16 of the Finnish Companies Act whereby all assets and liabilities of EAB Asset Management Ltd are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure (the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger). EAB Asset Management Ltd shall automatically dissolve as a result of the completion of the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger.More detailed information on the Combination Agreement and the mergers and their reasons are available in the stock exchange release published by Evli on May 31  2022.The contemplated Effective Date of the Merger between Evli and EAB Group Plc is October 1  2022. The merger of Evli and EAB Asset Management Ltd will be completed after the completion of the merger of Evli and EAB Group Plc on or about October 3  2022. The Effective Dates of the Merger can still change in accordance with the merger plans.Holders of Evli’s series A shares representing approximately 85 percent of series A shares in Evli and approximately 82 percent of the votes produced by all Evli shares have undertaken to vote in favour of the Merger at the General Meeting.The General Meeting can only approve or reject the proposed resolutions because the merger plans cannot be altered.Resolution on the merger of Evli and EAB Group PlcThe Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting resolve on the Merger of EAB Group Plc into Evli as set forth in the merger plan approved and signed by the Boards of Directors of Evli and EAB Group Plc on May 31  2022 (the Merger Plan) whereby all assets and liabilities of EAB Group Plc are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure on the Effective Date and that the General Meeting approve the Merger Plan.In addition to the other matters described in the Merger Plan  the resolution on the merger includes  among other things  the following key matters described in more detail below in points (a) and (b):(a) Merger considerationPursuant to the Merger Plan  the shareholders of EAB Group Plc will receive as merger consideration 0.172725 new class B shares in Evli for each share they own in EAB Group Plc and a cash consideration for a total amount of EUR three (3) million  which shall be equally distributed between the outstanding shares of EAB Group Plc. Based on the current amount of outstanding shares the cash consideration would amount to EUR 0.217196 per share (jointly the Merger Consideration). Pursuant to Chapter 16  section 16  subsection 3 of the Finnish Companies Act  shares in EAB Group Plc held by EAB Group Plc or Evli do not carry the right to the Merger Consideration.In case the number of shares received by a shareholder of EAB Group Plc as Merger Consideration is a fractional number (per each book-entry account)  the fractions shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Fractional entitlements to the shares will be aggregated and sold in trading on Nasdaq Helsinki  and the proceeds will be distributed to the shareholders of EAB Group Plc entitled to receive such fractional entitlements in proportion to holding of such fractional entitlements. Any costs related to the sale and distribution of fractional entitlements shall be borne by Evli.As at the date of the notice convening the General Meeting  the aggregate number of shares in EAB Group Plc is 13 843 272 shares. EAB Group Plc holds 30 877 of its own shares. Evli does not hold any shares in EAB Group Plc. Based on the situation on the date of the notice convening the General Meeting  the total number of shares in Evli to be issued as Merger Consideration would therefore be 2 385 745 B shares at maximum. As a result  after the Merger  the shareholders of Evli would own approximately 91 percent of the shares and 99 percent of the votes in Evli  and the shareholders of EAB Group Plc would own approximately 9 percent of the shares and one percent of the votes in Evli.The new shares issued as Merger Consideration will be applied to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Helsinki.(b) Increase of share capitalPursuant to the Merger Plan  the share capital of Evli shall be increased by EUR 30 000 000 in connection with the registration of the completion of the Merger. After the increase  the share capital of Evli is EUR 53 745 459.66.7. Resolution on the Evli/EAB Asset Management MergerIn accordance with the introduction of item 6 above  the Board of Directors of Evli proposes that the General Meeting resolve on the merger of EAB Asset Management Ltd into Evli as set forth in the merger plan approved and signed by the Boards of Directors of Evli and EAB Asset Management Ltd on May 31  2022 (the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger Plan) whereby all assets and liabilities of EAB Asset Management Ltd are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure on the Effective Date in the manner set forth in the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger Plan and that the General Meeting approve the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger Plan.

The information may differ from the expense ratios disclosed in this report.† Marsico Capital Management  LLC (the “Adviser”) has entered into a written expense limitation and fee waiver agreement under which it has agreed (i) to limit the total expenses of the Investor Class of each Fund (excluding taxes  interest  acquired fund fees and expenses  litigation  extraordinary expenses  and brokerage and other transaction expenses relating to the purchase or sale of portfolio investments) to an annual rate of 1.50% of the average net assets attributable to Investor Class shares of the International Opportunities Fund and Global Fund  and (ii) to limit the total expenses of the Institutional Class of each Fund (excluding taxes  interest  acquired fund fees and expenses  litigation  extraordinary expenses  and brokerage and other transaction expenses relating to the purchase or sale of portfolio investments) to an annual rate of 1.25% of the average net assets attributable to Institutional Class shares of the International Opportunities Fund and Global Fund  until January 31  2023. This expense limitation and fee waiver agreement may be terminated by the Adviser at any time after January 31  2023  upon 15 days prior notice to the Fund and its administrator. The Adviser may recoup from a Fund fees previously waived or expenses previously reimbursed by the Adviser with respect to that Fund pursuant to this agreement (or a previous expense limitation agreement) if: (1) such recoupment by the Adviser does not cause the Fund  at the time of recoupment  to exceed the lesser of (a) the expense limitation in effect at the time the relevant amount was waived and/or reimbursed  or (b) the expense limitation in effect at the time of the proposed recoupment  and (2) the recoupment is made within three years after the fiscal year end date as of which the amount to be waived or reimbursed was determined and the waiver or reimbursement occurred.(1) The performance data quoted here represent past performance  and past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

In the absence of such a waiver or reimbursement  the performance returns reflected would have been reduced. In accordance with the expense limitation and fee waiver agreement  the Adviser may recoup fees and expenses previously waived or reimbursed under certain parameters. Periodically  the Adviser has recouped such fees or expenses from the Growth Fund  Midcap Growth Focus Fund  International Opportunities Fund  and Global Fund  resulting in a lower performance return.(3) Institutional Class shares commenced operations on December 6  2021.

These sectors may include more than one industry. The Fund’s portfolio composition is subject to change at any time.4MARKET ENVIRONMENTMARKET ENVIRONMENT: OCTOBER 2021 – MARCH 2022 (UNAUDITED)Over the course of the last six months the world and likewise capital markets have had to deal with a confluence of issues  such as the rise of yet another variant of COVID-19 (“Omicron”)  rising and persistent inflationary pressures driven by imbalances created during the COVID-19 pandemic  and tragically  the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine  which has obvious and significant global security and economic implications. While we can envision a path toward improving conditions  the range of outcomes are wide and we anticipate many of these issues will continue to remain front and center for capital markets for the foreseeable future. Within this context  we continue to believe a portfolio of innovative  high-quality growth companies is well-positioned to navigate this uncertain environment.The war between Russia and Ukraine created a stunning change in global security and economic conditions  upending decades-long globalization trends  which supported low inflation global GDP growth. While the human tragedy seems unimaginable  disruptions to Ukraine’s agriculture sector (which  when combined with Russia’s  is estimated to produce more than 10% of global calories consumed) have significant implications for the global food supply and have led to dramatic price rises in grain commodities. Similarly  Ukraine serves as a manufacturing and technology hub for companies around the world and the war has led companies like BMW and Volkswagen to slow and  in certain cases  halt Western European automobile production. Significant sanctions imposed by Western countries on Russia’s financial  consumer  technology and energy sectors have led to a sharp contraction in the Russian economy and have similarly raised concerns over global energy supply  particularly as it relates to Western Europe  where countries like Germany source roughly 40% of their natural gas needs from Russia. This could put a significant strain on resources across Europe as the need to diversify energy security  improve defense capabilities and undertake humanitarian efforts takes priority.A consequence of these actions has been a tangible impact on inflation expectations across the globe. Entering the year  we expected year-over-year inflationary trends to peak during the first half of 2022 and subsequently subside as the year progressed due to the combination of base effects  a normalization in goods consumption  improving supply chains  increased labor participation and a change in US Federal Reserve policy. In many respects  this hypothesis is starting to emerge as used car and container shipping prices have begun to moderate  in addition to improving labor participation trends. While we continue to believe these trends will benefit core inflation in 2022  we expect that the recent price spike in energy and grain commodities will likely dampen the improvement and result in inflationary pressures lingering longer than previously anticipated. As a result  the US Federal Reserve has taken a more proactive approach to containing inflation  signaling several interest-rate increases on the horizon as well as a contraction of financial assets on its balance sheet. Across markets  this has resulted in the benchmark 10-Year US Treasury note rate increasing significantly to start the year  creating a divergence in financial asset performance across markets.These past several years have presented a series of extraordinary events  the likes of which we have never seen. However  during this period  we are generally pleased with our results as we have attempted to stay consistent with our process in identifying high quality growth companies at attractive valuations for investment.

The Institutional Class shares commenced operations on December 6  2021. The performance attributed to the Institutional Class shares prior to that date is that of the Investor Class shares and has not been adjusted to reflect the lower expenses of the Institutional Class shares. During this period  Institutional Class shares would have had returns similar to  but potentially higher than  the Investor Class shares due to the fact that Institutional Class shares represent interests in the same portfolio as Investor Class shares but are subject to lower expenses. The total return information presented here for comparison purposes differs from the total return information disclosed for the Institutional Class shares in the Financial Highlights. The total return information in the Financial Highlights represents the performance for the portion of the fiscal period in which the Institutional Class was operational. The Fund underperformed its benchmark index  the S&P 500 Index  which had a total return of +5.92% over the same time period. Please see the Fund’s Overview for more detailed information about the Fund’s longer-term performance for various time periods ended March 31  2022.The performance data quoted here represent past performance  and past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares  when redeemed  may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information quoted.

Shareholders should keep in mind that the Fund is intended for long-term investors who hold their shares for substantially longer periods of time. You should also keep in mind that our current views and beliefs regarding all investments discussed in this report are subject to change at any time. References to specific securities  industries  and sectors discussed in this report are not recommendations to buy or sell such securities or related investments  and the Fund may not necessarily hold these securities or investments today. Please see the accompanying Schedule of Investments for the percentage of the Fund’s portfolio represented by the securities mentioned in this report as of the end of the reporting period.The Focus Fund is non-diversified and may hold fewer securities than a diversified fund because it is permitted to invest a greater percentage of its assets in a smaller number of issuers. Holding securities of fewer issuers increases the risk that the value of the Fund could go down because of the poor performance of a single investment or may be more volatile than its benchmark. The Fund is subject to broad risks associated with investing in equity securities markets generally  including the risks that the securities and markets in which it invests may experience volatility and instability  that domestic and global economies and markets may undergo periods of cyclical change and decline  that investors may at times avoid investments in equity securities  and those investments may not perform as anticipated. Please see the Prospectus for more information.The Fund is not managed to track its benchmark index  and may hold a substantially overweight or underweight position in a sector  industry  or security compared to its weight in the benchmark. The Fund may be subject to risks associated with a particular sector or other area in which it is overweight  including the risk that the stocks of companies within one area could simultaneously decline in price because of an event that affects the entire area. For informational purposes  the discussion below may compare the benchmark weight or performance of a sector or industry to the investment approach of the Fund.The Focus Fund’s underperformance during the six-month period ended March 31  2022  as compared to the S&P 500 Index  can be primarily attributed to certain stock selection in the Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors  as defined in the Global Industry Classification Standard (“GICS”)(2). From a sector allocation perspective  the Fund’s relative performance was dampened by maintaining an overweight allocation to the Communication Services sector  the weakest-performing area of the benchmark index  and by having no investments in the Energy sector  which was the strongest-performing sector of the benchmark index.Despite strong operating results  Consumer Discretionary stock On Holding A.G. – Cl. A (-29%) detracted from overall performance of the Fund due to a broader trade in the market away from high growth  high multiple stocks  given more hawkish commentary from the US Federal Reserve due to inflationary concerns.Information Technology holding PayPal Holdings  Inc. (-44%) detracted significantly from performance amid growing competition in online checkout options and diminishing e-commerce tailwinds relative to the previous six months  both of which have challenged investor sentiment. Additionally  it remains unclear how cryptocurrencies  blockchain technology  and stablecoins may continue to impact and potentially disrupt the payment ecosystem moving forward.6FOCUS FUNDOn the positive end of the spectrum  the Fund’s performance was boosted by stock selection in the Industrials sector  as well as certain other individual stocks discussed further below. Additionally  the Fund’s overweight allocation to the Information Technology sector  a solid performer for the benchmark index during the period  provided a tailwind to performance.Information Technology holding NVIDIA Corp. (“NVIDIA”) (+26%) was a top contributor to the Fund’s performance during the period  reporting a better-than-expected recent fiscal quarter and introducing a host of new products and services at its March Investor Day. Demand by NVIDIA’s customers is tracking well ahead of NVIDIA’s supply in both the key gaming and datacenter businesses  and this dynamic is expected to continue through calendar year 2022. Datacenter strength is broad-based with cloud providers  high-performance computing customers  and enterprises all contributing to growth. In addition  NVIDIA’s recent Investor Day introduced the latest graphics processing unit chip and platform for the datacenter space  named “Hopper.” This new chip is expected to be launched for gaming applications in the fall of 2022  updating a two-year-old product  and we believe it will drive a healthy refresh cycle. In addition to hardware  NVIDIA is leaning into enterprise software and has had several launches in the space targeting industries such as healthcare  manufacturing  and retail. Further  enthusiasm continues to build for NVIDIA’s Omniverse product  which is in beta testing and is aimed at taking advantage of the continued development of and focus on the metaverse.Industrials sector stock United Parcel Service  Inc. – Cl. B (“UPS”) was also a strong  positive contributor to Fund performance during the period  posting a total return of +24%. UPS was an outperformer over the last six months as the company continues to focus on increasing its profitability metrics and return on investment. The company mantra under CEO Carol Tome is that not all volume is created equally and UPS will no longer chase volume to sacrifice profitability. The COVID-19 pandemic has created supply chain disruptions as well as retail channel shifts which have hurt other companies within the transportation sector. UPS has outperformed many other companies during this time period by focusing on higher growth  higher return market segments  such as small to medium business channels  and business-to-consumer e-commerce  in addition to applying automation to eliminate unnecessary costs for package distribution. This has led to industry-leading growth as well as incremental margin profitability for the company overall.During the reporting period  the Fund increased its exposure to the Information Technology sector and decreased its allocation to the Health Care sector. There were no significant changes to the Fund’s allocations to the Financials  Consumer Discretionary  Industrials  Materials  or Communication Services sectors.Fiscal Period-End Investment PostureAs of March 31  2022  the Fund’s largest economic sector allocations included Information Technology  Consumer Discretionary  and Communication Services. As of that date  the Fund had no investments in the Consumer Staples  Energy  Real Estate  or Utilities sectors.Sincerely THOMAS F. MARSICOBRANDON A.

For informational purposes  the discussion below may compare the benchmark weight or performance of a sector or industry to the investment approach of the Fund.The Growth Fund’s underperformance during the six-month period ended March 31  2022  as compared to the S&P 500 Index  can primarily be attributed to weak stock selection in several areas  including the Information Technology  Communication Services and Health Care sectors  as defined in the Global Industry Classification Standard (“GICS”)(2). From a sector allocation perspective  the Fund’s relative performance was further dampened by maintaining an overweight allocation to the Communication Services sector  the weakest-performing sector of the benchmark index  and by having no investments in the Energy sector  which was the strongest-performing sector of the benchmark index.Information Technology holding PayPal Holdings  Inc. (-58%) detracted significantly from performance amid growing competition in online checkout options and diminishing e-commerce tailwinds relative to the previous six months  both of which have challenged investor sentiment. Additionally  it remains unclear how cryptocurrencies  blockchain technology  and stablecoins may continue to impact and potentially disrupt the payment ecosystem moving forward.In the Communication Services sector  Sea Ltd. ADR (“Sea”) detracted from performance  returning -62% prior to being sold. Sea was a top detractor from the Fund’s relative performance as the company issued guidance that equated to declining revenue from its gaming division. “Free Fire” is Sea’s key gaming franchise and we believe that investors likely fear the franchise has matured. While we see this drawdown for near term issues as being overstated and continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory for Sea and its myriad of drivers  we exited the position to pursue other attractive investment opportunities.Health Care sector holding DexCom  Inc. (“DexCom”) (-8%) also hindered the Fund’s results. Dexcom was an underperformer during the period as the company’s US revenue growth was impacted by the resurgence of COVID-19 via Omicron. The company noted that inpatient consultations and physician visits were negatively impacted by the pandemic  which resulted in a domestic revenue growth shortfall for the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition  the company has been switching product distribution from medical equipment10GROWTH FUNDdistributors to retail pharmacies  which has impacted the company’s average sales price per patient added. We remain optimistic on the company overall as the pandemic fades over time  DexCom’s distribution model shift is completed  and the company receives approval for its next generation device  known as the G7 in the US  in the first half of 2022.On the positive end of the spectrum  the Fund’s performance was boosted relative to its benchmark index by the positive results of certain individual positions  discussed further below. Additionally  the Fund’s underweight allocation to the Financials sector  one of the weaker-performing sectors of the benchmark index during the period  provided a small tailwind to relative performance.Consumer Discretionary holding Tesla  Inc. (“Tesla”) (+39%) was one of the largest contributors to the Fund’s performance overall during the period. Tesla contributed positively to Fund performance through the stock’s significant appreciation  as well as the Fund’s overweight position as compared to the benchmark index. Tesla continued to produce and deliver products at a much faster pace than expected  despite headwinds from supply chain issues and COVID-19-related restrictions. As a result  Tesla has furthered its lead in the electronic vehicle space. The company has recently opened factories in Berlin and Austin  which we believe should lead to significant growth in sales and operating profit.Information Technology holding NVIDIA Corp. (“NVIDIA”) (+33%) was a top contributor to the Fund’s performance during the period  reporting a better-than-expected recent fiscal quarter and introducing a host of new products and services at its March Investor Day. Demand by NVIDIA’s customers is tracking well ahead of NVIDIA’s supply in both the key gaming and datacenter businesses  and this dynamic is expected to continue through calendar year 2022.

The Institutional Class shares commenced operations on December 6  2021. The performance attributed to the Institutional Class shares prior to that date is that of the Investor Class shares and has not been adjusted to reflect the lower expenses of the Institutional Class shares. During this period  Institutional Class shares would have had returns similar to  but potentially higher than  the Investor Class shares due to the fact that Institutional Class shares represent interests in the same portfolio as Investor Class shares but are subject to lower expenses. The total return information presented here for comparison purposes differs from the total return information disclosed for the Institutional Class shares in the Financial Highlights. The total return information in the Financial Highlights represents the performance for the portion of the fiscal period in which the Institutional Class was operational. The Fund underperformed the Russell Midcap Growth Index  the Fund’s benchmark index  which had a total return of -10.09% over the same time period. Please see the Fund’s Overview for more detailed information about the Fund’s longer-term performance for various time periods ended March 31  2022.The performance data quoted here represent past performance  and past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares  when redeemed  may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information quoted. To obtain performance information current to the most recent month-end  please call 888-860-8686 or visit marsicofunds.com .(1)This review highlights Fund performance over a six-month fiscal period. Shareholders should keep in mind that the Fund is intended for long-term investors who hold their shares for substantially longer periods of time. You should also keep in mind that our current views and beliefs regarding all investments discussed in this report are subject to change at any time. References to specific securities  industries  and sectors discussed in this report are not recommendations to buy or sell such securities or related investments  and the Fund may not necessarily hold these securities or investments today. Please see the accompanying Schedule of Investments for the percentage of the Fund’s portfolio represented by the securities mentioned in this report as of the end of the reporting period.The Fund is subject to broad risks associated with investing in equity securities markets generally  including the risks that the securities and markets in which it invests may experience volatility and instability  that domestic and global economies and markets may undergo periods of cyclical change and decline  that investors may at times avoid investments in equity securities  and that investments may not perform as anticipated.The Fund’s investments in medium-capitalization or midcap companies  as well as any investments in small-cap companies  can involve more risk than investments in larger companies because medium-capitalization and smaller companies have potentially greater sensitivity to adverse business or economic conditions. Medium-capitalization and smaller companies may have more limited financial resources  markets or product lines  less access to capital markets  and more limited trading in their stocks. This can cause the prices of equity securities of these companies to be more volatile than those of larger companies  or to decline more significantly during market downturns than the market as a whole. Please see the Prospectus for more information.The Fund is not managed to track its benchmark index  and may hold a substantially overweight or underweight position in a sector  industry  or security compared to its weight in the benchmark. The Fund may be subject to risks associated with a particular sector or other area in which it is overweight  including the risk that the stocks of companies within one area could simultaneously decline in price because of an event that affects the entire area. For informational purposes  the discussion below may compare the benchmark weight or performance of a sector or industry to the investment approach of the Fund.The Midcap Growth Focus Fund’s underperformance during the six-month period ended March 31  2022 as compared to its benchmark  the Russell Midcap Growth Index  was due  in part  to weak stock selection in the Health Care and Information Technology sectors  as defined in the Global Industry Classification Standard (“GICS”)(2). From a sector allocation perspective  the Fund’s relative performance was penalized by having no exposure to the strongest-performing sector of the benchmark index  Energy  and an overweight posture in the weaker-performing Health Care sector.In the Health Care sector  Natera  Inc. (“Natera”) (-64%) emerged as one of the Fund’s largest detractors to performance overall. Natera was an underperformer for the reporting period as company growth prospects in the noninvasive prenatal test (“NIPT”) market were questioned. Natera remains an industry leader in the analysis of circulating DNA to evaluate the potential for genetic disorders  cancer tumor growth  and organ transplant rejection. Although the company’s NIPT products represent a significant majority of Natera’s revenue growth to date  the company is in the early phase of new product launches in the oncology and organ transplant markets. We believe that these new products should generate higher average sales prices and operating margins as these new markets for the company are less penetrated when compared to the NIPT market. Going forward  we believe the company should continue to outpace its respective industry growth overall due to its recent product launches.14MIDCAP GROWTH FOCUS FUNDInformation Technology sector holding Twilio  Inc. - Cl. A (“Twilio”) (-48%) was the largest individual detractor to performance for the Fund for the period  as the company issued guidance that pointed to slowing organic revenue and bookings growth. Twilio enables communication between businesses and consumers and benefitted greatly from different use cases during the pandemic. As the effects of COVID-19 and related restrictions have eased  the relative strength of the business-to-consumer mobile communications segment tempered as users started to spend more time outside the home. We still believe in the long-term prospects of the company and see this period as a blip in the growth trajectory for Twilio.The Fund had some bright spots during the period  including stock selection in the Consumer Discretionary sector and other individual holdings  as discussed further below. The Fund’s underweight allocation to the Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary sectors  two of the weakest-performing sectors of the benchmark index during the period  aided relative performance. Additionally  as the Fund’s benchmark index returned -10.09% during the period  relative Fund performance was boosted by maintaining a 5% cash position on average.Consumer Discretionary holding Hilton Worldwide Holdings  Inc. (“Hilton”) (+15%) performed well for the Fund. An overweight allocation to this stock as compared to the benchmark index created an additional boost to Fund performance. Hilton was a key contributor to the performance of the Fund as leisure demand for travel recovered exceptionally well after the Omicron wave swept across the globe.Information Technology sector holding Marvell Technology  Inc. (“Marvell”) (+20%) emerged as a strong individual contributor to performance for the reporting period due to its strong execution in a highly constrained supply environment. Demand by Marvell’s customers is tracking materially ahead of Marvell’s supply  which is expected to continue through calendar year 2022 and into 2023 despite Marvell obtaining incrementally more manufacturing capacity during this time. The company’s datacenter segment has been the primary driver of absolute sales growth over the past two quarters  reflecting Marvell’s successful transition to more advanced semiconductor production along with key strategic acquisitions over the past couple of years. The smaller  but faster-growing automotive and industrial businesses are leveraging technology from the company’s datacenter and networking businesses  and are benefitting from the trends relating to autonomous driving and factory automation. Additionally  Marvell has strong exposure to 5G base station providers  and is seeing meaningful content growth with a broadening out of 5G investment versus the concentration of early spending in the US and China.During the reporting period  the Fund eliminated its sole holding in the Materials sector and its exposure to the Communication Services sector was reduced. The Fund increased its allocation to the Information Technology sector. There were no significant changes to the Fund’s allocations to the Real Estate  Health Care  Financials  Consumer Discretionary  or Industrials sectors.Fiscal Period-End Investment PostureAs of March 31  2022  the Fund’s primary economic sector allocations included Information Technology  Health Care  Consumer Discretionary  and Industrials. At period end  the Fund had no investments in the Consumer Staples  Energy  Materials  or Utilities sectors.Sincerely BRANDON A.

The Institutional Class shares commenced operations on December 6  2021. The performance attributed to the Institutional Class shares prior to that date is that of the Investor Class shares and has not been adjusted to reflect the lower expenses of the Institutional Class shares. During this period  Institutional Class shares would have had returns similar to  but potentially higher than  the Investor Class shares due to the fact that Institutional Class shares represent interests in the same portfolio as Investor Class shares but are subject to lower expenses. The total return information presented here for comparison purposes differs from the total return information disclosed for the Institutional Class shares in the Financial Highlights. The total return information in the Financial Highlights represents the performance for the portion of the fiscal period in which the Institutional Class was operational. The Fund underperformed the MSCI Europe Australasia Far East (“EAFE”) Index  the Fund’s benchmark index  which had a total return of (US$) -3.38% over the same time period. Please see the Fund’s Overview for more detailed information about the Fund’s longer-term performance for various time periods ended March 31  2022.The performance data quoted here represent past performance  and past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares  when redeemed  may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Shareholders should keep in mind that the Fund is intended for long-term investors who hold their shares for substantially longer periods of time. You should also keep in mind that our current views and beliefs regarding all investments discussed in this report are subject to change at any time. References to specific securities  industries  and sectors discussed in this report are not recommendations to buy or sell such securities or related investments  and the Fund may not necessarily hold these securities or investments today. Please see the accompanying Schedule of Investments for the percentage of the Fund’s portfolio represented by the securities mentioned in this report as of the end of the reporting period.Foreign investments present additional risks due to currency fluctuations  economic and political factors  lower liquidity  differences in securities regulations and accounting standards  possible changes in taxation  limited public information  and other factors. In addition  the Fund is subject to broad risks associated with investing in equity securities markets generally  including the risks that the securities and markets in which it invests may experience volatility and instability  that domestic and global economies and markets may undergo periods of cyclical change and decline  that investors may at times avoid investments in equity securities  and that investments may not perform as anticipated. Please see the Prospectus for more information.The Fund is not managed to track its benchmark index  and may hold a substantially overweight or underweight position in a sector  industry  or security compared to its weight in the benchmark. The Fund may be subject to risks associated with a particular sector or other area in which it is overweight  including the risk that the stocks of companies within one area could simultaneously decline in price because of an event that affects the entire area. For informational purposes  the discussion below may compare the benchmark weight or performance of a sector or industry to the investment approach of the Fund.The International Opportunities Fund’s underperformance during the six-month period ended March 31  2022  as compared to the MSCI EAFE Index  was primarily due to stock selection in several sectors  including the Communication Services  Industrials  and Information Technology sectors  as defined in the Global Industry Classification Standard (“GICS”)(2). In addition  the Fund’s relative performance was dampened by having an overweight allocation to the benchmark index’s weakest-performing area  the Information Technology sector  and an underweight allocation to the benchmark index’s strongest-performing areas  the Energy and Materials sectors.In the Communication Services sector  Sea Ltd. ADR (“Sea”) detracted from performance  returning -61%. Sea was a top detractor from the Fund’s relative performance as the company issued guidance that equated to declining revenue from its gaming division. “Free Fire” is Sea’s key gaming franchise and we believe that investors likely fear the franchise has matured. We see this drawdown for near term issues as being overstated and continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory for Sea.Industrials sector holding Wizz Air Holdings PLC (“Wizz Air”) contributed negatively to Fund performance as it returned -43% for the period. We believe Wizz Air remains a strong long-term growth story as a well situated  well capitalized and highly cost efficient Eastern European airline poised to double its fleet capacity over the next three years. Nevertheless  the stock has been weak in recent months given the war in Ukraine and the significant rise of oil prices. We have reduced the size of the Fund’s position in Wizz Air as we wait for more clarity on the longer-term impacts of travel demand trends in Eastern Europe and higher oil prices on the company  but remain confident in Wizz Air given what we believe to be its sound business model and strong growth plan.Information Technology stock MercadoLibre  Inc. (“MercadoLibre”) (-29%) also detracted from Fund performance for the period. We believe MercadoLibre shares have underperformed recently primarily for two reasons. First  most high growth  unprofitable e-commerce stocks around the world have sold off in recent months as we lap tough COVID-19-related sales comparisons and interest rates rise significantly (depressing long duration growth multiples). This issue is not specific to MercadoLibre and we believe it should have no impact on the company’s long-term growth and earnings prospects—both of which remain very strong. The second issue is that many Brazilian payment stocks have been weak in recent months due to rising Brazilian interest rates and19INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FUNDtougher competition. A small part of MercadoLibre’s business is tied to financial technology (fintech) and merchant acquiring  and as rates have risen and made the net interest margin in this business less profitable  the profitability of the fintech side of MercadoLibre has been valued lower. Despite this  the company has now reported two very strong quarters in a row  continues to improve the underlying profitability of its core e-commerce business  and remains a share taker in the growing e-commerce space in Latin America. MercadoLibre’s fintech business also continues to grow nicely  though we believe management has rightly shifted toward a “profit first” strategy. Our medium-term outlook for MercadoLibre remains optimistic given the company’s dominance in Latin America e-commerce  which we believe is in the early innings of growth.On the positive side  certain holdings in the Consumer Staples sector  along with certain other individual contributors  provided a boost to Fund performance. An overweight allocation to the relatively stronger-performing Health Care sector provided an additional tailwind to performance.In the Health Care sector  AstraZeneca PLC (“AstraZeneca”) (+13%) performed well for the Fund. During the reporting period  AstraZeneca continued to report industry-leading top line growth as a result of new product innovation in the company’s Oncology  Cardiovascular  Renal and Metabolism divisions. Additionally  as AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Alexion in June of 2021  the company entered into the marketing of medicines for rare diseases  a market with faster revenue growth and higher operating margins when compared to traditional pharmaceutical manufacturers. We believe this portfolio transition  along with new product innovation  was reflected in the reporting period and should continue to lead to AstraZeneca reporting above-industry top line growth  operating profitability and cash flow for the foreseeable future.Retailing giant Dollarama  Inc. (“Dollarama”) was another strong contributor to performance  posting +30% for the period. Dollarama was a top contributor to the Fund’s performance due to its strong execution against a very tough backdrop for retailers. Dollarama’s modus operandi involves concurrently contracting with its goods providers  which are primarily in China  6-12 months ahead of time  contracting the applicable freight for the products and hedging currencies. This sourcing practice of Dollarama’s became a competitive advantage in the current environment of supply shortages  inflation  and greatly increased freight costs. In addition  we believe Dollarama’s demonstrated ability to migrate select items to higher price points to cover higher costs should lead to higher sales growth and margin performance.Although active currency management is not a central facet of the International Opportunities Fund’s investment process  fluctuations in major world currencies can at times affect the Fund’s performance. During the period  the net effect of currency moves had a positive impact on Fund performance.There were several shifts in the Fund’s sector allocations during the period. The Fund reduced its allocations to the Consumer Discretionary and Communication Services sectors  and increased its allocations to the Financials and Consumer Staples sectors. There were no significant changes to the Fund’s allocations to the Information Technology  Real Estate  Health Care  Materials  Energy or Industrials sectors.Fiscal Period-End Investment PostureAs of March 31  2022  the Fund’s primary economic sector allocations included the Information Technology  Health Care  Industrials  Financials  Consumer Discretionary  and Communication Services sectors. The Fund had no investments in the Utilities sector.In terms of country allocations  the Fund’s most significant weightings at period-end  excluding short-term investments  were in Japan  Germany  Switzerland  the United Kingdom  France  China/Hong Kong  and Canada. Country-level weightings generally should be considered a residual of the Fund’s stock selection process rather than a major  proactive facet of its investment strategy.Sincerely THOMAS F.

The Institutional Class shares commenced operations on December 6  2021. The performance attributed to the Institutional Class shares prior to that date is that of the Investor Class shares and has not been adjusted to reflect the lower expenses of the Institutional Class shares. During this period  Institutional Class shares would have had returns similar to  but potentially higher than  the Investor Class shares due to the fact that Institutional Class shares represent interests in the same portfolio as Investor Class shares but are subject to lower expenses. The total return information presented here for comparison purposes differs from the total return information disclosed for the Institutional Class shares in the Financial Highlights. The total return information in the Financial Highlights represents the performance for the portion of the fiscal period in which the Institutional Class was operational. The Fund underperformed the MSCI All Country World Index (“MSCI ACWI Index”)  the Fund’s benchmark index  which had a total return of (US$) +0.96% over the same time period. Please see the Fund’s Overview for more detailed information about the Fund’s longer-term performance for various time periods ended March 31  2022.The performance data quoted here represent past performance  and past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares  when redeemed  may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information quoted. To obtain performance information current to the most recent month-end  please call 888-860-8686 or visit marsicofunds.com .(1)This review highlights Fund performance over a six-month fiscal period. Shareholders should keep in mind that the Fund is intended for long-term investors who hold their shares for substantially longer periods of time. You should also keep in mind that our current views and beliefs regarding all investments discussed in this report are subject to change at any time. References to specific securities  industries  and sectors discussed in this report are not recommendations to buy or sell such securities or related investments  and the Fund may not necessarily hold these securities or investments today. Please see the accompanying Schedule of Investments for the percentage of the Fund’s portfolio represented by the securities mentioned in this report as of the end of the reporting period.Foreign investments present additional risks due to currency fluctuations  economic and political factors  lower liquidity  differences in securities regulations and accounting standards  possible changes in taxation  limited public information  and other factors. In addition  the Fund is subject to broad risks associated with investing in equity securities markets generally  including the risks that the securities and markets in which it invests may experience volatility and instability  that domestic and global economies and markets may undergo periods of cyclical change and decline  that investors may at times avoid investments in equity securities  and that investments may not perform as anticipated. Please see the Prospectus for more information.The Fund is not managed to track its benchmark index  and may hold a substantially overweight or underweight position in a sector  industry  or security compared to its weight in the benchmark. The Fund may be subject to risks associated with a particular sector or other area in which it is overweight  including the risk that the stocks of companies within one area could simultaneously decline in price because of an event that affects the entire area. For informational purposes  the discussion below may compare the benchmark weight or performance of a sector or industry to the investment approach of the Fund.The Global Fund’s underperformance during the six-month period ended March 31  2022 as compared to the MSCI ACWI Index was due  in part  to certain weaker-performing stocks in several sectors  most notably in the Information Technology  Communication Services  and Consumer Discretionary sectors  as defined in the Global Industry Classification Standard (“GICS”)(2). The Fund’s relative performance was also hindered by having an overweight allocation in the benchmark index’s weakest-performing areas  the Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary sectors  and by having no exposure to the Energy sector  the benchmark index’s strongest-performing sector.Information Technology holding Shopify  Inc. – Cl. A (“Shopify”) (-50% prior to being sold) benefitted greatly from the needs of businesses and consumers to move commerce online during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we emerge from lockdowns and other restrictions related to COVID-19  consumers are migrating spending toward services and travel and away from goods. In-person retail traffic is returning  leading to a slowing in online spending as well  which has negatively impacted Shopify’s operating performance. This  in turn  led to poor performance by the stock and ultimately led us to sell the Fund’s position in Shopify.In the Communication Services sector  Sea Ltd. ADR (“Sea”) detracted from Fund performance in the period  returning -56% prior to being sold. Sea was a top detractor from the Fund’s relative performance as the company issued guidance that equated to declining revenue from its gaming division. “Free Fire” is Sea’s key gaming franchise and we believe that investors likely fear the franchise has matured. While we see this drawdown for near term issues as being overstated and continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory for Sea and its myriad of drivers  we exited the position to pursue other attractive investment opportunities.Consumer Discretionary stock Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd. (“Domino’s”) (-39%) was a detractor to the Fund’s performance during the period due to a tougher operating environment for its Japanese business in addition to food and labor inflation seen across its markets in Australia  Europe  and Asia. Domino’s Japanese business had a substantial negative margin impact in the second half of calendar year 2021 as it added the most corporate stores it has ever added in a six-month period (53 new corporate stores). Domino’s Japan typically24GLOBAL FUNDgrows stores by opening them first on a corporate-run basis before then re-franchising them to franchisees when the stores are up and running. The nature of corporate stores is that both store-level revenue and costs are carried on the books of Domino’s and not on those of the franchisees (who would  in a franchise model  pay royalties to the parent). New store openings come with additional costs and revenues take time to ramp. Because of this  we believe the margin hit to Domino’s Japanese business should prove transitory as the stores mature and are re-franchised. In terms of food and labor inflation  Domino’s appears better positioned than most peers that have much slimmer margins to absorb them. In the meantime  select price increases are being taken by the company to pass along higher costs.On the positive side  there were a few individual contributors to Fund performance  discussed further below. Additionally  as benchmark returns were modestly positive for the period  the Fund’s low 1% cash position on average created a boost to relative Fund performance.Information Technology holding NVIDIA Corp. (“NVIDIA”) (+26%) was the top contributor to the Fund’s performance during the period  reporting a better-than-expected recent fiscal quarter and introducing a host of new products and services at its March Investor Day. Demand by NVIDIA’s customers is tracking well ahead of NVIDIA’s supply in both the key gaming and datacenter businesses  and this dynamic is expected to continue through calendar year 2022. Datacenter strength is broad-based with cloud providers  high-performance computing customers  and enterprises all contributing to growth. In addition  NVIDIA’s recent Investor Day introduced the latest graphics processing unit chip and platform for the datacenter space  named “Hopper.” This new chip is expected to be launched for gaming applications in the fall of 2022  updating a two-year-old product  and we believe it will drive a healthy refresh cycle. In addition to hardware  NVIDIA is leaning into enterprise software and has had several launches in the space targeting industries such as healthcare  manufacturing  and retail. Further  enthusiasm continues to build for NVIDIA’s Omniverse product  which is in beta testing and is aimed at taking advantage of the continued development of and focus on the metaverse.Apple  Inc. (“Apple”) (+24%)  an Information Technology sector holding  was a strong performer during the period as its services business has begun to inflect  showing the power of a diversified growth platform that has developed around its core iPhone product. “Advertising” and “Payments” divisions are newer large growth drivers for Apple  and the company is in the very early stages of monetizing these vertical business segments.During the period  the Fund increased exposure to the Financials  Industrials  Materials  Health Care  Consumer Discretionary  and Consumer Staples sectors.

During Inventiva’s ‘NATIVE’ Phase IIb clinical trial  lanifibranor  compared to placebo  has demonstrated beneficial effects on liver histology  NASH resolution and fibrosis regression in patients with non-cirrhotic NASH.Based on the NATIVE data  the authors of the abstract show that glycemic control correlates with NASH severity measured by liver biopsy. In addition  improvement of glycemic control in patients who received lanifibranor correlated with the improvement of metabolic-immune markers of NASH insulin resistance  lipid metabolism  inflammation  liver enzymes and with hepatic steatosis  measured by Continuous Attenuation Parameter (CAP).The details of the presentation are as follows:Date: June 5  2022 Timing of the poster session: 1:00-2:00 pm EST Poster identifier: 830-P Abstract title: “The Pan-PPAR agonist lanifibranor improves nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and glycemic Control” Author: Dr. Michael P. Cooreman  Chief Medical Officer of InventivaStory continuesAbout InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of NASH and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.The Company has established a strategic collaboration with AbbVie in the area of autoimmune diseases that resulted in the discovery of the drug candidate cedirogant (ABBV-157)  an oral RORγ inverse agonist which is being evaluated in a Phase IIb clinical trial  led by AbbVie  in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA - ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.com .ContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupLaurence Frost /Tristan Roquet Montegon /Aude LepreuxMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

This performance is supported by the global economic recovery following the improvement in the health situation and by the efforts undertaken for several years on the Group's value policy. The Laurent-Perrier Group is therefore maintaining its strategy by continuing to rely on the quality of its Champagne wines  the quality of its teams  the strength of its brands and the control of its distribution.""Change in turnover:During the period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022  the global champagne market grew significantly in volume  reaching +34% compared to FY N-1 and +13% compared to FY N-2.During the same period  the Group experienced strong growth in sales volume of +58.6% compared to FY N-1 and +26.6% compared to FY N-2. This performance  supported by the strong market recovery  was based on the strength of the Group's brands and the quality of its premium champagnes  which recorded market share gains. Turnover (champagne sales) for the year was thus up sharply  standing at €292.8 million at current exchange rates  with a positive price/mix effect of +4.4% vs. FY N-1 and +11.9% vs FY N-2.Story continuesChange in the result :During the period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022  the Group began the gradual resumption of its long-term investments  particularly in support of its brands and in business development. This resumption of investments was closely linked to the need to increase sales and control costs. All of this contributed to an improvement in the Group's operating margin  which reached 26.3% at current exchange rates. The Group share of net income also rose sharply. It stands at €50.2 million at current exchange rates and thus represents 16.4% of the Group's consolidated turnover.Change in operational cash flow and the financial structure :Operating cash flow for the period showed a strong increase of +€65.6 million compared to FY N-1. This performance is linked to the growth of the business and to the control of working capital requirements  particularly inventory management.The elements of the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended 31 March 2022 once again demonstrate the solidity of the Group's financial structure. Shareholders' equity  Group share  amounted to €500.7 million and net debt (*) stood at €225.1 million including available cash of €125.7 million. Gearing thus improved significantly to a historically low level of 0.45  compared with 0.63 at 31 March 2021.(*) Net debt: financial debt and other non-current debt + current financial debt - available cashOutlookIn a business context marked by the strength and intensity of the recovery in champagne shipments in 2021  the Laurent-Perrier Group notes that the annual results published for the 2021-2022 financial year have benefited from an exceptional context.Faced with the uncertainties arising from the conflict in Ukraine  inflationary pressures and the resulting monetary policies  all of which call for a great deal of caution  the Laurent-Perrier Group is continuing to execute its 2021-2025 business plan with vigilance and confidence  and is maintaining its value strategy  which is based on four pillars:A single business: The production and sale of top-of-the-range ChampagnesA high-quality supply based on a policy of partnershipsA portfolio of strong and complementary brandsWell-controlled global distribution.Laurent-Perrier is one of the rare family groups of champagne houses which is listed on the stock market  and which is exclusively dedicated to champagne  and focused on the high-end market. It has a large product portfolio renowned for its quality  based around the Laurent-Perrier  Salon  Delamotte and Champagne de Castellane brands.Code ISIN : FR 0006864484Bloomberg : LPE:FPReuters : LPER.PA Laurent-Perrier belongs to compartment B of Euronext.

CRS – a life-threatening toxic immune reaction to CAR T therapy – has been seen in a meaningful number of patients and has led to at least 15 clinical trial failures for new therapies since 2016 ” said Jacob Aptekar  MD  vice president at Medidata. “ Many known physiological markers that could indicate risk for severe CRS are difficult to measure but the study presented at ASCO is an important step in demonstrating how commonly collected laboratory tests – like a complete blood count (CBC) – can be used to assess CRS risk in a large number of patients across multiple clinical trials  indications  and CAR T products.”Titled “Predictors of severe CRS in longitudinal CAR T-cell clinical trial data ” the study used the company’s Medidata Acorn AI platform to analyze 542 patients pooled from multiple clinical trials. These are significantly more patients than previous CRS studies  which have traditionally used a limited number of patients from a single clinical trial or clinical site. The Medidata study demonstrated notable differences in commonly measured biomarkers including platelet counts  serum albumin concentration  creatinine levels  and neutrophil counts between patients who experience severe CRS versus those who do not.The Medidata study includes a conclusion that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for CRS may be warranted for CAR T therapy  both during clinical trials and in real-world use  using periodic monitoring of common lab markers to assess the risk level and enable early intervention when warranted.“ The trend across oncology is towards precision treatment and research. This Medidata study is a critical piece of that puzzle for CAR T therapy  empowering both researchers and health care providers to better understand the safety and efficacy of treatments in specific patients ” said Michael Kattan  PhD  the Dr. Keyhan and Dr. Jafar Mobasseri Endowed Chair for Innovations in Cancer Research and chairman  Department of Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic. “ By understanding where the warning signs for CRS are  we can design safer trials  avoid and better understand trial failures  and get better and safer innovative treatments to more patients in more care settings.”Medidata Acorn AI leverages the company’s rich  regulatory grade clinical data  machine learning and AI capabilities  and pharmaceutical product development expertise to drive value for the life sciences community.

5973,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/africa-s-digital-infrastructure-5122706/,Africa's digital infrastructure transformation | White & Case LLP - JDSupra - JD Supra,Affordable  universal digital access is key to Africa's growth and development-               Now  more than ever  Africa is looking to digital...,"Affordable  universal digital access is key to Africa's growth and developmentNow  more than ever  Africa is looking to digital solutions to increase productivity and drive development.According to a report by the IFC and Google  Africa’s internet economy is one of the largest overlooked investment opportunities available  with a potential to add US$180 billion to Africa’s GDP by 2025.Although increased internet access and related infrastructure could have a profound impact across the continent  Africa remains far behind much of the rest of the world in terms of fiber network and broadband connectivity  spectrum and data center processing capabilities. Yet digital infrastructure is growing at a rapid rate in sub-Saharan Africa  spurred by strong investment incentives.The potential for digital growth opportunities in Africa is vast  but it will depend critically on ensuring that digital access is affordable and widespread. This  in turn  will require significant capital from equity investors and financiers.Digital infrastructure drivers and challengesThe COVID-19 pandemic sharply accelerated African digital innovation and demand for more digital infrastructure across the continent.1Many of the industry-relevant regulatory policy changes made by sub-Saharan governments during the pandemic emphasized digital accessibility.2 The African Union (AU) launched an online COVID-19 pass tool to simplify verification of public health documentation for travelers.3 Togo's Novisi  a digital cash transfer program launched in 2020 to support informal workers during the pandemic  signed up more than one million users during its first week.4 MTN Nigeria showed a 60 percent growth in data revenue at the height of the pandemic  far surpassing the growth in developed markets during that time.5The AU's Digital Transformation Strategy 2020 – 2030 aspires to universal digital access and a single pan-African digital market by 2030.6 Achieving this would create a profound impact. For instance  the World Bank estimates that in Africa a 10 percent increase in mobile internet penetration could translate to a 2.5 percent increase in gross domestic product (GDP).7Yet the digital divide across Africa remains stark. Fewer than one-third of Africans have access to broadband connectivity. Of the 25 least-connected countries in the world  21 are located in Africa.8 Three hundred million Africans live more than 50 kilometers from a fiber or cable broadband connection. At just 36 percent  Africa's internet penetration compares poorly with the 62.5 percent global average.9600+ million mobile connections by Africans  with 65 percent via smart phones  are expected by 2025. Source: infrastructureinvestor.comStill  approximately 473 million Africans are online  and an additional 300 million will likely join them by 2025.10 Achieving and surpassing this level of penetration is crucial to Africa's future growth.One of the main obstacles to bridging this divide remains inadequate investment.11 According to the World Bank  achieving universal  good-quality internet access across Africa will require investments of US$100 billion  80 percent of which is needed for core infrastructure to establish and maintain broadband networks.12 This includes 250 000 new 4G base stations  at least 250 000 kilometers of fiber and migration to 5G  which  in turn  could dramatically increase the need for data centers.13View full image: Figure 1: Internet access (PDF)Investment trends in African digital infrastructureSub-Saharan Africa's internet access is growing at one of the fastest paces in the world due to strong investment incentives.14 Africa's youthful population and rapid urbanization are both strong drivers of demand for digitalization.15Some of the most significant investment trends have been the following:Mobile networksUS$3 billion growth in Africa’s data center market  expected by 2025. Source: africabusiness communities.comNetwork coverage is rapidly expanding  mainly driven by upgrading 2G networks to 3G or 4G and network sharing.16 In 2020  4G accounted for just 12 percent of the continent's mobile phone connections and is expected to grow to 28 percent by 2025—though it remains below the current global average of 57 percent. However  only seven commercial 5G networks had been established in five African markets as of 2021.17Average download speeds in Africa doubled between 2015 and 2019  while data costs halved.18 Africa's mobile penetration may reach 50 percent (more than 600 million connections  65 percent via smart phones) by 2025.19 Average African mobile traffic could more than quadruple to just over 7 gigabytes per month per subscriber  and 5G connections could approach 30 million African users by 2025.20Mobile devices will likely remain the primary method of internet access for people in Africa. Better 4G and 5G networks serving these devices would provide greater bandwidth  lower latency  improve spectrum efficiency and bring innovative ""Internet of Things"" products and services to Africa.21Fiber-optic cablesThe global fiber-optic submarine telecommunication cable systems market  valued at US$23.4 billion in 2020  is forecast to grow by 7.1 percent per year and reach US$37.8 billion by 2027.22 Only three African countries—the Central African Republic  Eritrea and South Sudan—lack a fiber-optic connection to the submarine cables circling the continent.23By some estimates  African countries have rolled out more than 1.389 million kilometers of terrestrial fiber links  approximately 936 000 kilometers of which were already operational in 2018.24 The 2Africa cable system—the largest subsea project  which will ring the entire African continent with a 23 000-mile-long  high-speed subsea cable—is expected to include 21 landings in 16 African nations and double the continent's total internet capacity  once completed in 2024.25 The Equiano subsea cable project will extend along the continent's Atlantic coastline with landing points in Nigeria  Namibia and South Africa. The first phase of the project connecting South Africa and Portugal is expected to finish in 2022.26Yet fiber-optic networks have yet to fully penetrate Africa—particularly in the land-locked interior countries.27 Widespread availability of high-speed (broadband) internet through fiber-to-premises connections to homes and offices remains sparse and is largely concentrated in a few capital cities.28 For example  fiber-based broadband service household penetration remains below 2 percent in sub-Saharan Africa  while South Africa's fiber-based broadband subscriptions represent almost half of all fiber-based broadband subscriptions in sub-Saharan Africa.29Data centersUS$180 billion potential growth in Africa’s GDP by 2025. Source: FC and Google’s e-Conomy Africa 2020 reportLatency issues and concerns over data sovereignty are driving data center localization in Africa.30Although most African countries are currently relatively unrestricted regarding personal data  this might change in the future  in ways that would make it necessary to store regulated data in local data centers.31 Currently  Africa accounts for only 1 percent of global data center capacity.32 According to the African Data Centres Association  roughly two-thirds of that capacity is located in South Africa.33 To bring the rest of the continent up to a similar density to South Africa would require roughly 700 new data centers of 1 000 MW capacity.34Indeed  Africa's data center market is expected to grow to US$3 billion by 2025.35 In 2020 and 2021 alone  four major pan-continental deals and investment commitments totaling US$2 billion were concluded. These included Equinix's purchase of Main One (US$320 million)  West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC)'s investment in Open Access Data Centres (US$500 million)  Digital Realty's investment commitment to Africa (US$500 million) and Liquid Intelligent Technologies' (Liquid) US$500 million investment into its subsidiary  Africa Data Centres (ADC). ADC received a US$300 million investment from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to acquire and expand data centers and enter new markets.36 ADC has opened a new facility in Johannesburg and is constructing others in Nigeria  Togo and Kenya 37 and it plans to build ten data centers in ten African countries over two years.38 To date  Liquid has also received US$259 million worth of investment from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to expand its data center capacity and roll out fiber-optic cables in Africa.39 Local African businesses—including Vodacom/Safaricom  MTN  Rack Centre Nigeria  ADC and Teraco—have been at the forefront of this growing industry and together own more than 95 percent of Africa's data center capacity. International investors in hyperscalers have also begun to enter the market in recent years.40Financing challengesTo date  most African digital infrastructure projects have been funded through equity investments  rather than debt financings  and this is likely to continue.For instance  a consortium of partners that include Facebook  MTN  Vodafone and Orange is funding the 2Africa cable  and Google and its co-investors are privately funding the Equiano project.41 Limited recourse or non-recourse funding has yet to be seen at scale. The IFC invested US$250 million in Liquid through equity and debt  and IFC's latest investment in February 2021 was by participating in Liquid's bond placement on Euronext Dublin.42 The IFC's US$300 million investment in ADC was structured as a full-recourse corporate loan.43Yet as digital infrastructure assets demand larger capital expenditures  the need for more structured financing solutions will likely grow. The high costs of constructing and operating mega-data centers might also encourage shifts toward alternative funding sources that deploy capital more efficiently.Energy is another important consideration. Expansion of co-location data centers and competitive pricing of services increasingly depends on energy costs and efficiency  since energy can account for 40 percent or more of a data center's operating expenses. Without cheap and reliable power  operating data centers in Africa will be challenging.44 In South Africa  data center operators are highly exposed to the power shortages and regular load-shedding that plague the country  heightening reliance on expensive diesel or battery-power solutions.45ConclusionAccording to the IFC and Google's e-Conomy Africa 2020 report  Africa's internet economy is one of the largest overlooked investment opportunities available  with a potential to add US$180 billion to Africa's GDP by 2025.46Africa has the world's youngest  fastest-growing and increasingly urbanized workforce  which is driving a rapid increase in its consumption of online services. Increased connectivity  in turn  creates more opportunities for innovative entrepreneurs with new technologies. However  digital transformation can only be fully realized if high-quality access to communication networks and services is made available at affordable prices.Accelerating the type and pace of investments into digital infrastructure in Africa will be critical to ensure the growth of Africa's economies and livelihoods for years to come.1 e-Conomy-Africa 2020  Africa’s 180 billion internet economy  IFC and Google Report  available at: https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/publications_ext_content/ifc_external_publication_site/publications_listing_page/google-e-conomy2 https://www.brookings.edu/essay/technological-innovations-creating-and-harnessing-tools-for-improved-livelihoods/3 Covid-19 is changing the way African countries are collaborating with each other  available at: https://qz.com/africa/2036396/covid-19-is-changing-the-way-africa-thinks-of-digital-innovation/4 Covid-19 is changing the way African countries are collaborating with each other  available at: https://qz.com/africa/2036396/covid-19-is-changing-the-way-africa-thinks-of-digital-innovation/5 Africa's digital infrastructure revolution | Infrastructure Investor6 https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/africasource/africas-digital-infrastructure-is-the-next-playing-field-for-great-power-competition/7 https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/digitaldevelopment/overview#1;

The company said that the consequences of the diseas “are difficult to estimate now ” but will likely result in a reduced overall harvest volume in 2022 and 2023.The company said that the Hamraborg site consists of roughly 890 000 fish with an average weight of 2.137 kilograms each  while the Svarthamar site consists of roughly 1.1 million fish with an average weight of 0.798 kilograms each.The company did not offer an estimate on what the financial impacts of the ISA discovery will be  and said that it “continues to analyze and will return with more information once it is available.”The company reported its operational earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) dropped in Q1 2022 by NOK 12.9 million (USD 1.3 million  EUR 1.2 million)  compared to earnings of NOK 6.6 million (USD 700 503  EUR 651 935) in the same period in 2021. The drop in earnings was despite an increase in harvested volume  with the company announcing it harvested 2 712 metric tons (MT) of salmon in Q1 2022 compared to 1 496 MT in 2021.The lower earnings  the company said  were attributable to a lower EBIT-per-kilogram  which dropped to a loss of NOK 4.80 (USD 0.50  EUR 0.47) per kilogram in Q1 2022 compared to earnings of NOK 4.4 (USD 0.46 EUR 0.43) per kilogram in 2021. The higher volume and lower earnings  the company said  is due to an early harvest of wounded fish after a fish transfer in autumn 2021.Photo courtesy of Ice Fish Farms,neutral,0.03,0.88,0.09,negative,0.01,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['Ice Fish Farm', 'two sites', 'presence', 'ISA', 'Iceland-based salmon farming company', 'Euronext Growth market', 'infectious salmon anemia', 'Ice Fish Farm', 'overall harvest volume', 'farming operations', 'early harvest', '1.1 million fish', 'fish transfer', 'two sites', 'average weight', 'financial impacts', 'same period', '2,712 metric tons', 'higher volume', 'Photo courtesy', 'similar announcement', 'Hamraborg site', 'Svarthamar site', 'operational earnings', 'lower earnings', 'lower EBIT', 'ISA discovery', '890,000 fish', 'presence', 'infection', '27 May', 'consequences', 'diseas', 'reduced', '2.137 kilograms', '0.798 kilograms', 'estimate', 'information', 'interest', 'taxes', 'Q1', 'NOK', 'drop', 'increase', 'MT', 'loss', 'wounded', 'autumn']",2022-06-03,2022-06-03,seafoodsource.com

Innate will receive a $5M milestone payment from AstraZeneca and will be responsible for conducting the study. AstraZeneca and Innate will share study costs and AstraZeneca will supply clinical trial drugs.“We are very pleased that our collaboration with AstraZeneca continues to advance with this Phase 2 trial of our anti-CD39  IPH5201. We are particularly excited about the progress of our assets targeting the adenosine pathway  which is increasingly recognized as critical in tumor immunosuppression. In addition to IPH5201  Innate’s anti-CD73 program  IPH5301 is in a Phase 1 study ” said Mondher Mahjoubi  Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma. “The decision to advance IPH5201 illustrates our growing late stage pipeline and progress in building a sustainable business  as well as the positive collaboration we have with AstraZeneca  which also includes two Phase 3 trials with monalizumab in non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer.”AstraZeneca conducted a Phase 1 trial in solid tumors with IPH5201 alone or in combination with durvalumab (PD-L1). The data are expected to be presented at an upcoming medical meeting in due course.About IPH5201:IPH5201 is a blocking antibody targeting the CD39 immunosuppressive pathway. CD39 is an extracellular enzyme that is expressed in the tumor microenvironment  on both tumor infiltrating cells and stromal cells in several cancer types. CD39 inhibits the immune system by degrading adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine monophosphate (AMP)  that is then further degraded into adenosine by CD73. By promoting the accumulation of immune-stimulating ATP and preventing the production of immune-suppressive adenosine  the blockade of CD39 may stimulate anti-tumor activity.About the Innate Pharma-AstraZeneca Multi-Term Agreement:In October 2018  Innate Pharma and AstraZeneca entered into a development collaboration that included an option agreement for IPH5201  an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody. As part of the option agreement AstraZeneca paid Innate a $50m upfront payment for the option to the exclusive license to co-develop and co-commercialize IPH5201 and up to $825m in opt-in payments  development and commercial milestones and high-single to double-digit tiered royalties. Innate retains the right to receive profit sharing within the EU.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of natural killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

Innate will receive a $5M milestone payment from AstraZeneca and will be responsible for conducting the study. AstraZeneca and Innate will share study costs and AstraZeneca will supply clinical trial drugs.""We are very pleased that our collaboration with AstraZeneca continues to advance with this Phase 2 trial of our anti-CD39  IPH5201. We are particularly excited about the progress of our assets targeting the adenosine pathway  which is increasingly recognized as critical in tumor immunosuppression. In addition to IPH5201  Innate's anti-CD73 program  IPH5301 is in a Phase 1 study "" said Mondher Mahjoubi  Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma. ""The decision to advance IPH5201 illustrates our growing late stage pipeline and progress in building a sustainable business  as well as the positive collaboration we have with AstraZeneca  which also includes two Phase 3 trials with monalizumab in non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer.""AstraZeneca conducted a Phase 1 trial in solid tumors with IPH5201 alone or in combination with durvalumab (PD-L1). The data are expected to be presented at an upcoming medical meeting in due course.About IPH5201:IPH5201 is a blocking antibody targeting the CD39 immunosuppressive pathway. CD39 is an extracellular enzyme that is expressed in the tumor microenvironment  on both tumor infiltrating cells and stromal cells in several cancer types. CD39 inhibits the immune system by degrading adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine monophosphate (AMP)  that is then further degraded into adenosine by CD73. By promoting the accumulation of immune-stimulating ATP and preventing the production of immune-suppressive adenosine  the blockade of CD39 may stimulate anti-tumor activity.About the Innate Pharma-AstraZeneca Multi-Term Agreement:In October 2018  Innate Pharma and AstraZeneca entered into a development collaboration that included an option agreement for IPH5201  an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody. As part of the option agreement AstraZeneca paid Innate a $50m upfront payment for the option to the exclusive license to co-develop and co-commercialize IPH5201 and up to $825m in opt-in payments  development and commercial milestones and high-single to double-digit tiered royalties. Innate retains the right to receive profit sharing within the EU.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma's broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of natural killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor antigens  as well as antibody engineering.
