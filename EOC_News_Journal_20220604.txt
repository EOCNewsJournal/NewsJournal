Opening of the meeting2. Calling the meeting to order3. Election of the persons to scrutinise the minutes and to supervise the counting of votes4. Recording the legality of the meeting5. Recording the attendance at the meeting and adoption of the list of votes6. Resolution on the merger of Evli and EAB Group PlcIntroductionOn April 22  2022  Evli announced that it has signed a letter of intent on the combination of Evli and EAB Group Plc (the Combination). The objective of the Combination is to create a company that would be one of the leading companies on the Helsinki Stock Exchange to offer investing and wealth management services with a broad expertise and whose clientele would cover institutions  corporations  and private persons. The combined company has a strong financial position and good capabilities for future growth according to the Company’s strategy. The combined company would have the ability to conduct the businesses of current Evli and EAB with better operative efficiency enabling to achieve synergies. After the combination  a broader range of products and services and a wider range of expertise will be available to clients.The Combination will be carried out by way of a statutory absorption merger pursuant to Chapter 16 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act (624/2006 as amended) (the Finnish Companies Act) whereby EAB Group Plc merges into Evli so that all assets and liabilities of EAB Group Plc are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure (the Merger). EAB Group Plc shall automatically dissolve as a result of the completion of the Merger. In the Merger  the shareholders of EAB Group Plc will receive as merger consideration new class B shares in Evli and a cash consideration.Story continuesSimultaneously  the parties intend to execute an arrangement pursuant to which EAB Asset Management Ltd  a fully owned subsidiary of EAB Group Plc  will merge into Evli by way of a statutory absorption merger pursuant to Chapter 16 of the Finnish Companies Act whereby all assets and liabilities of EAB Asset Management Ltd are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure (the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger). EAB Asset Management Ltd shall automatically dissolve as a result of the completion of the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger.More detailed information on the Combination Agreement and the mergers and their reasons are available in the stock exchange release published by Evli on May 31  2022.The contemplated Effective Date of the Merger between Evli and EAB Group Plc is October 1  2022. The merger of Evli and EAB Asset Management Ltd will be completed after the completion of the merger of Evli and EAB Group Plc on or about October 3  2022. The Effective Dates of the Merger can still change in accordance with the merger plans.Holders of Evli’s series A shares representing approximately 85 percent of series A shares in Evli and approximately 82 percent of the votes produced by all Evli shares have undertaken to vote in favour of the Merger at the General Meeting.The General Meeting can only approve or reject the proposed resolutions because the merger plans cannot be altered.Resolution on the merger of Evli and EAB Group PlcThe Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting resolve on the Merger of EAB Group Plc into Evli as set forth in the merger plan approved and signed by the Boards of Directors of Evli and EAB Group Plc on May 31  2022 (the Merger Plan) whereby all assets and liabilities of EAB Group Plc are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure on the Effective Date and that the General Meeting approve the Merger Plan.In addition to the other matters described in the Merger Plan  the resolution on the merger includes  among other things  the following key matters described in more detail below in points (a) and (b):(a) Merger considerationPursuant to the Merger Plan  the shareholders of EAB Group Plc will receive as merger consideration 0.172725 new class B shares in Evli for each share they own in EAB Group Plc and a cash consideration for a total amount of EUR three (3) million  which shall be equally distributed between the outstanding shares of EAB Group Plc. Based on the current amount of outstanding shares the cash consideration would amount to EUR 0.217196 per share (jointly the Merger Consideration). Pursuant to Chapter 16  section 16  subsection 3 of the Finnish Companies Act  shares in EAB Group Plc held by EAB Group Plc or Evli do not carry the right to the Merger Consideration.In case the number of shares received by a shareholder of EAB Group Plc as Merger Consideration is a fractional number (per each book-entry account)  the fractions shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Fractional entitlements to the shares will be aggregated and sold in trading on Nasdaq Helsinki  and the proceeds will be distributed to the shareholders of EAB Group Plc entitled to receive such fractional entitlements in proportion to holding of such fractional entitlements. Any costs related to the sale and distribution of fractional entitlements shall be borne by Evli.As at the date of the notice convening the General Meeting  the aggregate number of shares in EAB Group Plc is 13 843 272 shares. EAB Group Plc holds 30 877 of its own shares. Evli does not hold any shares in EAB Group Plc. Based on the situation on the date of the notice convening the General Meeting  the total number of shares in Evli to be issued as Merger Consideration would therefore be 2 385 745 B shares at maximum. As a result  after the Merger  the shareholders of Evli would own approximately 91 percent of the shares and 99 percent of the votes in Evli  and the shareholders of EAB Group Plc would own approximately 9 percent of the shares and one percent of the votes in Evli.The new shares issued as Merger Consideration will be applied to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Helsinki.(b) Increase of share capitalPursuant to the Merger Plan  the share capital of Evli shall be increased by EUR 30 000 000 in connection with the registration of the completion of the Merger. After the increase  the share capital of Evli is EUR 53 745 459.66.7. Resolution on the Evli/EAB Asset Management MergerIn accordance with the introduction of item 6 above  the Board of Directors of Evli proposes that the General Meeting resolve on the merger of EAB Asset Management Ltd into Evli as set forth in the merger plan approved and signed by the Boards of Directors of Evli and EAB Asset Management Ltd on May 31  2022 (the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger Plan) whereby all assets and liabilities of EAB Asset Management Ltd are transferred to Evli without a liquidation procedure on the Effective Date in the manner set forth in the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger Plan and that the General Meeting approve the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger Plan. As the Evli/EAB Asset Management Merger is completed after the merger of Evli and EAB Group Plc has been completed  EAB Asset Management Ltd shall be a fully owned subsidiary of Evli at the time of completion and no merger consideration shall be issued.8.

This performance is supported by the global economic recovery following the improvement in the health situation and by the efforts undertaken for several years on the Group's value policy. The Laurent-Perrier Group is therefore maintaining its strategy by continuing to rely on the quality of its Champagne wines  the quality of its teams  the strength of its brands and the control of its distribution.""Change in turnover:During the period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022  the global champagne market grew significantly in volume  reaching +34% compared to FY N-1 and +13% compared to FY N-2.During the same period  the Group experienced strong growth in sales volume of +58.6% compared to FY N-1 and +26.6% compared to FY N-2. This performance  supported by the strong market recovery  was based on the strength of the Group's brands and the quality of its premium champagnes  which recorded market share gains. Turnover (champagne sales) for the year was thus up sharply  standing at €292.8 million at current exchange rates  with a positive price/mix effect of +4.4% vs. FY N-1 and +11.9% vs FY N-2.Story continuesChange in the result :During the period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022  the Group began the gradual resumption of its long-term investments  particularly in support of its brands and in business development. This resumption of investments was closely linked to the need to increase sales and control costs. All of this contributed to an improvement in the Group's operating margin  which reached 26.3% at current exchange rates. The Group share of net income also rose sharply. It stands at €50.2 million at current exchange rates and thus represents 16.4% of the Group's consolidated turnover.Change in operational cash flow and the financial structure :Operating cash flow for the period showed a strong increase of +€65.6 million compared to FY N-1. This performance is linked to the growth of the business and to the control of working capital requirements  particularly inventory management.The elements of the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended 31 March 2022 once again demonstrate the solidity of the Group's financial structure. Shareholders' equity  Group share  amounted to €500.7 million and net debt (*) stood at €225.1 million including available cash of €125.7 million. Gearing thus improved significantly to a historically low level of 0.45  compared with 0.63 at 31 March 2021.(*) Net debt: financial debt and other non-current debt + current financial debt - available cashOutlookIn a business context marked by the strength and intensity of the recovery in champagne shipments in 2021  the Laurent-Perrier Group notes that the annual results published for the 2021-2022 financial year have benefited from an exceptional context.Faced with the uncertainties arising from the conflict in Ukraine  inflationary pressures and the resulting monetary policies  all of which call for a great deal of caution  the Laurent-Perrier Group is continuing to execute its 2021-2025 business plan with vigilance and confidence  and is maintaining its value strategy  which is based on four pillars:A single business: The production and sale of top-of-the-range ChampagnesA high-quality supply based on a policy of partnershipsA portfolio of strong and complementary brandsWell-controlled global distribution.Laurent-Perrier is one of the rare family groups of champagne houses which is listed on the stock market  and which is exclusively dedicated to champagne  and focused on the high-end market. It has a large product portfolio renowned for its quality  based around the Laurent-Perrier  Salon  Delamotte and Champagne de Castellane brands.Code ISIN : FR 0006864484Bloomberg : LPE:FPReuters : LPER.PA Laurent-Perrier belongs to compartment B of Euronext.

CRS – a life-threatening toxic immune reaction to CAR T therapy – has been seen in a meaningful number of patients and has led to at least 15 clinical trial failures for new therapies since 2016 ” said Jacob Aptekar  MD  vice president at Medidata. “ Many known physiological markers that could indicate risk for severe CRS are difficult to measure but the study presented at ASCO is an important step in demonstrating how commonly collected laboratory tests – like a complete blood count (CBC) – can be used to assess CRS risk in a large number of patients across multiple clinical trials  indications  and CAR T products.”Titled “Predictors of severe CRS in longitudinal CAR T-cell clinical trial data ” the study used the company’s Medidata Acorn AI platform to analyze 542 patients pooled from multiple clinical trials. These are significantly more patients than previous CRS studies  which have traditionally used a limited number of patients from a single clinical trial or clinical site. The Medidata study demonstrated notable differences in commonly measured biomarkers including platelet counts  serum albumin concentration  creatinine levels  and neutrophil counts between patients who experience severe CRS versus those who do not.The Medidata study includes a conclusion that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for CRS may be warranted for CAR T therapy  both during clinical trials and in real-world use  using periodic monitoring of common lab markers to assess the risk level and enable early intervention when warranted.“ The trend across oncology is towards precision treatment and research. This Medidata study is a critical piece of that puzzle for CAR T therapy  empowering both researchers and health care providers to better understand the safety and efficacy of treatments in specific patients ” said Michael Kattan  PhD  the Dr. Keyhan and Dr. Jafar Mobasseri Endowed Chair for Innovations in Cancer Research and chairman  Department of Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic. “ By understanding where the warning signs for CRS are  we can design safer trials  avoid and better understand trial failures  and get better and safer innovative treatments to more patients in more care settings.”Medidata Acorn AI leverages the company’s rich  regulatory grade clinical data  machine learning and AI capabilities  and pharmaceutical product development expertise to drive value for the life sciences community.

The company said that the consequences of the diseas “are difficult to estimate now ” but will likely result in a reduced overall harvest volume in 2022 and 2023.The company said that the Hamraborg site consists of roughly 890 000 fish with an average weight of 2.137 kilograms each  while the Svarthamar site consists of roughly 1.1 million fish with an average weight of 0.798 kilograms each.The company did not offer an estimate on what the financial impacts of the ISA discovery will be  and said that it “continues to analyze and will return with more information once it is available.”The company reported its operational earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) dropped in Q1 2022 by NOK 12.9 million (USD 1.3 million  EUR 1.2 million)  compared to earnings of NOK 6.6 million (USD 700 503  EUR 651 935) in the same period in 2021. The drop in earnings was despite an increase in harvested volume  with the company announcing it harvested 2 712 metric tons (MT) of salmon in Q1 2022 compared to 1 496 MT in 2021.The lower earnings  the company said  were attributable to a lower EBIT-per-kilogram  which dropped to a loss of NOK 4.80 (USD 0.50  EUR 0.47) per kilogram in Q1 2022 compared to earnings of NOK 4.4 (USD 0.46 EUR 0.43) per kilogram in 2021. The higher volume and lower earnings  the company said  is due to an early harvest of wounded fish after a fish transfer in autumn 2021.Photo courtesy of Ice Fish Farms,neutral,0.03,0.88,0.09,negative,0.01,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['Ice Fish Farm', 'two sites', 'presence', 'ISA', 'Iceland-based salmon farming company', 'Euronext Growth market', 'infectious salmon anemia', 'Ice Fish Farm', 'overall harvest volume', 'farming operations', 'early harvest', '1.1 million fish', 'fish transfer', 'two sites', 'average weight', 'financial impacts', 'same period', '2,712 metric tons', 'higher volume', 'Photo courtesy', 'similar announcement', 'Hamraborg site', 'Svarthamar site', 'operational earnings', 'lower earnings', 'lower EBIT', 'ISA discovery', '890,000 fish', 'presence', 'infection', '27 May', 'consequences', 'diseas', 'reduced', '2.137 kilograms', '0.798 kilograms', 'estimate', 'information', 'interest', 'taxes', 'Q1', 'NOK', 'drop', 'increase', 'MT', 'loss', 'wounded', 'autumn']",2022-06-04,2022-06-04,seafoodsource.com

Innate will receive a $5M milestone payment from AstraZeneca and will be responsible for conducting the study. AstraZeneca and Innate will share study costs and AstraZeneca will supply clinical trial drugs.“We are very pleased that our collaboration with AstraZeneca continues to advance with this Phase 2 trial of our anti-CD39  IPH5201. We are particularly excited about the progress of our assets targeting the adenosine pathway  which is increasingly recognized as critical in tumor immunosuppression. In addition to IPH5201  Innate’s anti-CD73 program  IPH5301 is in a Phase 1 study ” said Mondher Mahjoubi  Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma. “The decision to advance IPH5201 illustrates our growing late stage pipeline and progress in building a sustainable business  as well as the positive collaboration we have with AstraZeneca  which also includes two Phase 3 trials with monalizumab in non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer.”AstraZeneca conducted a Phase 1 trial in solid tumors with IPH5201 alone or in combination with durvalumab (PD-L1). The data are expected to be presented at an upcoming medical meeting in due course.About IPH5201:IPH5201 is a blocking antibody targeting the CD39 immunosuppressive pathway. CD39 is an extracellular enzyme that is expressed in the tumor microenvironment  on both tumor infiltrating cells and stromal cells in several cancer types. CD39 inhibits the immune system by degrading adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine monophosphate (AMP)  that is then further degraded into adenosine by CD73. By promoting the accumulation of immune-stimulating ATP and preventing the production of immune-suppressive adenosine  the blockade of CD39 may stimulate anti-tumor activity.About the Innate Pharma-AstraZeneca Multi-Term Agreement:In October 2018  Innate Pharma and AstraZeneca entered into a development collaboration that included an option agreement for IPH5201  an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody. As part of the option agreement AstraZeneca paid Innate a $50m upfront payment for the option to the exclusive license to co-develop and co-commercialize IPH5201 and up to $825m in opt-in payments  development and commercial milestones and high-single to double-digit tiered royalties. Innate retains the right to receive profit sharing within the EU.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of natural killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

5989,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.caribbeannationalweekly.com/uncategorized/antigua-government-confirms-multi-million-dollar-bond-canceled-opposition-not-amused/,Antigua Government confirms multi-million-dollar bond canceled; opposition not amused,14 hours ago,Antigua and Barbuda’s main opposition United Progressive Party (UPP) has accused the Gaston Browne administration of providing “great expectations” after it was forced to cancel a US$200 million bond it issued on the international market earlier this year.The government in February had said the bond had been fully subscribed and provides “an incredible opportunity for the government to re-profile its debt”.Prime Minister Gaston Browne  delivering the EC$1.64 billion (One EC dollar=US$0.37 cents) budget to Parliament in February  said the bond with a ten-year  4.5 percent instrument registered on Euroclear  “is the first and largest bond of its kind issued by Antigua and Barbuda  and it has been fully subscribed.- Advertisement -“This financing provides an incredible opportunity for the government to re-profile its debt  to ensure sustainability going forward  and to invest in strategic projects that will drive economic growth  create employment  and generate increased revenue to finance government operations.”But Browne  speaking this week acknowledged that the bond had been canceled as he answered opposition questions on the matter.“We had an entity that subscribed to the bond and so far  they have not paid the funds and we have given instructions to cancel the offer ” Browne told legislators as the Opposition Leader  Jamale L. Pringle  urged him to confirm the bond offer of US$200 million had indeed been canceled.“Mr. Speaker it is likely that we may do so and re-issue it (but) instructions have been given to cancel it ” Browne told legislators.Browne said in February that the bond would also have been used for the acquisition and renovation of the Jolly Beach Hotel and “ensure payment of severance due to the Jolly Beach workers upon successful acquisition of the property”. He said the funds will also be used to construct a hotel at Morris Bay.But the UPP said as a result of the cancellation  the government gave Antigua and Barbudans unrealistic expectations  noting that even after the announcement of the cancellation  a senior government minister was still informing the nation that the bonds would be available.“They gave the public false hope. To the pensioners  they expected this money would have helped …all of the workers who were owed  backpay  etc.  thought that this would help the government settle the arrears and everybody waiting on some little assistance ” said UPP spokesman Damani Tabor.He told a radio program the hopes of the workers had been dashed “and now we hear that a single person or company that had expressed interest changed their mind and so the bond issue has failed”.He questioned how the bond could have failed when the government made it clear at the start that it had been oversubscribed.“But how could it have been just a single person  the term the government used is oversubscribed and for bonds to be oversubscribed it means you have multiple people coming to you and saying …the offer is so sweet take my money  not one person”.The UPP claimed that the government’s poor record on financial accountability is behind the reason for the cancellation of the bond.“If we did not put this to Gaston Browne during the questions to ministers  the public would not have known and it is shameful ” Tabor said.CMC/,negative,0.02,0.07,0.91,mixed,0.25,0.07,0.69,True,English,"['Antigua Government', 'multi-million-dollar bond', 'opposition', 'main opposition United Progressive Party', 'UPP spokesman Damani Tabor', 'Prime Minister Gaston Browne', 'ten-year, 4.5 percent instrument', 'Jamale L.

5994,Clearstream,Google API,https://weirdnewsera.com/is-metv-on-pluto-tv/,Is Metv On Pluto TV - Weird News Era,1 hour ago,Pluto TV is a popular free streaming service that provides users with access to hundreds of virtual channels with an experience that is similar to that of cable TV. You won’t have to pay a dime to watch movies  television shows  or even live programming when you stream them online. However  given that there are over 250 different channels available on Pluto TV  the question becomes: which ones should you begin with?Thats a fantastic question. The reality is that there is such a wide variety of channels and categories available to watch on Pluto TV that it will ultimately come down to your personal preferences to determine which ones you will continue to watch. Nevertheless  we believe that we can point you in the correct path by providing you with our recommendations for the top Pluto TV channels.How Can I Watch Metv Without CableYou can pause  rewind  and watch all of your favorite network shows using the free ClearStream TV companion app and any HDTV antenna with no subscription or monthly fees from *ABC  CBS  NBC  Fox  PBS  myTV  ION  MeTV  The CW  and Univision  along with expanded programming  using the FREE ClearStream TV companion app and an HDTV antenna. In addition  you can watch expanded programming using the FREE ClearStream TV companion app and an HDTV antenna.Pluto TV Is Adding Support For Live Local ChannelsOn several popular streaming media players  including Rokus and Fire TVs  Pluto TV is one of the most popular free streaming applications available. Many people who have dropped their cable or satellite television subscriptions appreciate this app since it integrates a diverse selection of material into a single user experience.Now Pluto TV is doing tests to see if it is possible to include the local channels that you receive from your antenna directly into the Pluto TV interface. If you have a Roku TV and an antenna attached to it  you will be able to access your local channels directly within the Pluto TV user interface. This is only possible if you own a Roku TV.Because we were unable to locate a significant amount of information regarding this newly added feature  we contacted Ilya Pozin  an employee at Pluto TV. This is what we have picked up.During this period of beta testing  Pluto TV will only display a maximum of 15 channels within the Pluto TV guide. It was said that this was just for the preliminary test  and that Pluto will continue to enhance support as it receives input from the community.Because Pluto obtains its data from the Roku TV  you need to ensure that your antenna is properly connected to the Roku TV. This is simply a preliminary test for the beta version. It has stated that  based on how the community responds to this test  it may explore extending support to more devices and increasing the support for live TV. At the moment  it does not support other devices such as Android TV.What Is Pluto TVThe term “over-the-top” refers to the fact that Pluto TV is a service that is delivered through the internet as opposed to being broadcast on dedicated lines or over the air. A video-on-demand service that is supported by advertisements is also included. This places it in the same category as other free streaming services such as Crackle  Tubi  and Sling Free.You can watch Pluto TV by streaming it on the website  or you can download the app to use it on any of the numerous devices that are compatible with the service.The Andy Griffith ShowOther stations on Pluto TV are devoted to continuously broadcasting classic comedies including Happy Days  Threes Company  and Family Ties. These channels are available around the clock. For our money  we believe that the sitcom station that is dedicated to broadcasting episodes of The Andy Griffith Show is the best of these several sitcom channels. In contrast to the majority of sitcoms  which take place in large cities  this one is situated in the fictional town of Mayberry  North Carolina. There  the local sheriff  Andy Taylor  does not need to carry a pistol in order to maintain order. This program still manages to be amusing  yet it still has the ability to tug at your emotions on occasion.How To Watch Metv On The RokuHowever  some MeTV-affiliated stations carry the network as a primary affiliation on their main channel  and a small number of stations air select programs from the network alongside their regular general entertainment schedules. MeTV is carried on digital subchannels of affiliated television stations in most markets. However  some MeTV-affiliated stations carry the network as a primary affiliation on their main channel. In addition  the network can be received throughout the United States via the free-to-air C band satellite through SES-1 in the DVB-S format; in certain areas  it can also be received on AT&T U-verse channels 136 and 1136. MeTV’s business operations are managed from the Weigel Broadcasting corporate headquarters  which are located in Chicago  Illinois  on North Halsted Street.Tablo is a next-generation digital video recorder (DVR) that can record free  local HDTV broadcast programs like news and sports inside the United States and Canada by plugging into a digital TV antenna. Tablo does not include an HDMI connection  in contrast to more conventional DVRs that are only linked to a single television. Tablo can connect to your home network by WiFi or Ethernet  allowing it to stream video to any connected device in your home or anywhere else in the world where you have internet access.The Over-The-Air (OTA) DVR service offered by Tablo provides live  local HDTV broadcast programs that are unavailable via Over-The-Top (OTT) online content providers such as Amazon Prime  Hulu  and Netflix. You won’t have to wait until the next day to watch your favorite network shows live  and you won’t have to pay the expensive cable fee either.

6005,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-war-global-food-security-075200603.html,Russia’s war on global food security,Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine is also a war on global food security. In February 2022  Russia blockaded all of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports ...,David Beasley  the executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)  recently warned  “When a country like Ukraine that grows enough food for 400 million people is out of the market  it creates market volatility  which we are now seeing.”Beasley made clear how grave the crisis is as Russian forces preventing Ukraine’s exports from getting to market threaten to plunge vulnerable populations into peril. “Truly  failure to open those ports in the Odesa region will be a declaration of war on global food security ” said Beasley. “And it will result in famine and destabilization and mass migration around the world.”In recent years  Ukraine’s export revenues from both goods and services have surged  thanks to booming agricultural production and rising commodity prices. They soared from $124 billion in 2020 to a record of $166 billion in 2021  while Ukraine’s gross domestic product (GDP) was $200 billion. Meanwhile  the share of agriculture in Ukraine’s export revenues from goods increased from 26 percent in 2012 to 45 percent in 2020.Read also: Russia delivered 100 000 tons of stolen Ukrainian grain to SyriaRussia has further aggravated this food crisis by bombing and burning grain storage in the south and east of Ukraine  by stealing hundreds of thousands of tons of grain  and by exporting it on its own ships  primarily to its ally Syria.Russia’s war on Ukraine’s grain exports should not be allowed to continue. The collective West needs to open Ukraine’s Black Sea ports  primarily the major ports in Odesa  to mitigate the ongoing crisis in countries suffering from food insecurity  as well as enabling Ukraine to sell the twenty-eight million tons of grain it has in storage.Ukraine is a global granaryBefore communism  Ukraine was the granary of the world; since the privatization of agricultural land in 2000  it has become so again. Its grain production has skyrocketed  and Ukraine is now focusing on modern grains—corn  wheat  soy  canola  and sunflower oil.Story continuesUkraine is a major producer of many grains. In 2021  it produced some eighty-six million tons of grain. The latest reliable statistics are for 2019 from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.In 2019  Ukraine produced 35.9 million tons of corn. It was the fifth-biggest grower of corn after the United States  China  Brazil  and Argentina  producing 3.1 percent of all corn in the world. Ukraine produced 28.4 million tons of wheat  or 3.7 percent of global production  ranking seventh in the world  after China  India  Russia  the United States  France  and Canada.Ukraine’s role as an exporter of grain is much greater because most of the other major producers are very large countries  such as China  India  the United States  Indonesia  and Brazil  which consume much of their produce themselves.Read also: List of Russian ships exporting Ukrainian grain given to Turkey  Dzhemilev saysIn 2019  42 percent of all global sunflower oil exports came from Ukraine  as did 16 percent of all corn exports  8.9 percent of all wheat exports  and 9.7 percent of all barley exports. Because of Ukraine’s swiftly expanding agriculture  the country’s role as a grain exporter has risen fast.Most attention is being devoted to wheat because it is crucial for economically developing countries’ supplies of bread  a basic staple. With its steadily improving agriculture  Ukraine’s exports have risen in turn. For the year until July 2021  the US Department of Agriculture assessed Ukrainian exports of wheat at 23.5 million tons.These wheat exports were spread to many countries in Asia  the Middle East  and North Africa. The main recipients by quantity were Indonesia  Egypt  Pakistan  Bangladesh  Morocco  Turkey  Yemen  Tunisia  Libya  Lebanon  and the Philippines. These countries are most likely to suffer from a new shortfall of wheat.Corn is the second important grain export. Ukraine has nearly perfect conditions for growing corn  similar to those of the US states of Iowa and Illinois  and corn production has grown exponentially. For the year until July 2021  the US Department of Agriculture assessed Ukrainian exports of corn at thirty-four million tons.The corn exports went in quite different directions from the wheat exports  going to somewhat wealthier countries  because corn is mainly used for animal feed. In recent years  Ukraine’s main market has been China  which bought no less than 8.4 million tons of Ukraine’s corn exports in 2020–2021. Other major purchasers were Spain  the Netherlands  Egypt  and Iran.Officially  Russia closed vast expanses of the Black and the Azov Seas for civilian maritime traffic  under the pretext of naval exercises  for the period from February 13–19. It had no legal basis for this decision. Thus  Russia closed the access to all Ukraine’s ports from the Black Sea  and the ports have remained shut ever since. Russia has also mined them. Russian naval ships have hit at least ten commercial ships since Russia launched its assault  according to the International Maritime Organization. They sank one Estonian commercial ship. About eighty commercial ships have been caught in the Black Sea or the Sea of Azov for months. The risk to commercial shipping in the area has soared  and the cost of marine insurance in the Black Sea has skyrocketed as a result.A tight global grain marketIn recent years  the global grain market has tightened fast because of production problems in many parts of the world  which are largely connected with climate change. The two big positive exceptions have been Russia and Ukraine. As a result of a tightening global grain market  global prices have risen greatly. By and large  global wheat prices have doubled since early 2021. The Euronext Paris milling price of wheat has risen from about 200 euros per ton in early 2021 to 400 euros a ton at present.Food is a highly sensitive political issue. As politicians are anxious to keep food prices low  they want to keep scarce domestically produced grains at home  and shortages often provoke export bans.More than twenty countries have already imposed export bans on food  including important grain producers such as India and Indonesia. More countries are likely to follow  further aggravating the global shortage of grains.As the global grain market grows tighter  many traditional exporters prohibit exports to keep their domestic prices low  to avoid political tensions. But  as they prohibit exports  global grain prices rise further  and the economically weak countries that struggle to afford their vital grain imports suffer the most.How can Ukraine get its grain to market?Out of Ukraine’s total grain production of some eighty-six million tons in 2021  about twenty-eight million tons are stuck in Ukrainian ports because of the Russian naval blockade. Ukraine has limited storage available—and  after some time in storage  much of the grain perishes. Moreover  new sowing and other work require financing  and the Ukrainian farmers need to be able to sell their grain in order to acquire financing for the next year’s harvest.At the Stuttgart Group of Seven (G7) conference from May 12–14  Ukraine’s Minister of Agrarian Policy Mykola Solsky laid out the situation  saying  “Due to the blockade of Ukrainian seaports  7 million tons of wheat  14 million tons of corn  3 million tons of sunflower oil  and 3 million tons of sunflower meal and other crops have not entered the world market.” Usually  Ukraine would export 6–7 million tons a month through its Black Sea ports  but they are blocked  and the Russians offer no sign of easing up.Read also: Business community urges international organizations to help lift Russia’s blockade of Black Sea portsUkrainian exports fell by 58 percent and imports by 76 percent from March 2021 to March 2022  which reflects just how devastatingly Russian warfare has hindered much of the production and transportation of goods in Ukraine.Ukraine has no alternative seaports for its large grain volumes. Rail or truck transportation can take some volumes through Poland or Romania  to the Polish port of Gdansk  the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda  or the Romanian ports on the Danube River or the Black Sea. At present  these alternative routes can only manage about one-tenth of the demand  400 000–500 000 tons per month  but they can rise to 2 million tons per month  according to Ukrainian agricultural experts interviewed by the author  and the delays are substantial and costly. The delays are caused by both infrastructure bottlenecks and seemingly excessive border controls. The rail transportation is being impeded by Ukraine having broad track gauge (the distance between the two rails on a railway track)  matching railways in Russia  Belarus  and the Baltics  which are different from railways in Poland and Romania.The alternative transportation routes are cumbersome  small  and costly. Usually  the transportation of grain to a Black Sea port costs a Ukrainian grain producer about 10 percent of the price.Once there  one of the big international grain traders buys the grain and takes it over. Currently  the added cost to transport grain to Gdansk or Klaipeda adds about 30 percent. Considering that European grain prices have doubled in a year  that is not prohibitive  but the capacity remains tiny—whatever Ukrainian exports make it to these ports are unlikely to make the difference needed to mitigate the global food crisis.Read also: Putin ‘signals’ readiness to lift blockade of Ukrainian ports  exchange POWs  says Austrian chancellorThe only substantial option for the export of grain is through the Ukrainian Black Sea ports  primarily the Pivdenny and Odesa ports in the Odesa region. There is no viable alternative.Accusations of Russian destruction and plunderThe Kremlin has by no means ignored the global food crisis. To the contrary  it has decided to aggravate and exploit it. Ample Ukrainian sources report that the Russian military has intentionally bombed and burnt Ukrainian grain elevators  fertilizer stores  farming areas  and infrastructure.Russians have stolen grain on an industrial scale. Ukraine’s Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskiy stated in early May that Russians had exported 441 000 tons of grain from the four occupied regions of Zaporizhia  Kherson  Donetsk  and Luhansk. They transported the stolen grain on trucks to Novorossiisk  the main Russian port on the Black Sea  or Sevastopol  the top Crimean port.Then  they ship the grain through the Bosporus to Mediterranean ports. Ports in Cyprus and Lebanon have reportedly turned down delivery of stolen grain  while Russia’s ally Syria accepts it. However  Vysotskiy states that only 1.5 million tons of grain was stored on newly occupied territory.Putin has a long history of personal involvement in major graft operations and is reportedly micromanaging elements of the war on Ukraine. Businessman and human-rights leader Bill Browder showed how such business is done in his investigation of the Sergei Magnitsky affair.Of the $230 million stolen from the Russian tax office  the Panama Papers showed that $800 000 had gone to President Putin himself  and Putin fought tooth and nail to defend the theft from his own government.Given Putin’s history and the big business of stealing and selling Ukraine’s grain  it is likely that these new operations are being organized at the highest level.Similarly  since 2014  Russian government-supported business has exported coal from illegally confiscated coal mines in occupied Donbas to Russia  Belarus  Poland  and Turkey  leading to legal cases in Poland and Turkey.This is part of the Putin government’s close cooperation with organized crime  which has been deeply detailed in recent books by Karen Dawisha  Bill Browder  Catherine Belton  and this author.How the Russian blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea Ports can be endedSince early February  Russia has blocked all of Ukraine’s seaports without any legal excuse or recourse. In the first month of the war alone  the Russian navy attacked at least eight civilian commercial freight ships  and has caused one Estonian freight ship to sink  likely from a mine. These disturbing events have received relatively little international attention.Russia has mined all the Ukrainian ports with hundreds of mines. The three NATO countries around the Black Sea—Bulgaria  Romania and Turkey—have all reported that loose mines have reached their territorial waters.For too long  the undeclared Russian blockade of all Ukrainian Black Sea ports has attracted little international attention in spite of its many negative effects and the absence of a legal case.Since half of Ukraine’s exports are grain  the blockade deprived Ukraine of roughly half its exports earnings  adding a serious economic dimension to the Kremlin’s full-scale war on Ukraine. Combined with the potential effect of starving approximately forty-seven million people  the seriousness of Russia’s blockade cannot be understated.At long last  the West appears to be waking up to this disaster  and has started to consider doing something. From May 12–14  the foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned that “Russia’s war of aggression has generated one of the most severe food and energy crises in recent history which now threatens those most vulnerable across the globe…We are determined to accelerate a coordinated multilateral response to preserve global food security and stand by our most vulnerable partners in this respect.”But how can this be done? Moscow correctly assesses that the blockade is a major blow to the Ukrainian economy and a potent tool in its war to cripple Ukraine—so how can the US and its allies make the Kremlin stand down?The first step is to rally international support to lift the blockade. Moscow has taken comfort from the fact that non-aligned nations have not come out strongly against its aggression in Ukraine.But some of the most impacted victims of the Kremlin-induced food shortage are prominent nations like Egypt and Indonesia. The G-7 should begin a massive public diplomacy campaign to ensure that key nations in Africa  Latin America  the Middle East  and South Asia understand the origins of the food shortage and the obvious solution—to open shipping from Odesa  at a minimum for vital food supplies.The aim would be to bring this issue to the UN General Assembly for a resolution calling for an end to the naval blockade in the Black Sea  at least on food. This effort will force Moscow to pay a greater political price for the blockade.At the same time  the US should explore creating a coalition of willing states to establish a humanitarian maritime channel to Odesa to escort food products out of dangerous waters in the Black Sea. This maritime channel could also be used to deliver crucial humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The group should include NATO allies and especially Turkey  as well as interested partners and key non-aligned states that import grain from Ukraine and that have a strong navy.Turkey is essential to include to ensure that there is no problem with the 1936 Montreux Convention  which governs the passage of vessels through the Bosporus. Given its strong navy and history in successfully standing up to Russian military brinksmanship  Turkey would be valuable in a key role for any international coalition.Egypt is a major grain-importing country impacted by this crisis with a navy that could assist with demining.While this approach contains risk of a confrontation with Russia  it is worth noting that the US navy delivered humanitarian aid to Georgia during the 2008 war while avoiding any serious escalation with Moscow. Creating a large international task force would raise the risks to Moscow of using force to deny access to and from Odesa.Read also: Kuleba and Podolyak respond to Russia's ‘blackmail’ proposal for corridor for grain exportsThis proposal is already gaining traction. On May 22  Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis argued that “The countries who consider the looming global food crisis a serious challenge…should guarantee a safe passage of ships from Odesa across the Black Sea to the Bosporus.”Landsbergis went on to affirm that guaranteeing food supplies is not an escalation  and that urgent action is required to avert a deeper crisis.In parallel  the West needs to reinforce Ukraine’s naval defense  notably with the delivery of potent anti-ship missiles and mine-sweeping facilities.Denmark is already moving in this direction  pledging the delivery of Harpoon anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine. These systems will bolster Ukraine’s ability to defend against Russia’s Black Sea Fleet  but could take months to train on and integrate into the country’s coastal defense system. Further deliveries of these systems should take place immediately.Finally  the US  the EU  and other partners from around the world should consider possible economic measures to force Moscow to end the blockade. This could include an embargo on all Kremlin shipping. It might also include sanctions on all insurers for Russian shipping.This broad range approach holds open the door to ending the blockade but certainly increases the price to Moscow of continuing it and will add new nations to the list of those who oppose Putin’s war on Ukraine.Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s war of aggression has seen remarkable success. But  with the war likely to continue for the foreseeable future  the deeply destabilizing impact on the global economy appears set to continue as well  with tens of millions of people in the Global South being plunged into mass starvation.To reduce the risk of further mass hunger and the ensuing political destabilization  global powers must make it a priority to urgently open Ukraine’s ports for shipping.The operations required to fulfill this mission have successful precedent and can be accomplished without a serious escalation in this conflict. Russia’s war on Ukraine has sparked sea changes in global politics on a historic scale.As the West grapples with how to move forward  addressing Russia’s culpability in exploiting a global food crisis—and mitigating the damage—is essential.This story was first published by the Atlantic Council.

During Inventiva’s ‘NATIVE’ Phase IIb clinical trial  lanifibranor  compared to placebo  has demonstrated beneficial effects on liver histology  NASH resolution and fibrosis regression in patients with non-cirrhotic NASH.Based on the NATIVE data  the authors of the abstract show that glycemic control correlates with NASH severity measured by liver biopsy. In addition  improvement of glycemic control in patients who received lanifibranor correlated with the improvement of metabolic-immune markers of NASH insulin resistance  lipid metabolism  inflammation  liver enzymes and with hepatic steatosis  measured by Continuous Attenuation Parameter (CAP).The details of the presentation are as follows:Date: June 5  2022 Timing of the poster session: 1:00-2:00 pm EST Poster identifier: 830-P Abstract title: “The Pan-PPAR agonist lanifibranor improves nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and glycemic Control” Author: Dr. Michael P.
