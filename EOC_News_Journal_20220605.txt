5994,Clearstream,Google API,https://weirdnewsera.com/is-metv-on-pluto-tv/,Is Metv On Pluto TV - Weird News Era,1 day ago,Pluto TV is a popular free streaming service that provides users with access to hundreds of virtual channels with an experience that is similar to that of cable TV. You won’t have to pay a dime to watch movies  television shows  or even live programming when you stream them online. However  given that there are over 250 different channels available on Pluto TV  the question becomes: which ones should you begin with?Thats a fantastic question. The reality is that there is such a wide variety of channels and categories available to watch on Pluto TV that it will ultimately come down to your personal preferences to determine which ones you will continue to watch. Nevertheless  we believe that we can point you in the correct path by providing you with our recommendations for the top Pluto TV channels.How Can I Watch Metv Without CableYou can pause  rewind  and watch all of your favorite network shows using the free ClearStream TV companion app and any HDTV antenna with no subscription or monthly fees from *ABC  CBS  NBC  Fox  PBS  myTV  ION  MeTV  The CW  and Univision  along with expanded programming  using the FREE ClearStream TV companion app and an HDTV antenna. In addition  you can watch expanded programming using the FREE ClearStream TV companion app and an HDTV antenna.Pluto TV Is Adding Support For Live Local ChannelsOn several popular streaming media players  including Rokus and Fire TVs  Pluto TV is one of the most popular free streaming applications available. Many people who have dropped their cable or satellite television subscriptions appreciate this app since it integrates a diverse selection of material into a single user experience.Now Pluto TV is doing tests to see if it is possible to include the local channels that you receive from your antenna directly into the Pluto TV interface. If you have a Roku TV and an antenna attached to it  you will be able to access your local channels directly within the Pluto TV user interface. This is only possible if you own a Roku TV.Because we were unable to locate a significant amount of information regarding this newly added feature  we contacted Ilya Pozin  an employee at Pluto TV. This is what we have picked up.During this period of beta testing  Pluto TV will only display a maximum of 15 channels within the Pluto TV guide. It was said that this was just for the preliminary test  and that Pluto will continue to enhance support as it receives input from the community.Because Pluto obtains its data from the Roku TV  you need to ensure that your antenna is properly connected to the Roku TV. This is simply a preliminary test for the beta version. It has stated that  based on how the community responds to this test  it may explore extending support to more devices and increasing the support for live TV. At the moment  it does not support other devices such as Android TV.What Is Pluto TVThe term “over-the-top” refers to the fact that Pluto TV is a service that is delivered through the internet as opposed to being broadcast on dedicated lines or over the air. A video-on-demand service that is supported by advertisements is also included. This places it in the same category as other free streaming services such as Crackle  Tubi  and Sling Free.You can watch Pluto TV by streaming it on the website  or you can download the app to use it on any of the numerous devices that are compatible with the service.The Andy Griffith ShowOther stations on Pluto TV are devoted to continuously broadcasting classic comedies including Happy Days  Threes Company  and Family Ties. These channels are available around the clock. For our money  we believe that the sitcom station that is dedicated to broadcasting episodes of The Andy Griffith Show is the best of these several sitcom channels. In contrast to the majority of sitcoms  which take place in large cities  this one is situated in the fictional town of Mayberry  North Carolina. There  the local sheriff  Andy Taylor  does not need to carry a pistol in order to maintain order. This program still manages to be amusing  yet it still has the ability to tug at your emotions on occasion.How To Watch Metv On The RokuHowever  some MeTV-affiliated stations carry the network as a primary affiliation on their main channel  and a small number of stations air select programs from the network alongside their regular general entertainment schedules. MeTV is carried on digital subchannels of affiliated television stations in most markets. However  some MeTV-affiliated stations carry the network as a primary affiliation on their main channel. In addition  the network can be received throughout the United States via the free-to-air C band satellite through SES-1 in the DVB-S format; in certain areas  it can also be received on AT&T U-verse channels 136 and 1136. MeTV’s business operations are managed from the Weigel Broadcasting corporate headquarters  which are located in Chicago  Illinois  on North Halsted Street.Tablo is a next-generation digital video recorder (DVR) that can record free  local HDTV broadcast programs like news and sports inside the United States and Canada by plugging into a digital TV antenna. Tablo does not include an HDMI connection  in contrast to more conventional DVRs that are only linked to a single television. Tablo can connect to your home network by WiFi or Ethernet  allowing it to stream video to any connected device in your home or anywhere else in the world where you have internet access.The Over-The-Air (OTA) DVR service offered by Tablo provides live  local HDTV broadcast programs that are unavailable via Over-The-Top (OTT) online content providers such as Amazon Prime  Hulu  and Netflix. You won’t have to wait until the next day to watch your favorite network shows live  and you won’t have to pay the expensive cable fee either.

6005,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-war-global-food-security-075200603.html,Russia’s war on global food security,Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine is also a war on global food security. In February 2022  Russia blockaded all of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports ...,David Beasley  the executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)  recently warned  “When a country like Ukraine that grows enough food for 400 million people is out of the market  it creates market volatility  which we are now seeing.”Beasley made clear how grave the crisis is as Russian forces preventing Ukraine’s exports from getting to market threaten to plunge vulnerable populations into peril. “Truly  failure to open those ports in the Odesa region will be a declaration of war on global food security ” said Beasley. “And it will result in famine and destabilization and mass migration around the world.”In recent years  Ukraine’s export revenues from both goods and services have surged  thanks to booming agricultural production and rising commodity prices. They soared from $124 billion in 2020 to a record of $166 billion in 2021  while Ukraine’s gross domestic product (GDP) was $200 billion. Meanwhile  the share of agriculture in Ukraine’s export revenues from goods increased from 26 percent in 2012 to 45 percent in 2020.Read also: Russia delivered 100 000 tons of stolen Ukrainian grain to SyriaRussia has further aggravated this food crisis by bombing and burning grain storage in the south and east of Ukraine  by stealing hundreds of thousands of tons of grain  and by exporting it on its own ships  primarily to its ally Syria.Russia’s war on Ukraine’s grain exports should not be allowed to continue. The collective West needs to open Ukraine’s Black Sea ports  primarily the major ports in Odesa  to mitigate the ongoing crisis in countries suffering from food insecurity  as well as enabling Ukraine to sell the twenty-eight million tons of grain it has in storage.Ukraine is a global granaryBefore communism  Ukraine was the granary of the world; since the privatization of agricultural land in 2000  it has become so again. Its grain production has skyrocketed  and Ukraine is now focusing on modern grains—corn  wheat  soy  canola  and sunflower oil.Story continuesUkraine is a major producer of many grains. In 2021  it produced some eighty-six million tons of grain. The latest reliable statistics are for 2019 from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.In 2019  Ukraine produced 35.9 million tons of corn. It was the fifth-biggest grower of corn after the United States  China  Brazil  and Argentina  producing 3.1 percent of all corn in the world. Ukraine produced 28.4 million tons of wheat  or 3.7 percent of global production  ranking seventh in the world  after China  India  Russia  the United States  France  and Canada.Ukraine’s role as an exporter of grain is much greater because most of the other major producers are very large countries  such as China  India  the United States  Indonesia  and Brazil  which consume much of their produce themselves.Read also: List of Russian ships exporting Ukrainian grain given to Turkey  Dzhemilev saysIn 2019  42 percent of all global sunflower oil exports came from Ukraine  as did 16 percent of all corn exports  8.9 percent of all wheat exports  and 9.7 percent of all barley exports. Because of Ukraine’s swiftly expanding agriculture  the country’s role as a grain exporter has risen fast.Most attention is being devoted to wheat because it is crucial for economically developing countries’ supplies of bread  a basic staple. With its steadily improving agriculture  Ukraine’s exports have risen in turn. For the year until July 2021  the US Department of Agriculture assessed Ukrainian exports of wheat at 23.5 million tons.These wheat exports were spread to many countries in Asia  the Middle East  and North Africa. The main recipients by quantity were Indonesia  Egypt  Pakistan  Bangladesh  Morocco  Turkey  Yemen  Tunisia  Libya  Lebanon  and the Philippines. These countries are most likely to suffer from a new shortfall of wheat.Corn is the second important grain export. Ukraine has nearly perfect conditions for growing corn  similar to those of the US states of Iowa and Illinois  and corn production has grown exponentially. For the year until July 2021  the US Department of Agriculture assessed Ukrainian exports of corn at thirty-four million tons.The corn exports went in quite different directions from the wheat exports  going to somewhat wealthier countries  because corn is mainly used for animal feed. In recent years  Ukraine’s main market has been China  which bought no less than 8.4 million tons of Ukraine’s corn exports in 2020–2021. Other major purchasers were Spain  the Netherlands  Egypt  and Iran.Officially  Russia closed vast expanses of the Black and the Azov Seas for civilian maritime traffic  under the pretext of naval exercises  for the period from February 13–19. It had no legal basis for this decision. Thus  Russia closed the access to all Ukraine’s ports from the Black Sea  and the ports have remained shut ever since. Russia has also mined them. Russian naval ships have hit at least ten commercial ships since Russia launched its assault  according to the International Maritime Organization. They sank one Estonian commercial ship. About eighty commercial ships have been caught in the Black Sea or the Sea of Azov for months. The risk to commercial shipping in the area has soared  and the cost of marine insurance in the Black Sea has skyrocketed as a result.A tight global grain marketIn recent years  the global grain market has tightened fast because of production problems in many parts of the world  which are largely connected with climate change. The two big positive exceptions have been Russia and Ukraine. As a result of a tightening global grain market  global prices have risen greatly. By and large  global wheat prices have doubled since early 2021. The Euronext Paris milling price of wheat has risen from about 200 euros per ton in early 2021 to 400 euros a ton at present.Food is a highly sensitive political issue. As politicians are anxious to keep food prices low  they want to keep scarce domestically produced grains at home  and shortages often provoke export bans.More than twenty countries have already imposed export bans on food  including important grain producers such as India and Indonesia. More countries are likely to follow  further aggravating the global shortage of grains.As the global grain market grows tighter  many traditional exporters prohibit exports to keep their domestic prices low  to avoid political tensions. But  as they prohibit exports  global grain prices rise further  and the economically weak countries that struggle to afford their vital grain imports suffer the most.How can Ukraine get its grain to market?Out of Ukraine’s total grain production of some eighty-six million tons in 2021  about twenty-eight million tons are stuck in Ukrainian ports because of the Russian naval blockade. Ukraine has limited storage available—and  after some time in storage  much of the grain perishes. Moreover  new sowing and other work require financing  and the Ukrainian farmers need to be able to sell their grain in order to acquire financing for the next year’s harvest.At the Stuttgart Group of Seven (G7) conference from May 12–14  Ukraine’s Minister of Agrarian Policy Mykola Solsky laid out the situation  saying  “Due to the blockade of Ukrainian seaports  7 million tons of wheat  14 million tons of corn  3 million tons of sunflower oil  and 3 million tons of sunflower meal and other crops have not entered the world market.” Usually  Ukraine would export 6–7 million tons a month through its Black Sea ports  but they are blocked  and the Russians offer no sign of easing up.Read also: Business community urges international organizations to help lift Russia’s blockade of Black Sea portsUkrainian exports fell by 58 percent and imports by 76 percent from March 2021 to March 2022  which reflects just how devastatingly Russian warfare has hindered much of the production and transportation of goods in Ukraine.Ukraine has no alternative seaports for its large grain volumes. Rail or truck transportation can take some volumes through Poland or Romania  to the Polish port of Gdansk  the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda  or the Romanian ports on the Danube River or the Black Sea. At present  these alternative routes can only manage about one-tenth of the demand  400 000–500 000 tons per month  but they can rise to 2 million tons per month  according to Ukrainian agricultural experts interviewed by the author  and the delays are substantial and costly. The delays are caused by both infrastructure bottlenecks and seemingly excessive border controls. The rail transportation is being impeded by Ukraine having broad track gauge (the distance between the two rails on a railway track)  matching railways in Russia  Belarus  and the Baltics  which are different from railways in Poland and Romania.The alternative transportation routes are cumbersome  small  and costly. Usually  the transportation of grain to a Black Sea port costs a Ukrainian grain producer about 10 percent of the price.Once there  one of the big international grain traders buys the grain and takes it over. Currently  the added cost to transport grain to Gdansk or Klaipeda adds about 30 percent. Considering that European grain prices have doubled in a year  that is not prohibitive  but the capacity remains tiny—whatever Ukrainian exports make it to these ports are unlikely to make the difference needed to mitigate the global food crisis.Read also: Putin ‘signals’ readiness to lift blockade of Ukrainian ports  exchange POWs  says Austrian chancellorThe only substantial option for the export of grain is through the Ukrainian Black Sea ports  primarily the Pivdenny and Odesa ports in the Odesa region. There is no viable alternative.Accusations of Russian destruction and plunderThe Kremlin has by no means ignored the global food crisis. To the contrary  it has decided to aggravate and exploit it. Ample Ukrainian sources report that the Russian military has intentionally bombed and burnt Ukrainian grain elevators  fertilizer stores  farming areas  and infrastructure.Russians have stolen grain on an industrial scale. Ukraine’s Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskiy stated in early May that Russians had exported 441 000 tons of grain from the four occupied regions of Zaporizhia  Kherson  Donetsk  and Luhansk. They transported the stolen grain on trucks to Novorossiisk  the main Russian port on the Black Sea  or Sevastopol  the top Crimean port.Then  they ship the grain through the Bosporus to Mediterranean ports. Ports in Cyprus and Lebanon have reportedly turned down delivery of stolen grain  while Russia’s ally Syria accepts it. However  Vysotskiy states that only 1.5 million tons of grain was stored on newly occupied territory.Putin has a long history of personal involvement in major graft operations and is reportedly micromanaging elements of the war on Ukraine. Businessman and human-rights leader Bill Browder showed how such business is done in his investigation of the Sergei Magnitsky affair.Of the $230 million stolen from the Russian tax office  the Panama Papers showed that $800 000 had gone to President Putin himself  and Putin fought tooth and nail to defend the theft from his own government.Given Putin’s history and the big business of stealing and selling Ukraine’s grain  it is likely that these new operations are being organized at the highest level.Similarly  since 2014  Russian government-supported business has exported coal from illegally confiscated coal mines in occupied Donbas to Russia  Belarus  Poland  and Turkey  leading to legal cases in Poland and Turkey.This is part of the Putin government’s close cooperation with organized crime  which has been deeply detailed in recent books by Karen Dawisha  Bill Browder  Catherine Belton  and this author.How the Russian blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea Ports can be endedSince early February  Russia has blocked all of Ukraine’s seaports without any legal excuse or recourse. In the first month of the war alone  the Russian navy attacked at least eight civilian commercial freight ships  and has caused one Estonian freight ship to sink  likely from a mine. These disturbing events have received relatively little international attention.Russia has mined all the Ukrainian ports with hundreds of mines. The three NATO countries around the Black Sea—Bulgaria  Romania and Turkey—have all reported that loose mines have reached their territorial waters.For too long  the undeclared Russian blockade of all Ukrainian Black Sea ports has attracted little international attention in spite of its many negative effects and the absence of a legal case.Since half of Ukraine’s exports are grain  the blockade deprived Ukraine of roughly half its exports earnings  adding a serious economic dimension to the Kremlin’s full-scale war on Ukraine. Combined with the potential effect of starving approximately forty-seven million people  the seriousness of Russia’s blockade cannot be understated.At long last  the West appears to be waking up to this disaster  and has started to consider doing something. From May 12–14  the foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned that “Russia’s war of aggression has generated one of the most severe food and energy crises in recent history which now threatens those most vulnerable across the globe…We are determined to accelerate a coordinated multilateral response to preserve global food security and stand by our most vulnerable partners in this respect.”But how can this be done? Moscow correctly assesses that the blockade is a major blow to the Ukrainian economy and a potent tool in its war to cripple Ukraine—so how can the US and its allies make the Kremlin stand down?The first step is to rally international support to lift the blockade. Moscow has taken comfort from the fact that non-aligned nations have not come out strongly against its aggression in Ukraine.But some of the most impacted victims of the Kremlin-induced food shortage are prominent nations like Egypt and Indonesia. The G-7 should begin a massive public diplomacy campaign to ensure that key nations in Africa  Latin America  the Middle East  and South Asia understand the origins of the food shortage and the obvious solution—to open shipping from Odesa  at a minimum for vital food supplies.The aim would be to bring this issue to the UN General Assembly for a resolution calling for an end to the naval blockade in the Black Sea  at least on food. This effort will force Moscow to pay a greater political price for the blockade.At the same time  the US should explore creating a coalition of willing states to establish a humanitarian maritime channel to Odesa to escort food products out of dangerous waters in the Black Sea. This maritime channel could also be used to deliver crucial humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The group should include NATO allies and especially Turkey  as well as interested partners and key non-aligned states that import grain from Ukraine and that have a strong navy.Turkey is essential to include to ensure that there is no problem with the 1936 Montreux Convention  which governs the passage of vessels through the Bosporus. Given its strong navy and history in successfully standing up to Russian military brinksmanship  Turkey would be valuable in a key role for any international coalition.Egypt is a major grain-importing country impacted by this crisis with a navy that could assist with demining.While this approach contains risk of a confrontation with Russia  it is worth noting that the US navy delivered humanitarian aid to Georgia during the 2008 war while avoiding any serious escalation with Moscow. Creating a large international task force would raise the risks to Moscow of using force to deny access to and from Odesa.Read also: Kuleba and Podolyak respond to Russia's ‘blackmail’ proposal for corridor for grain exportsThis proposal is already gaining traction. On May 22  Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis argued that “The countries who consider the looming global food crisis a serious challenge…should guarantee a safe passage of ships from Odesa across the Black Sea to the Bosporus.”Landsbergis went on to affirm that guaranteeing food supplies is not an escalation  and that urgent action is required to avert a deeper crisis.In parallel  the West needs to reinforce Ukraine’s naval defense  notably with the delivery of potent anti-ship missiles and mine-sweeping facilities.Denmark is already moving in this direction  pledging the delivery of Harpoon anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine. These systems will bolster Ukraine’s ability to defend against Russia’s Black Sea Fleet  but could take months to train on and integrate into the country’s coastal defense system. Further deliveries of these systems should take place immediately.Finally  the US  the EU  and other partners from around the world should consider possible economic measures to force Moscow to end the blockade. This could include an embargo on all Kremlin shipping. It might also include sanctions on all insurers for Russian shipping.This broad range approach holds open the door to ending the blockade but certainly increases the price to Moscow of continuing it and will add new nations to the list of those who oppose Putin’s war on Ukraine.Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s war of aggression has seen remarkable success. But  with the war likely to continue for the foreseeable future  the deeply destabilizing impact on the global economy appears set to continue as well  with tens of millions of people in the Global South being plunged into mass starvation.To reduce the risk of further mass hunger and the ensuing political destabilization  global powers must make it a priority to urgently open Ukraine’s ports for shipping.The operations required to fulfill this mission have successful precedent and can be accomplished without a serious escalation in this conflict. Russia’s war on Ukraine has sparked sea changes in global politics on a historic scale.As the West grapples with how to move forward  addressing Russia’s culpability in exploiting a global food crisis—and mitigating the damage—is essential.This story was first published by the Atlantic Council.

But the real gold nuggets are often found in the footnotes  which most analysts never read.The latest numbers indicate that “collateral velocity” — a measure of how quickly and smoothly collateral moves around the financial system — has started slowing again.That indicates a need to augment the current financial plumbing  and raises a few issues that warrant attention from policymakers.First  some background. Collateral velocity is simply the ratio of the total pledged collateral received by the large banks  divided by the primary collateral sourced from reverse repos  securities borrowing  prime brokerage and derivative margin. This ratio measures the reuse of collateral due to financial intermediation between banks and non-banks  also known as “collateral chains”.For global banks that are active in peddling pledged collateral globally  there are two primary sources of collateral that form the basis of the bank/non-bank nexus  and the market plumbing: hedge funds and other types of institutional investors.For example  in 2007 about $3.4tn of “source collateral” was provided by hedge funds (via their repo and prime brokerage funding)  securities lending by pension funds and insurers  and via derivative margins. Given the overall pledged collateral of $10tn  this meant an overall collateral velocity (or reuse rate) of about 3.The original estimates of collateral velocity were first calculated in 2011. Researchers from Bank of England  Dutch Central Bank  Reserve Bank of Australia  and recently Bundesbank  and public-and-private regulators  (FSB and DTCC etc) have since been investigating this topic  including several working groups at BIS.As you might expect  a lot has changed since 2007  with the disappearance of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns  the reshuffling of business models by UBS  Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank  and the rise of JPMorgan and Barclays. The latest data is in green-and-white bars below.Although dealers adapted to the post-Basel regulatory era and balance-sheet space constraints  re-use capacity has maxed out in recent years. Despite an increase in the sources of overall pledged collateral  balance sheet constraints limit only reuse in markets that are more profitable — for example  prime brokerage transactions are preferred over repo.Changes in hedge fund strategies have been the primary drivers of the altered landscape  as banks have worked to accommodate their customers’ preferences. The size of the hedge fund industry has grown above $4tn of assets under management  but it is important to understand their footprint (leverage) and their choice of funding.In the period 2019/20 we saw a shift from equity strategies (in prime brokerage) to fixed income strategies (in repo); then a reversal towards prime brokerage after the March 2020 crisis. Leverage also reshuffles with such strategies (repo is higher leverage than equity strategies).The initial post-2008 slump in collateral velocity was caused by a spike in counterparty risk aversion between large banks in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’s demise. But it has remained subdued ever since  despite increasing sources of collateral in recent years.Factors like the European crisis  quantitative easing (central bank bond purchases restricted the availability of good collateral) and regulations that now restricted dealer banks’ intermediation capacity have had a big impact. After ticking up a little from the post-crisis doldrums  the collateral velocity fell back to 2.1 last year.Dealer balance sheet constraints and the collateral reuse metric are a harbinger for market plumbing issues. For example  the debt pipeline is likely to be sizeable relative to dealer balance sheet capacity to arrange transactions in all collateral markets (like repos/sec-lending/prime brokerage/derivatives). This is especially true in the US.If balance sheets are constrained  prime brokerage and derivatives transactions are generally more profitable per unit of balance sheet  although banks continue to seek creative netting solutions (like FICC) to make repo attractive.But the interest rate cycle is turning. Collateral constraints in some jurisdiction (such as the eurozone) mean we will need to revisit dealer balance sheet constraints  as repo markets will need to move in tandem with rate hikes. Basically  the “old pipes” are maxed out  so new pipes are needed to augment the traditional ones  and bring the global financial plumbing into the new century.As a result  there are a few issues that warrant attention on the policy front:• If new pipes are not forthcoming  we may need regulatory or central bank intervention to prevent unavoidable systemic risk. But in the the aftermath of the financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic  the central bank footprint in market is already large.• Inter-operability  including tri-party links  is crucial to mobilise collateral. Global custodians such as Euroclear  Bank of New York or Clearstream — often called “International Central Securities Depositories” — are trying to enhance links with country-specific CSDs  but local laws often hinder such ties.• Tokenisation maybe a silver lining on the horizon. Frictionless collateral with instant  realtime settlement can increase the velocity of collateral  if the new technology can work within the regulatory parameters.This post was originally published on this site,neutral,0.13,0.59,0.28,mixed,0.08,0.21,0.71,True,English,"['new financial pipes', 'central bank bond purchases', 'Dealer balance sheet constraints', 'dealer balance sheet capacity', 'balance-sheet space constraints', 'real gold nuggets', 'initial post-2008 slump', 'counterparty risk aversion', 'creative netting solutions', 'unavoidable systemic risk', 'Dutch Central Bank', 'central bank intervention', 'hedge fund industry', 'interest rate cycle', 'fixed income strategies', 'current financial plumbing', 'post-Basel regulatory era', 'central bank footprint', 'hedge fund strategies', 'global financial plumbing', 'two primary sources', 'banks’ intermediation capacity', 'prime brokerage funding', 'prime brokerage transactions', 'collateral reuse metric', 'market plumbing issues', 'overall collateral velocity', 'balance sheets', 're-use capacity', 'Collateral constraints', 'financial intermediation', 'Reserve Bank', 'Deutsche Bank', 'hedge funds', 'financial system', 'financial crisis', 'primary drivers', 'rate hikes', 'equity strategies', 'global banks', 'primary collateral', 'reuse rate', 'Manmohan Singh', 'senior economist', 'executive board', 'annual reports', 'fascinating exercise', 'most analysts', 'latest numbers', 'derivative margin', 'bank/non-bank nexus', 'other types', 'institutional investors', 'pension funds', 'original estimates', 'private regulators', 'Lehman Brothers', 'Bear Stearns', 'business models', 'Credit Suisse', 'latest data', 'white bars', 'recent years', 'customers’ preferences', 'March 2020 crisis', 'increasing sources', 'European crisis', 'quantitative easing', 'big impact', 'post-crisis doldrums', 'debt pipeline', 'lending/prime brokerage/derivatives', 'derivatives transactions', 'old pipes', 'new pipes', 'new century', 'policy front', 'Covid-19 pandemic', 'collateral moves', 'collateral chains', 'source collateral', 'good collateral', 'big banks', 'large banks', 'reverse repos', 'securities borrowing', 'collateral markets', 'repo markets', 'IMF', 'views', 'April', 'footnotes', 'measure', 'need', 'attention', 'policymakers', 'background', 'ratio', 'total', 'basis', 'example', 'insurers', 'Researchers', 'England', 'Australia', 'Bundesbank', 'public', 'FSB', 'DTCC', 'topic', 'several', 'groups', 'BIS', 'lot', 'disappearance', 'reshuffling', 'UBS', 'rise', 'JPMorgan', 'Barclays', 'green', 'dealers', 'increase', 'Changes', 'landscape', 'size', 'assets', 'management', 'leverage', 'choice', 'period', 'shift', 'reversal', 'spike', 'aftermath', 'demise', 'Factors', 'availability', 'regulations', 'harbinger', 'unit', 'FICC', 'jurisdiction', 'eurozone', 'tandem', 'traditional', 'result', 'Inter-operability']",2022-06-03,2022-06-05,publicwire.com

Nanobiotix also presented a trial-in-progress poster on the study design of the Company's ongoing pivotal phase 3 study  NANORAY-312  evaluating NBTXR3 as a single agent activated by radiotherapy for the treatment of elderly and frail patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC) who are ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin).In view of the Company's strategy for development of NBTXR3 as a product candidate that can integrate across solid tumor indications along with major treatment modalities within each indication  starting with head and neck cancer  the company believes these new data add support for the radioenhancer in combination with chemoradiation and as a neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy with the potential to improve surgical outcomes. ""Revolutionizing treatment outcomes for millions of patients with cancer will require integration of NBTXR3 across solid tumor indications  treatment modalities  and lines of therapy where radiation is a part of the treatment regimen—starting with head and neck cancer "" said Laurent Levy  co-founder and chairman of the executive board at Nanobiotix. ""Taken together with the clinical data we have already produced for NBTXR3 as a single agent activated by radiotherapy and as a combination agent with anti-PD-1  we view the new chemoradiation data presented at ASCO as critical validation of NBTXR3's feasibility across the standard of care. As we continue to prioritize our ongoing pivotal phase 3 study for elderly and frail patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  our aim is to build a comprehensive approach to the treatment of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer that will serve as a model for our radioenhancer in other indications.""A Comprehensive Approach to Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Inclusive of ChemoradiationMost cisplatin-eligible patients with LA-HNSCC receive multimodal therapy including high dose concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) as the standard of care. While CCRT has shown to improve local control and extend survival  the toxicity of high dose cisplatin creates challenges. These challenges appear both in terms of compliance with the treatment regimen for patients undergoing therapy that can impair efficacy  and in terms of the patients' quality of life after treatment. Although changes to the treatment protocol have been explored in randomized studies to reduce toxicity and improve compliance  reduction in toxicity has also led to reduction in efficacy.These patients need innovative new therapeutic options that do not create additional burden in their administration  do not add combined toxicity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy  and have the potential to improve survival.A Phase 1b/2 Study Evaluating NBTXR3 in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiation for Patients with Locally Advanced or Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell CarcinomaThis study  sponsored  executed  and reported by former Nanobiotix collaborator in Asia  PharmaEngine  Inc. (PEI)  sought to evaluate the safety and feasibility of NBTXR3 intratumoral injection when added to low-dose weekly cisplatin-containing CCRT for patients with locally advanced or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The study also aimed to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)  however the RP2D was not determined due to stoppage of the phase 1b part of the trial resulting from the conclusion of the collaboration between PEI and Nanobiotix in 2021.Adult patients with T3-4 LA-HNSCC suitable for cisplatin were eligible for the study and 12 such patients were enrolled. These patients received a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3  followed by a low-dose weekly regimen of CCRT. All 12 patients were deemed evaluable and all had stage 4 locally advanced disease.Of these evaluable patients  3  6  and 3 patients received NBTXR3 at the 5%  10%  and 15% dose levels  respectively. No serious adverse events (SAEs) inconsistent with what would normally be expected from a low-dose CCRT regimen were observed. Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 increased ALT and grade 3 increased AST were observed in one patient at the 10% dose level. Common Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) observed across dose levels were stomatitis  decreased WBC  decreased appetite  decreased neutrophil count  and leukopenia. One patient experienced grade 4 hyponatremia.Preliminary efficacy results showed a disease control rate of 100%  with an overall response rate of 58.3% according to RECIST 1.1. The study concluded that adding a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 to weekly low dose cisplatin-containing CCRT was feasible and had a favorable safety profile for patients with LA-HNSCC.Strengthening Support for NBTXR3 in Combination with Chemoradiation in the Preoperative SettingColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer indication worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. One-third of CRCs appear in the rectum. For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC)  combined modality therapy with neoadjuvant CCRT  followed by total mesorectal excision (TME; surgery)  followed by adjuvant (post-operative) systemic chemotherapy is the current standard of care. The aim of the neoadjuvant portion of the treatment regimen is to control and downstage the disease to allow for R0 TME (surgical removal with a negative margin in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the primary tumor bed)  as clinical studies have shown a positive correlation between improved cancer-specific survival and R0 TME. While outcomes have improved  patients are still faced with a highly toxic treatment regimen that can lead to a lack of compliance which may hamper efficacy  along with deteriorated quality of life after treatment.Innovation with the potential to improve the rate of R0 resection without adding toxicity is an urgent need for this patient population.A Phase 1b/2 Study Evaluating NBTXR3 in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiation in the Neoadjuvant Setting for Patients with Locally Advanced or Unresectable Rectal CancerThis study  sponsored  executed  and presented by PEI  sought to evaluate safety  feasibility  and early signs of efficacy for neoadjuvant NBTXR3 combined with CCRT followed by surgery for patients with locally advanced or unresectable rectal cancer. The study established the recommended phase 2 dose of NBTXR3 at 22% of gross tumor volume  however the phase 2 part of the trial was stopped as a result of the conclusion of the collaboration between PEI and Nanobiotix in 2021. Adult and older patients with T3-T4 locally advanced or unresectable rectal cancer suitable for chemoradiation were eligible for the study and 32 such patients were enrolled. These patients received a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3  followed by a weekly regimen of CCRT. 31 of 32 patients were deemed evaluable and none of the evaluable patients had tumors eligible for surgery at the time of diagnosis.Of the 31 evaluable patients  6  4  3  and 18 patients received NBTXR3 at the 5%  10%  15%  and 22% dose levels  respectively. No NBTXR3-related SAEs or grade ≥ 3 AEs were observed. The most frequently reported AEs were grade 1 or 2 decreased WBC  diarrhea  increased CRP  UTI  and decreased lymphocyte count which were all consistent with what would normally be expected from CCRT.Preliminary efficacy results showed a disease control rate of 100%  with an overall response rate of 35.5% according to RECIST 1.1. Pathological tumor downstaging was observed in 14 of 31 patients after therapy  25 patients underwent surgery  and 96% of those patients achieved R0 surgical margins. Pathological complete response was observed in 20% of the patients who received surgery. The study concluded that a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 in combination with CCRT is feasible and has a favorable safety profile in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with locally advanced or unresectable rectal adenocarcinoma.***About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company is leveraging its proprietary nanoparticle platform  including its lead product candidate  radiotherapy activated NBTXR3  to develop a pipeline of therapeutic options designed to enhance local and systemic control of solid tumors with an initial focus on the treatment of head and neck cancers.For more information about Nanobiotix  visit us at www.nanobiotix.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.DisclaimerThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws  including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALNOX) (Paris:ALNOX)  a biotechnology company focused on improving cancer treatments by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  announced today the publication of the full top-line results from the NOX-A12 Phase 1/2 GLORIA trial in brain cancer (glioblastoma) in a poster presentation at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting  taking place in Chicago  Illinois  US  from June 3 to June 7  2022.The poster presentation entitled “Radiotherapy and olaptesed pegol (NOX-A12) in partially resected or biopsy-only MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma: Interim data from the German multicenter phase 1/2 GLORIA trial” was presented by Dr. Frank A. Giordano and highlighted that:90% of patients who received NOX-A12 and radiotherapy achieved tumor size reductions vs. 25% of patients in a matched reference cohort receiving standard of care.40% of patients who received NOX-A12 and radiotherapy achieved partial response (defined as tumor size reduction of more than 50%) vs. 10% in a matched reference cohort receiving standard of care.In 30% of patients who received NOX-A12 and radiotherapy  one or more non-target lesions (smaller secondary lesions) completely disappeared.Infiltration of the tumor with activated  cytotoxic T-cells and M1-like macrophages was seen in both patients who had repeat surgery during NOX-A12 therapy  consistent with NOX-A12 and radiotherapy overcoming immune cell exclusion and making the tumors immunologically hotter.The combination of NOX-A12 and radiotherapy was safe and well tolerated  with no dose limiting toxicities and no treatment-related deaths. Only 4% of the adverse events of Grade 2 or more were deemed solely NOX-A12-related.Aram Mangasarian  CEO of NOXXON  commented: ""We are excited about these impressive results  which demonstrate the potential of our lead asset NOX-A12 in brain cancer and further substantiate our innovative approach of targeting the tumor microenvironment. We will continue to report on maturing data from the dose-escalation part of the study and are looking forward to interim read-outs from the ongoing expansion study exploring additional combination therapies  which will help us design our planned pivotal trial. Brain cancer is a very difficult to treat condition and these results bring us a step closer to offering improved treatment options and hope for patients.""Dr. Frank A. Giordano  Director and Chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University Hospital Bonn and the lead investigator of the GLORIA trial  commented: ""These encouraging results show a strong response to NOX-A12 and radiotherapy  with 90% of patients achieving tumor size reduction. In addition to this  the 40% of patients who have achieved more than 50% tumor size reduction under NOX‑A12 treatment is a considerable increase over the 22% disclosed in the previous interim data analysis  and a multi-fold increase over the 10% achieved by the reference cohort receiving standard of care. This suggests the promising clinical efficacy of this new approach to directly target CXCL12 in glioblastoma.""A copy of the poster presentation and a video describing the poster  is available on the NOXXON website. More information about the GLORIA study (NCT04121455) can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov.Following the ASCO 2022 conference  NOXXON will host a Key Opinion Leader (KOL) webinar with Dr. Giordano  who will take the audience through the ASCO poster presentation and discuss the results of the GLORIA Phase 1/2 trial in more detail.Details of the Key Opinion Leader webinar are as follows:Title: KOL Webinar on GLORIA Top-Line Results of NOX-A12 & Radiotherapy Combination in First-Line Glioblastoma Presented at ASCO 2022Presenter: Dr. Frank A.

By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  NOXXON’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses against the immune system and enable greater therapeutic impact. NOXXON’s lead program NOX-A12 has delivered final top-line data from a Keytruda® combination trial in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients published at the ESMO conference in September 2020 and in July 2021 the company announced its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. NOXXON is also studying NOX-A12 in brain cancer in combination with radiotherapy which has been granted orphan drug status in the US and EU for the treatment of certain brain cancers. GLORIA  a trial of NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy has delivered top-line data from all three dose-escalation cohorts showing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA has been expanded to assess the benefit of NOX-A12 with other treatment combinations  radiotherapy + bevacizumab and radiotherapy + pembrolizumab. The company’s second clinical-stage asset NOX-E36 is a Phase 2 TME asset targeting the innate immune system. NOXXON plans to test NOX‑E36 in patients with solid tumors.

The study also aimed to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)  however the RP2D was not determined due to stoppage of the phase 1b part of the trial resulting from the conclusion of the collaboration between PEI and Nanobiotix in 2021.Adult patients with T3-4 LA-HNSCC suitable for cisplatin were eligible for the study and 12 such patients were enrolled. These patients received a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3  followed by a low-dose weekly regimen of CCRT. All 12 patients were deemed evaluable and all had stage 4 locally advanced disease.Of these evaluable patients  3  6  and 3 patients received NBTXR3 at the 5%  10%  and 15% dose levels  respectively. No serious adverse events (SAEs) inconsistent with what would normally be expected from a low-dose CCRT regimen were observed. Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 increased ALT and grade 3 increased AST were observed in one patient at the 10% dose level. Common Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) observed across dose levels were stomatitis  decreased WBC  decreased appetite  decreased neutrophil count  and leukopenia. One patient experienced grade 4 hyponatremia.Preliminary efficacy results showed a disease control rate of 100%  with an overall response rate of 58.3% according to RECIST 1.1. The study concluded that adding a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 to weekly low dose cisplatin-containing CCRT was feasible and had a favorable safety profile for patients with LA-HNSCC.Strengthening Support for NBTXR3 in Combination with Chemoradiation in the Preoperative SettingColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer indication worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. One-third of CRCs appear in the rectum. For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC)  combined modality therapy with neoadjuvant CCRT  followed by total mesorectal excision (TME; surgery)  followed by adjuvant (post-operative) systemic chemotherapy is the current standard of care. The aim of the neoadjuvant portion of the treatment regimen is to control and downstage the disease to allow for R0 TME (surgical removal with a negative margin in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the primary tumor bed)  as clinical studies have shown a positive correlation between improved cancer-specific survival and R0 TME. While outcomes have improved  patients are still faced with a highly toxic treatment regimen that can lead to a lack of compliance which may hamper efficacy  along with deteriorated quality of life after treatment.Innovation with the potential to improve the rate of R0 resection without adding toxicity is an urgent need for this patient population.A Phase 1b/2 Study Evaluating NBTXR3 in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiation in the Neoadjuvant Setting for Patients with Locally Advanced or Unresectable Rectal CancerThis study  sponsored  executed  and presented by PEI  sought to evaluate safety  feasibility  and early signs of efficacy for neoadjuvant NBTXR3 combined with CCRT followed by surgery for patients with locally advanced or unresectable rectal cancer. The study established the recommended phase 2 dose of NBTXR3 at 22% of gross tumor volume  however the phase 2 part of the trial was stopped as a result of the conclusion of the collaboration between PEI and Nanobiotix in 2021. Adult and older patients with T3-T4 locally advanced or unresectable rectal cancer suitable for chemoradiation were eligible for the study and 32 such patients were enrolled. These patients received a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3  followed by a weekly regimen of CCRT. 31 of 32 patients were deemed evaluable and none of the evaluable patients had tumors eligible for surgery at the time of diagnosis.Of the 31 evaluable patients  6  4  3  and 18 patients received NBTXR3 at the 5%  10%  15%  and 22% dose levels  respectively. No NBTXR3-related SAEs or grade ≥ 3 AEs were observed. The most frequently reported AEs were grade 1 or 2 decreased WBC  diarrhea  increased CRP  UTI  and decreased lymphocyte count which were all consistent with what would normally be expected from CCRT.Preliminary efficacy results showed a disease control rate of 100%  with an overall response rate of 35.5% according to RECIST 1.1. Pathological tumor downstaging was observed in 14 of 31 patients after therapy  25 patients underwent surgery  and 96% of those patients achieved R0 surgical margins. Pathological complete response was observed in 20% of the patients who received surgery. The study concluded that a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 in combination with CCRT is feasible and has a favorable safety profile in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with locally advanced or unresectable rectal adenocarcinoma.***About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity. The company is leveraging its proprietary nanoparticle platform  including its lead product candidate  radiotherapy activated NBTXR3  to develop a pipeline of therapeutic options designed to enhance local and systemic control of solid tumors with an initial focus on the treatment of head and neck cancers.For more information about Nanobiotix  visit us at www.nanobiotix.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.DisclaimerThis press release contains certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws  including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
