Nanobiotix also presented a trial-in-progress poster on the study design of the Company's ongoing pivotal phase 3 study  NANORAY-312  evaluating NBTXR3 as a single agent activated by radiotherapy for the treatment of elderly and frail patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC) who are ineligible for platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin).In view of the Company's strategy for development of NBTXR3 as a product candidate that can integrate across solid tumor indications along with major treatment modalities within each indication  starting with head and neck cancer  the company believes these new data add support for the radioenhancer in combination with chemoradiation and as a neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy with the potential to improve surgical outcomes. ""Revolutionizing treatment outcomes for millions of patients with cancer will require integration of NBTXR3 across solid tumor indications  treatment modalities  and lines of therapy where radiation is a part of the treatment regimen—starting with head and neck cancer "" said Laurent Levy  co-founder and chairman of the executive board at Nanobiotix. ""Taken together with the clinical data we have already produced for NBTXR3 as a single agent activated by radiotherapy and as a combination agent with anti-PD-1  we view the new chemoradiation data presented at ASCO as critical validation of NBTXR3's feasibility across the standard of care. As we continue to prioritize our ongoing pivotal phase 3 study for elderly and frail patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  our aim is to build a comprehensive approach to the treatment of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer that will serve as a model for our radioenhancer in other indications.""A Comprehensive Approach to Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Inclusive of ChemoradiationMost cisplatin-eligible patients with LA-HNSCC receive multimodal therapy including high dose concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) as the standard of care. While CCRT has shown to improve local control and extend survival  the toxicity of high dose cisplatin creates challenges. These challenges appear both in terms of compliance with the treatment regimen for patients undergoing therapy that can impair efficacy  and in terms of the patients' quality of life after treatment. Although changes to the treatment protocol have been explored in randomized studies to reduce toxicity and improve compliance  reduction in toxicity has also led to reduction in efficacy.These patients need innovative new therapeutic options that do not create additional burden in their administration  do not add combined toxicity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy  and have the potential to improve survival.A Phase 1b/2 Study Evaluating NBTXR3 in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiation for Patients with Locally Advanced or Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell CarcinomaThis study  sponsored  executed  and reported by former Nanobiotix collaborator in Asia  PharmaEngine  Inc. (PEI)  sought to evaluate the safety and feasibility of NBTXR3 intratumoral injection when added to low-dose weekly cisplatin-containing CCRT for patients with locally advanced or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The study also aimed to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)  however the RP2D was not determined due to stoppage of the phase 1b part of the trial resulting from the conclusion of the collaboration between PEI and Nanobiotix in 2021.Adult patients with T3-4 LA-HNSCC suitable for cisplatin were eligible for the study and 12 such patients were enrolled. These patients received a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3  followed by a low-dose weekly regimen of CCRT. All 12 patients were deemed evaluable and all had stage 4 locally advanced disease.Of these evaluable patients  3  6  and 3 patients received NBTXR3 at the 5%  10%  and 15% dose levels  respectively. No serious adverse events (SAEs) inconsistent with what would normally be expected from a low-dose CCRT regimen were observed. Dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 increased ALT and grade 3 increased AST were observed in one patient at the 10% dose level. Common Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) observed across dose levels were stomatitis  decreased WBC  decreased appetite  decreased neutrophil count  and leukopenia. One patient experienced grade 4 hyponatremia.Preliminary efficacy results showed a disease control rate of 100%  with an overall response rate of 58.3% according to RECIST 1.1. The study concluded that adding a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 to weekly low dose cisplatin-containing CCRT was feasible and had a favorable safety profile for patients with LA-HNSCC.Strengthening Support for NBTXR3 in Combination with Chemoradiation in the Preoperative SettingColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer indication worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. One-third of CRCs appear in the rectum. For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC)  combined modality therapy with neoadjuvant CCRT  followed by total mesorectal excision (TME; surgery)  followed by adjuvant (post-operative) systemic chemotherapy is the current standard of care. The aim of the neoadjuvant portion of the treatment regimen is to control and downstage the disease to allow for R0 TME (surgical removal with a negative margin in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the primary tumor bed)  as clinical studies have shown a positive correlation between improved cancer-specific survival and R0 TME. While outcomes have improved  patients are still faced with a highly toxic treatment regimen that can lead to a lack of compliance which may hamper efficacy  along with deteriorated quality of life after treatment.Innovation with the potential to improve the rate of R0 resection without adding toxicity is an urgent need for this patient population.A Phase 1b/2 Study Evaluating NBTXR3 in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiation in the Neoadjuvant Setting for Patients with Locally Advanced or Unresectable Rectal CancerThis study  sponsored  executed  and presented by PEI  sought to evaluate safety  feasibility  and early signs of efficacy for neoadjuvant NBTXR3 combined with CCRT followed by surgery for patients with locally advanced or unresectable rectal cancer. The study established the recommended phase 2 dose of NBTXR3 at 22% of gross tumor volume  however the phase 2 part of the trial was stopped as a result of the conclusion of the collaboration between PEI and Nanobiotix in 2021. Adult and older patients with T3-T4 locally advanced or unresectable rectal cancer suitable for chemoradiation were eligible for the study and 32 such patients were enrolled. These patients received a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3  followed by a weekly regimen of CCRT. 31 of 32 patients were deemed evaluable and none of the evaluable patients had tumors eligible for surgery at the time of diagnosis.Of the 31 evaluable patients  6  4  3  and 18 patients received NBTXR3 at the 5%  10%  15%  and 22% dose levels  respectively. No NBTXR3-related SAEs or grade ≥ 3 AEs were observed. The most frequently reported AEs were grade 1 or 2 decreased WBC  diarrhea  increased CRP  UTI  and decreased lymphocyte count which were all consistent with what would normally be expected from CCRT.Preliminary efficacy results showed a disease control rate of 100%  with an overall response rate of 35.5% according to RECIST 1.1. Pathological tumor downstaging was observed in 14 of 31 patients after therapy  25 patients underwent surgery  and 96% of those patients achieved R0 surgical margins. Pathological complete response was observed in 20% of the patients who received surgery. The study concluded that a single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 in combination with CCRT is feasible and has a favorable safety profile in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with locally advanced or unresectable rectal adenocarcinoma.***About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy.

Changes to entries on the relevant register of securities after that time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. Appointment of proxies If you are a member of the Company at the time set out in note 1 above  you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to speak and vote at the meeting and you should have received a proxy form with this notice of meeting. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company however  we encourage shareholders to appoint the Chair of the meeting as proxy. This will ensure that your vote will be counted even though physical attendance at the meeting is prohibited . Details of how to appoint the Chairman of the meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the meeting you must appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to the relevant person. Details of how to appoint the Chairman of the meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the meeting you must appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to the relevant person. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy  you must complete a separate proxy form for each proxy and specify against the proxy's name the number of shares over which the proxy has rights. If you are in any doubt as to the procedure to be followed for the purpose of appointing more than one proxy you must contact the Company's Registrars  Link Group  on 0371 664 0300 calls are charged at the standard geographic rate and will vary by provider.

If you fail to specify the number of shares to which each proxy relates  or specify a number of shares greater than that held by you on the record date  your proxy appointments will be invalid. A vote withheld is not a vote in law  which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting indication is given  your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at their discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as they think fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting. Appointment of proxy through CREST 7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Meeting and any adjournment thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST manual. The CREST manual can be found at www.euroclear.com. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ""CREST proxy instruction"") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited's (""EUI"") specification and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST manual. All messages regarding the appointment of a proxy or an instruction to a previously appointed proxy must be transmitted so as to be received by Link Group (ID RA10) by no later than 10.30 a.m. BST 24th June 2022. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will apply in relation to the input of CREST proxy instructions. It is therefore the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. 3 Appointment of proxy using hard copy proxy The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy how to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote.

Termination of proxy appointments In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company by sending a signed hard copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to the Company's Registrars as indicated in note 7 above. In the case of a member which is a company  the revocation notice must be signed on its behalf by an officer or agent of the company so authorised.

The table illustrates the Payment at Maturity of the Notes (excluding the final Contingent Coupon and any unpaid Contingent Coupons  if payable) for a hypothetical range of performance for the Reference Stock  assuming the following terms and that the Notes are not automatically called prior to maturity:Hypothetical Initial Stock Price: $100.00* Hypothetical Trigger Price and Coupon Barrier: $55.00  which is 55% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Rate: 10.75% per annum (or 2.6875% per quarter)  which is the midpoint of the Contingent Coupon Rate range set forth above. Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Amount: $26.875 per quarter Observation Dates: Quarterly Principal Amount: $1 000 per Note* The hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $100 used in the examples below has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the expected actual Initial Stock Price. The actual Initial Stock Price will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Prices are shown in the first column on the left. The second column shows the Payment at Maturity for a range of Final Stock Prices on the Valuation Date. The third column shows the amount of cash to be paid on the Notes per $1 000 in principal amount. If the Notes are called prior to maturity  the hypothetical examples below will not be relevant  and you will receive on the applicable Coupon Payment Date  for each $1 000 principal amount  $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon(s) otherwise due on the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Price Payment at Maturity as Percentage of Principal Amount Cash Payment Amount per $1 000 in Principal Amount $180.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $170.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $160.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $150.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $140.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $125.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $120.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $110.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $100.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $90.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $80.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $70.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $60.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $55.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $54.99 54.99% $549.90 $50.00 50.00% $500.00 $40.00 40.00% $400.00 $30.00 30.00% $300.00 $20.00 20.00% $200.00 $10.00 10.00% $100.00 $0.00 0.00% $0.00* Excluding the final Contingent Coupon and any unpaid Contingent Coupons  if payable.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponHypothetical Examples of Amounts Payable at MaturityThe following hypothetical examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated  assuming the Notes have not been called.Example 1: The price of the Reference Stock increases by 25% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $125.00. Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes (and any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons)  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 25% appreciation in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 2: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 10% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $90.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes (and any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons)  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 10% decline in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 3: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 60% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $40.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the final Contingent Coupon will not be payable on the Maturity Date  and we will pay only $400.00 for each $1 000 in the principal amount of the Notes  calculated as follows:Principal Amount + (Principal Amount x Reference Stock Return)= $1 000 + ($1 000 x -60.00%) = $1 000 - $600.00 = $400.00* * *The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on theoretical prices of the Reference Stock that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payments at Maturity shown above  and those amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Stock. These risks are explained in more detail in the section “Risk Factors” in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes• You May Lose All or a Portion of the Principal Amount at Maturity — Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the trading price of the Reference Stock between the Trade Date and the Valuation Date. If the Notes are not automatically called and the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price  the amount that you receive at maturity will represent a loss of your principal that is proportionate to the decline in the closing price of the Reference Stock from the Trade Date to the Valuation Date. Any Contingent Coupons received on the Notes prior to the Maturity Date may not be sufficient to compensate for any such loss.• The Notes Are Subject to an Automatic Call — If on any Observation Date beginning in December 2022  the closing price of the Reference Stock is greater than or equal to the Call Stock Price  then the Notes will be automatically called. If the Notes are automatically called  then  on the applicable Call Settlement Date  for each $1 000 in principal amount  you will receive $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the applicable Call Settlement Date (together with any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons). You will not receive any Contingent Coupons after the Call Settlement Date. You may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the automatic call in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been called.• You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupons — We will not necessarily make any coupon payments on the Notes. If the closing price of the Reference Stock on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier  we will not pay you the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date. If the closing price of the Reference Stock is less than the Coupon Barrier on each of the Observation Dates and on the Valuation Date  we will not pay you any Contingent Coupons during the term of  and you will not receive a positive return on your Notes. Generally  this non-payment of the Contingent Coupon coincides with a period of greater risk of principal loss on your Notes. Accordingly  if we do not pay the Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date  you will also incur a loss of principal  because the Final Stock Price will be less than the Trigger Price. Notwithstanding the memory coupon feature of the Notes  it is possible that any unpaid Contingent Coupons will remain unpaid for the remaining term of the Notes.• The Call Feature and the Contingent Coupon Feature Limit Your Potential Return — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified Contingent Coupon Rate  regardless of the appreciation of the Reference Stock. In addition  the total return on the Notes will vary based on the number of Observation Dates on which the Contingent Coupon becomes payable prior to maturity or an automatic call. Further  if the Notes are called due to the Call Feature  you will not receive any Contingent Coupons or any other payment in respect of any Observation Dates after the applicable Call Settlement Date. Since the Notes could be called as early as the second Observation Date  the total return on the Notes could be minimal. If the Notes are not called  you may be subject to the full downside performance of the Reference Stock even though your potential return is limited to the Contingent Coupon Rate. As a result  the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in the Reference Stock.• Your Return on the Notes May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity — The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.• Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes — The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of any Contingent Coupons  if payable  and the amount due on any relevant payment date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on the applicable payment dates. This will be the case even ifAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponthe price of the Reference Stock increases after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at any time during the term of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes• There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes-Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses — There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any other affiliate of ours may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Less than the Price to the Public — The initial estimated value that will be set forth in the final pricing supplement for the Notes does not represent a minimum price at which we  RBCCM or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase the Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity  their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and the initial estimated value. This is due to  among other things  changes in the price of the Reference Stock  the borrowing rate we pay to issue securities of this kind  and the inclusion in the price to the public of the underwriting discount and the estimated costs relating to our hedging of the Notes. These factors  together with various credit  market and economic factors over the term of the Notes  are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell your Notes prior to maturity may be less than your original purchase price  as any such sale price would not be expected to include the underwriting discount and the hedging costs relating to the Notes. In addition to bid-ask spreads  the value of the Notes determined by RBCCM for any secondary market price is expected to be based on the secondary rate rather than the internal funding rate used to price the Notes and determine the initial estimated value. As a result  the secondary price will be less than if the internal funding rate was used. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly  you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes that We Will Provide in the Final Pricing Supplement Will Be an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Are Set — The initial estimated value of the Notes will be based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See “Structuring the Notes” below. Our estimate will be based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.The value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities• Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Stock that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders’ interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the share price of the Reference Stock  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with the Reference Stock Issuer  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could includeAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponinvestment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates’ obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Stock. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the share price of the Reference Stock  and  therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Stock• Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Reference Stock — The return on your Notes is unlikely to reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned shares of the Reference Stock. For instance  you will not receive or be entitled to receive any dividend payments or other distributions on the Reference Stock during the term of your Notes. As an owner of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or any other rights that holders of the Reference Stock may have. Furthermore  the Reference Stock may appreciate substantially during the term of the Notes  while your potential return will be limited to the applicable Contingent Coupon payments.• There Is No Affiliation Between the Reference Stock Issuer and RBCCM  and RBCCM Is Not Responsible for any Disclosure by the Reference Stock Issuer — We are not affiliated with the Reference Stock Issuer. However  we and our affiliates may currently  or from time to time in the future engage  in business with the Reference Stock Issuer. Nevertheless  neither we nor our affiliates assume any responsibilities for the accuracy or the completeness of any information that any other company prepares. You  as an investor in the Notes  should make your own investigation into the Reference Stock. The Reference Stock Issuer is not involved in this offering and has no obligation of any sort with respect to your Notes. The Reference Stock Issuer has no obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason  including when taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of your Notes.• The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments — The payment at maturity  each Observation Date and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see “General Terms of the Notes—Market Disruption Events” in the product prospectus supplement.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE STOCK ISSUERThe Reference Stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Companies with securities registered under that Act are required to file periodically certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information filed with the SEC can be obtained through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition  information regarding the Reference Stock may be obtained from other sources including  but not limited to  press releases  newspaper articles and other publicly disseminated documents.The following information regarding the Reference Stock Issuer is derived from publicly available information.We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of reports filed by the Reference Stock Issuer with the SEC  information published by it on its website or in any other format  information about it obtained from any other source or the information provided below.We obtained the information regarding the historical performance of the Reference Stock set forth below from Bloomberg Financial Markets.Best Buy Co.

The red line represents a hypothetical Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price of $44.69  which is equal to 55% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price (rounded to two decimal places). The actual Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price will be based on the closing price of the Reference Stock on the Trade Date.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSUPPLEMENTAL DISCUSSION OFU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCESThe following disclosure supplements  and to the extent inconsistent supersedes  the discussion in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”Under Section 871(m) of the Code  a “dividend equivalent” payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States. Such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (“ELIs”) that are “specified ELIs” may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference  directly or indirectly  an interest in an “underlying security ” which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However  the IRS has issued guidance that states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the effective dates of the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to provide that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1  2023. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments  if any  under the Notes. However  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Reference Stock or the Notes  and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter  or have entered  into other transactions in respect of the Reference Stock or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding  we (or the applicable withholding agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on or about June 17  2022  which is the third (3rd) business day following the Trade Date (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+3”). See “Plan of Distribution” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021. For additional information as to the relationship between us and RBCCM  please see the section “Plan of Distribution—Conflicts of Interest” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021.We expect to deliver the Notes on a date that is greater than two business days following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than two business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.In the initial offering of the Notes  they will be offered to investors at a purchase price equal to par  except with respect to certain accounts as indicated on the cover page of this document. In addition to the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page  we or one of our affiliates may also pay an expected fee to a broker-dealer that is unaffiliated with us for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.The value of the Notes shown on your account statement may be based on RBCCM’s estimate of the value of the Notes if RBCCM or another of our affiliates were to make a market in the Notes (which it is not obligated to do). That estimate will be based upon the price that RBCCM may pay for the Notes in light of then prevailing market conditions  our creditworthiness and transaction costs. For a period of approximately 6 months after the issue date of the Notes  the value of the Notes that may be shown on your account statement may be higher than RBCCM’s estimated value of the Notes at that time. This is because the estimated value of the Notes will not include the underwriting discount and our hedging costs and profits; however  the value of the Notes shown on your account statement during that period may initially be a higher amount  reflecting the addition of RBCCM’s underwriting discount and our estimated costs and profits from hedging the Notes. This excess is expected to decrease over time until the end of this period. After this period  if RBCCM repurchases your Notes  it expects to do so at prices that reflect their estimated value.We may use this terms supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  RBCCM or another of our affiliates may use this terms supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this terms supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.STRUCTURING THE NOTESThe Notes are our debt securities  the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Stock. As is the case for all of our debt securities  including our structured notes  the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition  because structured notes result in increased operational  funding and liability management costs to us  we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity. Using this relatively lower implied borrowing rate rather than the secondary market rate  is a factor that is likely to reduce the initial estimated value of the Notes at the time their terms are set. Unlike the estimated value that will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement  any value of the Notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction may be based on a different funding rate  which may result in a lower value for the Notes than if our initial internal funding rate were used.In order to satisfy our payment obligations under the Notes  we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options  put options or other derivatives) on the issue date with RBCCM or one of our other subsidiaries. The terms of these hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors  including our creditworthiness  interest rate movements  the volatility of the Reference Stock  and the tenor of the Notes. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.The lower implied borrowing rate is a factor that reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you. The initial offering price of the Notes also reflects the underwriting commission and our estimated hedging costs. These factors result in the initialAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponestimated value for the Notes on the Trade Date being less than their public offering price.

The table illustrates the Payment at Maturity of the Notes (excluding the final Contingent Coupon and any unpaid Contingent Coupons  if payable) for a hypothetical range of performance for the Reference Stock  assuming the following terms and that the Notes are not automatically called prior to maturity:Hypothetical Initial Stock Price: $100.00*Hypothetical Trigger Price and Coupon Barrier: $55.00  which is 55% of the hypothetical Initial Stock PriceHypothetical Contingent Coupon Rate: 11.25% per annum (or 2.8125% per quarter)  which is the midpoint of the Contingent Coupon Rate range set forth above.Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Amount: $28.125 per quarterObservation Dates: QuarterlyPrincipal Amount: $1 000 per Note* The hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $100 used in the examples below has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the expected actual Initial Stock Price. The actual Initial Stock Price will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Prices are shown in the first column on the left. The second column shows the Payment at Maturity for a range of Final Stock Prices on the Valuation Date. The third column shows the amount of cash to be paid on the Notes per $1 000 in principal amount. If the Notes are called prior to maturity  the hypothetical examples below will not be relevant  and you will receive on the applicable Coupon Payment Date  for each $1 000 principal amount  $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon(s) otherwise due on the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Price Payment at Maturity as Percentage of Principal Amount Cash Payment Amount per $1 000 in Principal Amount $180.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $170.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $160.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $150.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $140.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $125.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $120.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $110.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $100.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $90.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $80.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $70.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $60.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $55.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $54.99 54.99% $549.90 $50.00 50.00% $500.00 $40.00 40.00% $400.00 $30.00 30.00% $300.00 $20.00 20.00% $200.00 $10.00 10.00% $100.00 $0.00 0.00% $0.00* Excluding the final Contingent Coupon and any unpaid Contingent Coupons  if payable.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponHypothetical Examples of Amounts Payable at MaturityThe following hypothetical examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated  assuming the Notes have not been called.Example 1: The price of the Reference Stock increases by 25% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $125.00. Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes (and any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons)  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 25% appreciation in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 2: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 10% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $90.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes (and any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons)  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 10% decline in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 3: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 60% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $40.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the final Contingent Coupon will not be payable on the Maturity Date  and we will pay only $400.00 for each $1 000 in the principal amount of the Notes  calculated as follows:Principal Amount + (Principal Amount x Reference Stock Return)= $1 000 + ($1 000 x -60.00%) = $1 000 - $600.00 = $400.00* * *The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on theoretical prices of the Reference Stock that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payments at Maturity shown above  and those amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Stock. These risks are explained in more detail in the section “Risk Factors” in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes• You May Lose All or a Portion of the Principal Amount at Maturity — Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the trading price of the Reference Stock between the Trade Date and the Valuation Date. If the Notes are not automatically called and the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price  the amount that you receive at maturity will represent a loss of your principal that is proportionate to the decline in the closing price of the Reference Stock from the Trade Date to the Valuation Date. Any Contingent Coupons received on the Notes prior to the Maturity Date may not be sufficient to compensate for any such loss.• The Notes Are Subject to an Automatic Call — If on any Observation Date beginning in December 2022  the closing price of the Reference Stock is greater than or equal to the Call Stock Price  then the Notes will be automatically called. If the Notes are automatically called  then  on the applicable Call Settlement Date  for each $1 000 in principal amount  you will receive $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the applicable Call Settlement Date (together with any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons). You will not receive any Contingent Coupons after the Call Settlement Date. You may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the automatic call in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been called.• You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupons — We will not necessarily make any coupon payments on the Notes. If the closing price of the Reference Stock on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier  we will not pay you the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date. If the closing price of the Reference Stock is less than the Coupon Barrier on each of the Observation Dates and on the Valuation Date  we will not pay you any Contingent Coupons during the term of  and you will not receive a positive return on your Notes. Generally  this non-payment of the Contingent Coupon coincides with a period of greater risk of principal loss on your Notes. Accordingly  if we do not pay the Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date  you will also incur a loss of principal  because the Final Stock Price will be less than the Trigger Price. Notwithstanding the memory coupon feature of the Notes  it is possible that any unpaid Contingent Coupons will remain unpaid for the remaining term of the Notes.• The Call Feature and the Contingent Coupon Feature Limit Your Potential Return — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified Contingent Coupon Rate  regardless of the appreciation of the Reference Stock. In addition  the total return on the Notes will vary based on the number of Observation Dates on which the Contingent Coupon becomes payable prior to maturity or an automatic call. Further  if the Notes are called due to the Call Feature  you will not receive any Contingent Coupons or any other payment in respect of any Observation Dates after the applicable Call Settlement Date. Since the Notes could be called as early as the second Observation Date  the total return on the Notes could be minimal. If the Notes are not called  you may be subject to the full downside performance of the Reference Stock even though your potential return is limited to the Contingent Coupon Rate. As a result  the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in the Reference Stock.• Your Return on the Notes May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity — The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.• Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes — The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of any Contingent Coupons  if payable  and the amount due on any relevant payment date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on the applicable payment dates. This will be the case even ifAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponthe price of the Reference Stock increases after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at any time during the term of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes• There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes-Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses — There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any other affiliate of ours may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Less than the Price to the Public — The initial estimated value that will be set forth in the final pricing supplement for the Notes does not represent a minimum price at which we  RBCCM or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase the Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity  their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and the initial estimated value. This is due to  among other things  changes in the price of the Reference Stock  the borrowing rate we pay to issue securities of this kind  and the inclusion in the price to the public of the underwriting discount and the estimated costs relating to our hedging of the Notes. These factors  together with various credit  market and economic factors over the term of the Notes  are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell your Notes prior to maturity may be less than your original purchase price  as any such sale price would not be expected to include the underwriting discount and the hedging costs relating to the Notes. In addition to bid-ask spreads  the value of the Notes determined by RBCCM for any secondary market price is expected to be based on the secondary rate rather than the internal funding rate used to price the Notes and determine the initial estimated value. As a result  the secondary price will be less than if the internal funding rate was used. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly  you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes that We Will Provide in the Final Pricing Supplement Will Be an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Are Set — The initial estimated value of the Notes will be based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See “Structuring the Notes” below. Our estimate will be based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.The value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities• Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Stock that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders’ interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the share price of the Reference Stock  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with the Reference Stock Issuer  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could includeAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponinvestment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates’ obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Stock. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the share price of the Reference Stock  and  therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Stock• Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Reference Stock — The return on your Notes is unlikely to reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned shares of the Reference Stock. For instance  you will not receive or be entitled to receive any dividend payments or other distributions on the Reference Stock during the term of your Notes. As an owner of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or any other rights that holders of the Reference Stock may have. Furthermore  the Reference Stock may appreciate substantially during the term of the Notes  while your potential return will be limited to the applicable Contingent Coupon payments.• There Is No Affiliation Between the Reference Stock Issuer and RBCCM  and RBCCM Is Not Responsible for any Disclosure by the Reference Stock Issuer — We are not affiliated with the Reference Stock Issuer. However  we and our affiliates may currently  or from time to time in the future engage  in business with the Reference Stock Issuer. Nevertheless  neither we nor our affiliates assume any responsibilities for the accuracy or the completeness of any information that any other company prepares. You  as an investor in the Notes  should make your own investigation into the Reference Stock. The Reference Stock Issuer is not involved in this offering and has no obligation of any sort with respect to your Notes. The Reference Stock Issuer has no obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason  including when taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of your Notes.• The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments — The payment at maturity  each Observation Date and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see “General Terms of the Notes—Market Disruption Events” in the product prospectus supplement.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE STOCK ISSUERThe Reference Stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Companies with securities registered under that Act are required to file periodically certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information filed with the SEC can be obtained through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition  information regarding the Reference Stock may be obtained from other sources including  but not limited to  press releases  newspaper articles and other publicly disseminated documents.The following information regarding the Reference Stock Issuer is derived from publicly available information.We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of reports filed by the Reference Stock Issuer with the SEC  information published by it on its website or in any other format  information about it obtained from any other source or the information provided below.We obtained the information regarding the historical performance of the Reference Stock set forth below from Bloomberg Financial Markets.Ford Motor CompanyFord Motor Company designs  manufactures  markets and services a range of trucks  cars  sport utility vehicles  electrified vehicles  and luxury vehicles. The company operates through three segments: automotive  mobility and credit.The company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “F.”Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponHistorical InformationThe graph below illustrates the performance of the Reference Stock from January 1  2012 to June 3  2022  reflecting a hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $13.50  which was its closing price on June 3  2022. The red line represents a hypothetical Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price of $7.43  which is equal to 55% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price (rounded to two decimal places). The actual Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price will be based on the closing price of the Reference Stock on the Trade Date.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSUPPLEMENTAL DISCUSSION OFU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCESThe following disclosure supplements  and to the extent inconsistent supersedes  the discussion in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”Under Section 871(m) of the Code  a “dividend equivalent” payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States. Such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (“ELIs”) that are “specified ELIs” may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference  directly or indirectly  an interest in an “underlying security ” which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However  the IRS has issued guidance that states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the effective dates of the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to provide that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1  2023. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments  if any  under the Notes. However  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Reference Stock or the Notes  and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter  or have entered  into other transactions in respect of the Reference Stock or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding  we (or the applicable withholding agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on or about June 17  2022  which is the third (3rd) business day following the Trade Date (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+3”). See “Plan of Distribution” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021. For additional information as to the relationship between us and RBCCM  please see the section “Plan of Distribution—Conflicts of Interest” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021.We expect to deliver the Notes on a date that is greater than two business days following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than two business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.In the initial offering of the Notes  they will be offered to investors at a purchase price equal to par  except with respect to certain accounts as indicated on the cover page of this document. In addition to the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page  we or one of our affiliates may also pay an expected fee to a broker-dealer that is unaffiliated with us for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.The value of the Notes shown on your account statement may be based on RBCCM’s estimate of the value of the Notes if RBCCM or another of our affiliates were to make a market in the Notes (which it is not obligated to do). That estimate will be based upon the price that RBCCM may pay for the Notes in light of then prevailing market conditions  our creditworthiness and transaction costs. For a period of approximately 6 months after the issue date of the Notes  the value of the Notes that may be shown on your account statement may be higher than RBCCM’s estimated value of the Notes at that time. This is because the estimated value of the Notes will not include the underwriting discount and our hedging costs and profits; however  the value of the Notes shown on your account statement during that period may initially be a higher amount  reflecting the addition of RBCCM's underwriting discount and our estimated costs and profits from hedging the Notes. This excess is expected to decrease over time until the end of this period. After this period  if RBCCM repurchases your Notes  it expects to do so at prices that reflect their estimated value.We may use this terms supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  RBCCM or another of our affiliates may use this terms supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this terms supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSTRUCTURING THE NOTESThe Notes are our debt securities  the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Stock. As is the case for all of our debt securities  including our structured notes  the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition  because structured notes result in increased operational  funding and liability management costs to us  we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity. Using this relatively lower implied borrowing rate rather than the secondary market rate  is a factor that is likely to reduce the initial estimated value of the Notes at the time their terms are set. Unlike the estimated value that will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement  any value of the Notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction may be based on a different funding rate  which may result in a lower value for the Notes than if our initial internal funding rate were used.In order to satisfy our payment obligations under the Notes  we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options  put options or other derivatives) on the issue date with RBCCM or one of our other subsidiaries. The terms of these hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors  including our creditworthiness  interest rate movements  the volatility of the Reference Stock  and the tenor of the Notes. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.The lower implied borrowing rate is a factor that reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you. The initial offering price of the Notes also reflects the underwriting commission and our estimated hedging costs. These factors result in the initial estimated value for the Notes on the Trade Date being less than their public offering price.

The table illustrates the Payment at Maturity of the Notes (excluding the final Contingent Coupon and any unpaid Contingent Coupons  if payable) for a hypothetical range of performance for the Reference Stock  assuming the following terms and that the Notes are not automatically called prior to maturity:Hypothetical Initial Stock Price: $100.00* Hypothetical Trigger Price and Coupon Barrier: $55.00  which is 55% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Rate: 10.75% per annum (or 2.6875% per quarter)  which is the midpoint of the Contingent Coupon Rate range set forth above. Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Amount: $26.875 per quarter Observation Dates: Quarterly Principal Amount: $1 000 per Note* The hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $100 used in the examples below has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the expected actual Initial Stock Price. The actual Initial Stock Price will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Prices are shown in the first column on the left. The second column shows the Payment at Maturity for a range of Final Stock Prices on the Valuation Date. The third column shows the amount of cash to be paid on the Notes per $1 000 in principal amount. If the Notes are called prior to maturity  the hypothetical examples below will not be relevant  and you will receive on the applicable Coupon Payment Date  for each $1 000 principal amount  $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon(s) otherwise due on the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Price Payment at Maturity as Percentage of Principal Amount Cash Payment Amount per $1 000 in Principal Amount $180.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $170.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $160.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $150.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $140.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $125.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $120.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $110.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $100.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $90.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $80.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $70.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $60.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $55.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $54.99 54.99% $549.90 $50.00 50.00% $500.00 $40.00 40.00% $400.00 $30.00 30.00% $300.00 $20.00 20.00% $200.00 $10.00 10.00% $100.00 $0.00 0.00% $0.00* Excluding the final Contingent Coupon and any unpaid Contingent Coupons  if payable.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponHypothetical Examples of Amounts Payable at MaturityThe following hypothetical examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated  assuming the Notes have not been called.Example 1: The price of the Reference Stock increases by 25% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $125.00. Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes (and any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons)  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 25% appreciation in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 2: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 10% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $90.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes (and any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons)  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 10% decline in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 3: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 60% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $40.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the final Contingent Coupon will not be payable on the Maturity Date  and we will pay only $400.00 for each $1 000 in the principal amount of the Notes  calculated as follows:Principal Amount + (Principal Amount x Reference Stock Return)= $1 000 + ($1 000 x -60.00%) = $1 000 - $600.00 = $400.00* * *The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on theoretical prices of the Reference Stock that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payments at Maturity shown above  and those amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Stock. These risks are explained in more detail in the section “Risk Factors” in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes• You May Lose All or a Portion of the Principal Amount at Maturity — Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the trading price of the Reference Stock between the Trade Date and the Valuation Date. If the Notes are not automatically called and the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price  the amount that you receive at maturity will represent a loss of your principal that is proportionate to the decline in the closing price of the Reference Stock from the Trade Date to the Valuation Date. Any Contingent Coupons received on the Notes prior to the Maturity Date may not be sufficient to compensate for any such loss.• The Notes Are Subject to an Automatic Call — If on any Observation Date beginning in December 2022  the closing price of the Reference Stock is greater than or equal to the Call Stock Price  then the Notes will be automatically called. If the Notes are automatically called  then  on the applicable Call Settlement Date  for each $1 000 in principal amount  you will receive $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the applicable Call Settlement Date (together with any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons). You will not receive any Contingent Coupons after the Call Settlement Date. You may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the automatic call in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been called.• You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupons — We will not necessarily make any coupon payments on the Notes. If the closing price of the Reference Stock on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier  we will not pay you the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date. If the closing price of the Reference Stock is less than the Coupon Barrier on each of the Observation Dates and on the Valuation Date  we will not pay you any Contingent Coupons during the term of  and you will not receive a positive return on your Notes. Generally  this non-payment of the Contingent Coupon coincides with a period of greater risk of principal loss on your Notes. Accordingly  if we do not pay the Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date  you will also incur a loss of principal  because the Final Stock Price will be less than the Trigger Price. Notwithstanding the memory coupon feature of the Notes  it is possible that any unpaid Contingent Coupons will remain unpaid for the remaining term of the Notes.• The Call Feature and the Contingent Coupon Feature Limit Your Potential Return — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified Contingent Coupon Rate  regardless of the appreciation of the Reference Stock. In addition  the total return on the Notes will vary based on the number of Observation Dates on which the Contingent Coupon becomes payable prior to maturity or an automatic call. Further  if the Notes are called due to the Call Feature  you will not receive any Contingent Coupons or any other payment in respect of any Observation Dates after the applicable Call Settlement Date. Since the Notes could be called as early as the second Observation Date  the total return on the Notes could be minimal. If the Notes are not called  you may be subject to the full downside performance of the Reference Stock even though your potential return is limited to the Contingent Coupon Rate. As a result  the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in the Reference Stock.• Your Return on the Notes May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity — The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.• Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes — The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of any Contingent Coupons  if payable  and the amount due on any relevant payment date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on the applicable payment dates. This will be the case even ifAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponthe price of the Reference Stock increases after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at any time during the term of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes• There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes-Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses — There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any other affiliate of ours may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Less than the Price to the Public — The initial estimated value that will be set forth in the final pricing supplement for the Notes does not represent a minimum price at which we  RBCCM or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase the Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity  their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and the initial estimated value. This is due to  among other things  changes in the price of the Reference Stock  the borrowing rate we pay to issue securities of this kind  and the inclusion in the price to the public of the underwriting discount and the estimated costs relating to our hedging of the Notes. These factors  together with various credit  market and economic factors over the term of the Notes  are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell your Notes prior to maturity may be less than your original purchase price  as any such sale price would not be expected to include the underwriting discount and the hedging costs relating to the Notes. In addition to bid-ask spreads  the value of the Notes determined by RBCCM for any secondary market price is expected to be based on the secondary rate rather than the internal funding rate used to price the Notes and determine the initial estimated value. As a result  the secondary price will be less than if the internal funding rate was used. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly  you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes that We Will Provide in the Final Pricing Supplement Will Be an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Are Set — The initial estimated value of the Notes will be based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See “Structuring the Notes” below. Our estimate will be based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.The value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities• Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Stock that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders’ interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the share price of the Reference Stock  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with the Reference Stock Issuer  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could includeAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponinvestment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates’ obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Stock. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the share price of the Reference Stock  and  therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Stock• Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Reference Stock — The return on your Notes is unlikely to reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned shares of the Reference Stock. For instance  you will not receive or be entitled to receive any dividend payments or other distributions on the Reference Stock during the term of your Notes. As an owner of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or any other rights that holders of the Reference Stock may have. Furthermore  the Reference Stock may appreciate substantially during the term of the Notes  while your potential return will be limited to the applicable Contingent Coupon payments.• There Is No Affiliation Between the Reference Stock Issuer and RBCCM  and RBCCM Is Not Responsible for any Disclosure by the Reference Stock Issuer — We are not affiliated with the Reference Stock Issuer. However  we and our affiliates may currently  or from time to time in the future engage  in business with the Reference Stock Issuer. Nevertheless  neither we nor our affiliates assume any responsibilities for the accuracy or the completeness of any information that any other company prepares. You  as an investor in the Notes  should make your own investigation into the Reference Stock. The Reference Stock Issuer is not involved in this offering and has no obligation of any sort with respect to your Notes. The Reference Stock Issuer has no obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason  including when taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of your Notes.• The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments — The payment at maturity  each Observation Date and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see “General Terms of the Notes—Market Disruption Events” in the product prospectus supplement.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE STOCK ISSUERThe Reference Stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Companies with securities registered under that Act are required to file periodically certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information filed with the SEC can be obtained through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition  information regarding the Reference Stock may be obtained from other sources including  but not limited to  press releases  newspaper articles and other publicly disseminated documents.The following information regarding the Reference Stock Issuer is derived from publicly available information.We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of reports filed by the Reference Stock Issuer with the SEC  information published by it on its website or in any other format  information about it obtained from any other source or the information provided below.We obtained the information regarding the historical performance of the Reference Stock set forth below from Bloomberg Financial Markets.Best Buy Co.  Inc.Best Buy Co.  Inc. retails consumer electronics  home office products  entertainment software  appliances and related services online and through its retail stores.The company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BBY.”Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponHistorical InformationThe graph below illustrates the performance of the Reference Stock from January 1  2012 to June 2  2022  reflecting a hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $81.26  which was its closing price on June 2  2022. The red line represents a hypothetical Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price of $44.69  which is equal to 55% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price (rounded to two decimal places). The actual Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price will be based on the closing price of the Reference Stock on the Trade Date.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSUPPLEMENTAL DISCUSSION OFU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCESThe following disclosure supplements  and to the extent inconsistent supersedes  the discussion in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”Under Section 871(m) of the Code  a “dividend equivalent” payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States. Such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (“ELIs”) that are “specified ELIs” may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference  directly or indirectly  an interest in an “underlying security ” which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However  the IRS has issued guidance that states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the effective dates of the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to provide that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1  2023. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments  if any  under the Notes. However  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Reference Stock or the Notes  and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter  or have entered  into other transactions in respect of the Reference Stock or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding  we (or the applicable withholding agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on or about June 17  2022  which is the third (3rd) business day following the Trade Date (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+3”). See “Plan of Distribution” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021. For additional information as to the relationship between us and RBCCM  please see the section “Plan of Distribution—Conflicts of Interest” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021.We expect to deliver the Notes on a date that is greater than two business days following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than two business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.In the initial offering of the Notes  they will be offered to investors at a purchase price equal to par  except with respect to certain accounts as indicated on the cover page of this document. In addition to the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page  we or one of our affiliates may also pay an expected fee to a broker-dealer that is unaffiliated with us for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.The value of the Notes shown on your account statement may be based on RBCCM’s estimate of the value of the Notes if RBCCM or another of our affiliates were to make a market in the Notes (which it is not obligated to do). That estimate will be based upon the price that RBCCM may pay for the Notes in light of then prevailing market conditions  our creditworthiness and transaction costs. For a period of approximately 6 months after the issue date of the Notes  the value of the Notes that may be shown on your account statement may be higher than RBCCM’s estimated value of the Notes at that time. This is because the estimated value of the Notes will not include the underwriting discount and our hedging costs and profits; however  the value of the Notes shown on your account statement during that period may initially be a higher amount  reflecting the addition of RBCCM’s underwriting discount and our estimated costs and profits from hedging the Notes. This excess is expected to decrease over time until the end of this period. After this period  if RBCCM repurchases your Notes  it expects to do so at prices that reflect their estimated value.We may use this terms supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  RBCCM or another of our affiliates may use this terms supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this terms supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.STRUCTURING THE NOTESThe Notes are our debt securities  the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Stock. As is the case for all of our debt securities  including our structured notes  the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition  because structured notes result in increased operational  funding and liability management costs to us  we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity. Using this relatively lower implied borrowing rate rather than the secondary market rate  is a factor that is likely to reduce the initial estimated value of the Notes at the time their terms are set. Unlike the estimated value that will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement  any value of the Notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction may be based on a different funding rate  which may result in a lower value for the Notes than if our initial internal funding rate were used.In order to satisfy our payment obligations under the Notes  we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options  put options or other derivatives) on the issue date with RBCCM or one of our other subsidiaries. The terms of these hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors  including our creditworthiness  interest rate movements  the volatility of the Reference Stock  and the tenor of the Notes. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.The lower implied borrowing rate is a factor that reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you. The initial offering price of the Notes also reflects the underwriting commission and our estimated hedging costs. These factors result in the initialAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponestimated value for the Notes on the Trade Date being less than their public offering price.

However  the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in the Notes are uncertain and the Internal Revenue Service could assert that the Notes should be taxed in a manner that is different from that described in the preceding sentence. Please see the section below  “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences ” and the discussion (including the opinion of Ashurst LLP  our special U.S. tax counsel) in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences ” which apply to the Notes.

The table illustrates the Payment at Maturity of the Notes (excluding the final Contingent Coupon and any unpaid Contingent Coupons  if payable) for a hypothetical range of performance for the Reference Stock  assuming the following terms and that the Notes are not automatically called prior to maturity:Hypothetical Initial Stock Price: $100.00*Hypothetical Trigger Price and Coupon Barrier: $55.00  which is 55% of the hypothetical Initial Stock PriceHypothetical Contingent Coupon Rate: 11.25% per annum (or 2.8125% per quarter)  which is the midpoint of the Contingent Coupon Rate range set forth above.Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Amount: $28.125 per quarterObservation Dates: QuarterlyPrincipal Amount: $1 000 per Note* The hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $100 used in the examples below has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the expected actual Initial Stock Price. The actual Initial Stock Price will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Prices are shown in the first column on the left. The second column shows the Payment at Maturity for a range of Final Stock Prices on the Valuation Date. The third column shows the amount of cash to be paid on the Notes per $1 000 in principal amount. If the Notes are called prior to maturity  the hypothetical examples below will not be relevant  and you will receive on the applicable Coupon Payment Date  for each $1 000 principal amount  $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon(s) otherwise due on the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Price Payment at Maturity as Percentage of Principal Amount Cash Payment Amount per $1 000 in Principal Amount $180.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $170.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $160.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $150.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $140.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $125.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $120.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $110.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $100.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $90.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $80.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $70.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $60.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $55.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $54.99 54.99% $549.90 $50.00 50.00% $500.00 $40.00 40.00% $400.00 $30.00 30.00% $300.00 $20.00 20.00% $200.00 $10.00 10.00% $100.00 $0.00 0.00% $0.00* Excluding the final Contingent Coupon and any unpaid Contingent Coupons  if payable.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponHypothetical Examples of Amounts Payable at MaturityThe following hypothetical examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated  assuming the Notes have not been called.Example 1: The price of the Reference Stock increases by 25% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $125.00. Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes (and any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons)  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 25% appreciation in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 2: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 10% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $90.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes (and any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons)  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 10% decline in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 3: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 60% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $40.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the final Contingent Coupon will not be payable on the Maturity Date  and we will pay only $400.00 for each $1 000 in the principal amount of the Notes  calculated as follows:Principal Amount + (Principal Amount x Reference Stock Return)= $1 000 + ($1 000 x -60.00%) = $1 000 - $600.00 = $400.00* * *The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on theoretical prices of the Reference Stock that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payments at Maturity shown above  and those amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Stock. These risks are explained in more detail in the section “Risk Factors” in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes• You May Lose All or a Portion of the Principal Amount at Maturity — Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the trading price of the Reference Stock between the Trade Date and the Valuation Date. If the Notes are not automatically called and the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price  the amount that you receive at maturity will represent a loss of your principal that is proportionate to the decline in the closing price of the Reference Stock from the Trade Date to the Valuation Date. Any Contingent Coupons received on the Notes prior to the Maturity Date may not be sufficient to compensate for any such loss.• The Notes Are Subject to an Automatic Call — If on any Observation Date beginning in December 2022  the closing price of the Reference Stock is greater than or equal to the Call Stock Price  then the Notes will be automatically called. If the Notes are automatically called  then  on the applicable Call Settlement Date  for each $1 000 in principal amount  you will receive $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the applicable Call Settlement Date (together with any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons). You will not receive any Contingent Coupons after the Call Settlement Date. You may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the automatic call in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been called.• You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupons — We will not necessarily make any coupon payments on the Notes. If the closing price of the Reference Stock on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier  we will not pay you the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date. If the closing price of the Reference Stock is less than the Coupon Barrier on each of the Observation Dates and on the Valuation Date  we will not pay you any Contingent Coupons during the term of  and you will not receive a positive return on your Notes. Generally  this non-payment of the Contingent Coupon coincides with a period of greater risk of principal loss on your Notes. Accordingly  if we do not pay the Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date  you will also incur a loss of principal  because the Final Stock Price will be less than the Trigger Price. Notwithstanding the memory coupon feature of the Notes  it is possible that any unpaid Contingent Coupons will remain unpaid for the remaining term of the Notes.• The Call Feature and the Contingent Coupon Feature Limit Your Potential Return — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified Contingent Coupon Rate  regardless of the appreciation of the Reference Stock. In addition  the total return on the Notes will vary based on the number of Observation Dates on which the Contingent Coupon becomes payable prior to maturity or an automatic call. Further  if the Notes are called due to the Call Feature  you will not receive any Contingent Coupons or any other payment in respect of any Observation Dates after the applicable Call Settlement Date. Since the Notes could be called as early as the second Observation Date  the total return on the Notes could be minimal. If the Notes are not called  you may be subject to the full downside performance of the Reference Stock even though your potential return is limited to the Contingent Coupon Rate. As a result  the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in the Reference Stock.• Your Return on the Notes May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity — The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.• Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes — The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of any Contingent Coupons  if payable  and the amount due on any relevant payment date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on the applicable payment dates. This will be the case even ifAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponthe price of the Reference Stock increases after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at any time during the term of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes• There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes-Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses — There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any other affiliate of ours may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Less than the Price to the Public — The initial estimated value that will be set forth in the final pricing supplement for the Notes does not represent a minimum price at which we  RBCCM or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase the Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity  their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and the initial estimated value. This is due to  among other things  changes in the price of the Reference Stock  the borrowing rate we pay to issue securities of this kind  and the inclusion in the price to the public of the underwriting discount and the estimated costs relating to our hedging of the Notes. These factors  together with various credit  market and economic factors over the term of the Notes  are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell your Notes prior to maturity may be less than your original purchase price  as any such sale price would not be expected to include the underwriting discount and the hedging costs relating to the Notes. In addition to bid-ask spreads  the value of the Notes determined by RBCCM for any secondary market price is expected to be based on the secondary rate rather than the internal funding rate used to price the Notes and determine the initial estimated value. As a result  the secondary price will be less than if the internal funding rate was used. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly  you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes that We Will Provide in the Final Pricing Supplement Will Be an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Are Set — The initial estimated value of the Notes will be based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See “Structuring the Notes” below. Our estimate will be based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.The value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities• Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Stock that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders’ interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the share price of the Reference Stock  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with the Reference Stock Issuer  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could includeAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponinvestment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates’ obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Stock. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the share price of the Reference Stock  and  therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Stock• Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Reference Stock — The return on your Notes is unlikely to reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned shares of the Reference Stock. For instance  you will not receive or be entitled to receive any dividend payments or other distributions on the Reference Stock during the term of your Notes. As an owner of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or any other rights that holders of the Reference Stock may have. Furthermore  the Reference Stock may appreciate substantially during the term of the Notes  while your potential return will be limited to the applicable Contingent Coupon payments.• There Is No Affiliation Between the Reference Stock Issuer and RBCCM  and RBCCM Is Not Responsible for any Disclosure by the Reference Stock Issuer — We are not affiliated with the Reference Stock Issuer. However  we and our affiliates may currently  or from time to time in the future engage  in business with the Reference Stock Issuer. Nevertheless  neither we nor our affiliates assume any responsibilities for the accuracy or the completeness of any information that any other company prepares. You  as an investor in the Notes  should make your own investigation into the Reference Stock. The Reference Stock Issuer is not involved in this offering and has no obligation of any sort with respect to your Notes. The Reference Stock Issuer has no obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason  including when taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of your Notes.• The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments — The payment at maturity  each Observation Date and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see “General Terms of the Notes—Market Disruption Events” in the product prospectus supplement.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE STOCK ISSUERThe Reference Stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Companies with securities registered under that Act are required to file periodically certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information filed with the SEC can be obtained through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition  information regarding the Reference Stock may be obtained from other sources including  but not limited to  press releases  newspaper articles and other publicly disseminated documents.The following information regarding the Reference Stock Issuer is derived from publicly available information.We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of reports filed by the Reference Stock Issuer with the SEC  information published by it on its website or in any other format  information about it obtained from any other source or the information provided below.We obtained the information regarding the historical performance of the Reference Stock set forth below from Bloomberg Financial Markets.Ford Motor CompanyFord Motor Company designs  manufactures  markets and services a range of trucks  cars  sport utility vehicles  electrified vehicles  and luxury vehicles. The company operates through three segments: automotive  mobility and credit.The company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “F.”Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponHistorical InformationThe graph below illustrates the performance of the Reference Stock from January 1  2012 to June 3  2022  reflecting a hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $13.50  which was its closing price on June 3  2022. The red line represents a hypothetical Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price of $7.43  which is equal to 55% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price (rounded to two decimal places). The actual Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price will be based on the closing price of the Reference Stock on the Trade Date.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSUPPLEMENTAL DISCUSSION OFU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCESThe following disclosure supplements  and to the extent inconsistent supersedes  the discussion in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”Under Section 871(m) of the Code  a “dividend equivalent” payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States. Such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (“ELIs”) that are “specified ELIs” may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference  directly or indirectly  an interest in an “underlying security ” which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However  the IRS has issued guidance that states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the effective dates of the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to provide that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1  2023. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments  if any  under the Notes. However  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Reference Stock or the Notes  and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter  or have entered  into other transactions in respect of the Reference Stock or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding  we (or the applicable withholding agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on or about June 17  2022  which is the third (3rd) business day following the Trade Date (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+3”). See “Plan of Distribution” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021. For additional information as to the relationship between us and RBCCM  please see the section “Plan of Distribution—Conflicts of Interest” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021.We expect to deliver the Notes on a date that is greater than two business days following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than two business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.In the initial offering of the Notes  they will be offered to investors at a purchase price equal to par  except with respect to certain accounts as indicated on the cover page of this document. In addition to the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page  we or one of our affiliates may also pay an expected fee to a broker-dealer that is unaffiliated with us for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.The value of the Notes shown on your account statement may be based on RBCCM’s estimate of the value of the Notes if RBCCM or another of our affiliates were to make a market in the Notes (which it is not obligated to do). That estimate will be based upon the price that RBCCM may pay for the Notes in light of then prevailing market conditions  our creditworthiness and transaction costs. For a period of approximately 6 months after the issue date of the Notes  the value of the Notes that may be shown on your account statement may be higher than RBCCM’s estimated value of the Notes at that time. This is because the estimated value of the Notes will not include the underwriting discount and our hedging costs and profits; however  the value of the Notes shown on your account statement during that period may initially be a higher amount  reflecting the addition of RBCCM's underwriting discount and our estimated costs and profits from hedging the Notes. This excess is expected to decrease over time until the end of this period. After this period  if RBCCM repurchases your Notes  it expects to do so at prices that reflect their estimated value.We may use this terms supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  RBCCM or another of our affiliates may use this terms supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this terms supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSTRUCTURING THE NOTESThe Notes are our debt securities  the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Stock. As is the case for all of our debt securities  including our structured notes  the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition  because structured notes result in increased operational  funding and liability management costs to us  we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity. Using this relatively lower implied borrowing rate rather than the secondary market rate  is a factor that is likely to reduce the initial estimated value of the Notes at the time their terms are set. Unlike the estimated value that will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement  any value of the Notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction may be based on a different funding rate  which may result in a lower value for the Notes than if our initial internal funding rate were used.In order to satisfy our payment obligations under the Notes  we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options  put options or other derivatives) on the issue date with RBCCM or one of our other subsidiaries. The terms of these hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors  including our creditworthiness  interest rate movements  the volatility of the Reference Stock  and the tenor of the Notes. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.The lower implied borrowing rate is a factor that reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you. The initial offering price of the Notes also reflects the underwriting commission and our estimated hedging costs. These factors result in the initial estimated value for the Notes on the Trade Date being less than their public offering price.

In her session “Increase Your Value as a Client Advisor ” Colleen will explain why the AICPA emphasizes Audit Data Analytics (ADA) in reporting requirements  and how ADA tools create new possibilities for auditors to add value as advisors to their clients.Additionally  on Tuesday  June 7  Knuff will be presenting a session – “Rewriting the Book on Audit” – during which attendees will learn how audit work is trending toward data-driven audits  or cloud-enabled data integration. She will explain the technologies behind Wolters Kluwer’s evolving data-driven audit and show how data and automation can be incorporated into the audit process to reduce risk  add value  and complete audits more quickly.“We provide diagnostics and coaching in our audit approach to guide auditors through the work they need to perform. Doing so creates a much more optimized and intelligent workflow that yields the profitable audit and satisfied client that every firm is looking for ” says Knuff. “Currently  you provide the audit opinion on financial statements  but wouldn’t clients be so much happier if you also came back to them with data visualizations to say  ‘Here’s how you compare to your peers in your industry ” or “here’s an analysis we’ve done over several years  along with where we think your business is going.”ADA tools like Wolters Kluwer’s TeamMate Analytics provide auditors with robust analytics without needing highly specialized technical training or data science expertise  making it possible to analyze even large amounts of data efficiently and effectively. Colleen will present key concepts during her presentation on Monday during the Education Lab session.“The biggest complaint I get from our auditors is that sample sizes are too big. But the reality is if that is what your risk assessment is producing  then you have to approach it in a different way. So there's a lot of savings with TeamMate Analytics because it digs into those transactions that fall outside the curve or the spectrum of normal ” says Christopher O’Neal  CPA and Partner at Roedl Management Inc.Wolters Kluwer’s suite of cloud-based audit solutions is constructed with this same emphasis on data and cloud-enabled automation. With CCH Axcess™ Engagement (currently in an early adopter phase) and CCH Axcess™ Knowledge Coach (Wolters Kluwer’s proprietary risk-based audit methodology solution) serving as the foundation  additional tools like TeamMate Analytics round out the suite for fully integrated data and data analytics throughout the audit process.”Wolters Kluwer is innovating and investing in ideas like data-driven audit  which will help automate time consuming and highly manual tasks that are performed in almost every engagement. We are incorporating data analytics and harnessing those analytics to perform preliminary analysis on our clients  spot patterns and identify trends. That’s part of our Data-Driven Approach that we’re very  very excited about ” says Knuff.Visit booth 927 during the 2022 AICPA Engage Conference to learn more about the award-winning portfolio of tax  accounting  and audit solutions from Wolters Kluwer.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

The results also reveal that while 27% currently use some form of official national Digital ID scheme  45% are relying on insecure  unofficial  ‘DIY’ (do it yourself) scans and photos of their cards and documents to help prove their identity and entitlements.Digitalisation is already improving user-experience and relieving identification headachesStarting with a pilot phase in 2023  every member state must by 2024 offer citizens a Digital ID Wallet that can be used throughout the EU. The results of the survey certainly underline the need for this pioneering European initiative aiming at offering most convenient User Experience (UX) at highest level of security. Regarding UX  34% of people surveyed currently find it difficult to prove their identity when renewing an ID document  30% have problems when making a high value purchase  and 29% encounter troubles when applying for financial services. However  among the 40% who face such issues  the figure falls to just 5% or below when a digital format is used.Successful wallets will need to match highest security standardsIn all but one of the countries surveyed  government emerges as the preferred provider of the EDIW. However  despite widespread public support for the idea  the results demonstrate that wallet providers must address significant security and data privacy concerns among potential users. In particular  the research shows that 65% of Europeans rate security as the most important feature in any new wallet  followed by convenience and privacy.Results highlight different national attitudes to the EDIWThe survey uncovers differences in national attitudes. The French and the Italians are the most positive about the EDIW  with 85% and 75% respectively claiming they will use it. Enthusiasm for the EDIW is also influenced by age  and citizens’ experiences of digital wallets providers (such as Apple  Google  Samsung) and national Digital ID schemes including BankID in Sweden.“By providing citizens with a secure and convenient means of proving their identity and entitlements via a smartphone  the EDIW will enable smooth and secure interactions between citizens  governments and private businesses. The results of our survey offer providers a better understanding of citizens’ needs  helping them to maximise adoption and use of the new wallets that will be introduced throughout the EU over the next 18 months. Thales as a leader in digital security and trustful provider of digital identities remains fully committed to address those needs thanks to field-proven wallet solutions ” said Youzec Kurp  VP Identity and Biometric Solutions at Thales.Conducted by Thales  the survey took place in December 2021. In total  1835 citizens from seven different EU countries provided detailed answers to an online questionnaire. The full results are now available in a new white paper: Understanding the European identity experience.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies  investing in digital and “deep tech” innovations – connectivity  big data  artificial intelligence  cybersecurity and quantum computing – to build a confident future crucial for the development of our societies.

A long-standing collaboration between the two global cybersecurity leaders  Thales and Palo Alto Networks  will help support this widespread cloud migration  allowing organisations to implement Zero Trust security systems at scale. Through three technology integrations  businesses will gain access to Internal Resources within a robust  highly resilient security architecture.This news comes at a time where cloud transformation at enterprise-level is occurring at pace to support an increasingly hybrid working world. In line with this shift  it is critical that businesses secure distributed IT environments that no longer have a defined physical security perimeter. The combination of identity aware contextual access controls and multi-factor authentication systems will enable secure cloud transformation whilst supporting remote workforces  allowing employees to safely access any resource  from anywhere  and on any device.Three key integrationsThe integrations will minimise the threat of data breaches from identity compromise by implementing strong  adaptive authentication at the network edge and by ensuring automated remediation workflows in the event of an untrusted access event.By integrating Thales’ SafeNet Trusted Access across Palo Alto Networks Prisma® Access  GlobalProtect  ML-Powered Next Generation Firewalls  and Cortex® XSOAR technologies  businesses will be able to deploy a Zero Trust model across a suite of solutions. Organisations will benefit from secure and adaptive multi-factor authentication  access management across edge solutions  network security policies  incident response and threat intelligence management.“Thales has partnered with us to help support customers through their digital transformation journeys  and in collaboration we are well primed to provide a zero trust approach with authentication  SOC security and ZTNA solutions. With these integrations  businesses are able to seamlessly secure access to hybrid and cloud environments  detect suspicious account activity  automatically trigger alerts and enforce stronger access policies in real-time ” said Tana Rosenblatt  VP Technology Partnerships  at Palo Alto Networks.“The business threat landscape is evolving rapidly  leading to an increase in the scale and complexity of risks being faced by many of our clients. As organisations move their network security to the cloud  it becomes more difficult to implement holistic security controls. We are excited to be able to work with Palo Alto Networks and offer organisations a clear path towards identity-aware Zero Trust security.By applying and enforcing adaptive and multi-factor authentication at the network edge  and by responding to and stopping untrusted access events in real-time  Thales and Palo Alto Networks ensure organisations can make the move to the cloud successfully and securely ” concluded Francois Lasnier  VP Access Management Products at Thales.For businesses looking to roll out Zero Trust frameworks within their networks  Thales and Palo Alto Networks security solutions are available to integrate now.

June 6  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today  Peet's …,"""This responsible sourcing achievement is the result of a multi-year data collection process to verify the conditions and practices of the more than 59 000  mostly small coffee farms in 24 regions around the world who supply coffee beans for Peet's Coffee "" said Doug Welsh  Vice President and Roastmaster.In 2016 Peet's Coffee began working with Enveritas because the non-profit offers a different way of addressing sustainability - an approach where producers access free verification of their practices  while encouraging a deeper understanding and commitment to solving the most challenging sustainability issues in their local community. Working collaboratively  Peet's and Enveritas designed a custom coffee-specific verification program that uses  among other techniques  artificial intelligence (AI) and geo-spatial technology to gather independent  data-rich reports of conditions on coffee farms. These conditions are verified against 30 sustainability standards set by Enveritas  which has performed more than 20 000 annual audits across Peet's coffee supply chain. Peet's shares the results of these audits with its suppliers and  if issues are identified  collaborates with importers  governments  non-profits  competitors and  most importantly  its farmer partners to develop impact projects tailored to the needs of farmers and their communities. Peet's currently operates 39 social and environmental impact programs in 24 regions.""Coffee is more than a source of energy or enjoyment for the millions of people worldwide who farm coffee for their livelihood  as a family legacy and way of life "" said Welsh. ""At Peet's  responsible sourcing requires that we identify challenges  invest in projects that improve lives  and then measure that progress. The reach of this accomplishment – applying consistent sustainability standards to all the coffee we roast – is just the beginning. If we can achieve this across our global system at Peet's  other coffee roasters can as well. Our collaborative approach will help advance progress and create more tailored  relevant support for coffee farmers and their home communities.""Over several decades  Peet's Coffee's sourcing experts  led by Welsh  have worked to better understand challenging social and environmental conditions on coffee farms and the impact on smallholder farmers  who produce more than 60% of the world's coffee. Peet's Coffee has established viable sourcing systems and partnerships with highly credible organizations including World Coffee Research  TechnoServe and Enveritas to inform the company's practices and achieve greater reach in improving coffee production.""Many coffee companies are satisfied with paying for a label that says their coffee is certified  but few companies are actually tracking that data to determine opportunities for change and real progress "" said David Browning  CEO of Enveritas. ""Peet's Coffee came to us several years ago with the challenge to customize a data collection system to track actual practices in the regions where they source coffee beans. The company wanted to know with certainty how Peet's coffee is grown and then help improve conditions within each community through targeted projects. The verification audits we perform are rigorous  and the data details actual practices in place for accuracy and year-over-year analysis. It is a model that will help individual producers and the industry evolve to better address climate change and other associated  complex challenges.""Accelerating Peet's Coffee's pioneering collaboration with Enveritas  global partner  JDE Peet's (EURONEXT: JDEP)  recently announced it will increase its responsibly sourced coffee from 30% to 80% by the end of 2022.Peet's Coffee will continue to provide timely updates on its efforts to drive positive impact.

TG4050 is based on Transgene’s myvac® platform and powered by NEC’s cutting-edge AI capabilities.These additional positive initial data  including molecular (ctDNA) response  have been generated from the first patients with ovarian cancer and HPV-negative head and neck cancer enrolled in the two ongoing Phase I trials assessing TG4050. They were presented in-person in Chicago  IL  June 5  2022.“These new results  though early  are very encouraging” said Dr. Maud Brandely  MD  PhD  Chief Medical Officer of Transgene. “So far we accumulated promising preliminary data with TG4050: good tolerability  consistent immunogenicity and encouraging molecular response. We are particularly impressed by the effective priming of the immune system and the early signs of clinical activity. These results suggest that our individualized vaccine  TG4050  has the potential to extend the remission period  thus providing a new hope for cancer patients. In addition  the information we gather from the two ongoing Phase I studies will be pivotal in designing the Phase II trial of TG4050 which could start as early as 2023.”Prof. Jean-Pierre Delord  MD  PhD  General Manager of IUCT Oncopole of Toulouse and first author of the poster  added: “Neoantigen vaccination such as TG4050 is a relevant strategy for the treatment of patients with high risk of cancer relapse for whom the medical need is particularly high. In this setting  the vaccine is expected to deliver clinical benefit by controlling the residual disease. To date  this non-invasive treatment is well tolerated by the patients and although preliminary  the data presented at ASCO clearly suggest that TG4050 could become a new treatment option for cancer patients. I am looking forward to seeing this potential game-changing therapy moving forward.”For the first time  ctDNA data were generated following treatment with TG4050Liquid biopsies were performed to measure the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels. ctDNA is an emerging modality that is used to detect subclinical disease or asymptomatic relapse in an increasing number of indications. Use of such highly sensitive and specific marker seeks to identify patients whose disease is very likely to relapse in the near future  before their disease becomes detectable with current standard methods such as imaging. Moreover  it allows a non-invasive monitoring of treatment effectiveness. For instance  in at least one ovarian cancer patient in the study  a decline in ctDNA was concomitant with CA-125 normalization and disease control. Analyses are ongoing in more recently included patients.Clinical follow-up data continue to demonstrate the potential of TG4050 in ovarian and head and neck cancer patientsIn the head and neck cancer trial  patients were randomized to immediately receive vaccination with TG4050 (early treatment arm  arm A) or at relapse (delayed vaccination arm  arm B). All evaluable patients randomized to arm A (n=8) are still in complete response as of mid-May 2022. In arm B (n=8)  two patients have experienced relapse.In the ovarian cancer trial (n=5)  a fifth patient initiated her treatment with TG4050 recently. One patient treated after an elevation of CA-125 experienced a normalization of CA-125 without clinical progression for 9 months until death from an unrelated chronic illness. Another patient was treated upon onset of radiological evidence of relapse and remained stable for 11.4 months.To date  the vaccine has been well tolerated and no related Serious Adverse Events have been reported across the two studies.In both clinical studies  enrollment and patient dosing are progressing in line with our expectations. Overall  Transgene plans to treat 13 patients in the ovarian cancer trial and 30 patients in the head and neck cancer trial.Immune cell response data demonstrated an effective priming of the immune system which is associated with disease regressionTransgene presented a comprehensive set of immunological data at ASCO. Circulating immune cells quantification (in particular monocytes  DC  NK cells  subcells of CD8  CD4  Treg) and expression of immune checkpoints (ICOS and PD1) suggest that the vaccine is able to effectively induce innate and adaptive immune responses in patients.In an ovarian cancer patient  clinical resolution and biological responses (CA-125 and ctDNA responses) were concomitant to an immune response against multiple epitopes and to the onset of markers of an effective immune response (switch in circulating CD4 and CD8 cells toward an effector phenotype  increase in CD16neg NK cells; peak in circulating cytokines).All evaluable patients developed a robust T-cell response against multiple targeted neoantigens (median of 10 positive responses per patient). T-cell responses were observed for class I and class II epitopes  they consisted of de novo responses and amplifications of preexisting responses.The poster can be downloaded from the ASCO and Transgene websites.Poster title: Phase 1 studies of personalized neoantigen vaccine TG4050 in ovarian carcinoma (OC) and head and neck carcinoma (HNSCC)Abstract number: 26372637 Session title : Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy: Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy Authors : J.P.

Yamagata  Y. Tanaka  B. Malone  E. Quemeneur  K. Bendjama***About the clinical trialsTG4050 is being evaluated in two Phase I clinical trials for patients with ovarian cancer (NCT03839524) and HPV-negative head and neck cancers (NCT04183166).In a first Phase I trial  TG4050 is being administered to patients with HPV-negative head and neck cancer. A personalized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive an adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants receive their vaccine immediately after they complete their adjuvant treatment. The other half is given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease as an additional treatment to SoC. This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who have a high risk of relapse. Up to 30 patients will receive TG4050 in France  in the UK and in the USA. The principal investigator of the trial is Prof. Christian Ottensmeier  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre and Professor of Immuno-Oncology at the University of Liverpool. In France  the clinical trial is being conducted at Institut Curie  Paris by Prof. Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  Head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i)  and at the IUCT-Oncopole  Toulouse by Prof. Jean-Pierre Delord  MD  PhD. In the USA  the trial is being led by Yujie Zhao  MD  PhD  at the Mayo Clinic. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.In parallel  a Phase I clinical trial of TG4050 is enrolling patients with ovarian cancer. This second trial is including patients at the time of asymptomatic relapse after surgery and first-line chemotherapy. Matthew Block  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncology  Consultant Immunology and Associate Professor of Oncology at the Mayo Clinic (USA) is the principal investigator of the trial; in France  the trial is being conducted by Prof. Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  at Institut Curie and by Alexandra Martinez  MD  Associate Head of Surgical Department  at IUCT-Oncopole. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.The first preliminary clinical data generated from the first patients treated with TG4050 were very encouraging.About myvac®myvac® is a viral vector (MVA – Modified Vaccinia Ankara) based  individualized immunotherapy platform that has been developed by Transgene to target solid tumors. myvac®-derived products are designed to stimulate the patient’s immune system  recognize and destroy tumors using the patient’s own cancer specific genetic mutations.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALNOX) (Paris:ALNOX)  a biotechnology company focused on improving cancer treatments by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  announced today the publication of the full top-line results from the NOX-A12 Phase 1/2 GLORIA trial in brain cancer (glioblastoma) in a poster presentation at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting  taking place in Chicago  Illinois  US  from June 3 to June 7  2022.The poster presentation entitled ""Radiotherapy and olaptesed pegol (NOX-A12) in partially resected or biopsy-only MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma: Interim data from the German multicenter phase 1/2 GLORIA trial"" was presented by Dr. Frank A. Giordano and highlighted that:90% of patients who received NOX-A12 and radiotherapy achieved tumor size reductions vs. 25% of patients in a matched reference cohort receiving standard of care.40% of patients who received NOX-A12 and radiotherapy achieved partial response (defined as tumor size reduction of more than 50%) vs. 10% in a matched reference cohort receiving standard of care.In 30% of patients who received NOX-A12 and radiotherapy  one or more non-target lesions (smaller secondary lesions) completely disappeared.Infiltration of the tumor with activated  cytotoxic T-cells and M1-like macrophages was seen in both patients who had repeat surgery during NOX-A12 therapy  consistent with NOX-A12 and radiotherapy overcoming immune cell exclusion and making the tumors immunologically hotter.The combination of NOX-A12 and radiotherapy was safe and well tolerated  with no dose limiting toxicities and no treatment-related deaths. Only 4% of the adverse events of Grade 2 or more were deemed solely NOX-A12-related.Aram Mangasarian  CEO of NOXXON  commented: ""We are excited about these impressive results  which demonstrate the potential of our lead asset NOX-A12 in brain cancer and further substantiate our innovative approach of targeting the tumor microenvironment. We will continue to report on maturing data from the dose-escalation part of the study and are looking forward to interim read-outs from the ongoing expansion study exploring additional combination therapies  which will help us design our planned pivotal trial. Brain cancer is a very difficult to treat condition and these results bring us a step closer to offering improved treatment options and hope for patients.""Story continuesDr. Frank A. Giordano  Director and Chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University Hospital Bonn and the lead investigator of the GLORIA trial  commented: ""These encouraging results show a strong response to NOX-A12 and radiotherapy  with 90% of patients achieving tumor size reduction. In addition to this  the 40% of patients who have achieved more than 50% tumor size reduction under NOX‑A12 treatment is a considerable increase over the 22% disclosed in the previous interim data analysis  and a multi-fold increase over the 10% achieved by the reference cohort receiving standard of care. This suggests the promising clinical efficacy of this new approach to directly target CXCL12 in glioblastoma.""A copy of the poster presentation and a video describing the poster  is available on the NOXXON website. More information about the GLORIA study (NCT04121455) can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov.Following the ASCO 2022 conference  NOXXON will host a Key Opinion Leader (KOL) webinar with Dr. Giordano  who will take the audience through the ASCO poster presentation and discuss the results of the GLORIA Phase 1/2 trial in more detail.Details of the Key Opinion Leader webinar are as follows:Title: KOL Webinar on GLORIA Top-Line Results of NOX-A12 & Radiotherapy Combination in First-Line Glioblastoma Presented at ASCO 2022Presenter: Dr. Frank A. Giordano  Director and Chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology  University Hospital Bonn  GermanyWebinar time and date: June 10  2022  at 02:00 p.m. CEST (08:00 a.m. EDT)Registration: To register for the event  please click hereAbout NOXXONNOXXON’s oncology-focused pipeline acts on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking the tumor protection barrier and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  NOXXON’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses against the immune system and enable greater therapeutic impact. NOXXON’s lead program NOX-A12 has delivered final top-line data from a Keytruda® combination trial in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients published at the ESMO conference in September 2020 and in July 2021 the company announced its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. NOXXON is also studying NOX-A12 in brain cancer in combination with radiotherapy which has been granted orphan drug status in the US and EU for the treatment of certain brain cancers. GLORIA  a trial of NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy has delivered top-line data from all three dose-escalation cohorts showing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA has been expanded to assess the benefit of NOX-A12 with other treatment combinations  radiotherapy + bevacizumab and radiotherapy + pembrolizumab. The company’s second clinical-stage asset NOX-E36 is a Phase 2 TME asset targeting the innate immune system. NOXXON plans to test NOX‑E36 in patients with solid tumors.

GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 three additional arms combining NOX-A12 with: A. radiotherapy in patients with complete tumor resection; B. radiotherapy and bevacizumab; and C. radiotherapy and pembrolizumab.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is NOXXON’s open-label two-arm phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.

In addition  the number of feature animation projects in production has grown from two in 2019 to six features in 2022;At the Mill  whose activity is closely related to advertising spending  activity growth is being slowed by the current global economic environment. As a result  the Mill is now expecting slower growth than initially anticipated over the period  with the main impact in 2022. Actions to mitigate the impact on margin have already been identified and initiated relating to costs and operational efficiencies;At Technicolor Games  demand for games content is expected to continue growing  along with the expansion of the Technicolor Games offer to preproduction  game assets creation  animation  VFX  and in-engine integration  with co-development and quality assurance (“QA”) services.Significant investment in artist recruitment  retention  and training (including TCS Academy programs) continues  with delivery of all pipeline projects remaining the main challenge for 2022  as a consequence of the shortage of talent in the market.These trends were associated with a higher volatility in the financial environment of the Group  mainly in the valuation of its main currencies - notably the US dollar  the Canadian dollar  and the British pound – which have evolved favorably since the beginning of the year.In light of the market trends highlighted above  the Company is publishing the following forward looking assumptions for TCS:2022 2023 Previous forward looking assumptions2 New forward looking assumptions using previous exchange rates3 New forward looking assumptions using end of April exchange rates4 Previous forward looking assumptions2 New forward looking assumptions using previous exchange rates3 New forward looking assumptions using end of April exchange rates4 Adjusted EBITDA5 176-186 165-175 175-185 210-220 185-205 200-220 Adjusted EBITA 78-88 65-75 75-85 106-116 85-105 95-115 Free Cash Flow before Tax and Financial 100-110 70-80 75-85 125-135 100-120 110-130As part of the proposed carve-out  TCS is planning to review its key performance indicators (KPI)  notably including an adjusted EBITDA after lease  with the goal of becoming more comparable with its peers and market practices  whilst being more aligned with the way the business is managed.
