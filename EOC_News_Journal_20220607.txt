The table illustrates the Payment at Maturity of the Notes (excluding the final Contingent Coupon and any unpaid Contingent Coupons  if payable) for a hypothetical range of performance for the Reference Stock  assuming the following terms and that the Notes are not automatically called prior to maturity:Hypothetical Initial Stock Price: $100.00* Hypothetical Trigger Price and Coupon Barrier: $55.00  which is 55% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Rate: 10.75% per annum (or 2.6875% per quarter)  which is the midpoint of the Contingent Coupon Rate range set forth above. Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Amount: $26.875 per quarter Observation Dates: Quarterly Principal Amount: $1 000 per Note* The hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $100 used in the examples below has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the expected actual Initial Stock Price. The actual Initial Stock Price will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Prices are shown in the first column on the left. The second column shows the Payment at Maturity for a range of Final Stock Prices on the Valuation Date. The third column shows the amount of cash to be paid on the Notes per $1 000 in principal amount. If the Notes are called prior to maturity  the hypothetical examples below will not be relevant  and you will receive on the applicable Coupon Payment Date  for each $1 000 principal amount  $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon(s) otherwise due on the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Price Payment at Maturity as Percentage of Principal Amount Cash Payment Amount per $1 000 in Principal Amount $180.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $170.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $160.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $150.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $140.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $125.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $120.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $110.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $100.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $90.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $80.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $70.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $60.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $55.00 100.00%* $1 000.00* $54.99 54.99% $549.90 $50.00 50.00% $500.00 $40.00 40.00% $400.00 $30.00 30.00% $300.00 $20.00 20.00% $200.00 $10.00 10.00% $100.00 $0.00 0.00% $0.00* Excluding the final Contingent Coupon and any unpaid Contingent Coupons  if payable.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponHypothetical Examples of Amounts Payable at MaturityThe following hypothetical examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated  assuming the Notes have not been called.Example 1: The price of the Reference Stock increases by 25% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $125.00. Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes (and any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons)  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 25% appreciation in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 2: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 10% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $90.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes (and any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons)  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 10% decline in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 3: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 60% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $40.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the final Contingent Coupon will not be payable on the Maturity Date  and we will pay only $400.00 for each $1 000 in the principal amount of the Notes  calculated as follows:Principal Amount + (Principal Amount x Reference Stock Return)= $1 000 + ($1 000 x -60.00%) = $1 000 - $600.00 = $400.00* * *The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on theoretical prices of the Reference Stock that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payments at Maturity shown above  and those amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Stock. These risks are explained in more detail in the section ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes‚Ä¢ You May Lose All or a Portion of the Principal Amount at Maturity ‚Äî Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the trading price of the Reference Stock between the Trade Date and the Valuation Date. If the Notes are not automatically called and the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price  the amount that you receive at maturity will represent a loss of your principal that is proportionate to the decline in the closing price of the Reference Stock from the Trade Date to the Valuation Date. Any Contingent Coupons received on the Notes prior to the Maturity Date may not be sufficient to compensate for any such loss.‚Ä¢ The Notes Are Subject to an Automatic Call ‚Äî If on any Observation Date beginning in December 2022  the closing price of the Reference Stock is greater than or equal to the Call Stock Price  then the Notes will be automatically called. If the Notes are automatically called  then  on the applicable Call Settlement Date  for each $1 000 in principal amount  you will receive $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the applicable Call Settlement Date (together with any previously unpaid Contingent Coupons). You will not receive any Contingent Coupons after the Call Settlement Date. You may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the automatic call in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been called.‚Ä¢ You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupons ‚Äî We will not necessarily make any coupon payments on the Notes. If the closing price of the Reference Stock on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier  we will not pay you the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date. If the closing price of the Reference Stock is less than the Coupon Barrier on each of the Observation Dates and on the Valuation Date  we will not pay you any Contingent Coupons during the term of  and you will not receive a positive return on your Notes. Generally  this non-payment of the Contingent Coupon coincides with a period of greater risk of principal loss on your Notes. Accordingly  if we do not pay the Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date  you will also incur a loss of principal  because the Final Stock Price will be less than the Trigger Price. Notwithstanding the memory coupon feature of the Notes  it is possible that any unpaid Contingent Coupons will remain unpaid for the remaining term of the Notes.‚Ä¢ The Call Feature and the Contingent Coupon Feature Limit Your Potential Return ‚Äî The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified Contingent Coupon Rate  regardless of the appreciation of the Reference Stock. In addition  the total return on the Notes will vary based on the number of Observation Dates on which the Contingent Coupon becomes payable prior to maturity or an automatic call. Further  if the Notes are called due to the Call Feature  you will not receive any Contingent Coupons or any other payment in respect of any Observation Dates after the applicable Call Settlement Date. Since the Notes could be called as early as the second Observation Date  the total return on the Notes could be minimal. If the Notes are not called  you may be subject to the full downside performance of the Reference Stock even though your potential return is limited to the Contingent Coupon Rate. As a result  the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in the Reference Stock.‚Ä¢ Your Return on the Notes May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity ‚Äî The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.‚Ä¢ Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes ‚Äî The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of any Contingent Coupons  if payable  and the amount due on any relevant payment date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on the applicable payment dates. This will be the case even ifAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponthe price of the Reference Stock increases after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at any time during the term of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes‚Ä¢ There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes-Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses ‚Äî There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any other affiliate of ours may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes‚Ä¢ The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Less than the Price to the Public ‚Äî The initial estimated value that will be set forth in the final pricing supplement for the Notes does not represent a minimum price at which we  RBCCM or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase the Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity  their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and the initial estimated value. This is due to  among other things  changes in the price of the Reference Stock  the borrowing rate we pay to issue securities of this kind  and the inclusion in the price to the public of the underwriting discount and the estimated costs relating to our hedging of the Notes. These factors  together with various credit  market and economic factors over the term of the Notes  are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell your Notes prior to maturity may be less than your original purchase price  as any such sale price would not be expected to include the underwriting discount and the hedging costs relating to the Notes. In addition to bid-ask spreads  the value of the Notes determined by RBCCM for any secondary market price is expected to be based on the secondary rate rather than the internal funding rate used to price the Notes and determine the initial estimated value. As a result  the secondary price will be less than if the internal funding rate was used. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly  you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.‚Ä¢ The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes that We Will Provide in the Final Pricing Supplement Will Be an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Are Set ‚Äî The initial estimated value of the Notes will be based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See ‚ÄúStructuring the Notes‚Äù below. Our estimate will be based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.The value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities‚Ä¢ Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest ‚Äî We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Stock that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders‚Äô interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the share price of the Reference Stock  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with the Reference Stock Issuer  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could includeAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponinvestment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates‚Äô obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Stock. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the share price of the Reference Stock  and  therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Stock‚Ä¢ Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Reference Stock ‚Äî The return on your Notes is unlikely to reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned shares of the Reference Stock. For instance  you will not receive or be entitled to receive any dividend payments or other distributions on the Reference Stock during the term of your Notes. As an owner of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or any other rights that holders of the Reference Stock may have. Furthermore  the Reference Stock may appreciate substantially during the term of the Notes  while your potential return will be limited to the applicable Contingent Coupon payments.‚Ä¢ There Is No Affiliation Between the Reference Stock Issuer and RBCCM  and RBCCM Is Not Responsible for any Disclosure by the Reference Stock Issuer ‚Äî We are not affiliated with the Reference Stock Issuer. However  we and our affiliates may currently  or from time to time in the future engage  in business with the Reference Stock Issuer. Nevertheless  neither we nor our affiliates assume any responsibilities for the accuracy or the completeness of any information that any other company prepares. You  as an investor in the Notes  should make your own investigation into the Reference Stock. The Reference Stock Issuer is not involved in this offering and has no obligation of any sort with respect to your Notes. The Reference Stock Issuer has no obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason  including when taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of your Notes.‚Ä¢ The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments ‚Äî The payment at maturity  each Observation Date and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see ‚ÄúGeneral Terms of the Notes‚ÄîMarket Disruption Events‚Äù in the product prospectus supplement.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE STOCK ISSUERThe Reference Stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ‚ÄúExchange Act‚Äù). Companies with securities registered under that Act are required to file periodically certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information filed with the SEC can be obtained through the SEC‚Äôs website at www.sec.gov. In addition  information regarding the Reference Stock may be obtained from other sources including  but not limited to  press releases  newspaper articles and other publicly disseminated documents.The following information regarding the Reference Stock Issuer is derived from publicly available information.We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of reports filed by the Reference Stock Issuer with the SEC  information published by it on its website or in any other format  information about it obtained from any other source or the information provided below.We obtained the information regarding the historical performance of the Reference Stock set forth below from Bloomberg Financial Markets.Best Buy Co.  Inc.Best Buy Co.  Inc. retails consumer electronics  home office products  entertainment software  appliances and related services online and through its retail stores.The company‚Äôs common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúBBY.‚ÄùAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponHistorical InformationThe graph below illustrates the performance of the Reference Stock from January 1  2012 to June 2  2022  reflecting a hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $81.26  which was its closing price on June 2  2022. The red line represents a hypothetical Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price of $44.69  which is equal to 55% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price (rounded to two decimal places). The actual Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price will be based on the closing price of the Reference Stock on the Trade Date.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSUPPLEMENTAL DISCUSSION OFU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCESThe following disclosure supplements  and to the extent inconsistent supersedes  the discussion in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under ‚ÄúSupplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.‚ÄùUnder Section 871(m) of the Code  a ‚Äúdividend equivalent‚Äù payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States. Such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (‚ÄúELIs‚Äù) that are ‚Äúspecified ELIs‚Äù may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference  directly or indirectly  an interest in an ‚Äúunderlying security ‚Äù which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However  the IRS has issued guidance that states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the effective dates of the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to provide that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1  2023. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments  if any  under the Notes. However  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Reference Stock or the Notes  and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter  or have entered  into other transactions in respect of the Reference Stock or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding  we (or the applicable withholding agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory CouponSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on or about June 17  2022  which is the third (3rd) business day following the Trade Date (this settlement cycle being referred to as ‚ÄúT+3‚Äù). See ‚ÄúPlan of Distribution‚Äù in the prospectus dated September 14  2021. For additional information as to the relationship between us and RBCCM  please see the section ‚ÄúPlan of Distribution‚ÄîConflicts of Interest‚Äù in the prospectus dated September 14  2021.We expect to deliver the Notes on a date that is greater than two business days following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than two business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.In the initial offering of the Notes  they will be offered to investors at a purchase price equal to par  except with respect to certain accounts as indicated on the cover page of this document. In addition to the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page  we or one of our affiliates may also pay an expected fee to a broker-dealer that is unaffiliated with us for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.The value of the Notes shown on your account statement may be based on RBCCM‚Äôs estimate of the value of the Notes if RBCCM or another of our affiliates were to make a market in the Notes (which it is not obligated to do). That estimate will be based upon the price that RBCCM may pay for the Notes in light of then prevailing market conditions  our creditworthiness and transaction costs. For a period of approximately 6 months after the issue date of the Notes  the value of the Notes that may be shown on your account statement may be higher than RBCCM‚Äôs estimated value of the Notes at that time. This is because the estimated value of the Notes will not include the underwriting discount and our hedging costs and profits; however  the value of the Notes shown on your account statement during that period may initially be a higher amount  reflecting the addition of RBCCM‚Äôs underwriting discount and our estimated costs and profits from hedging the Notes. This excess is expected to decrease over time until the end of this period. After this period  if RBCCM repurchases your Notes  it expects to do so at prices that reflect their estimated value.We may use this terms supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  RBCCM or another of our affiliates may use this terms supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this terms supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.STRUCTURING THE NOTESThe Notes are our debt securities  the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Stock. As is the case for all of our debt securities  including our structured notes  the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition  because structured notes result in increased operational  funding and liability management costs to us  we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity. Using this relatively lower implied borrowing rate rather than the secondary market rate  is a factor that is likely to reduce the initial estimated value of the Notes at the time their terms are set. Unlike the estimated value that will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement  any value of the Notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction may be based on a different funding rate  which may result in a lower value for the Notes than if our initial internal funding rate were used.In order to satisfy our payment obligations under the Notes  we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options  put options or other derivatives) on the issue date with RBCCM or one of our other subsidiaries. The terms of these hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors  including our creditworthiness  interest rate movements  the volatility of the Reference Stock  and the tenor of the Notes. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.The lower implied borrowing rate is a factor that reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you. The initial offering price of the Notes also reflects the underwriting commission and our estimated hedging costs. These factors result in the initialAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes with Memory Couponestimated value for the Notes on the Trade Date being less than their public offering price.

In her session ‚ÄúIncrease Your Value as a Client Advisor ‚Äù Colleen will explain why the AICPA emphasizes Audit Data Analytics (ADA) in reporting requirements  and how ADA tools create new possibilities for auditors to add value as advisors to their clients.Additionally  on Tuesday  June 7  Knuff will be presenting a session ‚Äì ‚ÄúRewriting the Book on Audit‚Äù ‚Äì during which attendees will learn how audit work is trending toward data-driven audits  or cloud-enabled data integration. She will explain the technologies behind Wolters Kluwer‚Äôs evolving data-driven audit and show how data and automation can be incorporated into the audit process to reduce risk  add value  and complete audits more quickly.‚ÄúWe provide diagnostics and coaching in our audit approach to guide auditors through the work they need to perform. Doing so creates a much more optimized and intelligent workflow that yields the profitable audit and satisfied client that every firm is looking for ‚Äù says Knuff. ‚ÄúCurrently  you provide the audit opinion on financial statements  but wouldn‚Äôt clients be so much happier if you also came back to them with data visualizations to say  ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs how you compare to your peers in your industry ‚Äù or ‚Äúhere‚Äôs an analysis we‚Äôve done over several years  along with where we think your business is going.‚ÄùADA tools like Wolters Kluwer‚Äôs TeamMate Analytics provide auditors with robust analytics without needing highly specialized technical training or data science expertise  making it possible to analyze even large amounts of data efficiently and effectively. Colleen will present key concepts during her presentation on Monday during the Education Lab session.‚ÄúThe biggest complaint I get from our auditors is that sample sizes are too big. But the reality is if that is what your risk assessment is producing  then you have to approach it in a different way. So there's a lot of savings with TeamMate Analytics because it digs into those transactions that fall outside the curve or the spectrum of normal ‚Äù says Christopher O‚ÄôNeal  CPA and Partner at Roedl Management Inc.Wolters Kluwer‚Äôs suite of cloud-based audit solutions is constructed with this same emphasis on data and cloud-enabled automation. With CCH Axcess‚Ñ¢ Engagement (currently in an early adopter phase) and CCH Axcess‚Ñ¢ Knowledge Coach (Wolters Kluwer‚Äôs proprietary risk-based audit methodology solution) serving as the foundation  additional tools like TeamMate Analytics round out the suite for fully integrated data and data analytics throughout the audit process.‚ÄùWolters Kluwer is innovating and investing in ideas like data-driven audit  which will help automate time consuming and highly manual tasks that are performed in almost every engagement. We are incorporating data analytics and harnessing those analytics to perform preliminary analysis on our clients  spot patterns and identify trends.

The results also reveal that while 27% currently use some form of official national Digital ID scheme  45% are relying on insecure  unofficial  ‚ÄòDIY‚Äô (do it yourself) scans and photos of their cards and documents to help prove their identity and entitlements.Digitalisation is already improving user-experience and relieving identification headachesStarting with a pilot phase in 2023  every member state must by 2024 offer citizens a Digital ID Wallet that can be used throughout the EU. The results of the survey certainly underline the need for this pioneering European initiative aiming at offering most convenient User Experience (UX) at highest level of security. Regarding UX  34% of people surveyed currently find it difficult to prove their identity when renewing an ID document  30% have problems when making a high value purchase  and 29% encounter troubles when applying for financial services. However  among the 40% who face such issues  the figure falls to just 5% or below when a digital format is used.Successful wallets will need to match highest security standardsIn all but one of the countries surveyed  government emerges as the preferred provider of the EDIW. However  despite widespread public support for the idea  the results demonstrate that wallet providers must address significant security and data privacy concerns among potential users. In particular  the research shows that 65% of Europeans rate security as the most important feature in any new wallet  followed by convenience and privacy.Results highlight different national attitudes to the EDIWThe survey uncovers differences in national attitudes. The French and the Italians are the most positive about the EDIW  with 85% and 75% respectively claiming they will use it. Enthusiasm for the EDIW is also influenced by age  and citizens‚Äô experiences of digital wallets providers (such as Apple  Google  Samsung) and national Digital ID schemes including BankID in Sweden.‚ÄúBy providing citizens with a secure and convenient means of proving their identity and entitlements via a smartphone  the EDIW will enable smooth and secure interactions between citizens  governments and private businesses. The results of our survey offer providers a better understanding of citizens‚Äô needs  helping them to maximise adoption and use of the new wallets that will be introduced throughout the EU over the next 18 months. Thales as a leader in digital security and trustful provider of digital identities remains fully committed to address those needs thanks to field-proven wallet solutions ‚Äù said Youzec Kurp  VP Identity and Biometric Solutions at Thales.Conducted by Thales  the survey took place in December 2021.

A long-standing collaboration between the two global cybersecurity leaders  Thales and Palo Alto Networks  will help support this widespread cloud migration  allowing organisations to implement Zero Trust security systems at scale. Through three technology integrations  businesses will gain access to Internal Resources within a robust  highly resilient security architecture.This news comes at a time where cloud transformation at enterprise-level is occurring at pace to support an increasingly hybrid working world. In line with this shift  it is critical that businesses secure distributed IT environments that no longer have a defined physical security perimeter. The combination of identity aware contextual access controls and multi-factor authentication systems will enable secure cloud transformation whilst supporting remote workforces  allowing employees to safely access any resource  from anywhere  and on any device.Three key integrationsThe integrations will minimise the threat of data breaches from identity compromise by implementing strong  adaptive authentication at the network edge and by ensuring automated remediation workflows in the event of an untrusted access event.By integrating Thales‚Äô SafeNet Trusted Access across Palo Alto Networks Prisma¬Æ Access  GlobalProtect  ML-Powered Next Generation Firewalls  and Cortex¬Æ XSOAR technologies  businesses will be able to deploy a Zero Trust model across a suite of solutions. Organisations will benefit from secure and adaptive multi-factor authentication  access management across edge solutions  network security policies  incident response and threat intelligence management.‚ÄúThales has partnered with us to help support customers through their digital transformation journeys  and in collaboration we are well primed to provide a zero trust approach with authentication  SOC security and ZTNA solutions. With these integrations  businesses are able to seamlessly secure access to hybrid and cloud environments  detect suspicious account activity  automatically trigger alerts and enforce stronger access policies in real-time ‚Äù said Tana Rosenblatt  VP Technology Partnerships  at Palo Alto Networks.‚ÄúThe business threat landscape is evolving rapidly  leading to an increase in the scale and complexity of risks being faced by many of our clients. As organisations move their network security to the cloud  it becomes more difficult to implement holistic security controls. We are excited to be able to work with Palo Alto Networks and offer organisations a clear path towards identity-aware Zero Trust security.By applying and enforcing adaptive and multi-factor authentication at the network edge  and by responding to and stopping untrusted access events in real-time  Thales and Palo Alto Networks ensure organisations can make the move to the cloud successfully and securely ‚Äù concluded Francois Lasnier  VP Access Management Products at Thales.For businesses looking to roll out Zero Trust frameworks within their networks  Thales and Palo Alto Networks security solutions are available to integrate now.

All are expected to go on to full-time roles in the industry after completing their education.On the international front  Exclusive has partnered with Guardia in Europe to launch the first private cybersecurity academy in France where it will help in the development of course content as well as providing mentoring and internship opportunities for students.

It's time for the industry to put its money where its mouth is if we want to plug the cyber skills gap any time soon. We also need to look for answers beyond the traditional talent pool and attract more diverse  underserved and underrepresented candidates and I applaud this initiative for taking this approach.""Businesses spend $1 trillion a year on IT security  but the threat posed by ransomware  phishing  malware  denial-of-service and other attacks continues to grow. Yet it is estimated that damages from cyber-attacks in 2021 were $6 trillion.

June 6  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today  Peet's ‚Ä¶,"""This responsible sourcing achievement is the result of a multi-year data collection process to verify the conditions and practices of the more than 59 000  mostly small coffee farms in 24 regions around the world who supply coffee beans for Peet's Coffee "" said Doug Welsh  Vice President and Roastmaster.In 2016 Peet's Coffee began working with Enveritas because the non-profit offers a different way of addressing sustainability - an approach where producers access free verification of their practices  while encouraging a deeper understanding and commitment to solving the most challenging sustainability issues in their local community. Working collaboratively  Peet's and Enveritas designed a custom coffee-specific verification program that uses  among other techniques  artificial intelligence (AI) and geo-spatial technology to gather independent  data-rich reports of conditions on coffee farms. These conditions are verified against 30 sustainability standards set by Enveritas  which has performed more than 20 000 annual audits across Peet's coffee supply chain. Peet's shares the results of these audits with its suppliers and  if issues are identified  collaborates with importers  governments  non-profits  competitors and  most importantly  its farmer partners to develop impact projects tailored to the needs of farmers and their communities. Peet's currently operates 39 social and environmental impact programs in 24 regions.""Coffee is more than a source of energy or enjoyment for the millions of people worldwide who farm coffee for their livelihood  as a family legacy and way of life "" said Welsh. ""At Peet's  responsible sourcing requires that we identify challenges  invest in projects that improve lives  and then measure that progress. The reach of this accomplishment ‚Äì applying consistent sustainability standards to all the coffee we roast ‚Äì is just the beginning. If we can achieve this across our global system at Peet's  other coffee roasters can as well. Our collaborative approach will help advance progress and create more tailored  relevant support for coffee farmers and their home communities.""Over several decades  Peet's Coffee's sourcing experts  led by Welsh  have worked to better understand challenging social and environmental conditions on coffee farms and the impact on smallholder farmers  who produce more than 60% of the world's coffee. Peet's Coffee has established viable sourcing systems and partnerships with highly credible organizations including World Coffee Research  TechnoServe and Enveritas to inform the company's practices and achieve greater reach in improving coffee production.""Many coffee companies are satisfied with paying for a label that says their coffee is certified  but few companies are actually tracking that data to determine opportunities for change and real progress "" said David Browning  CEO of Enveritas. ""Peet's Coffee came to us several years ago with the challenge to customize a data collection system to track actual practices in the regions where they source coffee beans. The company wanted to know with certainty how Peet's coffee is grown and then help improve conditions within each community through targeted projects. The verification audits we perform are rigorous  and the data details actual practices in place for accuracy and year-over-year analysis. It is a model that will help individual producers and the industry evolve to better address climate change and other associated  complex challenges.""Accelerating Peet's Coffee's pioneering collaboration with Enveritas  global partner  JDE Peet's (EURONEXT: JDEP)  recently announced it will increase its responsibly sourced coffee from 30% to 80% by the end of 2022.Peet's Coffee will continue to provide timely updates on its efforts to drive positive impact.

Investors agree on what ""credit events"" trigger payouts for them when they enter into a credit default swap.The Kremlin had then sent a $564 million paymenton the principal and interest accrued before the due date. But the payment did not cover the $1.9 million of interest accrued after the due date  putting Russia closer to a default.""The debt committee resolved by supermajority that a Failure to Pay Credit Event has occurred with respect to the Russian Federation "" the committee said.This debt was still outstanding after the 30-day grace period elapsed  causing bondholders to send a default notice to the international clearing house and depository Euroclear PLC The debt committee ruled on Tuesday that a ""Failure to Pay Credit Event"" had occurred on May 19  and will meet on Wednesday to decide how credit default swaps will pay out.Members of the committee include representatives of banks and investment managers  including Goldman Sachs International  Credit Suisse and Pacific Investment Management Co . LLC.The committee  which covers Europe  the Middle East and Africa  is formed under the auspices of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association   a global standards-setter. The panel had previously found a """" event had occurred after it paid in rubles on bonds denominated in dollars  possibly causing a default if Russia did not pay after a 30-day grace period.The Kremlin was forced to make bond payments in May before it was necessary after the U.S.Treasury signaled it would let the license Russia relies on for debt payments expire into a technical default.The failure to pay may leave bondholdersfor recourse as Russia did not waive its sovereign immunity in the bond  making it difficult for creditors to sue over defaults and collect what they are owed.The debt committee had previously ruled that Russia's state-owned railway operator RZD OAO was theto default on bond debt since Russian troops invaded Ukraine  after it failed to make the payment through an Irish subsidiary due to Western sanctions.Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees are made up of 10 companies that create derivatives and five voting companies that purchase derivatives  alongside observer members that are involved in these transactions.

Around every corner investors have been faced with a new surprise to navigate. Just as in dodgeball  where players run for cover to avoid the sting of those dreaded balls  equity investors have flocked to the safety of defensive stocks in 2022. Year to date defensives have outperformed value  growth and cyclical stocks  doing what they are supposed to do in uncertain times: offer equity investors a shield against the onslaught of valuation pressures  slowing earnings growth and increased uncertainty. As we continue to brace ourselves for ongoing volatility in equity markets  we prefer to maintain exposure to selective stocks with defensive characteristics ‚Äì those that are winning by not losing. Deutsche Boerse and Merck & Co are two such examples.The big de-rating might not be overGlobal equity markets have de-rated since the recent peak in September 2020  with a sharper deceleration in 2022 driven by rising inflation fears as reflected in higher 10-year bond yields. In fact  most major market indices are now trading below their pre-Covid valuation levels. The derating has been particularly evident in the more expensive parts of the market  such as Technology stocks. For example  the Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen by -25% so far this year  with most of this occurring through forward PE multiples contracting from ~32 to ~23x currently. In comparison  the S&P 500 has fallen 16% and contracted from ~22x to ~17x over the same time frame.All major equity markets have derated sharply YTD to below pre-Covid levelsSource: Bloomberg  10 May 2022Despite this overall market de-rating  most major indices are still trading in line or above their 20-year averages and remain relatively high when considering the sharp rise in 10-year yields (see chart below). The Russia Ukraine War has also recently pushed commodity prices to new highs  raising inflation risks and potentially placing further pressure on market valuations.Valuations may be at more risk as bond yields continue to surgeSource: Bloomberg  10 May 2022Investors‚Äô fears are shifting from inflation to growthUS GDP has surged past prior cycle peaks but is now decelerating sharply. Similarly  while 1Q22 earnings were modestly ahead of expectations on average  management commentary and guidance about the outlook has been increasingly cautious  prompting analysts to downgrade earnings forecasts for both ‚Äô22 and ‚Äò23. In fact  earnings revisions breath has been declining since August 2021 and has recently moved outright negative. Given the wide range of headwinds companies currently face  which include cost pressures  supply chain constraints  inventory build ups and potentially weaker demand from higher prices and lower global growth  it‚Äôs likely that earnings revisions will remain negative for the foreseeable future. This has historically been associated with weak overall market performance (see below).Earnings Revisions and Price are highly correlatedSource: Alphinity  Bloomberg  3 May 2022Earnings leadership has taken another step to being more defensiveAt a sector level  we have however seen a sharp contrast with the classic defensive sectors  such as Utilities and Consumer Staples outperforming the overall market year to date  driven by a superior ratings performance as well as better earnings revisions versus their cyclical peers and the broader market (excluding the Energy and Materials). Defensives have a strong track record of outperforming during slowing growth/recessionary periods  a relative safe-haven within periods of market stress. With a broad range of defensives already reflecting these benefits in relatively high valuations  active investors need to remain nimble and look for new opportunities. Some of these might not be seen as typical defensive plays  such as Merck & Co referred to below  but they offer defensive characteristics that should bode well in a volatile environment. One such defensive earnings leader is Deutsche Boerse.Just as in a dodgeball game  there are certain times in the market cycle when it is not always about running the fastest  but also about finding the best places to hide.Deutsche Boerse- Leading stock exchange enjoying multiple cyclical & structural tailwindsDeutsche Boerse (DB1) is a high-quality owner of various key pieces of financial market infrastructure in Europe across pre-trading  trading & clearing and post-trading. These assets include Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)  Eurex (leading European financial derivative exchange)  EEX (a commodities trading & clearing exchange)  Xetra (cash equities) and Clearstream (a leading European settlement & custody provider). These businesses all tend to command dominant or leading market positions within their segments  and as such enjoy significant barriers to entry and high margins. These diversified businesses generate resilient mid-cycle digit % secular growth  which we expect to be further boosted by various cyclical tailwinds  including both higher interest rates and higher interest rate volatility  as well as further targeted M&A. Consequently  we expect the company to exceed management‚Äôs net income growth target of 10% (CAGR) for FY19-23E. With positive earnings revisions and a relatively undemanding valuation multiple (current forward PE of ~21x)  we continue to see more upside for DB1 in the current environment.Deutsche Boerse ‚Äì More defensive Earnings supported by several cyclical and structural factorsSource: Bloomberg  10 May 2022Merck & Co- A high quality defensive with flagship growth products & consistent earningsMerck & Co (MRK) is a global pharmaceutical company that delivers health solutions through its prescription medicines  vaccines  biologic therapies  animal health and consumer care products. MRK recently reported an impressive 1Q22 result with both revenue and earnings beating consensus expectations and the company raising 2022 guidance for both despite an expected FX headwind  driven by strength across the portfolio.

The big de-rating might not be over Global equity markets have de-rated since the recent peak in September 2020  with a sharper deceleration in 2022 driven by rising inflation fears as reflected in ...,by Elfreda Jonker ‚Äì Client Portfolio ManagerInvesting in global equity markets have felt like playing a game of dodgeball over the last few two years. Around every corner investors have been faced with a new surprise to navigate. Just as in dodgeball  where players run for cover to avoid the sting of those dreaded balls  equity investors have flocked to the safety of defensive stocks in 2022. Year to date defensives have outperformed value  growth and cyclical stocks  doing what they are supposed to do in uncertain times: offer equity investors a shield against the onslaught of valuation pressures  slowing earnings growth and increased uncertainty. As we continue to brace ourselves for ongoing volatility in equity markets  we prefer to maintain exposure to selective stocks with defensive characteristics ‚Äì those that are winning by not losing. Deutsche Boerse and Merck & Co are two such examples.The big de-rating might not be overGlobal equity markets have de-rated since the recent peak in September 2020  with a sharper deceleration in 2022 driven by rising inflation fears as reflected in higher 10-year bond yields. In fact  most major market indices are now trading below their pre-Covid valuation levels. The derating has been particularly evident in the more expensive parts of the market  such as Technology stocks. For example  the Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen by -25% so far this year  with most of this occurring through forward PE multiples contracting from ~32 to ~23x currently. In comparison  the S&P 500 has fallen 16% and contracted from ~22x to ~17x over the same time frame.All major equity markets have derated sharply YTD to below pre-Covid levelsSource: Bloomberg  10 May 2022Despite this overall market de-rating  most major indices are still trading in line or above their 20-year averages and remain relatively high when considering the sharp rise in 10-year yields (see chart below). The Russia Ukraine War has also recently pushed commodity prices to new highs  raising inflation risks and potentially placing further pressure on market valuations.Valuations may be at more risk as bond yields continue to surgeSource: Bloomberg  10 May 2022Investors‚Äô fears are shifting from inflation to growthUS GDP has surged past prior cycle peaks but is now decelerating sharply. Similarly  while 1Q22 earnings were modestly ahead of expectations on average  management commentary and guidance about the outlook has been increasingly cautious  prompting analysts to downgrade earnings forecasts for both ‚Äô22 and ‚Äò23. In fact  earnings revisions breath has been declining since August 2021 and has recently moved outright negative. Given the wide range of headwinds companies currently face  which include cost pressures  supply chain constraints  inventory build ups and potentially weaker demand from higher prices and lower global growth  it‚Äôs likely that earnings revisions will remain negative for the foreseeable future. This has historically been associated with weak overall market performance (see below).Earnings Revisions and Price are highly correlatedSource: Alphinity  Bloomberg  3 May 2022Earnings leadership has taken another step to being more defensiveAt a sector level  we have however seen a sharp contrast with the classic defensive sectors  such as Utilities and Consumer Staples outperforming the overall market year to date  driven by a superior ratings performance as well as better earnings revisions versus their cyclical peers and the broader market (excluding the Energy and Materials). Defensives have a strong track record of outperforming during slowing growth/recessionary periods  a relative safe-haven within periods of market stress. With a broad range of defensives already reflecting these benefits in relatively high valuations  active investors need to remain nimble and look for new opportunities. Some of these might not be seen as typical defensive plays  such as Merck & Co referred to below  but they offer defensive characteristics that should bode well in a volatile environment. One such defensive earnings leader is Deutsche Boerse.Just as in a dodgeball game  there are certain times in the market cycle when it is not always about running the fastest  but also about finding the best places to hide.Deutsche Boerse- Leading stock exchange enjoying multiple cyclical & structural tailwindsDeutsche Boerse (DB1) is a high-quality owner of various key pieces of financial market infrastructure in Europe across pre-trading  trading & clearing and post-trading. These assets include Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)  Eurex (leading European financial derivative exchange)  EEX (a commodities trading & clearing exchange)  Xetra (cash equities) and Clearstream (a leading European settlement & custody provider). These businesses all tend to command dominant or leading market positions within their segments  and as such enjoy significant barriers to entry and high margins. These diversified businesses generate resilient mid-cycle digit % secular growth  which we expect to be further boosted by various cyclical tailwinds  including both higher interest rates and higher interest rate volatility  as well as further targeted M&A. Consequently  we expect the company to exceed management‚Äôs net income growth target of 10% (CAGR) for FY19-23E.

In addition  the number of feature animation projects in production has grown from two in 2019 to six features in 2022;At the Mill  whose activity is closely related to advertising spending  activity growth is being slowed by the current global economic environment. As a result  the Mill is now expecting slower growth than initially anticipated over the period  with the main impact in 2022. Actions to mitigate the impact on margin have already been identified and initiated relating to costs and operational efficiencies;At Technicolor Games  demand for games content is expected to continue growing  along with the expansion of the Technicolor Games offer to preproduction  game assets creation  animation  VFX  and in-engine integration  with co-development and quality assurance (‚ÄúQA‚Äù) services.Story continuesSignificant investment in artist recruitment  retention  and training (including TCS Academy programs) continues  with delivery of all pipeline projects remaining the main challenge for 2022  as a consequence of the shortage of talent in the market.These trends were associated with a higher volatility in the financial environment of the Group  mainly in the valuation of its main currencies - notably the US dollar  the Canadian dollar  and the British pound ‚Äì which have evolved favorably since the beginning of the year.In light of the market trends highlighted above  the Company is publishing the following forward looking assumptions for TCS:2022 2023 Previous forward looking assumptions2 New forward looking assumptions using previous exchange rates3 New forward looking assumptions using end of April exchange rates4 Previous forward looking assumptions2 New forward looking assumptions using previous exchange rates3 New forward looking assumptions using end of April exchange rates4 Adjusted EBITDA5 176-186 165-175 175-185 210-220 185-205 200-220 Adjusted EBITA 78-88 65-75 75-85 106-116 85-105 95-115 Free Cash Flow before Tax and Financial 100-110 70-80 75-85 125-135 100-120 110-130As part of the proposed carve-out  TCS is planning to review its key performance indicators (KPI)  notably including an adjusted EBITDA after lease  with the goal of becoming more comparable with its peers and market practices  whilst being more aligned with the way the business is managed. New KPIs will be presented as part of the Capital Markets Day on June 14th  2022.Underlying market assumptions for Technicolor Ex-TCS remain unchanged  and therefore result in forward looking assumptions for Technicolor Ex-TCS being broadly unchanged with:2022 2023 Previous forward looking assumptions2 New forward looking assumptions using previous exchange rates6 New forward looking assumptions using end of April exchange rates4 Previous forward looking assumptions2 New forward looking assumptions using previous exchange rates6 New forward looking assumptions using end of April exchange rates4 Adjusted EBITDA5 >140 >140 >150 >135 >140 >150 Adjusted EBITA 38-48 38-48 48-58 29-39 29-39 40-50 Free Cash Flow before Tax and Financial 62-72 62-72 72-82 43-63 43-63 53-73As communicated on May 24th  both the refinancing and the spin-off are expected to be completed in Q3 2022  subject to (i) the shareholders‚Äô approval of the terms of the spin-off  (ii) the completion of the refinancing discussions with creditors on terms satisfactory to Technicolor Ex-TCS and TCS and (iii) customary conditions  consultations and regulatory approvals.Indicative TimetableCapital Market Day for Technicolor Ex-TCS and TCSTechnicolor‚Äôs Shareholders‚Äô meetingH1 2022 resultsTechnicolor‚Äôs Distribution Shareholders‚Äô MeetingDistribution of the TCS shares June 14th  2022June 30th  2022July 28th  2022Q3  2022Q3  2022###Warning: Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

In preclinical studies  THR-149 effectively blocked the release of bradykinin in the vitreous and reduced the level of edema and retinal vascular leakage in rodent models.Results: IVT-PK and IV-PK data were analyzed based on a mono-compartmental pharmacokinetic model  leading to ocular and systemic half-lives of 36 h and 1.1 h  respectively. The model indicates IVT administration of THR-149 reduces the four DME disease hallmarks: retinal vascular leakage  retinal edema  retinal inflammation and reactive gliosis.THR-149 is being developed as a potential new standard of care for the up to 50% of diabetic macular edema (DME) patients showing suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy. Oxurion is currently evaluating THR-149 for the treatment of DME in Part B  the second part of its two-part Phase 2 KALAHARI trial.About OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is a biopharmaceutical company developing next generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies  which are designed to improve and better preserve vision in patients with retinal disorders including diabetic macular edema (DME)  the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  as well as other conditions. Oxurion intends to play an important role in the treatment of retinal disorders  including the successful development of THR-149  its novel therapeutic for the treatment of DME. THR-149 is a potent plasma kallikrein inhibitor being developed as a potential new standard of care for the up to 50% of DME patients showing suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy.

TG4050 is based on Transgene‚Äôs myvac¬Æ platform and powered by NEC‚Äôs cutting-edge AI capabilities.These additional positive initial data  including molecular (ctDNA) response  have been generated from the first patients with ovarian cancer and HPV-negative head and neck cancer enrolled in the two ongoing Phase I trials assessing TG4050. They were presented in-person in Chicago  IL  June 5  2022.‚ÄúThese new results  though early  are very encouraging‚Äù said Dr. Maud Brandely  MD  PhD  Chief Medical Officer of Transgene. ‚ÄúSo far we accumulated promising preliminary data with TG4050: good tolerability  consistent immunogenicity and encouraging molecular response. We are particularly impressed by the effective priming of the immune system and the early signs of clinical activity. These results suggest that our individualized vaccine  TG4050  has the potential to extend the remission period  thus providing a new hope for cancer patients. In addition  the information we gather from the two ongoing Phase I studies will be pivotal in designing the Phase II trial of TG4050 which could start as early as 2023.‚ÄùProf. Jean-Pierre Delord  MD  PhD  General Manager of IUCT Oncopole of Toulouse and first author of the poster  added: ‚ÄúNeoantigen vaccination such as TG4050 is a relevant strategy for the treatment of patients with high risk of cancer relapse for whom the medical need is particularly high. In this setting  the vaccine is expected to deliver clinical benefit by controlling the residual disease. To date  this non-invasive treatment is well tolerated by the patients and although preliminary  the data presented at ASCO clearly suggest that TG4050 could become a new treatment option for cancer patients. I am looking forward to seeing this potential game-changing therapy moving forward.‚ÄùFor the first time  ctDNA data were generated following treatment with TG4050Liquid biopsies were performed to measure the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels. ctDNA is an emerging modality that is used to detect subclinical disease or asymptomatic relapse in an increasing number of indications. Use of such highly sensitive and specific marker seeks to identify patients whose disease is very likely to relapse in the near future  before their disease becomes detectable with current standard methods such as imaging. Moreover  it allows a non-invasive monitoring of treatment effectiveness. For instance  in at least one ovarian cancer patient in the study  a decline in ctDNA was concomitant with CA-125 normalization and disease control. Analyses are ongoing in more recently included patients.Clinical follow-up data continue to demonstrate the potential of TG4050 in ovarian and head and neck cancer patientsIn the head and neck cancer trial  patients were randomized to immediately receive vaccination with TG4050 (early treatment arm  arm A) or at relapse (delayed vaccination arm  arm B). All evaluable patients randomized to arm A (n=8) are still in complete response as of mid-May 2022. In arm B (n=8)  two patients have experienced relapse.In the ovarian cancer trial (n=5)  a fifth patient initiated her treatment with TG4050 recently. One patient treated after an elevation of CA-125 experienced a normalization of CA-125 without clinical progression for 9 months until death from an unrelated chronic illness. Another patient was treated upon onset of radiological evidence of relapse and remained stable for 11.4 months.To date  the vaccine has been well tolerated and no related Serious Adverse Events have been reported across the two studies.In both clinical studies  enrollment and patient dosing are progressing in line with our expectations. Overall  Transgene plans to treat 13 patients in the ovarian cancer trial and 30 patients in the head and neck cancer trial.Immune cell response data demonstrated an effective priming of the immune system which is associated with disease regressionTransgene presented a comprehensive set of immunological data at ASCO. Circulating immune cells quantification (in particular monocytes  DC  NK cells  subcells of CD8  CD4  Treg) and expression of immune checkpoints (ICOS and PD1) suggest that the vaccine is able to effectively induce innate and adaptive immune responses in patients.In an ovarian cancer patient  clinical resolution and biological responses (CA-125 and ctDNA responses) were concomitant to an immune response against multiple epitopes and to the onset of markers of an effective immune response (switch in circulating CD4 and CD8 cells toward an effector phenotype  increase in CD16neg NK cells; peak in circulating cytokines).All evaluable patients developed a robust T-cell response against multiple targeted neoantigens (median of 10 positive responses per patient). T-cell responses were observed for class I and class II epitopes  they consisted of de novo responses and amplifications of preexisting responses.The poster can be downloaded from the ASCO and Transgene websites.Poster title: Phase 1 studies of personalized neoantigen vaccine TG4050 in ovarian carcinoma (OC) and head and neck carcinoma (HNSCC)Abstract number: 26372637 Session title : Developmental Therapeutics‚ÄîImmunotherapy: Developmental Therapeutics‚ÄîImmunotherapy Authors : J.P.

Yamagata  Y. Tanaka  B. Malone  E. Quemeneur  K. Bendjama***About the clinical trialsTG4050 is being evaluated in two Phase I clinical trials for patients with ovarian cancer (NCT03839524) and HPV-negative head and neck cancers (NCT04183166).In a first Phase I trial  TG4050 is being administered to patients with HPV-negative head and neck cancer. A personalized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive an adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants receive their vaccine immediately after they complete their adjuvant treatment.

If no choice was made during this election period  the dividend will be paid in cash. Both the dividend in cash and the dividend in shares will be made payable to shareholders from June 8  2022.For 44.5% of the currently outstanding shares  an election was made for a share dividend  resulting in the issuance of 14 174 568 new common shares. Upon distribution of the dividend shares  the total issued share capital will amount to EUR 179 614 707.40  representing 898 073 537 common shares.As communicated earlier   Philips intends to have 19 571 218 shares delivered through the early settlement of forward contracts in the remainder of 2022. These forward contracts were entered into as part of the EUR 1.5 billion share repurchase program for capital reduction purposes  as announced on July 26  2021. Philips expects to cancel a total of 28 329 673 shares (including 8 758 455 treasury shares already held) before the end of the year  which would result in 869 743 864 issued common shares at year-end 2022 (2021: 883 898 969).

This transition is based on a solid culture of...,"Beter Bed Holding NVBeter Bed is working hard to develop its strategic positioning as a market-leading sleep specialist. This transition is based on a solid culture of innovation and experimentation. Thijs Nootenboom  responsible for E-commerce at Beter Bed  regards the nomination as recognition of the steps Beter Bed has taken in experimenting and creating a sustainable innovation infrastructure.Experimentation as a mindsetAt the heart of this successful innovation culture is the experimentation programme initiated by the e-commerce team several years ago. The experimentation programme has  among other things  resulted in the creation of an excellent infrastructure and a streamlined business process for testing hypotheses in a short cycle. This provides opportunities to effectively cash in on current and future e-commerce opportunities and to achieve the ambitious online targets (sales of at least ‚Ç¨ 100 million by 2025). With the launch of LUNEXT  Beter Bed's digital organisation  the conditions have been created for scaling up experiments  once validated  quickly and efficiently to the business. The focus is no longer exclusively on ROI but also on supporting the business with validated decision-making.""Lessons learned from the experiments are shared with the entire organisation so that everyone can learn from them "" says Thijs Nootenboom. ""Experimentation has now become a mindset at Beter Bed  allowing the impact and deployment of strategic initiatives to be iteratively tested. It's embedded in our daily activities thanks to the close cooperation between the development team and the commercial teams. This prevents internal debates about resources and capacity  increases the speed of testing and leads to better results. In the coming year  experimentation will be even more emphatically on the agenda as we enter into dialogue with other departments and share relevant lessons with each other. The prestigious nomination for the Experimentation Culture Awards 2022 strengthens our confidence that we are on the right track. This is a big compliment to the teams driving the development of an experimentation culture within Beter Bed Holding.""Story continuesExperimentation Culture Awards 2022The experimentation programme and the development team's role as accelerator are what prompted the Experimentation Culture Awards expert jury to nominate Beter Bed in the ""Organisation-wide"" category. Other nominees are Marks & Spencer (UK)  TL (Switzerland)  ASOS (UK) and Vattenfall Netherlands. The Experimentation Culture Award was established in 2020 with the aim of promoting a culture of experimentation around the world and helping people to achieve a reliable  evidence-based decision-making process. The organisation does this by sharing inspirational stories of experimentation growth and by nominating individuals  teams and organisations that deserve to be recognised for their work. The awards will be presented online on 7 July 2022.About Beter Bed HoldingBeter Bed Holding (BBH) is the Netherlands‚Äô leading sleep specialist in retail  wholesale and B2B.Our mission is simple.

Astrocast  with a network ...,Consolidation in the satellite IoT space  already  and again; Swiss satellite IoT operator Astrocast has agreed a deal to acquire busy Dutch industrial IoT scale-up Hiber. Astrocast  with a network of 12 nanosatellites as it stands  has a stated plan to have 20 in orbit by the end of 2022  40 by the end of 2023  and 100 by 2025. It expects the deal for Hiber to close ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù following a public offering on Euronext Growth Paris later this year.Astrocast  founded in 2014  has L-band spectrum at 1-2 GHz  at the top end of the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) range  via a relationship with UAE-based mobile-satellite service provider Thuraya. It serves the agriculture  maritime  and utilities markets  as well as providing connectivity for environmental monitoring. Hiber  founded in 2016  makes IoT solutions for remote industry  combining sensors  analytics  and satellite connectivity.Astrocast makes its products in-house  from the satellites to the terminals; its headline ultra-low power Astronode S module was developed in combination with Airbus  CEA/LETI  and ESA. It said the deal for Hiber  which secured ‚Ç¨26 million in EU and private investment in 2021  and announced at the end of 2021 it will use Inmarsat‚Äôs ELERA satellite IoT network to expand its own Hiberband-branded low-power IoT network  will accelerate its in-house OEM strategy.Astrocast has agreed to acquire all of Hiber‚Äôs shares in exchange for the issuance of new Astrocast shares  representing 16.5 percent of Astrocast‚Äôs share capital  calculated prior to its public offering on Euronext Growth Paris. Hiber‚Äôs shareholders also agreed to invest ‚Ç¨10.45 million in Astrocast‚Äôs public offering. Astrocast expects to have raised ‚Ç¨60-‚Ç¨80 million  already  with an initial offering on Euronext Growth Oslo earlier this year.Astrocast wants to use the new funding round to complete the deployment of its satellite IoT network  and to ‚Äúramp-up‚Äù commercial activities. Future constellation launches and upgrades are targeted to be funded from cash flow from operations and debt  it said. Its existing constellation includes 12 satellites  10 of which provide commercial IoT services on an international scale  it claims. When the network reaches 20-30 in satellites  it will offer latency of less than 15 minutes ‚Äì ‚Äúwhich satisfies most IoT use cases ‚Äù it said.It is negotiating an extension on its L-band spectrum agreement  it said  to ‚Äúsignificantly de-risk‚Äù its business plan. Prospective customers are receiving development kits to test various IoT applications. The company has a partnership agreement with Telefonica  among others  with the ‚Äúpotential to connect thousands of maritime shipping containers‚Ä¶ through the Astrocast network‚Äù.Hiber provides satellite-connected IoT modules for industrial asset monitoring and tracking. Its fledgling Hiberband network was developed initially under its own steam  including via its ‚Ç¨26 million EU investment  in combination with the Dutch government  as a part of its ‚Ç¨278 million European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund. Its HiberEasypulse system claims to offer cheap IoT connectivity for tracking and monitoring in remote locations.Its HiberHeavy solution  released in March  is geared for monitoring heavy equipment  also in remote locations  where mobile coverage fails. Both are targeted at the oil and gas  forestry  mining  and military sectors  among others. Royal Dutch Shell announced in September it is using the HiberHilo solution to monitor the condition of offshore oil wells. The solution has been installed at Shell operations in the North Sea.It has a joint venture around the HiberHilo product with solution provider WTS Energy  which sells digital change solutions to the oil and gas sector; WTS Energy claims 1 250 consultants in 18 countries.Fabien Jordan  chief executive at Astrocast  said: ‚ÄúHiber is recognised as a powerful IoT scale-up within the market. [Its] focus on satellite-enabled IoT solutions  innovation and production aligns with Astrocast‚Äôs strategic go-to-market priorities for 2022 and beyond‚Ä¶ Astrocast will gain access to customer segments that we have historically had little traction with. These segments complement Astrocast‚Äôs current sales effort. In addition  this acquisition will strengthen financing opportunities for Astrocast  benefiting investors  and accelerating the total fundraising plan for Astrocast.‚ÄùRoel Jansen  chief executive at Hiber  said: ‚ÄúHiber brings IoT solutions to its customers located in the most remote locations on earth; we are democratizing data for industries that previously did not have access to affordable and easy-to-use solutions via satellites. We are excited to join forces with Astrocast to continue developing and providing world-class IoT solutions that are unrivalled in service excellence and product innovation within the IoT space.‚Äù,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.18,0.31,0.51,True,English,"['Dutch IoT scale-up', 'Enterprise IoT Insights', 'satellite network', 'Astrocast', 'Hiber', 'funds', 'headline ultra-low power Astronode S module', 'busy Dutch industrial IoT scale-up Hiber', 'Swiss satellite IoT operator', 'most IoT use cases', 'UAE-based mobile-satellite service provider', '‚Ç¨278 million European Innovation Council', 'Hiberband-branded low-power IoT network', 'ELERA satellite IoT network', 'powerful IoT scale-up', 'industrial asset monitoring', 'various IoT applications', 'satellite-connected IoT modules', 'Royal Dutch Shell', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'new funding round', 'current sales effort', 'satellite IoT space', 'commercial IoT services', 'satellite-enabled IoT solutions', 'world-class IoT solutions', 'fledgling Hiberband network', 'Future constellation launches', 'digital change solutions', 'cheap IoT connectivity', 'house OEM strategy', 'maritime shipping containers', '‚Ç¨26 million EU investment', 'total fundraising plan', 'offshore oil wells', 'L-band spectrum agreement', 'new Astrocast shares', 'Dutch government', 'use solutions', 'satellite connectivity', 'service excellence', 'solution provider', 'private investment', 'commercial activities', 'existing constellation', 'partnership agreement', 'product innovation', 'public offering', '1-2 GHz', 'ultrahigh frequency', 'UHF) range', 'utilities markets', 'environmental monitoring', 'remote industry', 'share capital', 'initial offering', 'cash flow', 'international scale', 'business plan', 'development kits', 'EIC) Fund', 'HiberEasypulse system', 'remote locations', 'heavy equipment', 'mobile coverage', 'military sectors', 'Shell operations', 'North Sea', 'joint venture', 'HiberHilo product', 'WTS Energy', 'Fabien Jordan', 'chief executive', 'little traction', 'financing opportunities', 'Roel Jansen', 'HiberHeavy solution', 'HiberHilo solution', 'Astrocast network', 'Prospective customers', 'gas sector', 'market priorities', 'customer segments', 'top end', 'Consolidation', 'deal', '12 nanosatellites', 'orbit', 'relationship', 'Thuraya', 'agriculture', 'sensors', 'analytics', 'products', 'terminals', 'combination', 'Airbus', 'CEA/LETI', 'ESA', 'Inmarsat', 'exchange', 'issuance', '16.5 percent', 'shareholders', 'deployment', 'upgrades', 'debt', '12 satellites', 'latency', 'less', '15 minutes', 'extension', 'company', 'Telefonica', 'others', 'potential', 'thousands', 'tracking', 'steam', 'March', 'forestry', 'mining', 'September', 'condition', '1,250 consultants', '18 countries', 'focus', 'production', 'strategic', 'access', 'addition', 'acquisition', 'investors', 'earth', 'data', 'industries', 'affordable', 'easy-to', 'forces', '2022']",2022-06-07,2022-06-07,enterpriseiotinsights.com

In 2021  organisations worldwide were using an average amount of 110 software as a service (SaaS) applications2  compared with just eight in 2015  showcasing a startlingly rapid increase. There has been a notable expansion in the use of multiple IaaS providers  with almost three-quarters (72%) of businesses using multiple IaaS providers  up from 57% the year before. The use of multiple providers has almost doubled in the last year  with one in five (20%) of respondents reporting using three or more providers.Despite their increasing prevalence and use  businesses share common concerns about the increasing complexity of cloud services with the majority (51%) of IT professionals agreeing that it is more complex to manage privacy and data protection in the cloud. Additionally  the journey to the cloud is also becoming more complex  with the percentage of respondents reporting that they‚Äôre expecting to lift and shift  the simplest of migration tactics  dropping from 55% in 2021 to 24% currently.Security Challenges of Multicloud ComplexityWith increasing complexity comes an even greater need for robust cybersecurity. When asked what percentage of their sensitive data is stored in the cloud  a solid majority (66%) said between 21-60%. However  only a quarter (25%) said they could fully classify all data.Additionally  nearly a third (32%) of respondents admitted to having to issue a breach notification to a government agency  customer  partner or employees. This should be a cause for concern among enterprises with sensitive data  particularly in highly regulated industries.Cyber-attacks also present an ongoing risk to cloud applications and data. Respondents reported an increasing prevalence of attacks  with a quarter (26%) citing an increase in malware  25% in ransomware and one-fifth (19%) reporting seeing an increase in phishing/ whaling.Protecting Sensitive DataWhen it comes to securing data in multicloud environments  IT professionals view encryption as a critical security control. The majority of respondents cited encryption (59%) and key management (52%) as the security technologies they currently use to protect sensitive data in the cloud.However  when asked what percentage of their data in the cloud is encrypted  only one in ten (11%) of respondents said between 81-100% is encrypted. Additionally  key management platform sprawl may be an issue for enterprises. Only 10% of respondents use one to two platforms  90% use three or more  and almost one in five (17%) admitted using eight or more platforms.Encryption should be a priority area for enterprises to focus on when it comes to securing data in the cloud. In fact  40% of respondents stated that they were able to avoid the breach notification process because the stolen or leaked data was encrypted or tokenised  showcasing the tangible value of encryption platforms.Additionally  it is encouraging to see signs enterprises embrace Zero Trust and investing accordingly. Nearly a third of respondents (29%) said they are already executing a Zero Trust strategy  a quarter (27%) said they are evaluating and planning one and  23% said they are considering it. This is a positive result  but there is certainly still room to grow.Sebastien Cano  Senior Vice President for Cloud Protection and Licensing activities at Thales said: ‚ÄúThe complexity of managing multicloud environments cannot be overstated. Additionally  the growing importance of data sovereignty is increasingly raising questions for CISOs and Data Protection Officers when considering their cloud strategy  governance  and risk management. The challenge is not only where the sensitive data resides geographically  but even who has access to sensitive data inside the organisation.There are various solutions such as encryption and key management. Last but not least  continuing to embrace a Zero Trust strategy will be essential in securing these complex environments  helping to ensure organisations can support their data and manage future challenges.‚ÄùThales and 451 Research will discuss the findings in more detail during a webinar on 23 June 2022.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) for children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Regulatory filings for this age group are underway by the European Medicines Agency and regulatory authorities in additional countries.""Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in babies and young children is more than just a rash ‚Äì the intense itch can make them scratch uncontrollably throughout the day and night and cause their skin to crack and bleed "" said Julie Block  President and Chief Executive Officer at National Eczema Association. ""Caregivers do their best to manage skincare routines multiple times a day  but for many  topical treatments are not enough. We're pleased to see how scientific innovation and research continues to address unmet needs for the atopic dermatitis community  and we're hopeful for the positive impact Dupixent can have for these children and their families.""Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Eighty-five to ninety percent of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  and crusting and oozing. In the U.S.  more than 75 000 children aged 5 years and younger have uncontrolled moderate-to-severe disease and are most in need of new treatment options. Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of a young child and their caregivers.""Young children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis are a significantly underserved population of patients  who spend vulnerable years of their lives suffering through the relentless and far-reaching effects of this chronic disease "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Dupixent has changed the atopic dermatitis treatment paradigm ‚Äì significantly clearing skin and reducing itch ‚Äì by targeting an underlying cause of this disease without broadly suppressing the immune system. Today's approval brings the proven efficacy and  importantly  well-established safety profile of Dupixent to these young children  making it the first of its kind to be approved for any U.S. patient aged six months or older living with this debilitating disease.""""Until today  treatment options in the U.S. for infants and children under the age of 6 suffering from moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis have been limited to topical steroids ‚Äì which may be associated with significant safety risks when used long-term. This has left patients and their caregivers in desperate need of medicines that can better address the chronic  long-term nature of the disease "" Naimish Patel  M.D  Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""These young people  and their families  often struggle to cope with the significant impact itch can have not only on the body  but on many other facets of daily life. This approval means that Dupixent  with its well-established safety and efficacy profile  is now available to some of the youngest people living with this disease.""The FDA evaluated Dupixent under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions. The approval is based on data that include a Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent every four weeks (200 mg or 300 mg  based on body weight) plus low-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) or TCS alone. The trial met the primary and all secondary endpoints. At 16 weeks  patients who received Dupixent with TCS experienced the following  compared to TCS alone (placebo):28% achieved clear or almost-clear skin compared to 4% with placebo  the primary endpoint.53% achieved 75% or greater improvement in overall disease severity from baseline compared to 11% with placebo  the co-primary endpoint outside of the U.S.48% achieved clinically meaningful reduction in itch compared to 9% with placebo.The safety profile of Dupixent observed through 16 weeks in children aged 6 months to 5 years was similar to the safety profile in patients 6 years and older with atopic dermatitis. The long-term safety profile of Dupixent in children aged 6 months to 5 years through 52 weeks was also similar to the safety profile observed in the pivotal trial and consistent with what was observed in older patients with atopic dermatitis. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease and skin papilloma were  respectively  reported in 5% and 2% of Dupixent patients aged 6 months to 5 years  and none of these cases led to treatment discontinuation.About the Dupixent TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.The primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16. Additional outcome measures included itch reduction  which was assessed using a caregiver-reported 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale  with a clinically meaningful improvement defined as ‚â•4-point improvement at week 16.Children who completed the trials were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension trial to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with Dupixent in this age group.About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 6 months to 5 years  Dupixent is administered with a pre-filled syringe every four weeks based on weight (200 mg for children ‚â•5 to <15 kg and 300 mg for children ‚â•15 to <30 kg). Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home. Dupixent does not require initial lab testing or ongoing lab monitoring.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay¬Æ program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent is approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) or eosinophilic esophagitis in different age populations in a number of countries around the world. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in the European Union and Japan and more than 60 countries. More than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  CRSwNP and eosinophilic esophagitis  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.About Regeneron's VelocImmune¬Æ TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid.
