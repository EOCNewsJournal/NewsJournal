The step came amid Ukraine-related sanctions introduced against Moscow. Later  clearing house Clearstream  which is owned by Deutsche Boerse  followed suit.The volume of assets of non-residents that were blocked in Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD) reportedly exceeded $85 billion  with some $48 billion of the assets being stocks  while the remaining $38 billion accounts for bonds  mainly ruble-denominated sovereign debt (OFZs).Analysts say that the majority of holders of foreign assets in the NSD are local banks  management companies  non-state pension funds and individuals that are holding structural notes and foreign shares.‚ÄúThere is a high probability that payments to holders of Eurobonds in the NSD and Euroclear will be made in rubles  in accordance with the scheme previously announced by the Ministry of Finance  after which they can be converted into foreign currency ‚Äù the strategists of ITI Capital told the media.According to ITI Capital  EU leaders may consider confiscating the blocked assets as part of the bloc‚Äôs anti-Russian penalties.The experts expect Washington to introduce similar sanctions against the NSD  forcing brokers to de-collateralize assets in euros and dollars.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,negative,0.03,0.3,0.67,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,True,English,"['Russian securities', 'Value', 'EU', 'largest financial securities transactions companies', 'ruble-denominated sovereign debt', 'National Settlement Depository', 'non-state pension funds', 'management companies', 'Russian securities', 'Belgium-based settlement', 'foreign investors', '$27 billion worth', 'ITI Capital', 'clearing organization', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'clearing house', 'Deutsche Boerse', '$38 billion accounts', 'local banks', 'structural notes', 'foreign shares', 'high probability', 'foreign currency', 'EU leaders', 'anti-Russian penalties', 'similar sanctions', 'business section', 'Frozen assets', 'foreign assets', 'Euroclear', 'Russians', 'world', 'strategists', 'The', 'suspension', 'March', 'step', 'Moscow', 'Clearstream', 'suit', 'volume', 'non-residents', 'NSD', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'OFZs', 'Analysts', 'majority', 'holders', 'individuals', 'payments', 'rubles', 'accordance', 'scheme', 'Ministry', 'Finance', 'media', 'part', 'bloc', 'experts', 'Washington', 'brokers', 'euros', 'dollars', 'stories', 'economy']",2022-06-07,2022-06-08,rt.com

6086,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.sharecafe.com.au/2022/06/07/winning-by-not-losing/,Winning by Not Losing ‚Äì ShareCafe,1 day ago,by Elfreda Jonker ‚Äì Client Portfolio ManagerInvesting in global equity markets have felt like playing a game of dodgeball over the last few two years. Around every corner investors have been faced with a new surprise to navigate. Just as in dodgeball  where players run for cover to avoid the sting of those dreaded balls  equity investors have flocked to the safety of defensive stocks in 2022. Year to date defensives have outperformed value  growth and cyclical stocks  doing what they are supposed to do in uncertain times: offer equity investors a shield against the onslaught of valuation pressures  slowing earnings growth and increased uncertainty. As we continue to brace ourselves for ongoing volatility in equity markets  we prefer to maintain exposure to selective stocks with defensive characteristics ‚Äì those that are winning by not losing. Deutsche Boerse and Merck & Co are two such examples.The big de-rating might not be overGlobal equity markets have de-rated since the recent peak in September 2020  with a sharper deceleration in 2022 driven by rising inflation fears as reflected in higher 10-year bond yields. In fact  most major market indices are now trading below their pre-Covid valuation levels. The derating has been particularly evident in the more expensive parts of the market  such as Technology stocks. For example  the Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen by -25% so far this year  with most of this occurring through forward PE multiples contracting from ~32 to ~23x currently. In comparison  the S&P 500 has fallen 16% and contracted from ~22x to ~17x over the same time frame.All major equity markets have derated sharply YTD to below pre-Covid levelsSource: Bloomberg  10 May 2022Despite this overall market de-rating  most major indices are still trading in line or above their 20-year averages and remain relatively high when considering the sharp rise in 10-year yields (see chart below). The Russia Ukraine War has also recently pushed commodity prices to new highs  raising inflation risks and potentially placing further pressure on market valuations.Valuations may be at more risk as bond yields continue to surgeSource: Bloomberg  10 May 2022Investors‚Äô fears are shifting from inflation to growthUS GDP has surged past prior cycle peaks but is now decelerating sharply. Similarly  while 1Q22 earnings were modestly ahead of expectations on average  management commentary and guidance about the outlook has been increasingly cautious  prompting analysts to downgrade earnings forecasts for both ‚Äô22 and ‚Äò23. In fact  earnings revisions breath has been declining since August 2021 and has recently moved outright negative. Given the wide range of headwinds companies currently face  which include cost pressures  supply chain constraints  inventory build ups and potentially weaker demand from higher prices and lower global growth  it‚Äôs likely that earnings revisions will remain negative for the foreseeable future. This has historically been associated with weak overall market performance (see below).Earnings Revisions and Price are highly correlatedSource: Alphinity  Bloomberg  3 May 2022Earnings leadership has taken another step to being more defensiveAt a sector level  we have however seen a sharp contrast with the classic defensive sectors  such as Utilities and Consumer Staples outperforming the overall market year to date  driven by a superior ratings performance as well as better earnings revisions versus their cyclical peers and the broader market (excluding the Energy and Materials). Defensives have a strong track record of outperforming during slowing growth/recessionary periods  a relative safe-haven within periods of market stress. With a broad range of defensives already reflecting these benefits in relatively high valuations  active investors need to remain nimble and look for new opportunities. Some of these might not be seen as typical defensive plays  such as Merck & Co referred to below  but they offer defensive characteristics that should bode well in a volatile environment. One such defensive earnings leader is Deutsche Boerse.Just as in a dodgeball game  there are certain times in the market cycle when it is not always about running the fastest  but also about finding the best places to hide.Deutsche Boerse- Leading stock exchange enjoying multiple cyclical & structural tailwindsDeutsche Boerse (DB1) is a high-quality owner of various key pieces of financial market infrastructure in Europe across pre-trading  trading & clearing and post-trading. These assets include Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)  Eurex (leading European financial derivative exchange)  EEX (a commodities trading & clearing exchange)  Xetra (cash equities) and Clearstream (a leading European settlement & custody provider). These businesses all tend to command dominant or leading market positions within their segments  and as such enjoy significant barriers to entry and high margins. These diversified businesses generate resilient mid-cycle digit % secular growth  which we expect to be further boosted by various cyclical tailwinds  including both higher interest rates and higher interest rate volatility  as well as further targeted M&A. Consequently  we expect the company to exceed management‚Äôs net income growth target of 10% (CAGR) for FY19-23E. With positive earnings revisions and a relatively undemanding valuation multiple (current forward PE of ~21x)  we continue to see more upside for DB1 in the current environment.Deutsche Boerse ‚Äì More defensive Earnings supported by several cyclical and structural factorsSource: Bloomberg  10 May 2022Merck & Co- A high quality defensive with flagship growth products & consistent earningsMerck & Co (MRK) is a global pharmaceutical company that delivers health solutions through its prescription medicines  vaccines  biologic therapies  animal health and consumer care products. MRK recently reported an impressive 1Q22 result with both revenue and earnings beating consensus expectations and the company raising 2022 guidance for both despite an expected FX headwind  driven by strength across the portfolio.

If no choice was made during this election period  the dividend will be paid in cash. Both the dividend in cash and the dividend in shares will be made payable to shareholders from June 8  2022.For 44.5% of the currently outstanding shares  an election was made for a share dividend  resulting in the issuance of 14 174 568 new common shares.

This transition is based on a solid culture of...,"Beter Bed Holding NVBeter Bed is working hard to develop its strategic positioning as a market-leading sleep specialist. This transition is based on a solid culture of innovation and experimentation. Thijs Nootenboom  responsible for E-commerce at Beter Bed  regards the nomination as recognition of the steps Beter Bed has taken in experimenting and creating a sustainable innovation infrastructure.Experimentation as a mindsetAt the heart of this successful innovation culture is the experimentation programme initiated by the e-commerce team several years ago. The experimentation programme has  among other things  resulted in the creation of an excellent infrastructure and a streamlined business process for testing hypotheses in a short cycle. This provides opportunities to effectively cash in on current and future e-commerce opportunities and to achieve the ambitious online targets (sales of at least ‚Ç¨ 100 million by 2025). With the launch of LUNEXT  Beter Bed's digital organisation  the conditions have been created for scaling up experiments  once validated  quickly and efficiently to the business. The focus is no longer exclusively on ROI but also on supporting the business with validated decision-making.""Lessons learned from the experiments are shared with the entire organisation so that everyone can learn from them "" says Thijs Nootenboom. ""Experimentation has now become a mindset at Beter Bed  allowing the impact and deployment of strategic initiatives to be iteratively tested. It's embedded in our daily activities thanks to the close cooperation between the development team and the commercial teams. This prevents internal debates about resources and capacity  increases the speed of testing and leads to better results. In the coming year  experimentation will be even more emphatically on the agenda as we enter into dialogue with other departments and share relevant lessons with each other. The prestigious nomination for the Experimentation Culture Awards 2022 strengthens our confidence that we are on the right track. This is a big compliment to the teams driving the development of an experimentation culture within Beter Bed Holding.""Story continuesExperimentation Culture Awards 2022The experimentation programme and the development team's role as accelerator are what prompted the Experimentation Culture Awards expert jury to nominate Beter Bed in the ""Organisation-wide"" category. Other nominees are Marks & Spencer (UK)  TL (Switzerland)  ASOS (UK) and Vattenfall Netherlands. The Experimentation Culture Award was established in 2020 with the aim of promoting a culture of experimentation around the world and helping people to achieve a reliable  evidence-based decision-making process. The organisation does this by sharing inspirational stories of experimentation growth and by nominating individuals  teams and organisations that deserve to be recognised for their work.

Astrocast  with a network ...,Consolidation in the satellite IoT space  already  and again; Swiss satellite IoT operator Astrocast has agreed a deal to acquire busy Dutch industrial IoT scale-up Hiber. Astrocast  with a network of 12 nanosatellites as it stands  has a stated plan to have 20 in orbit by the end of 2022  40 by the end of 2023  and 100 by 2025. It expects the deal for Hiber to close ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù following a public offering on Euronext Growth Paris later this year.Astrocast  founded in 2014  has L-band spectrum at 1-2 GHz  at the top end of the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) range  via a relationship with UAE-based mobile-satellite service provider Thuraya. It serves the agriculture  maritime  and utilities markets  as well as providing connectivity for environmental monitoring. Hiber  founded in 2016  makes IoT solutions for remote industry  combining sensors  analytics  and satellite connectivity.Astrocast makes its products in-house  from the satellites to the terminals; its headline ultra-low power Astronode S module was developed in combination with Airbus  CEA/LETI  and ESA. It said the deal for Hiber  which secured ‚Ç¨26 million in EU and private investment in 2021  and announced at the end of 2021 it will use Inmarsat‚Äôs ELERA satellite IoT network to expand its own Hiberband-branded low-power IoT network  will accelerate its in-house OEM strategy.Astrocast has agreed to acquire all of Hiber‚Äôs shares in exchange for the issuance of new Astrocast shares  representing 16.5 percent of Astrocast‚Äôs share capital  calculated prior to its public offering on Euronext Growth Paris. Hiber‚Äôs shareholders also agreed to invest ‚Ç¨10.45 million in Astrocast‚Äôs public offering. Astrocast expects to have raised ‚Ç¨60-‚Ç¨80 million  already  with an initial offering on Euronext Growth Oslo earlier this year.Astrocast wants to use the new funding round to complete the deployment of its satellite IoT network  and to ‚Äúramp-up‚Äù commercial activities. Future constellation launches and upgrades are targeted to be funded from cash flow from operations and debt  it said. Its existing constellation includes 12 satellites  10 of which provide commercial IoT services on an international scale  it claims. When the network reaches 20-30 in satellites  it will offer latency of less than 15 minutes ‚Äì ‚Äúwhich satisfies most IoT use cases ‚Äù it said.It is negotiating an extension on its L-band spectrum agreement  it said  to ‚Äúsignificantly de-risk‚Äù its business plan. Prospective customers are receiving development kits to test various IoT applications. The company has a partnership agreement with Telefonica  among others  with the ‚Äúpotential to connect thousands of maritime shipping containers‚Ä¶ through the Astrocast network‚Äù.Hiber provides satellite-connected IoT modules for industrial asset monitoring and tracking. Its fledgling Hiberband network was developed initially under its own steam  including via its ‚Ç¨26 million EU investment  in combination with the Dutch government  as a part of its ‚Ç¨278 million European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund. Its HiberEasypulse system claims to offer cheap IoT connectivity for tracking and monitoring in remote locations.Its HiberHeavy solution  released in March  is geared for monitoring heavy equipment  also in remote locations  where mobile coverage fails. Both are targeted at the oil and gas  forestry  mining  and military sectors  among others. Royal Dutch Shell announced in September it is using the HiberHilo solution to monitor the condition of offshore oil wells. The solution has been installed at Shell operations in the North Sea.It has a joint venture around the HiberHilo product with solution provider WTS Energy  which sells digital change solutions to the oil and gas sector; WTS Energy claims 1 250 consultants in 18 countries.Fabien Jordan  chief executive at Astrocast  said: ‚ÄúHiber is recognised as a powerful IoT scale-up within the market. [Its] focus on satellite-enabled IoT solutions  innovation and production aligns with Astrocast‚Äôs strategic go-to-market priorities for 2022 and beyond‚Ä¶ Astrocast will gain access to customer segments that we have historically had little traction with. These segments complement Astrocast‚Äôs current sales effort. In addition  this acquisition will strengthen financing opportunities for Astrocast  benefiting investors  and accelerating the total fundraising plan for Astrocast.‚ÄùRoel Jansen  chief executive at Hiber  said: ‚ÄúHiber brings IoT solutions to its customers located in the most remote locations on earth; we are democratizing data for industries that previously did not have access to affordable and easy-to-use solutions via satellites. We are excited to join forces with Astrocast to continue developing and providing world-class IoT solutions that are unrivalled in service excellence and product innovation within the IoT space.‚Äù,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.18,0.31,0.51,True,English,"['Dutch IoT scale-up', 'Enterprise IoT Insights', 'satellite network', 'Astrocast', 'Hiber', 'funds', 'headline ultra-low power Astronode S module', 'busy Dutch industrial IoT scale-up Hiber', 'Swiss satellite IoT operator', 'most IoT use cases', 'UAE-based mobile-satellite service provider', '‚Ç¨278 million European Innovation Council', 'Hiberband-branded low-power IoT network', 'ELERA satellite IoT network', 'powerful IoT scale-up', 'industrial asset monitoring', 'various IoT applications', 'satellite-connected IoT modules', 'Royal Dutch Shell', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'new funding round', 'current sales effort', 'satellite IoT space', 'commercial IoT services', 'satellite-enabled IoT solutions', 'world-class IoT solutions', 'fledgling Hiberband network', 'Future constellation launches', 'digital change solutions', 'cheap IoT connectivity', 'house OEM strategy', 'maritime shipping containers', '‚Ç¨26 million EU investment', 'total fundraising plan', 'offshore oil wells', 'L-band spectrum agreement', 'new Astrocast shares', 'Dutch government', 'use solutions', 'satellite connectivity', 'service excellence', 'solution provider', 'private investment', 'commercial activities', 'existing constellation', 'partnership agreement', 'product innovation', 'public offering', '1-2 GHz', 'ultrahigh frequency', 'UHF) range', 'utilities markets', 'environmental monitoring', 'remote industry', 'share capital', 'initial offering', 'cash flow', 'international scale', 'business plan', 'development kits', 'EIC) Fund', 'HiberEasypulse system', 'remote locations', 'heavy equipment', 'mobile coverage', 'military sectors', 'Shell operations', 'North Sea', 'joint venture', 'HiberHilo product', 'WTS Energy', 'Fabien Jordan', 'chief executive', 'little traction', 'financing opportunities', 'Roel Jansen', 'HiberHeavy solution', 'HiberHilo solution', 'Astrocast network', 'Prospective customers', 'gas sector', 'market priorities', 'customer segments', 'top end', 'Consolidation', 'deal', '12 nanosatellites', 'orbit', 'relationship', 'Thuraya', 'agriculture', 'sensors', 'analytics', 'products', 'terminals', 'combination', 'Airbus', 'CEA/LETI', 'ESA', 'Inmarsat', 'exchange', 'issuance', '16.5 percent', 'shareholders', 'deployment', 'upgrades', 'debt', '12 satellites', 'latency', 'less', '15 minutes', 'extension', 'company', 'Telefonica', 'others', 'potential', 'thousands', 'tracking', 'steam', 'March', 'forestry', 'mining', 'September', 'condition', '1,250 consultants', '18 countries', 'focus', 'production', 'strategic', 'access', 'addition', 'acquisition', 'investors', 'earth', 'data', 'industries', 'affordable', 'easy-to', 'forces', '2022']",2022-06-07,2022-06-08,enterpriseiotinsights.com

In 2021  organisations worldwide were using an average amount of 110 software as a service (SaaS) applications2  compared with just eight in 2015  showcasing a startlingly rapid increase. There has been a notable expansion in the use of multiple IaaS providers  with almost three-quarters (72%) of businesses using multiple IaaS providers  up from 57% the year before. The use of multiple providers has almost doubled in the last year  with one in five (20%) of respondents reporting using three or more providers.Despite their increasing prevalence and use  businesses share common concerns about the increasing complexity of cloud services with the majority (51%) of IT professionals agreeing that it is more complex to manage privacy and data protection in the cloud. Additionally  the journey to the cloud is also becoming more complex  with the percentage of respondents reporting that they‚Äôre expecting to lift and shift  the simplest of migration tactics  dropping from 55% in 2021 to 24% currently.Security Challenges of Multicloud ComplexityWith increasing complexity comes an even greater need for robust cybersecurity. When asked what percentage of their sensitive data is stored in the cloud  a solid majority (66%) said between 21-60%. However  only a quarter (25%) said they could fully classify all data.Additionally  nearly a third (32%) of respondents admitted to having to issue a breach notification to a government agency  customer  partner or employees. This should be a cause for concern among enterprises with sensitive data  particularly in highly regulated industries.Cyber-attacks also present an ongoing risk to cloud applications and data. Respondents reported an increasing prevalence of attacks  with a quarter (26%) citing an increase in malware  25% in ransomware and one-fifth (19%) reporting seeing an increase in phishing/ whaling.Protecting Sensitive DataWhen it comes to securing data in multicloud environments  IT professionals view encryption as a critical security control. The majority of respondents cited encryption (59%) and key management (52%) as the security technologies they currently use to protect sensitive data in the cloud.However  when asked what percentage of their data in the cloud is encrypted  only one in ten (11%) of respondents said between 81-100% is encrypted. Additionally  key management platform sprawl may be an issue for enterprises. Only 10% of respondents use one to two platforms  90% use three or more  and almost one in five (17%) admitted using eight or more platforms.Encryption should be a priority area for enterprises to focus on when it comes to securing data in the cloud. In fact  40% of respondents stated that they were able to avoid the breach notification process because the stolen or leaked data was encrypted or tokenised  showcasing the tangible value of encryption platforms.Additionally  it is encouraging to see signs enterprises embrace Zero Trust and investing accordingly. Nearly a third of respondents (29%) said they are already executing a Zero Trust strategy  a quarter (27%) said they are evaluating and planning one and  23% said they are considering it. This is a positive result  but there is certainly still room to grow.Sebastien Cano  Senior Vice President for Cloud Protection and Licensing activities at Thales said: ‚ÄúThe complexity of managing multicloud environments cannot be overstated. Additionally  the growing importance of data sovereignty is increasingly raising questions for CISOs and Data Protection Officers when considering their cloud strategy  governance  and risk management. The challenge is not only where the sensitive data resides geographically  but even who has access to sensitive data inside the organisation.There are various solutions such as encryption and key management. Last but not least  continuing to embrace a Zero Trust strategy will be essential in securing these complex environments  helping to ensure organisations can support their data and manage future challenges.‚ÄùThales and 451 Research will discuss the findings in more detail during a webinar on 23 June 2022.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) for children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Regulatory filings for this age group are underway by the European Medicines Agency and regulatory authorities in additional countries.""Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in babies and young children is more than just a rash ‚Äì the intense itch can make them scratch uncontrollably throughout the day and night and cause their skin to crack and bleed "" said Julie Block  President and Chief Executive Officer at National Eczema Association. ""Caregivers do their best to manage skincare routines multiple times a day  but for many  topical treatments are not enough. We're pleased to see how scientific innovation and research continues to address unmet needs for the atopic dermatitis community  and we're hopeful for the positive impact Dupixent can have for these children and their families.""Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Eighty-five to ninety percent of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  and crusting and oozing. In the U.S.  more than 75 000 children aged 5 years and younger have uncontrolled moderate-to-severe disease and are most in need of new treatment options. Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of a young child and their caregivers.""Young children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis are a significantly underserved population of patients  who spend vulnerable years of their lives suffering through the relentless and far-reaching effects of this chronic disease "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Dupixent has changed the atopic dermatitis treatment paradigm ‚Äì significantly clearing skin and reducing itch ‚Äì by targeting an underlying cause of this disease without broadly suppressing the immune system. Today's approval brings the proven efficacy and  importantly  well-established safety profile of Dupixent to these young children  making it the first of its kind to be approved for any U.S. patient aged six months or older living with this debilitating disease.""""Until today  treatment options in the U.S. for infants and children under the age of 6 suffering from moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis have been limited to topical steroids ‚Äì which may be associated with significant safety risks when used long-term. This has left patients and their caregivers in desperate need of medicines that can better address the chronic  long-term nature of the disease "" Naimish Patel  M.D  Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""These young people  and their families  often struggle to cope with the significant impact itch can have not only on the body  but on many other facets of daily life. This approval means that Dupixent  with its well-established safety and efficacy profile  is now available to some of the youngest people living with this disease.""The FDA evaluated Dupixent under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions. The approval is based on data that include a Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent every four weeks (200 mg or 300 mg  based on body weight) plus low-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) or TCS alone. The trial met the primary and all secondary endpoints. At 16 weeks  patients who received Dupixent with TCS experienced the following  compared to TCS alone (placebo):28% achieved clear or almost-clear skin compared to 4% with placebo  the primary endpoint.53% achieved 75% or greater improvement in overall disease severity from baseline compared to 11% with placebo  the co-primary endpoint outside of the U.S.48% achieved clinically meaningful reduction in itch compared to 9% with placebo.The safety profile of Dupixent observed through 16 weeks in children aged 6 months to 5 years was similar to the safety profile in patients 6 years and older with atopic dermatitis. The long-term safety profile of Dupixent in children aged 6 months to 5 years through 52 weeks was also similar to the safety profile observed in the pivotal trial and consistent with what was observed in older patients with atopic dermatitis. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease and skin papilloma were  respectively  reported in 5% and 2% of Dupixent patients aged 6 months to 5 years  and none of these cases led to treatment discontinuation.About the Dupixent TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.The primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16. Additional outcome measures included itch reduction  which was assessed using a caregiver-reported 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale  with a clinically meaningful improvement defined as ‚â•4-point improvement at week 16.Children who completed the trials were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension trial to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with Dupixent in this age group.About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 6 months to 5 years  Dupixent is administered with a pre-filled syringe every four weeks based on weight (200 mg for children ‚â•5 to <15 kg and 300 mg for children ‚â•15 to <30 kg). Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home. Dupixent does not require initial lab testing or ongoing lab monitoring.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay¬Æ program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent is approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) or eosinophilic esophagitis in different age populations in a number of countries around the world. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in the European Union and Japan and more than 60 countries. More than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  CRSwNP and eosinophilic esophagitis  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.About Regeneron's VelocImmune¬Æ TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The Panel indicated that the primary purpose of the proposed amendments to the Rules and SARs was to update them to take account of developments in takeover practice and changes in relevant legislation that have occurred since the Rules and SARs were published. The consultation closed on 28 February 2022.On 20 May 2022  the Panel published a response statement together with draft new Takeover Rules which the Panel is proposing to adopt. The Panel has indicated that the new Rules will be published in due course.The following points are of note:Put Up or Shut Up (‚ÄúPUSU‚Äù) - the most significant amendment to the Rules is the proposed adoption of a revised PUSU regime  which is largely (though not entirely) aligned with the equivalent regime in the UK. Under the proposed new regime  any announcement by an offeree which commences an offer period must identify any potential bidder with which the offeree is in talks or from which an approach has been received. Bidders will have a period of 42 days following the announcement in which they are first identified to announce a firm intention to make an offer or announce that they do not intend to make an offer  in which case they will then be restricted from making an offer for the offeree for 6 months.Disclosure of Opening Positions - the revised Rules will introduce opening position disclosures  modelled on the UK Takeover Code  which will be of relevance market-wide. Disclosure obligations in relation to dealings which occur following the commencement of the offer period will continue as before  largely unchanged.Profit Forecasts - the current Rule on profit forecasts has been completely revised and  in general  the new regime aligns more closely with the UK Takeover Code. The Rule also sets out the reporting requirements in respect of quantified financial benefits statements (‚ÄúQFBS‚Äù).Strategic Review Announcement Triggers Offer Period - the Panel will treat a strategic review announcement which refers specifically to an offer as one of the options to be considered under the strategic review  as commencing an offer period in relation to the relevant company. This approach aligns with existing practice but was not previously expressly referenced in the Rules.Share Buybacks - the regime under the revised Rules for the redemption or purchase of own securities by an offeree has been reframed slightly  but generally aligns with the existing regime and practice. The implementation and continuation of share redemption and buyback programmes will now be assessed exclusively under Rule 21  rather than Rule 4 as was previously the case.Euroclear Bank and Dematerialisation ‚Äì the Panel has proposed a number of technical amendments to the Rules intended to reflect changes in process arising as a result of the migration of Irish corporate securities to the Euroclear Bank securities settlement system in 2021. In particular  new processes regarding acceptance of tender offers have been introduced which are intended to facilitate underlying shareholders in accepting tender offers through the Euroclear Bank system. In an attempt to future-proof the acceptance procedures for tender offers to account for dematerialisation  the revised Rules provide that a shareholder may provide evidence of identification numbers or codes in lieu of share certificates  where applicable.,neutral,0.04,0.77,0.19,negative,0.02,0.42,0.55,True,English,"['Irish Takeover Panel Publishes', 'New Takeover Rules', 'Euroclear Bank securities settlement system', 'quantified financial benefits statements', 'Irish Takeover Panel Act', 'Euroclear Bank system', 'Irish corporate securities', 'opening position disclosures', 'UK Takeover Code', 'public consultation paper', 'Substantial Acquisition Rules', 'Strategic Review Announcement', 'Triggers Offer Period', 'new Takeover Rules', 'takeover practice', 'Opening Positions', 'new processes', 'new regime', 'primary purpose', 'relevant legislation', 'response statement', 'due course', 'following points', 'significant amendment', 'potential bidder', 'firm intention', 'Profit Forecasts', 'reporting requirements', 'relevant company', 'Share Buybacks', 'buyback programmes', 'tender offers', 'underlying shareholders', 'identification numbers', 'share certificates', 'equivalent regime', 'existing regime', 'The Panel', 'existing practice', 'new Rules', 'Disclosure obligations', 'share redemption', 'acceptance procedures', 'PUSU regime', 'technical amendments', 'current Rule', 'December', 'comments', 'SARs', 'account', 'developments', 'changes', '28 February', '20 May', 'draft', 'note', 'adoption', 'revised', 'offeree', 'talks', 'approach', 'Bidders', '42 days', 'case', '6 months', 'relevance', 'relation', 'dealings', 'commencement', 'respect', 'QFBS', 'options', 'purchase', 'implementation', 'continuation', 'Dematerialisation', 'result', 'migration', 'attempt', 'evidence', 'codes', 'lieu']",2022-06-08,2022-06-08,lexology.com

6168,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-06-07/u-s-treasury-prohibits-investors-from-buying-russian-debt,U.S. Treasury prohibits investors from buying Russian debt,20 hours ago,The U.S. Treasury stepped up financial sanctions on Russia by barring investors from buying the country‚Äôs debt in the secondary market  bringing trading activity almost to a halt on Tuesday as investors scrambled to understand the new restrictions.The updated guidance means U.S. firms can hold or sell Russian debt but can‚Äôt purchase it  according to a spokesperson for Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control. The rules apply to both corporate and sovereign debt as well as equities.Banks trading Russian corporate and sovereign bonds have already faced criticism in the U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has blasted them for undermining sanctions and has called out market makers JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for purchasing and making recommendations to clients.Both are being pressed to hand over extensive information on clients trading Russian debt.The new ban comes as Russia separately tries to avoid a sovereign default by finding a way around sanctions that are preventing it from getting money to bondholders.AdvertisementTwo payments of about $100 million in total due May 27 are stuck at Euroclear Bank  according to a person familiar with the matter. The funds were transferred from Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository.The blockage means Russia is now deep into a 30-day grace period  at the end of which it could be declared in default. Moscow argues  however  that it fulfilled its obligations when it sent the money to the NSD on May 20.The latest U.S. ban will come as a further blow to funds holding Russian bonds  as it reduces the number of potential buyers of the assets and undermines any remaining value. The update  which was issued on the Office of Foreign Assets Control‚Äôs website late Monday  caught investors by surprise  prompting many to contact lawyers to determine what the new rules entail  said people familiar with the matter.Russia‚Äôs bonds fell about 3 cents on the dollar Tuesday as banks and brokers marked down their holdings.‚ÄúMarkets usually evaporate almost immediately but it‚Äôs always good policy to allow wind down for at least some time ‚Äù said Brian O‚ÄôToole  a former senior advisor at the Office of Foreign Assets Control. ‚ÄúProbably no one will buy the debt but it‚Äôs still good policy to let folks offload if they can rather than sticking them immediately with a worthless asset.‚ÄùUnder the new policy  U.S. market participants are prohibited from purchasing both new and existing debt and equity securities issued by a Russian Federation entity. But investors can still sell such assets  or facilitate their sale  to non-U.S. residents and may continue to hold them.Bloomberg writers Giulia Morpurgo and Anya Andrianova contributed to this report.,neutral,0.02,0.7,0.28,negative,0.02,0.15,0.82,True,English,"['U.S. Treasury', 'Russian debt', 'investors', 'U.S. Sen.

The hypothetical Percentage Changes of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset used to illustrate the calculation of the Payment at Maturity (rounded to two decimal places) are not estimates or forecasts of the Initial Level  the Final Level or the level of either Reference Asset on any trading day prior to the Maturity Date. All examples assume that a holder purchased Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1 000  the Barrier Percentage of 40.00% (the Barrier Level of each Reference Asset is 60.00% of its Initial Level)  a hypothetical Booster Coupon of 55.00% of the principal amount (the midpoint of the range set forth above)  and that no market disruption event occurs on the Valuation Date as to either Reference Asset.Example 1‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset is positive  but less than the Booster Coupon.Percentage Change: 10%  which is less than the Booster CouponPayment at Maturity: $1 000 + ($1 000 x 55.00%) = $1 000 + $550.00 = $1 550.00 On a $1 000 investment  a 10% Percentage Change for the Lesser Performing Reference Asset results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 550.00  a 55.00% return on the Notes.Example 2‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset is positive and exceeds the Booster Coupon.Percentage Change: 70%Payment at Maturity: $1 000 + ($1 000 x 70.00%) = $1 000 + $700.00 = $1 700.00On a $1 000 investment  a 70% Percentage Change for the Lesser Performing Reference Asset results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 700.00  a 70.00% return on the Notes.Example 3‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset is negative (but not by more than the Barrier Percentage).Percentage Change: -10%Payment at Maturity: At maturity  if the Percentage Change of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset is negative BUT not by more than the Barrier Percentage  then the Payment at Maturity will equal the principal amount.On a $1 000 investment  a -10% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 000  a 0% return on the Notes.Example 4‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset is negative (by more than the Barrier Percentage).Percentage Change: -45%Payment at Maturity: $1 000 + ($1 000 x -45.00%) = $1 000 - $450.00 = $550.00On a $1 000 investment  a -45% Percentage Change in the Lesser Performing Reference Asset results in a Payment at Maturity of $550.00  a -45% return on the Notes.Barrier Booster Notes Linked to the Lesser Performing of Two Equity IndicesSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets. These risks are explained in more detail in the section ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors Specific to the Notes‚Äù in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes‚Ä¢ You May Lose All or a Substantial Portion of the Principal Amount at Maturity ‚Äì Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the level of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset between the Trade Date and the Valuation Date of more than 40%. In such a case  you will lose 1% of the principal amount of your Notes for each 1% that the Final Level of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset is less than its Initial Level.‚Ä¢ Your Redemption Amount Will Be Determined Solely by Reference to the Lesser Performing Reference Asset Even if the Other Reference Asset Performs Better ‚Äì Your Redemption Amount will be determined solely by reference to the performance of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset. Even if the Final Level of the other Reference Asset has increased compared to its Initial Level  or has experienced a decrease that is less than that of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset  your return will only be determined by reference to the performance of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset  regardless of the performance of the other Reference Asset. The Notes are not linked to a weighted basket  in which the risk may be mitigated and diversified among each of the basket components. For example  in the case of notes linked to a weighted basket  the return would depend on the weighted aggregate performance of the basket components reflected as the basket return. As a result  the depreciation of one basket component could be mitigated by the appreciation of the other basket component  as scaled by the weighting of that basket component. However  in the case of the Notes  the individual performance of each of the Reference Assets would not be combined  and the depreciation of one Reference Asset would not be mitigated by any appreciation of the other Reference Asset. Instead your return will depend solely on the Final Level of the Lesser Performing Reference Asset.‚Ä¢ The Notes Do Not Pay Interest and Your Return May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity ‚Äì You will not receive any interest payments on the Notes as there would be on a conventional fixed-rate or floating-rate debt security having the same maturity. The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. The return on the Notes may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.‚Ä¢ Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes ‚Äì The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of the Redemption Amount is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations at that time. This will be the case even if the levels of the Reference Assets increase after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at the maturity of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes‚Ä¢ There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes ‚Äì Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses ‚Äì There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any of our other affiliates may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes‚Ä¢ The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Less than the Price to the Public ‚Äî The initial estimated value that will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement for the Notes does not represent a minimum price at which we  RBCCM or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase the Notes in anyBarrier Booster Notes Linked to the Lesser Performing of Two Equity Indicessecondary market (if any exists) at any time. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity  their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and the initial estimated value. This is due to  among other things  changes in the levels of the Reference Assets  the borrowing rate we pay to issue securities of this kind  and the inclusion in the price to the public of the underwriting discount and the estimated costs relating to our hedging of the Notes. These factors  together with various credit  market and economic factors over the term of the Notes  are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell your Notes prior to maturity may be less than your original purchase price  as any such sale price would not be expected to include the underwriting discount and the hedging costs relating to the Notes. In addition to bid-ask spreads  the value of the Notes determined by RBCCM for any secondary market price is expected to be based on the secondary rate rather than the internal funding rate used to price the Notes and determine the initial estimated value. As a result  the secondary price will be less than if the internal funding rate was used. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly  you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.‚Ä¢ The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes that We Will Provide in the Final Pricing Supplement Will Be an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Are Set ‚Äî The initial estimated value of the Notes will be based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See ‚ÄúStructuring the Notes‚Äù below. Our estimate will be based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.The value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities‚Ä¢ Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest ‚Äî We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Assets that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders‚Äô interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the levels of the Reference Assets  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with companies included in the Reference Assets  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could include investment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates‚Äô obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Assets. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the levels of the Reference Assets  and therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Assets‚Ä¢ An Investment in the Notes Is Subject to Risks Relating to Non-U.S. Securities Markets ‚Äì Because foreign companies or foreign equity securities included in the SX5E are publicly traded in the applicable foreign countries and are denominated in euros  an investment in the Notes involves particular risks. For example  the non-U.S. securities markets may be more volatile than the U.S. securities markets  and market developments may affect these markets differently from the U.S. or other securities markets. Direct or indirect government intervention to stabilize the securities markets outside the U.S.  as well as cross-shareholdings in certain companies  may affect trading prices and trading volumes in those markets. Also  the public availability of information concerning the foreign issuers may vary depending on their home jurisdiction and the reporting requirements imposed by theirBarrier Booster Notes Linked to the Lesser Performing of Two Equity Indicesrespective regulators. In addition  the foreign issuers may be subject to accounting  auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements that differ from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies.‚Ä¢ You Will Not Have Any Rights to the Securities Included in the Reference Asset s ‚Äì As a holder of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of securities included in the Reference Asset would have. The Final Level will not reflect any dividends paid on the securities included in the Reference Asset  and accordingly  any positive return on the Notes may be less than the potential positive return on those securities.‚Ä¢ The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Postponement Due to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments ‚Äì The Redemption Amount and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as to each Reference Asset as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see ‚ÄúGeneral Terms of the Notes‚ÄîMarket Disruption Events‚Äù in the product prospectus supplement.Barrier Booster Notes Linked to the Lesser Performing of Two Equity IndicesINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE ASSETSAll disclosures contained in this terms supplement regarding the Reference Assets  including  without limitation  their make-up  method of calculation  and changes in their components  have been derived from publicly available sources. The information reflects the policies of  and is subject to change by the applicable index sponsor. Each of these sponsors has no obligation to continue to publish  and may discontinue publication of  the applicable Reference Asset. The consequences of an index sponsor discontinuing publication of a Reference Asset are discussed in the section of the product prospectus supplement entitled ‚ÄúGeneral Terms of the Notes‚Äî Unavailability of the Level of the Reference Asset.‚Äù Neither we nor RBCCM accepts any responsibility for the calculation  maintenance or publication of either Reference Asset or any successor index.S&P 500 ¬Æ Index (‚ÄúSPX‚Äù)The SPX is intended to provide an indication of the pattern of price movements in the large-capitalization U.S. equity markets. The calculation of the level of the SPX is based on the relative value of the aggregate market value of the common stocks of 500 companies as of a particular time compared to the aggregate average market value of the common stocks of 500 similar companies during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943.S&P calculates the SPX by reference to the prices of the constituent stocks of the SPX without taking account of the value of dividends paid on those stocks. As a result  the return on the Notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the SPX constituent stocks and received the dividends paid on those stocks.Effective with the September 2015 rebalance  consolidated share class lines will no longer be included in the SPX. Each share class line will be subject to public float and liquidity criteria individually  but the company‚Äôs total market capitalization will be used to evaluate each share class line. This may result in one listed share class line of a company being included in the SPX while a second listed share class line of the same company is excluded.Computation of the SPXWhile S&P currently employs the following methodology to calculate the SPX  no assurance can be given that S&P will not modify or change this methodology in a manner that may affect the Payment at Maturity.Historically  the market value of any component stock of the SPX was calculated as the product of the market price per share and the number of then outstanding shares of such component stock. In March 2005  S&P began shifting the SPX halfway from a market capitalization weighted formula to a float-adjusted formula  before moving the SPX to full float adjustment on September 16  2005. S&P‚Äôs criteria for selecting stocks for the SPX did not change with the shift to float adjustment. However  the adjustment affects each company‚Äôs weight in the SPX.Under float adjustment  the share counts used in calculating the SPX reflect only those shares that are available to investors  not all of a company‚Äôs outstanding shares. Float adjustment excludes shares that are closely held by control groups  other publicly traded companies or government agencies.In September 2012  all shareholdings representing more than 5% of a stock‚Äôs outstanding shares  other than holdings by ‚Äúblock owners ‚Äù were removed from the float for purposes of calculating the SPX. Generally  these ‚Äúcontrol holders‚Äù will include officers and directors  private equity  venture capital and special equity firms  other publicly traded companies that hold shares for control  strategic partners  holders of restricted shares  ESOPs  employee and family trusts  foundations associated with the company  holders of unlisted share classes of stock  government entities at all levels (other than government retirement/pension funds) and any individual person who controls a 5% or greater stake in a company as reported in regulatory filings. However  holdings by block owners  such as depositary banks  pension funds  mutual funds and ETF providers  401(k) plans of the company  government retirement/pension funds  investment funds of insurance companies  asset managers and investment funds  independent foundations and savings and investment plans  will ordinarily be considered part of the float.Treasury stock  stock options equity participation units  warrants  preferred stock  convertible stock  and rights are not part of the float. Shares held in a trust to allow investors in countries outside the country of domicile  such as depositary shares and Canadian exchangeable shares are normally part of the float unless those shares form a control block.For each stock  an investable weight factor (‚ÄúIWF‚Äù) is calculated by dividing the available float shares by the total shares outstanding. Available float shares are defined as the total shares outstanding less shares held by control holders. ThisBarrier Booster Notes Linked to the Lesser Performing of Two Equity Indicescalculation is subject to a 5% minimum threshold for control blocks. For example  if a company‚Äôs officers and directors hold 3% of the company‚Äôs shares  and no other control group holds 5% of the company‚Äôs shares  S&P would assign that company an IWF of 1.00  as no control group meets the 5% threshold. However  if a company‚Äôs officers and directors hold 3% of the company‚Äôs shares and another control group holds 20% of the company‚Äôs shares  S&P would assign an IWF of 0.77  reflecting the fact that 23% of the company‚Äôs outstanding shares are considered to be held for control. As of July 31  2017  companies with multiple share class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the SPX. Constituents of the SPX prior to July 31  2017 with multiple share class lines were grandfathered in and continue to be included in the SPX. If a constituent company of the SPX reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure  that company will remain in the SPX at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee in order to minimize turnover.The SPX is calculated using a base-weighted aggregate methodology. The level of the SPX reflects the total market value of all 500 component stocks relative to the base period of the years 1941 through 1943. An indexed number is used to represent the results of this calculation in order to make the level easier to use and track over time. The actual total market value of the component stocks during the base period of the years 1941 through 1943 has been set to an indexed level of 10. This is often indicated by the notation 1941-43 = 10. In practice  the daily calculation of the SPX is computed by dividing the total market value of the component stocks by the ‚Äúindex divisor.‚Äù By itself  the index divisor is an arbitrary number. However  in the context of the calculation of the SPX  it serves as a link to the original base period level of the SPX. The index divisor keeps the SPX comparable over time and is the manipulation point for all adjustments to the SPX  which is index maintenance.Index MaintenanceIndex maintenance includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and deletions  share changes  stock splits  stock dividends  and stock price adjustments due to company restructuring or spinoffs. Some corporate actions  such as stock splits and stock dividends  require changes in the common shares outstanding and the stock prices of the companies in the SPX  and do not require index divisor adjustments.To prevent the level of the SPX from changing due to corporate actions  corporate actions which affect the total market value of the SPX require an index divisor adjustment. By adjusting the index divisor for the change in market value  the level of the SPX remains constant and does not reflect the corporate actions of individual companies in the SPX. Index divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the SPX closing level.Changes in a company‚Äôs shares outstanding and IWF due to its acquisition of another public company are made as soon as reasonably possible. At S&P‚Äôs discretion  de minimis merger and acquisition share changes are accumulated and implemented with the quarterly share rebalancing.All other changes of less than 5% are accumulated and made quarterly on the third Friday of March  June  September  and December.Changes in a company‚Äôs total shares outstanding of 5% or more due to public offerings are made as soon as reasonably possible. Other changes of 5% or more (for example  due to tender offers  Dutch auctions  voluntary exchange offers  company stock repurchases  private placements  acquisitions of private companies or non-index companies that do not trade on a major exchange  redemptions  exercise of options  warrants  conversion of preferred stock  notes  debt  equity participations  at-the-market stock offerings or other recapitalizations) are made weekly  and are generally announced on Fridays for implementation after the close of trading the following Friday (one week later). If a 5% or more share change causes a company‚Äôs IWF to change by five percentage points or more  the IWF is updated at the same time as the share change. IWF changes resulting from partial tender offers are considered on a case-by-case basis.License AgreementS&P¬Æ is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor‚Äôs Financial Services LLC and Dow Jones¬Æ is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (‚ÄúDow Jones‚Äù).

Publication of the SX5E in February 1998  based on an initial index level of 1 000 at December 31  1991.Composition and MaintenanceThe SX5E is composed of 50 component stocks of market sector leaders from within the 20 EURO STOXX¬Æ Supersector indices  which represent the Eurozone portion of the STOXX Europe 600¬Æ Supersector indices.The composition of the SX5E is reviewed annually  based on the closing stock data on the last trading day in August. The component stocks are announced on the first trading day in September. Changes to the component stocks are implemented on the third Friday in September and are effective the following trading day. Changes in the composition of the SX5E are made to ensure that the SX5E includes the 50 market sector leaders from within the Eurozone.The free float factors for each component stock used to calculate this Reference Asset  as described below  are reviewed  calculated  and implemented on a quarterly basis and are fixed until the next quarterly review.The SX5E is also reviewed on an ongoing monthly basis. Corporate actions (including initial public offerings  mergers and takeovers  spin-offs  delistings  and bankruptcy) that affect the SX5E composition are announced immediately  implemented two trading days later and become effective on the next trading day after implementation.Calculation of the SX5EThe SX5E is calculated with the ‚ÄúLaspeyres formula ‚Äù which measures the aggregate price changes in the component stocks against a fixed base quantity weight. The formula for calculating the SX5E value can be expressed as follows:SX5E = Free float market capitalization of the SX5EDivisorThe ‚Äúfree float market capitalization of the SX5E‚Äù is equal to the sum of the products of the price  the number of shares  the free float factor and the weighting cap factor for each component stock as of the time the SX5E is being calculated.The SX5E is also subject to a divisor  which is adjusted to maintain the continuity of the SX5E values across changes due to corporate actions  such as the deletion and addition of stocks  the substitution of stocks  stock dividends  and stock splits.Barrier Booster Notes Linked to the Lesser Performing of Two Equity IndicesLicense AgreementWe have entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with STOXX providing for the license to us and certain of our affiliated or subsidiary companies  in exchange for a fee  of the right to use indices owned and published by STOXX (including the SX5E) in connection with certain securities  including the Notes offered hereby.The license agreement between us and STOXX requires that the following language be stated in this document:STOXX has no relationship to us  other than the licensing of the SX5E and the related trademarks for use in connection with the Notes.

Such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (‚ÄúELIs‚Äù) that are ‚Äúspecified ELIs‚Äù may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference  directly or indirectly  an interest in an ‚Äúunderlying security ‚Äù which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However  the Internal Revenue Service (the ‚ÄúIRS‚Äù) has issued guidance that states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the effective dates of the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to provide that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1  2023. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments  if any  under the Notes. However  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Reference Assets or the Notes (for example  upon a Reference Asset rebalancing)  and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter  or have entered  into other transactions in respect of the Reference Assets or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding  we (or the applicable withholding agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.Barrier Booster Notes Linked to the Lesser Performing of Two Equity IndicesSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on or about June 30  2022  which is the third (3rd) business day following the Trade Date (this settlement cycle being referred to as ‚ÄúT+3‚Äù). See ‚ÄúPlan of Distribution‚Äù in the prospectus dated September 14  2021. For additional information as to the relationship between us and RBCCM  please see the section ‚ÄúPlan of Distribution‚ÄîConflicts of Interest‚Äù in the prospectus dated September 14  2021.We expect to deliver the Notes on a date that is greater than two business days following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than two business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.In the initial offering of the Notes  they will be offered to investors at a purchase price equal to par  except with respect to certain accounts as indicated on the cover page of this document. In addition to the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page  we or one of our affiliates may also pay an expected fee to a broker-dealer that is unaffiliated with us for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.The value of the Notes shown on your account statement may be based on RBCCM‚Äôs estimate of the value of the Notes if RBCCM or another of our affiliates were to make a market in the Notes (which it is not obligated to do). That estimate will be based upon the price that RBCCM may pay for the Notes in light of then prevailing market conditions  our creditworthiness and transaction costs. For a period of approximately 12 months after the issue date of the Notes  the value of the Notes that may be shown on your account statement may be higher than RBCCM‚Äôs estimated value of the Notes at that time. This is because the estimated value of the Notes will not include the underwriting discount and our hedging costs and profits; however  the value of the Notes shown on your account statement during that period may be a higher amount  reflecting the addition of RBCCM‚Äôs underwriting discount and our estimated costs and profits from hedging the Notes. This excess is expected to decrease over time until the end of this period. After this period  if RBCCM repurchases your Notes  it expects to do so at prices that reflect their estimated value.We may use this terms supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  RBCCM or another of our affiliates may use this terms supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this terms supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.Barrier Booster Notes Linked to the Lesser Performing of Two Equity IndicesSTRUCTURING THE NOTESThe Notes are our debt securities  the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. As is the case for all of our debt securities  including our structured notes  the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition  because structured notes result in increased operational  funding and liability management costs to us  we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity. Using this relatively lower implied borrowing rate rather than the secondary market rate  is a factor that is likely to reduce the initial estimated value of the Notes at the time their terms are set. Unlike the estimated value included in the final pricing supplement  any value of the Notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction may be based on a different funding rate  which may result in a lower value for the Notes than if our initial internal funding rate were used.In order to satisfy our payment obligations under the Notes  we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options  put options or other derivatives) on the issue date with RBCCM or one of our other subsidiaries. The terms of these hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors  including our creditworthiness  interest rate movements  the volatility of the Reference Assets  and the tenor of the Notes. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.The lower implied borrowing rate is a factor that reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you. The initial offering price of the Notes also reflects the underwriting commission and our estimated hedging costs. These factors result in the initial estimated value for the Notes on the Trade Date being less than their public offering price.

6182,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.sharecafe.com.au/2022/06/07/winning-by-not-losing/,Winning by Not Losing ‚Äì ShareCafe,1 day ago,by Elfreda Jonker ‚Äì Client Portfolio ManagerInvesting in global equity markets have felt like playing a game of dodgeball over the last few two years. Around every corner investors have been faced with a new surprise to navigate. Just as in dodgeball  where players run for cover to avoid the sting of those dreaded balls  equity investors have flocked to the safety of defensive stocks in 2022. Year to date defensives have outperformed value  growth and cyclical stocks  doing what they are supposed to do in uncertain times: offer equity investors a shield against the onslaught of valuation pressures  slowing earnings growth and increased uncertainty. As we continue to brace ourselves for ongoing volatility in equity markets  we prefer to maintain exposure to selective stocks with defensive characteristics ‚Äì those that are winning by not losing. Deutsche Boerse and Merck & Co are two such examples.The big de-rating might not be overGlobal equity markets have de-rated since the recent peak in September 2020  with a sharper deceleration in 2022 driven by rising inflation fears as reflected in higher 10-year bond yields. In fact  most major market indices are now trading below their pre-Covid valuation levels. The derating has been particularly evident in the more expensive parts of the market  such as Technology stocks. For example  the Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen by -25% so far this year  with most of this occurring through forward PE multiples contracting from ~32 to ~23x currently. In comparison  the S&P 500 has fallen 16% and contracted from ~22x to ~17x over the same time frame.All major equity markets have derated sharply YTD to below pre-Covid levelsSource: Bloomberg  10 May 2022Despite this overall market de-rating  most major indices are still trading in line or above their 20-year averages and remain relatively high when considering the sharp rise in 10-year yields (see chart below). The Russia Ukraine War has also recently pushed commodity prices to new highs  raising inflation risks and potentially placing further pressure on market valuations.Valuations may be at more risk as bond yields continue to surgeSource: Bloomberg  10 May 2022Investors‚Äô fears are shifting from inflation to growthUS GDP has surged past prior cycle peaks but is now decelerating sharply. Similarly  while 1Q22 earnings were modestly ahead of expectations on average  management commentary and guidance about the outlook has been increasingly cautious  prompting analysts to downgrade earnings forecasts for both ‚Äô22 and ‚Äò23. In fact  earnings revisions breath has been declining since August 2021 and has recently moved outright negative. Given the wide range of headwinds companies currently face  which include cost pressures  supply chain constraints  inventory build ups and potentially weaker demand from higher prices and lower global growth  it‚Äôs likely that earnings revisions will remain negative for the foreseeable future. This has historically been associated with weak overall market performance (see below).Earnings Revisions and Price are highly correlatedSource: Alphinity  Bloomberg  3 May 2022Earnings leadership has taken another step to being more defensiveAt a sector level  we have however seen a sharp contrast with the classic defensive sectors  such as Utilities and Consumer Staples outperforming the overall market year to date  driven by a superior ratings performance as well as better earnings revisions versus their cyclical peers and the broader market (excluding the Energy and Materials). Defensives have a strong track record of outperforming during slowing growth/recessionary periods  a relative safe-haven within periods of market stress. With a broad range of defensives already reflecting these benefits in relatively high valuations  active investors need to remain nimble and look for new opportunities. Some of these might not be seen as typical defensive plays  such as Merck & Co referred to below  but they offer defensive characteristics that should bode well in a volatile environment. One such defensive earnings leader is Deutsche Boerse.Just as in a dodgeball game  there are certain times in the market cycle when it is not always about running the fastest  but also about finding the best places to hide.Deutsche Boerse- Leading stock exchange enjoying multiple cyclical & structural tailwindsDeutsche Boerse (DB1) is a high-quality owner of various key pieces of financial market infrastructure in Europe across pre-trading  trading & clearing and post-trading. These assets include Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)  Eurex (leading European financial derivative exchange)  EEX (a commodities trading & clearing exchange)  Xetra (cash equities) and Clearstream (a leading European settlement & custody provider). These businesses all tend to command dominant or leading market positions within their segments  and as such enjoy significant barriers to entry and high margins. These diversified businesses generate resilient mid-cycle digit % secular growth  which we expect to be further boosted by various cyclical tailwinds  including both higher interest rates and higher interest rate volatility  as well as further targeted M&A. Consequently  we expect the company to exceed management‚Äôs net income growth target of 10% (CAGR) for FY19-23E. With positive earnings revisions and a relatively undemanding valuation multiple (current forward PE of ~21x)  we continue to see more upside for DB1 in the current environment.Deutsche Boerse ‚Äì More defensive Earnings supported by several cyclical and structural factorsSource: Bloomberg  10 May 2022Merck & Co- A high quality defensive with flagship growth products & consistent earningsMerck & Co (MRK) is a global pharmaceutical company that delivers health solutions through its prescription medicines  vaccines  biologic therapies  animal health and consumer care products. MRK recently reported an impressive 1Q22 result with both revenue and earnings beating consensus expectations and the company raising 2022 guidance for both despite an expected FX headwind  driven by strength across the portfolio.

The update features Vopak's strategic priorities and financial framework.Improve performance of our portfolioVopak aims to improve the performance of the portfolio and targets an operating cash return of at least 10% by 2025. Operating cash return is defined as proportional operating cash flow over proportional capital employed and reflects the increased importance of free cash flow and joint ventures in our portfolio. By 2025  Vopak expects that the share of proportional capital employed in industrial and gas will further increase  while the share of oil and chemical will gradually decline.Grow our base in industrial and gas terminalsVopak will grow its base in industrial and gas terminals by allocating EUR 1 billion to these activities by 2030. This will further support a long-term and steady cash flow generation. Vopak will continue to invest in the growing global gas markets and expand its network of LNG and LPG terminals at strategic locations. Vopak aims to further grow and maintain its position as market leader in industrial terminals.Accelerate towards new energies and sustainable feedstocksVopak will accelerate its portfolio investments towards new energies and sustainable feedstocks by allocating EUR 1 billion in growth capital to these activities by 2030. This will not only shape the future of Vopak  but also positively contribute to the transition within key industrial clusters and shaping of the energy hubs of the future. The share of zero-carbon and low-carbon energy and sustainable feedstocks at Vopak's existing locations will be increased and new infrastructure for the introduction of the vital products of the future will be developed. Here Vopak's focus is on infrastructure solutions for low-carbon and renewable hydrogen  ammonia  CO2  long duration energy storage and sustainable feedstocks. Those terminals within the Vopak network that store traditional fuels and feedstocks will be well positioned to handle low carbon substitutes.Story continuesDisciplined financial frameworkVopak aims to deliver strong cash flow generation and commits to a disciplined allocation of capital. Vopak targets a robust balance sheet with sufficient financial flexibility in the range of around 2.5 to 3.0 times senior net debt to EBITDA and may temporarily be outside this range depending on capital allocation choices.Progressive dividend policyVopak will continue to manage the portfolio in line with its strategy and be a steward of shareholder value creation. To reflect its strong cash flow generation  Vopak will update its dividend policy to a progressive dividend policy aiming to maintain or grow our annual dividend subject to market conditions.Management presentations in Rotterdam will start at 10:00 am CEST and can be followed via an on-demand audio webcast on Vopak's corporate website www.vopak.com .

The brand unveiled a written letter created from ocean bound plastic with the unifying message  ""Imagine a World Free of Plastic"" to illustrate the global scale of the ongoing environmental crisis. The plastic used in the exhibit is made from materials pulled from global beach clean-ups conducted by Corona and its partners.The installation calls attention to the 300 million tons of plastic that enter our oceans every year and make up over 80% of all marine debris.** (IUCN  2021). The following markets recreated the Mexico plastic letter with ocean plastic from their local waterways/oceans: Brazil  Chile  Dominican Republic  Germany  Canary Islands  Italy and Puerto Rico.""World Oceans Day is an opportunity to reflect and understand the human impact on vital natural resources. With Corona's long-standing history of protecting paradise  we needed to send an important message to the world "" said Felipe Ambra  Global Corona Vice President. ""We created this plastic letter installation to highlight that it's time for action  not just words. We must act urgently to continue to protect our oceans from daily plastic pollution  and we hope this visual inspires others to reevaluate the role and impact they can have.""In addition to the plastic letter  Corona has made significant strides to combat marine plastic pollution in innovative new ways. For Global Recycling Day this year  Corona hosted the first ever Global Fishing Tournament in China  Brazil  Israel  South Africa  Colombia and Mexico that removed nearly 10 tons of plastic debris from the ocean and supported local fishing communities. In Germany  Corona created a clever returnable crate program that utilizes over 90% of recycled plastic to avoid producing virgin plastic. To date  Corona has conducted over 1 400 clean-ups  engaged over 68 000 volunteers  and collected plastic waste from more than 44 million square meters of beach.Story continues""What's important to note is that the plastic we recovered is not local to Mexico. It's plastic that comes from all over the world and ends up on beaches everywhere through ocean currents "" said Mercedes Guzman  founder of Lamerced   Corona's beach clean up and recycling partner for the Mexico plastic letter. ""Although our work in the field is very difficult  it's fulfilling to send the message that even though it's not my plastic  it's my shared world to protect.""With the plastic beach letter  Corona continues to support its industry-leading position as the first global beverage brand to achieve a net-zero plastic footprint in 2021. This initiative is part of the brand's ongoing efforts to recover more plastic from the environment than it releases.

Furthermore  there is growing evidence on the benefits of treatment from a younger age ‚Äù said Dr. Hugh Sampson  Kurt Hirschhorn Professor of Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  Director Emeritus of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute and Chairman of the DBV Scientific Advisory Board. ‚ÄúWe believe these positive findings support the potential clinical benefit of Viaskin Peanut in this important  and underserved  population.‚ÄùThese results represent the second and final part of the EPITOPE trial  which enrolled 362 subjects ages 1 to 3 years  of which 244 and 118 were in the active and placebo arms  respectively. Enrollment was balanced for age and baseline disease characteristics between the active and placebo treatment arms. The median subject baseline eliciting dose (ED) was 100 mg in each treatment arm. A double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) was administered at baseline and month 12 to determine a subject‚Äôs ED at each timepoint. A treatment responder was defined as either a subject with a baseline ED ‚â§10 mg who reached an ED ‚â•300 mg of peanut protein at month 12  or a subject with a baseline ED >10 mg who reached an ED ‚â•1 000 mg of peanut protein at month 12.In an additional pre-specified efficacy analysis  treatment response was defined as achieving an ED ‚â•1 000 mg of peanut protein regardless of baseline ED. Using this response criterion  Viaskin Peanut demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect (p<0.001)  with 64.2% of subjects in the Viaskin Peanut arm meeting this treatment responder criterion after 12 months as compared to 29.6% of subjects in the placebo arm (difference in response rates = 34.7%; 95% CI = 23.6% - 45.7%). The response rate observed in the placebo arm appears consistent with the approximately 22% natural resolution rate in this patient population.1The EPITOPE safety results were generally consistent with the safety profile of Viaskin Peanut 250 Œºg observed in children with peanut allergy ages 4 years and older in prior clinical trials. No imbalance in the overall adverse event (AE) rate was observed in the trial between the active and placebo arms.Overall  21 subjects (8.6%) in the Viaskin Peanut arm and 3 subjects (2.5%) in the placebo arm experienced a serious adverse event (SAE). Only 1 of the SAEs (0.4%)  which was mild periorbital edema (swelling around the eye) in the Viaskin Peanut arm  was deemed related to treatment.The most commonly reported adverse events were skin reactions localized to the administration site  the majority of which were mild to moderate in nature. Fifty-five subjects (22.5%) in the Viaskin Peanut arm experienced an application site reaction that was assessed as severe by an investigator compared with 10 subjects (8.5%) in the placebo arm. Based on investigators‚Äô reported observations from examinations of the skin at each study visit  using the skin grading systems defined in the protocol  the severity of administration site skin reactions following patch application decreased throughout the course of the 12-month treatment period.Four (1.6%) subjects in the Viaskin Peanut arm experienced an anaphylactic reaction determined to be related to  or possibly related to  treatment. Among these anaphylactic reactions  3 resolved with a single dose of epinephrine and 1 resolved without epinephrine. All anaphylactic reactions were mild to moderate in severity and were characterized mainly by skin and respiratory symptoms.Eight subjects (3.3%) in the Viaskin Peanut arm discontinued due to adverse events.In the 12-month treatment period  the trial completion rate was 84.8% and was balanced between the Viaskin Peanut and placebo arms. Mean subject compliance to daily patch treatment was above 95% in both the active and placebo arms.‚ÄúWe are thrilled by the topline results of EPITOPE  our second Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Viaskin Peanut ‚Äù said Dr. Pharis Mohideen  Chief Medical Officer of DBV Technologies. ‚ÄúWe are grateful to the toddlers and their parents  caregivers and allergists who are contributing to a brighter future by having participated in this first-of-its kind trial.‚ÄùFollowing the completion of EPITOPE  all eligible subjects had the option to rollover into EPOPEX  a long-term  open-label extension study of Viaskin Peanut. There are currently 304 subjects (88% of all eligible subjects) enrolled in EPOPEX.DBV plans to present full EPITOPE trial results at future medical congresses as well as submit them for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.‚ÄúThe EPITOPE data advance our understanding of investigational epicutaneous immunotherapy‚Äôs ability to induce an immune response with minimal amounts of allergen ‚Äù said Daniel Tass√©  Chief Executive Officer of DBV Technologies. ‚ÄúThese results further inform EPIT‚Äôs potential in other food allergies and immunological conditions  which are areas of research DBV remains highly committed to pursuing.‚ÄùDBV will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Tuesday  June 7  2022  at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss the results.

A replay of the presentation will also be available on DBV‚Äôs website after the event.About EPITOPEEPITOPE (NCT03211247) enrolled 413 subjects (51 in Part A and 362 in Part B) in approximately 50 centers across North America (Canada and the United States)  Europe and Australia. The EPITOPE trial is a two-part trial: Part A was designed to assess the safety of Viaskin Peanut 100 ¬µg and 250 ¬µg and to determine the highest safe dose  and Part B was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the selected dose. Based on the results of Part A  the 250 ¬µg dose was selected for Part B. In Part B  subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive Viaskin Peanut 250 ¬µg or placebo.The primary endpoint was based on a responder analysis after 12 months of treatment with the selected dose of Viaskin Peanut. As a secondary efficacy endpoint  cumulative reactive dose (CRD) was also evaluated in EPITOPE to establish the total quantity of peanut protein that triggers subject reactions at month 12 of active treatment versus placebo. Serological markers were also measured at baseline  3  6 and 12 months in order to characterize the immunological changes in subjects.Following the completion of EPITOPE  all eligible subjects had the option to rollover into EPOPEX  a long-term  open-label extension study of Viaskin Peanut 250 ¬µg. Now that the EPITOPE study results are publicly available  subjects enrolled in the EPOPEX study will be unblinded to their respective treatment group in EPITOPE.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is developing Viaskin‚Ñ¢  an investigational proprietary technology platform with broad potential applications in immunotherapy.

The brand unveiled a written letter created from ocean bound plastic with the unifying message  ""Imagine a World Free of Plastic"" to illustrate the global scale of the ongoing environmental crisis. The plastic used in the exhibit is made from materials pulled from global beach clean-ups conducted by Corona and its partners.The installation calls attention to the 300 million tons of plastic that enter our oceans every year and make up over 80% of all marine debris.** (IUCN  2021). The following markets recreated the Mexico plastic letter with ocean plastic from their local waterways/oceans: Brazil  Chile  Dominican Republic  Germany  Canary Islands  Italy and Puerto Rico.""World Oceans Day is an opportunity to reflect and understand the human impact on vital natural resources. With Corona's long-standing history of protecting paradise  we needed to send an important message to the world "" said Felipe Ambra  Global Corona Vice President. ""We created this plastic letter installation to highlight that it's time for action  not just words. We must act urgently to continue to protect our oceans from daily plastic pollution  and we hope this visual inspires others to reevaluate the role and impact they can have.""In addition to the plastic letter  Corona has made significant strides to combat marine plastic pollution in innovative new ways. For Global Recycling Day this year  Corona hosted the first ever Global Fishing Tournament in China  Brazil  Israel  South Africa  Colombia and Mexico that removed nearly 10 tons of plastic debris from the ocean and supported local fishing communities. In Germany  Corona created a clever returnable crate program that utilizes over 90% of recycled plastic to avoid producing virgin plastic. To date  Corona has conducted over 1 400 clean-ups  engaged over 68 000 volunteers  and collected plastic waste from more than 44 million square meters of beach.Story continues""What's important to note is that the plastic we recovered is not local to Mexico. It's plastic that comes from all over the world and ends up on beaches everywhere through ocean currents "" said Mercedes Guzman  founder of Lamerced   Corona's beach clean up and recycling partner for the Mexico plastic letter. ""Although our work in the field is very difficult  it's fulfilling to send the message that even though it's not my plastic  it's my shared world to protect.""With the plastic beach letter  Corona continues to support its industry-leading position as the first global beverage brand to achieve a net-zero plastic footprint in 2021. This initiative is part of the brand's ongoing efforts to recover more plastic from the environment than it releases.

June 7  2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) for children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. A regulatory filing for this age group is under review by the European Medicines Agency and submissions to regulatory authorities in additional countries are underway.Julie BlockPresident and Chief Executive Officer  National Eczema Association‚ÄúModerate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in babies and young children is more than just a rash ‚Äì the intense itch can make them scratch uncontrollably throughout the day and night and cause their skin to crack and bleed. Caregivers do their best to manage skincare routines multiple times a day  but for many  topical treatments are not enough. We‚Äôre pleased to see how scientific innovation and research continues to address unmet needs for the atopic dermatitis community  and we‚Äôre hopeful for the positive impact Dupixent can have for these children and their families.‚ÄùAtopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Eighty-five to ninety percent of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  and crusting and oozing  along with increased risk of skin infections. In the U.S.  more than 75 000 children aged 5 years and younger have uncontrolled moderate-to-severe disease and are most in need of new treatment options.Story continuesNaimish Patel  M.D.Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation  Sanofi‚ÄúUntil today  treatment options in the U.S. for infants and children under the age of 6 suffering from moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis have been limited to topical steroids ‚Äì which may be associated with significant safety risks when used long-term. This has left patients and their caregivers in desperate need of medicines that can better address the chronic  long-term nature of the disease. These young people  and their families  often struggle to cope with the significant impact itch can have on them. This approval means that Dupixent  with its well-established safety and efficacy profile  is now available to some of the youngest people living with this disease.‚ÄùGeorge D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer  Regeneron‚ÄúYoung children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis are a significantly underserved population of patients  who spend vulnerable years of their lives suffering through the relentless and far-reaching effects of this chronic disease. Dupixent has changed the atopic dermatitis treatment paradigm ‚Äì significantly clearing skin and reducing itch ‚Äì by targeting an underlying cause of this disease without broadly suppressing the immune system. Today‚Äôs approval brings the proven efficacy and  importantly  well-established safety profile of Dupixent to these young children  making it the first of its kind to be approved for any U.S. patient aged six months or older living with this debilitating disease.‚ÄùThe FDA evaluated Dupixent under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions. The approval is based on data that include a Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent every four weeks (200 mg or 300 mg  based on body weight) plus low-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) or TCS alone (placebo). The trial met the primary and all secondary endpoints. At 16 weeks  patients who received Dupixent with TCS experienced the following  compared to TCS alone:28% achieved clear or almost-clear skin compared to 4% with placebo  the primary endpoint.53% achieved 75% or greater improvement in overall disease severity from baseline compared to 11% with placebo TCS alone  the co-primary endpoint outside of the U.S.48% achieved clinically meaningful reduction in itch compared to 9% with placebo.The safety profile of Dupixent observed through 16 weeks in children aged 6 months to 5 years was similar to the safety profile in patients 6 years and older with atopic dermatitis. The long-term safety profile of Dupixent in children aged 6 months to 5 years through 52 weeks was also similar to the safety profile observed in the pivotal trial and consistent with what was observed in older patients with atopic dermatitis. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease and skin papilloma were  respectively  reported in 5% and 2% of Dupixent patients aged 6 months to 5 years  and none of these cases led to treatment discontinuation.About the Dupixent TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.The primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16. Additional outcome measures included itch reduction which was assessed using a caregiver-reported 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale  with a clinically meaningful improvement defined as ‚â•4-point improvement at week 16.Children who completed the trials were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension trial to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with Dupixent in this age group.About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 6 months to 5 years  Dupixent is administered with a pre-filled syringe every four weeks based on weight (200 mg for children ‚â•5 to <15 kg and 300 mg for children ‚â•15 to <30 kg). Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home. Dupixent does not require initial lab testing or ongoing lab monitoring.Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay¬Æ program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent is approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) or eosinophilic esophagitis in different age populations in a number of countries around the world. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in the European Union and Japan and more than 60 countries. More than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  CRSwNP and eosinophilic esophagitis  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

We are very pleased to announce that we decided the extension of our Pasir Ris facility in Singapore that will be dedicated to 300mm SOI wafers ‚Äù added Paul Boudre.Record revenue and strong increase in EBITDA1 margin2Story continuesConsolidated income statement (part 1)(Euros millions) FY‚Äô22 FY‚Äô21 % change Revenue 863 584 +48% Gross profit 316 183 +72% As a % of revenue 36.6% 31.4% Net research and development expenses (57) (44) +28% Selling  general and administrative expenses (64) (49) +30% Current operating income 195 90 +117% As a % of revenue 22.6% 15.4% EBITDA1 from continuing operations 309 179 +72% As a % of revenue 35.8% 30.7%Consolidated revenue reached the all-time record high level of 863 million Euros in FY‚Äô22. Revenue was up 48% compared with 584 million Euros in FY‚Äô21. This reflects the combination of a 50% growth at constant exchange rates and a negative currency impact of 2%4.150/200-mm wafer sales reached 344 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 (40% of total revenue)  up 26% at constant exchange rates and up 24% on a reported basis compared to FY‚Äô21. This is a combination of i) a strong increase in sales of 150-mm POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers for smartphones RF filters  enabled by the good ramp-up in production following the increase in installed capacity at Bernin III; ii) higher sales of Power-SOI reflecting the recovery of the automotive industry from FY‚Äô21; and iii) a slight increase in 200-mm RF-SOI wafer sales dedicated to radiofrequency applications for smartphones.300-mm wafer sales amounted to 488 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 (57% of total revenue)  up 79% at constant exchange rates and up 77% on a reported basis compared to FY‚Äô21. 300-mm RF-SOI wafer sales recorded a strong increase  supported by the deployment of 5G smartphones requiring more RF-SOI content per smartphone. Increase in sales of FD-SOI wafers was particularly sharp  reflecting a stronger use of FD-SOI technology for applications related to Edge-Computing  Automotive and 5G mmWave modules. Soitec also recorded significantly higher sales of Photonics-SOI for data centers as well as higher sales of Imager-SOI dedicated to 3D sensing applications for smartphones.Total Royalties and other revenue were nearly stable at 30 million Euros (up 2% at constant exchange rates and up 1% on a reported basis).Gross profit reached 316 million Euros in FY‚Äô22  up 72% from 183 million Euros in FY‚Äô21  reflecting a strong 5.2 points increase in gross margin  from 31.4% of revenue in FY‚Äô21 to 36.6% of revenue in FY‚Äô22  despite an unfavorable currency impact. Soitec benefited from a strong operating leverage due to the robust increase in activity as well as from a very good industrial performance across all its industrial facilities leading to a higher use of its production capacity. Soitec also maintained a strong control over costs despite higher energy costs and benefited from a favorable phasing of its long-term agreements with suppliers regarding bulk material prices.Current operating income has more than doubled to 195 million Euros in FY‚Äô22  up from 90 million Euros in FY‚Äô21. This is translating into a strong increase in current operating margin from 15.4% of revenue in FY‚Äô21 to 22.6% of revenue in FY‚Äô22 despite the intensified efforts in R&D and higher SG&A aimed at supporting the Group‚Äôs growth:Net R&D expenses increased from 44 million Euros in FY‚Äô21 to 57 million Euros in FY‚Äô22. Gross R&D expenses increased by 19 million Euros as Soitec continued to invest in its innovation strategy and the expansion of its product portfolio required to support each of its three end markets. The increase in net R&D expenses was however limited to 13 million Euros thanks to higher subsidies and  as a percentage of revenue  they went down from 7.6% in FY‚Äô21 to 6.6% in FY‚Äô22.Selling  general and administrative (SG&A) expenses went up from 49 million Euros in FY‚Äô21 to 64 million Euros in FY‚Äô22  essentially reflecting an increase in expenses related to employee compensation schemes due to the higher number of staff as well as profit-sharing and incentive plans. SG&A expenses were however well monitored  as they went down from 8.4% of revenue in FY‚Äô21 to 7.4% in FY‚Äô22.The EBITDA1 from continuing operations amounted to 309 million Euros in FY‚Äô22  up 72% from 179 million Euros in FY‚Äô21. Despite unfavorable currency impact and continuous efforts in R&D and SG&A  the EBITDA1 margin2 increased by 5.1 points to 35.8% of revenue in FY‚Äô22  compared with 30.7% of revenue in FY‚Äô21  benefitting from a strong operating leverage and a very good industrial performance.Depreciation and amortization expenses went up from 60 million Euros in FY‚Äô21 to 81 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 as a result of the increased industrial capacity as well as R&D investments carried out by the Group in previous years.Consolidated income statement (part 2)(Euros millions) FY‚Äô22 FY‚Äô21 % change Current operating income 195 90 +117% Other operating income and expenses 10 0 Operating income 205 90 +126% Net financial result (1) (15) Income tax (2) (1) Net profit from continuing operations 202 74 +173% Net profit / (loss) from discontinued operations (0) (1) Net profit 202 73 +178%Basic earnings per share (in ‚Ç¨) 5.98 2.19 +173% Diluted earnings per share (in ‚Ç¨) 5.63 2.16 +161% Number of shares 33 753 666 33 176 570 Number of diluted shares 37 181 632 35 014 307The Group recorded a non-recurring income of 10 million Euros in other operating income and expenses in FY‚Äô22. This mainly reflects the full reversal of an impairment loss related to Singapore industrial building which had been recognized in FY‚Äô16. This reversal  which amounted to 9 million Euros  was triggered by the good industrial performance of Singapore facility. Consequently  the operating income reached 205 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 compared to 90 million Euros in FY‚Äô21.The net financial result was a loss of 1 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 compared to a loss of 15 million Euros in FY‚Äô21. On the one hand  the Group recorded an increase of 2 million Euros in net financial expenses  which reached 13 million Euros in FY‚Äô22. On the other hand  the Group recorded a net foreign exchange gain of 13 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 compared to a foreign exchange loss of 4 million Euros recorded in FY‚Äô21.Income tax expense amounted to 2 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 compared to 1 million Euros in FY‚Äô21. As the Group continues to benefit from tax loss carryforwards  the FY‚Äô22 net income tax expense includes a deferred tax income of 12 million Euros following the recognition of deferred tax assets in France and in Singapore.The net profit  Group share nearly tripled to reach 202 million Euros in FY‚Äô22  compared with a net profit of 73 million Euros recorded in FY‚Äô21.Positive Free Cash Flow while capacity investments increased stronglyConsolidated cash-flows(Euros millions) FY‚Äô22 FY‚Äô21 Continuing operations EBITDA1 309 179 Change in working capital (52) 9 Tax paid (2) (14) Net cash generated by operating activities 255 174 Net cash used in investing activities (213) (133) Free Cash Flow 42 42 Net proceeds from OCEANEs 2025 issued - 321 Proceeds from shareholders and other items 2 (1) Drawing on credit lines  new loans and debt repayment (including finance leases) 39 94 Financial expenses (4) (2) Net cash generated by financing activities 37 412 Impact of exchange rate fluctuations 6 (0) Net change in cash 85 454 Discontinued operations (2) (0) Group net change in cash 83 453The cash outflow from working capital amounted to 52 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 as a result of the strong increase in activity  as evidenced by i) a 31 million Euros increase in inventories and ii) a 48 million Euros increase in trade receivables  which were partly offset by iii) a 15 million increase in trade payables  iv) a 6 million Euros decrease in other receivables and v) a 6 million increase in other payables. In FY‚Äô21  when the activity was flat  the Group had recorded a cash inflow from working capital of 9 million Euros.Overall  net cash generated by operating activities went up 46%  from 174 million in FY‚Äô21 to 255 million Euros in FY‚Äô22.The net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations amounted to 213 million Euros in FY‚Äô22  up 61% compared to 133 million Euros in FY‚Äô21. Capital expenditure was mainly related to Bernin (103 million Euros spread between capacity investments and 8 million Euros of capitalized R&D) and Singapore (91 million Euros spent in capacity investments  including 300-mm SOI wafer production  refresh and epitaxy). In addition  the acquisition of NovaSiC represented an investment of 6 million Euros (net of cash).According to IFRS  the cash used in investing activities is calculated net of investments financed through leasing  which accounted for 16 million Euros in FY‚Äô22. Total cash out related to investing activities therefore amounted to 229 million Euros.A positive Free Cash Flow  at 42 million Euros in FY‚Äô22  was achieved while continuing to invest in capital expenditure to support the Group‚Äôs expansion and managing the working capital needs (in FY‚Äô21  Free Cash Flow also stood at 42 million Euros while the activity was flat and the capital expenditure lower).Net cash generated by financing activities of continuing operations amounted to 37 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 essentially reflecting a net increase in borrowings  including i) a 31 million additional drawdown on the 200 million Euros IPCEI long-term loan facility granted by Banque des Territoires (Caisse des D√©p√¥ts Group) as part of the ‚ÄúNano 2022‚Äù project and a net amount of 20 million Euros of bank loans contracted to finance new industrial equipment in Singapore. These were partially offset by repayments of leasing contracts over the period. In comparison  in FY‚Äô21  net cash generated by financing activities of continuing operations amounted to 412 million Euros including 321 million Euros of net proceeds from the issue of OCEANEs 2025.In total  including a 6 million Euros positive impact of exchange rate fluctuations  net cash generated by continuing operations reached 85 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 compared to 454 million Euros generated in FY‚Äô21. Net cash used by discontinued operations amounted to 2 million Euros in FY‚Äô22.Overall  Soitec further increased its cash position  which went up from 644 million Euros on March 31st  2021  to 728 million Euros on March 31st  2022.Further enhanced balance sheetThanks to the strong performance achieved in FY‚Äô22  Soitec has further strengthened its balance sheet.Property  plant and equipment increased by a net amount of 184 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 as a result of capacity investments in Bernin and Singapore.Shareholders‚Äô equity increased by 367 million Euros in FY‚Äô22 to 1 044 million Euros  mainly thanks to the net profit generated during the period and the conversion of the outstanding OCEANEs 2023 convertible bonds.Financial debt decreased by 63 million Euros to 586 million Euros on March 31st  2022. The conversion of 139 million Euros OCEANEs 2023 bonds was partially offset by a ‚Ç¨51m net increase in bank loans  a ‚Ç¨16m mark-to-market increase of financial derivatives and a ‚Ç¨4m net increase in leasing contracts.Lower financial debt combined with the 83 million Euros increase in cash  led to switch from a 4 million Euros net debt position5 on March 31st  2021  to a 142 million Euros positive net cash position5 on March 31st  2022.FY‚Äô23 OutlookSoitec expects FY‚Äô23 revenue growth to reach around 20% at constant exchange rates and perimeter. Growth will continue to be driven by an increase in sales in each one of the Group‚Äôs three end-markets  as Soitec expects to continue benefiting from the 5G deployment  from an increase of the automotive market as well as from sustained market trends for smart devices.Soitec expects FY‚Äô23 EBITDA1 margin2 to reach around 36% notably thanks to a strong operating leverage driven by higher volumes. Soitec expects its industrial performance to remain strong despite higher bulk material and energy prices.In addition  Soitec expects FY‚Äô23 net cash out related to capital expenditure to reach around 260 million Euros  essentially reflecting capacity investments to support first acquisitions of SiC tools (150 & 200-mm) in Bernin IV  300-mm SOI refresh capacity in Bernin IV and further 300-mm SOI capacity increase in Singapore facility  including both refresh and epitaxy capacity.Key events of FY‚Äô22Early redemption of the bonds convertible into and/or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANEs) due June 28  2023On September 16th  2021  Soitec announced its decision to redeem all outstanding OCEANEs due June 28th  2023  at a price per OCEANE equal to par (i.e. 104.47 Euros). On October 8th  2021  all bondholders had opted for the exercise of their conversion/exchange right at the conversion/exchange ratio of 1 Soitec share per OCEANE. Consequently  1 319 318 new Soitec shares were issued  representing 3.90% of Soitec share capital. On October 18th  2021  following the conversion of all OCEANEs 2023  share capital amounted to 70 275 148.00 Euros and comprised 34 896 560 ordinary shares  and 241 014 preferred shares  all with a par value of 2.00 Euros.Soitec commits to the reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions to limit climate change to 1.5¬∞COn December 7th  2021  Soitec obtained the approval of its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Steering Committee  attesting that Soitec's targets are in line with the levels required to limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab)...,"Children treated with Dupixent and topical corticosteroids (TCS) achieved clearer skin  experienced significantly improved overall disease severity and significantly reduced itch compared to TCS alone at week 16 in a Phase 3 trialLong-term safety data from a 52-week open-label extension trial in this age group reinforce the well-established safety profile of Dupixent observed across all other approved age groupsDupixent is the first and only biologic medicine approved to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis from infancy through adulthoodTARRYTOWN  N.Y. and PARIS  June 7  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) for children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Regulatory filings for this age group are underway by the European Medicines Agency and regulatory authorities in additional countries.""Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in babies and young children is more than just a rash ‚Äì the intense itch can make them scratch uncontrollably throughout the day and night and cause their skin to crack and bleed "" said Julie Block  President and Chief Executive Officer at National Eczema Association. ""Caregivers do their best to manage skincare routines multiple times a day  but for many  topical treatments are not enough. We're pleased to see how scientific innovation and research continues to address unmet needs for the atopic dermatitis community  and we're hopeful for the positive impact Dupixent can have for these children and their families.""Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Eighty-five to ninety percent of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  and crusting and oozing. In the U.S.  more than 75 000 children aged 5 years and younger have uncontrolled moderate-to-severe disease and are most in need of new treatment options. Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of a young child and their caregivers.Story continues""Young children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis are a significantly underserved population of patients  who spend vulnerable years of their lives suffering through the relentless and far-reaching effects of this chronic disease "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Dupixent has changed the atopic dermatitis treatment paradigm ‚Äì significantly clearing skin and reducing itch ‚Äì by targeting an underlying cause of this disease without broadly suppressing the immune system. Today's approval brings the proven efficacy and  importantly  well-established safety profile of Dupixent to these young children  making it the first of its kind to be approved for any U.S. patient aged six months or older living with this debilitating disease.""""Until today  treatment options in the U.S. for infants and children under the age of 6 suffering from moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis have been limited to topical steroids ‚Äì which may be associated with significant safety risks when used long-term. This has left patients and their caregivers in desperate need of medicines that can better address the chronic  long-term nature of the disease "" Naimish Patel  M.D  Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""These young people  and their families  often struggle to cope with the significant impact itch can have not only on the body  but on many other facets of daily life. This approval means that Dupixent  with its well-established safety and efficacy profile  is now available to some of the youngest people living with this disease.""The FDA evaluated Dupixent under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions. The approval is based on data that include a Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent every four weeks (200 mg or 300 mg  based on body weight) plus low-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) or TCS alone. The trial met the primary and all secondary endpoints. At 16 weeks  patients who received Dupixent with TCS experienced the following  compared to TCS alone (placebo):28% achieved clear or almost-clear skin compared to 4% with placebo  the primary endpoint.53% achieved 75% or greater improvement in overall disease severity from baseline compared to 11% with placebo  the co-primary endpoint outside of the U.S.48% achieved clinically meaningful reduction in itch compared to 9% with placebo.The safety profile of Dupixent observed through 16 weeks in children aged 6 months to 5 years was similar to the safety profile in patients 6 years and older with atopic dermatitis. The long-term safety profile of Dupixent in children aged 6 months to 5 years through 52 weeks was also similar to the safety profile observed in the pivotal trial and consistent with what was observed in older patients with atopic dermatitis. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease and skin papilloma were  respectively  reported in 5% and 2% of Dupixent patients aged 6 months to 5 years  and none of these cases led to treatment discontinuation.About the Dupixent TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.The primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16. Additional outcome measures included itch reduction  which was assessed using a caregiver-reported 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale  with a clinically meaningful improvement defined as ‚â•4-point improvement at week 16.Children who completed the trials were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension trial to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with Dupixent in this age group.About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 6 months to 5 years  Dupixent is administered with a pre-filled syringe every four weeks based on weight (200 mg for children ‚â•5 to <15 kg and 300 mg for children ‚â•15 to <30 kg). Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home. Dupixent does not require initial lab testing or ongoing lab monitoring.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay¬Æ program. For more information  please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent is approved for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) or eosinophilic esophagitis in different age populations in a number of countries around the world. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in the European Union and Japan and more than 60 countries. More than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  CRSwNP and eosinophilic esophagitis  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.About Regeneron's VelocImmune¬Æ TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Morgan Collaborate To Offer Investors Access To Danish Capital Markets,10 hours ago,"Euronext Securities Copenhagen today announced that J.P. Morgan has signed an agreement to become a direct participant in the Danish market.The agreement reflects a growing trend of shortening the value chain between issuers and investors. Across Europe  it is becoming more relevant for international players in the custody business to directly access local markets through direct connectivity with local CSDs. There are obvious advantages of this for both custodians and the clients they serve  ranging from reduced costs  a shortened custody chain  enhanced transparency and operational efficiencies. Euronext Securities is responding to this trend by converging the infrastructure and expanding services.Anthony Attia  Global Head of Primary Markets and Post Trade at Euronext  commented: ‚ÄúWe have had a close relationship with J.P. Morgan for a number of years  and we are proud to bring this collaboration to the next level and support them in their role as an Account Controller on the Danish market. Shortening of the custody value chain is a key assumption of Euronext‚Äôs ‚ÄúGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äù strategic plan. Today‚Äôs announcement shows this assumption is right. Structural changes like this one do not only produce tangible benefits for international clients  they fundamentally better connect European economies to global capital markets. Concretely international investors now have a more direct and efficient access to 1.5 trillion euros of assets issued in the Danish capital market.The most efficient way of servicing a growing marketFor J.P.

Soitec also recorded significantly higher sales of Photonics-SOI for data centers as well as higher sales of Imager-SOI dedicated to 3D sensing applications for smartphones. Total Royalties and other revenue were nearly stable at 30 million Euros (up 2% at constant exchange rates and up 1% on a reported basis).Gross profit reached 316 million Euros in FY'22  up 72% from 183 million Euros in FY'21  reflecting a strong 5.2 points increase in gross margin  from 31.4% of revenue in FY'21 to 36.6% of revenue in FY'22  despite an unfavorable currency impact. Soitec benefited from a strong operating leverage due to the robust increase in activity as well as from a very good industrial performance across all its industrial facilities leading to a higher use of its production capacity. Soitec also maintained a strong control over costs despite higher energy costs and benefited from a favorable phasing of its long-term agreements with suppliers regarding bulk material prices.Current operating income has more than doubled to 195 million Euros in FY'22  up from 90 million Euros in FY'21. This is translating into a strong increase in current operating margin from 15.4% of revenue in FY'21 to 22.6% of revenue in FY'22 despite the intensified efforts in R&D and higher SG&A aimed at supporting the Group's growth:Net R&D expenses increased from 44 million Euros in FY'21 to 57 million Euros in FY'22. Gross R&D expenses increased by 19 million Euros as Soitec continued to invest in its innovation strategy and the expansion of its product portfolio required to support each of its three end markets. The increase in net R&D expenses was however limited to 13 million Euros thanks to higher subsidies and  as a percentage of revenue  they went down from 7.6% in FY'21 to 6.6% in FY'22.increased from 44 million Euros in FY'21 to 57 million Euros in FY'22. Gross R&D expenses increased by 19 million Euros as Soitec continued to invest in its innovation strategy and the expansion of its product portfolio required to support each of its three end markets. The increase in net R&D expenses was however limited to 13 million Euros thanks to higher subsidies and  as a percentage of revenue  they went down from 7.6% in FY'21 to 6.6% in FY'22. Selling  general and administrative (SG&A) expenses went up from 49 million Euros in FY'21 to 64 million Euros in FY'22  essentially reflecting an increase in expenses related to employee compensation schemes due to the higher number of staff as well as profit-sharing and incentive plans. SG&A expenses were however well monitored  as they went down from 8.4% of revenue in FY'21 to 7.4% in FY'22.The EBITDA1 from continuing operations amounted to 309 million Euros in FY'22  up 72% from 179 million Euros in FY'21. Despite unfavorable currency impact and continuous efforts in R&D and SG&A  the EBITDA1 margin2 increased by 5.1 points to 35.8% of revenue in FY'22  compared with 30.7% of revenue in FY'21  benefitting from a strong operating leverage and a very good industrial performance.Depreciation and amortization expenses went up from 60 million Euros in FY'21 to 81 million Euros in FY'22 as a result of the increased industrial capacity as well as R&D investments carried out by the Group in previous years.Consolidated income statement (part 2)(Euros millions) FY'22 FY'21 % change Current operating income 195 90 +117% Other operating income and expenses 10 0 Operating income 205 90 +126% Net financial result (1) (15) Income tax (2) (1) Net profit from continuing operations 202 74 +173% Net profit / (loss) from discontinued operations (0) (1) Net profit 202 73 +178%Basic earnings per share (in ‚Ç¨) 5.98 2.19 +173% Diluted earnings per share (in ‚Ç¨) 5.63 2.16 +161% Number of shares 33 753 666 33 176 570 Number of diluted shares 37 181 632 35 014 307The Group recorded a non-recurring income of 10 million Euros in other operating income and expenses in FY'22. This mainly reflects the full reversal of an impairment loss related to Singapore industrial building which had been recognized in FY'16. This reversal  which amounted to 9 million Euros  was triggered by the good industrial performance of Singapore facility. Consequently  the operating income reached 205 million Euros in FY'22 compared to 90 million Euros in FY'21.The net financial result was a loss of 1 million Euros in FY'22 compared to a loss of 15 million Euros in FY'21. On the one hand  the Group recorded an increase of 2 million Euros in net financial expenses  which reached 13 million Euros in FY'22. On the other hand  the Group recorded a net foreign exchange gain of 13 million Euros in FY'22 compared to a foreign exchange loss of 4 million Euros recorded in FY'21.Income tax expense amounted to 2 million Euros in FY'22 compared to 1 million Euros in FY'21. As the Group continues to benefit from tax loss carryforwards  the FY'22 net income tax expense includes a deferred tax income of 12 million Euros following the recognition of deferred tax assets in France and in Singapore.The net profit  Group share nearly tripled to reach 202 million Euros in FY'22  compared with a net profit of 73 million Euros recorded in FY'21.Positive Free Cash Flow while capacity investments increased stronglyConsolidated cash-flows(Euros millions) FY'22 FY'21 Continuing operations EBITDA1 309 179 Change in working capital (52) 9 Tax paid (2) (14) Net cash generated by operating activities 255 174 Net cash used in investing activities (213) (133) Free Cash Flow 42 42 Net proceeds from OCEANEs 2025 issued - 321 Proceeds from shareholders and other items 2 (1) Drawing on credit lines  new loans and debt repayment (including finance leases) 39 94 Financial expenses (4) (2) Net cash generated by financing activities 37 412 Impact of exchange rate fluctuations 6 (0) Net change in cash 85 454 Discontinued operations (2) (0) Group net change in cash 83 453The cash outflow from working capital amounted to 52 million Euros in FY'22 as a result of the strong increase in activity  as evidenced by i) a 31 million Euros increase in inventories and ii) a 48 million Euros increase in trade receivables  which were partly offset by iii) a 15 million increase in trade payables  iv) a 6 million Euros decrease in other receivables and v) a 6 million increase in other payables. In FY'21  when the activity was flat  the Group had recorded a cash inflow from working capital of 9 million Euros.Overall  net cash generated by operating activities went up 46%  from 174 million in FY'21 to 255 million Euros in FY'22.The net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations amounted to 213 million Euros in FY'22  up 61% compared to 133 million Euros in FY'21. Capital expenditure was mainly related to Bernin (103 million Euros spread between capacity investments and 8 million Euros of capitalized R&D) and Singapore (91 million Euros spent in capacity investments  including 300-mm SOI wafer production  refresh and epitaxy). In addition  the acquisition of NovaSiC represented an investment of 6 million Euros (net of cash).According to IFRS  the cash used in investing activities is calculated net of investments financed through leasing  which accounted for 16 million Euros in FY'22. Total cash out related to investing activities therefore amounted to 229 million Euros.A positive Free Cash Flow  at 42 million Euros in FY'22  was achieved while continuing to invest in capital expenditure to support the Group's expansion and managing the working capital needs (in FY'21  Free Cash Flow also stood at 42 million Euros while the activity was flat and the capital expenditure lower).Net cash generated by financing activities of continuing operations amounted to 37 million Euros in FY'22 essentially reflecting a net increase in borrowings  including i) a 31 million additional drawdown on the 200 million Euros IPCEI long-term loan facility granted by Banque des Territoires (Caisse des D√©p√¥ts Group) as part of the ""Nano 2022"" project and a net amount of 20 million Euros of bank loans contracted to finance new industrial equipment in Singapore. These were partially offset by repayments of leasing contracts over the period. In comparison  in FY'21  net cash generated by financing activities of continuing operations amounted to 412 million Euros including 321 million Euros of net proceeds from the issue of OCEANEs 2025.In total  including a 6 million Euros positive impact of exchange rate fluctuations  net cash generated by continuing operations reached 85 million Euros in FY'22 compared to 454 million Euros generated in FY'21. Net cash usedby discontinued operations amounted to 2 million Euros in FY'22.Overall  Soitec further increased its cash position  which went up from 644 million Euros on March 31st  2021  to 728 million Euros on March 31st  2022.Further enhanced balance sheetThanks to the strong performance achieved in FY'22  Soitec has further strengthened its balance sheet.Property  plant and equipment increased by a net amount of 184 million Euros in FY'22 as a result of capacity investments in Bernin and Singapore.Shareholders' equity increased by 367 million Euros in FY'22 to 1 044 million Euros  mainly thanks to the net profit generated during the period and the conversion of the outstanding OCEANEs 2023 convertible bonds.Financial debt decreased by 63 million Euros to 586 million Euros on March 31st  2022. The conversion of 139 million Euros OCEANEs 2023 bonds was partially offset by a ‚Ç¨51m net increase in bank loans  a ‚Ç¨16m mark-to-market increase of financial derivatives and a ‚Ç¨4m net increase in leasing contracts.Lower financial debt combined with the 83 million Euros increase in cash  led to switch from a 4 million Euros net debt position5 on March 31st  2021  to a 142 million Euros positive net cash position5 on March 31st  2022.FY'23 OutlookSoitec expects FY'23 revenue growth to reach around 20% at constant exchange rates and perimeter. Growth will continue to be driven by an increase in sales in each one of the Group's three end-markets  as Soitec expects to continue benefiting from the 5G deployment  from an increase of the automotive market as well as from sustained market trends for smart devices.Soitec expects FY'23 EBITDA1 margin2 to reach around 36% notably thanks to a strong operating leverage driven by higher volumes. Soitec expects its industrial performance to remain strong despite higher bulk material and energy prices.In addition  Soitec expects FY'23 net cash out related to capital expenditure to reach around 260 million Euros  essentially reflecting capacity investments to support first acquisitions of SiC tools (150 & 200-mm) in Bernin IV  300-mm SOI refresh capacity in Bernin IV and further 300-mm SOI capacity increase in Singapore facility  including both refresh and epitaxy capacity.Key events of FY'22Early redemption of the bonds convertible into and/or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANEs) due June 28  2023On September 16th  2021  Soitec announced its decision to redeem all outstanding OCEANEs due June 28th  2023  at a price per OCEANE equal to par (i.e. 104.47 Euros). On October 8th  2021  all bondholders had opted for the exercise of their conversion/exchange right at the conversion/exchange ratio of 1 Soitec share per OCEANE. Consequently  1 319 318 new Soitec shares were issued  representing 3.90% of Soitec share capital. On October 18th  2021  following the conversion of all OCEANEs 2023  share capital amounted to 70 275 148.00 Euros and comprised 34 896 560 ordinary shares  and 241 014 preferred shares  all with a par value of 2.00 Euros.Soitec commits to the reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions to limit climate change to 1.5¬∞COn December 7th  2021  Soitec obtained the approval of its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Steering Committee  attesting that Soitec's targets are in line with the levels required to limit global warming to 1.5¬∞C.
