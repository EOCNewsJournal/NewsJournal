Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ""believes""  ""anticipates"" and ""expects"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen‚Äôs ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

Passengers are rediscovering the pleasures of flight‚Ä¶ along with some of the more laborious aspects of catching a plane such as that delicate phase at the security checkpoint where liquids and electronic items have to be removed from our hand luggage and scanned separately. In this context  Thales has developed a new scanner named HELIXVIEW  which could revolutionize the airport experience for both passengers and airlines companies.HELIXVIEW  based on Thales expertise in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cybersecurity  is a stationary  compact  and lightweight EDS CB C3-compliant scanner (the next standard applied to the certification for EDS CB) that combines X-ray nanotechnology-based electronic scanning and 3D imaging reconstruction. With this solution installed in checkpoints  passengers will no longer need to remove their items from luggage. The technology is fine-tuned to detect all forms of prohibited items  whether explosives  knives  or even weapons that have been dismantled and positioned in separate parts across several bags.Artificial Intelligence capabilities are leveraged to detect and interpret threats. The system then instantly provides the operator with a threat/no threat instruction for the bag.Security airport concerns remain as present as ever for airport staff and airlines  who need to be able to ensure precise and failsafe threat detection. Checkpoints need higher degrees of security and  by association  higher levels of technological requirements and more powerful new-generation equipment. With a reduced size  weight and overall footprint  HELIXVIEW will enable airports to optimize the space at their disposal. Instead of heavy and cumbersome parts that require two people to lift them out of the machine for repair  the mechanics of this system are simple and motionless; there are no moving parts or vibrations. Anything that needs to be replaced can be done quickly  easily and no physically demanding.‚ÄúI am very pleased to present HELIXVIEW  our new airport scanner. I am sure that passengers will appreciate this new smoother and faster security checks using attractively and ergonomically-designed systems. This new technology will bring higher security and comfort with an optimal cost-performance ratio‚Äù ‚Äì Yannick Assouad  ThalesThe HELIXVIEW product is aiming for certification by the end of 2023.This new solution beneficiates from the support of BPI through i-demo project initiative.Meet Thales at the Passenger Terminal Expo 2002 ‚Äì June 15 16 & 17 ‚Äì Paris Expo ‚ÄòPorte de Versailles‚Äô - Booth Z1.3000.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies  investing in digital and ‚Äúdeep tech‚Äù innovations ‚Äì connectivity  big data  artificial intelligence  cybersecurity and quantum technologies ‚Äì to build a confident future crucial for the development of our societies.

Based on the results of Inventiva‚Äôs NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in NASH  the authors of the abstract analysed markers of cardiometabolic health in relation with the weight variation observed in patients treated with lanifibranor or on placebo. The treatment with lanifibranor showed beneficial effects on biomarkers of cardiometabolic health  including markers of lipid and glucose metabolism  insulin resistance and inflammation independent of weight change. These beneficial effects occurred in parallel with an increase of adiponectin levels demonstrating an improvement in adipose tissue health. These results provide further evidence that PPARŒ≥-induced weight gain is associated with improved insulin sensitivity  i.e. is metabolically healthy and thus distinct from lifestyle-related weight gain.Story continuesThe second abstract evaluates the beneficial effect of lanifibranor treatment on the FibroScan-aspartate aminotransferase (FastTM) score  a promising non-invasive test (NIT) for active NASH with significant fibrosis. Based on the data of the NATIVE trial  the authors evaluated the effect of treatment with lanifibranor on the FastTM score the correlation between the histological and biomarker responses observed in patients with NASH and fibrosis F2/F3. The data showed that the treatment with lanifibranor induced a significant reduction of the FastTM score compared to placebo. This reduction under lanifibranor is associated with the histological endpoint ‚Äòresolution of NASH and improvement of fibrosis‚Äô  and with the improvement in triglycerides  Apo-C3 and ferritin levels. These results highlight the potential of the FastTM score as a NIT to monitor disease progression and response to therapy.The third abstract focuses on the identification of biomarkers of histological response in patients with non-cirrhotic NASH treated with lanifibranor. The authors conducted an assessment of serum-based biomarkers from the Inventiva‚Äôs NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial in order to identify biological signatures of the liver histological endpoints. The authors identified four biomarkers: baseline levels of adiponectin and ferritin  relative changes of MMP9 and transferrin at end of treatment  which combined into a score could predict the ‚ÄòNASH resolution and fibrosis improvement‚Äô with a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 95%. Four different biomarkers were identified as being predictive of the histological endpoint ‚ÄòNASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis‚Äô: baseline CK18-M65  absolute change of hyaluronate  relative changes of fructosamine and ALT at end of treatment  with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 89%. This exploratory assessment demonstrates that the combination of biomarker signatures allowed a non-invasive identification of histological response under lanifibranor treatment in NASH with a good diagnostic performance.The details of the various presentations are as follows:Abstract #1 :Abstract title: ""The pan-PPAR agonist lanifibranor improves markers of cardiometabolic health in patients with NASH independent of weight change"" Publication number: SAT119 Presentation type: Poster presentation Authors: Michael P.

The technology can be adapted for all vehicles equipped with a special ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù that transfers the energy incoming from the road infrastructure directly to the electric motor  extending the range  while conserving the vehicle battery charge.The pilot project of Stellantis and all partners involved is coordinated by A35 Brebemi  a company owned by the global transportation infrastructure operator Aleatica that focuses on sustainable and innovative mobility solutions.‚ÄúOur long-term strategic plan  Dare Forward 2030  is based on the premise of bringing ‚Äòcutting-edge freedom of mobility‚Äô to all and this project is the very essence of where we‚Äôre headed as a company ‚Äù said Anne-Lise Richard  Head of Global e-Mobility Business Unit  Stellantis. ‚ÄúWorking with this incredible group of partners  we have proven that inductive recharging technology can power our electrified future. These joint projects are exciting steps as we work to achieve longer battery lifespan  lower range anxiety  greater energy efficiency  smaller battery size  outstanding performance and lower weight and cost.‚ÄùStory continuesWork at ‚ÄúArena del Futuro‚Äù shows that a BEV  like the F iat New 500 outfitted to test the system  can travel at typical highway speeds without consuming the energy stored in its battery. Tests are showing that the efficiency of the energy flow from the asphalt to the car is comparable to the typical efficiency of fast charging stations  so the driver does not need to stop to recharge. Furthermore  measurements on magnetic field intensity prove that there is no impact on the driver and passengers.At the event in Chiari  a Maserati Grecale Folgore was displayed to announce Maserati‚Äôs upcoming involvement in the project. Folgore identifies the full electric version of Maserati  which will electrify its entire product range by 2025. The Grecale Folgore will be outfitted and run on the ""Arena del Futuro‚Äù circuit to collect data and deploy a detailed performance analysis.‚ÄúArena del Futuro‚Äù is powered by direct current (DC)  which offers several concrete and unique advantages  including:Reducing the power losses in the energy distribution process;Guaranteeing a direct integration with renewable energy sources without the need to convert DC into AC;Allowing the use of thinner cables than the AC current distribution with evident advantages in terms of packaging  weight and harmonic pollution; and Using aluminum cables for current distribution  which is easier to source  costs half compared to copper  and is lighter and easier to recycle in a circular economy business model.DWPT is one of the technologies intended to simplify the customer approach to electric mobility and ultimately to respond in a tangible way to the requirements for decarbonization and environmental sustainability in the mobility sector. Time magazine cited in-road inductive charging system behind ‚ÄúArena del Futuro‚Äù as one of the 100 most important inventions of 2021.These goals are achievable thanks to the innovative technologies offered by 5G  IoT (Internet of Things) and AI-based application solutions  which facilitate the exchange of information between the vehicle and the system management platform  increasing road safety and travel efficiency. Inductive energy transfer of DWPT means there are no exposed cables  keeping the road surface safe for people to walk on.The technology attracts interest for commercial development globally due to its versatility in its dynamic and static inductive versions. In addition to being useful on roads and motorways  it is also suitable when combined with other infrastructures like harbors  airports  and parking lots.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

(NASDAQ: VEON) (Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides mobile connectivity and services  updated the Company's stakeholders on key financial an‚Ä¶,"AMSTERDAM  June 10  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today the Chief Executive Officer of VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON) (Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides mobile connectivity and services  updated the Company's stakeholders on key financial and business developments.In his letter  VEON's CEO Kaan Terzioƒülu wrote:Dear VEON stakeholder I am pleased to update you on our latest achievements in key areas of interest for VEON Group. Since my last letter we have closed several important transactions and we are driving several others towards completion  while the operating performance of our companies remains healthy.As a global operator providing digital services to almost 220 million people across eight countries  VEON (NASDAQ: VEON) (Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) continues to attract international investors such as EXOR Capital (UK)  Shah Capital (US)  Kopernik Global Investors (US) and PIMCO (US)  who recently increased their holdings of our shares  according to the latest public filings. I would like to express my appreciation for your continued trust in VEON.Liquidity  capital structure and M&AThis week we announced the successful closing of the sale of our Georgian operations to our former local partner  delivering proceeds of USD 45 million  equivalent to 3.5 times 2021 EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16). This is another step in strengthening our focus on high-growth markets with a critical mass of users  streamlining our Group operations to create long-term value for customers  partners and shareholders. Beeline Georgia is a leader in terms of 4G penetration and digital services  thanks to its successful execution of VEON's digital operator strategy. The local management team and the new Georgian shareholder are committed to the successful development of the company and to supporting the digital transformation of the country.Another important focus area for VEON recently has been liquidity management and we have increased our Group's total cash and deposits to approximately USD 2.4 billion  including USD 1.8 billion equivalent of USD- and EUR-denominated cash and deposits held by the headquarters in Amsterdam. This was achieved after we further enhanced VEON Group's cash position by increasing our current revolving credit facility utilization to USD 973 million  as announced on 25 May 2022. As stated previously  we do not have any material debt maturing in 2022.In addition to HQ-level liquidity  the self-sufficient nature of our operating companies in terms of financing was again highlighted recently. Jazz in Pakistan and Banglalink in Bangladesh have successfully raised local long-term funding to cover their spectrum requirements  with 10-year PKR 40 billion (c. USD 222 million) and 5-year BDT 12 billion (c. USD 135 million) loans  respectively. We have also made material progress in the simplification of our capital structure. As communicated on 21 April 2022  a total of RUB 90 billion in loans were novated to PJSC VimpelCom  with the former borrower (VEON Finance Ireland) and the former guarantor (VEON Holdings BV) having been released. This transaction aligned ruble liabilities with ruble revenues and reduced HQ external debt. We are also working on rationalizing VEON Group's ownership structure of Beeline Kazakhstan.The next important step in portfolio management is now the pending completion of the put option for Djezzy in Algeria for USD 682 million  as disclosed in our 1Q22 trading update on 28 April 2022. This will both better streamline our operations and further improve our cash position.Supporting connectivity across our marketsToday the humanitarian need for connectivity is as important as other basic needs such as food  water  shelter and health care. In fact  connectivity is often a crucial lifeline for each one of us  as we rely on telecommunications networks to secure basic needs  stay connected with loved ones  access reliable information and use key digital services.In Ukraine  the Kyivstar team continues to make an extraordinary effort to keep the networks running despite the damage to towers and power supplies. Since the beginning of the conflict  more than 3 400 repairs of base stations have been performed  and some 26 500 meters of broken fiber-optics have been replaced. More than 90% of Kyivstar's network is still operational. We have added 100 new base stations across the Western part of the country and upgraded hundreds more with the latest technologies to enable uninterrupted communications.Growth across our footprint driven by the digital operator modelThe latest available data shows that our double and multiplay 4G subscribers reached 35% of the Group's monthly active customer base. This supported continued high single-digit local currency year-on-year growth in the Group's service revenues  both in April and May.In Pakistan  Jazz continues to perform strongly  enabled by growth in 4G customer base. As of May  it serves 50% of its customer base with 4G connectivity. With its 4G offering  Jazz continues to lead the market in terms of both revenue and customer base growth.In Bangladesh  our planned additional network coverage is expanding fast. The positive impact of this was already evident in Q1 as Banglalink recorded 8.6% year-on-year revenue growth. This performance has further accelerated: Banglalink's topline grew at a double-digit year-on-year pace in both April and May  driven by the 45% increase in its double and multiplay 4G customers.Beeline Kazakhstan is heading toward its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit topline growth  powered by the highest customer base 4G penetration among our larger operations. Over 66% of Beeline Kazakhstan's customers are now 4G users  bringing it closer to the 70% 4G penetration ambition that we set out at our Investor Day in December 2021. I had the opportunity this week to personally reiterate our commitment to support the Government's priorities for mobile communications  internet coverage and digital transformation  along with its long-term ambition of achieving net zero CO 2 emissions  at a plenary session of the Foreign Investors' Council in Kazakhstan  attended by key members of the Government and chaired by the country's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.I spent a couple of days with the Group management team in Uzbekistan at the beginning of May  witnessing first-hand the Beeline team's excellent work in building a success story. Beeline's robust double-digit performance continued during April and May  driven by increasing customer satisfaction  which we see in NPS and market share performance  and an impressive  sustained 4G growth. Beeline has also recently launched new bundles  to which nearly 1.2 million customers signed up in the first few months  including more than half a million customers with digital-enabled offers.In Algeria  as we near completion of the sale of Djezzy  we have been building on five consecutive quarters of growth  welcoming the recent addition of 2300 MHz band spectrum and committing around USD 20 million in additional capex to rapidly deliver increased 4G performance in densely populated urban areas.2022 AGM to convene on 29 JuneAs announced on 25 May 2022  the VEON Board of Directors has set the Company's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders for 29 June 2022. The Board has recommended 11 Directors.

June 09  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eagle Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (Nasdaq: EGRX) (‚ÄúEagle‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) today announced it has completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Acacia Pharma Group plc (‚ÄúAcacia Pharma‚Äù) (EURONEXT: ACPH) by way of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the United Kingdom‚Äôs Companies Act 2006 (the ‚ÄúTransaction‚Äù).‚ÄúThe closing of this transaction is a great achievement for Eagle both strategically and financially. The addition of the two products expands our presence in the acute care space  and we believe that our highly capable hospital-based salesforce will have great success commercializing these assets. We believe BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO represent two compelling opportunities  as both address significant unmet clinical needs ‚Äù stated Scott Tarriff  President and Chief Executive Officer of Eagle Pharmaceuticals.‚ÄúWith the recent launches of vasopressin and PEMFEXYTM and the completion of this transaction  Eagle has gone from three commercial products to eight within a year  with a ninth on the horizon if the new drug application submitted for landiolol last month is approved. The acquisition of Acacia Pharma should not only help improve the care of patients undergoing medical treatments but also solidify our leadership position in the hospital and oncology space and bring long-term value to our shareholders ‚Äù concluded Tarriff.Key HighlightsStrong synergistic fit with Eagle‚Äôs infrastructure and current and planned portfolio of hospital products;Two commercially compelling FDA-approved products: BARHEMSYS ¬Æ is the first and only antiemetic approved by the FDA for rescue treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting (‚ÄúPONV‚Äù) despite prophylaxis 3 . Eagle currently calls on healthcare providers and institutions representing over 70% of the expected BARHEMSYS addressable market opportunity; BARHEMSYS is also approved for the treatment of PONV in patients who have not received prophylaxis and for the prevention of PONV. The total estimated annual U.S. addressable market for prophylaxis and rescue is $2.7 billion 4 ; BYFAVO ¬Æ is indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less  with an estimated total addressable market in procedural sedation of more than $0.4 billion per year in the U.S. 5Opportunity to realize the full potential of BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO by leveraging Eagle‚Äôs longstanding relationships and highly experienced  hospital-based salesforce;The addition of diversified but complementary revenue streams  accelerating Eagle‚Äôs growth and strengthening its advantage in acute care; andExpected to be earnings accretive in 2024.Story continuesProduct Descriptions BARHEMSYS¬Æ (amisulpride for injection)6 is the first and only FDA-approved product for PONV rescue after failed prophylaxis. It is a selective dopamine D 2 /D 3 antagonist with a broad  differentiated label. PONV is a common complication of surgery  occurring in approximately 30% of all surgical patients and 80% of high-risk patients. PONV is associated with the use of anesthetic gases and opioid painkillers and is particularly common following gynecological  abdominal  breast  eye  and ear operations  especially those lasting an hour or more. PONV can delay hospital discharge; result in re-admission after in-patient procedures; and lead to day-case patients being admitted to the hospital  all of which can result in significantly increased healthcare costs. By reducing these risks  BARHEMSYS¬Æ offers the potential for significant economic savings to hospitals and ambulatory centers. There are approximately 70 million invasive surgical procedures where patients receive antiemetic prophylaxis annually in the U.S. Approximately 10 million of these patients per year require PONV rescue treatment. BARHEMSYS is the only drug with an FDA-approved indication to treat patients who have failed PONV prophylaxis. It has an established safety profile and efficacy demonstrated in multiple well-controlled clinical studies. BARHEMSYS¬Æ is nonsedating  a common complaint of standard antiemetic agents. Patients experiencing PONV who were treated in a pivotal clinical trial and failed prophylaxis were treated with BARHEMSYS. These patients were observed to have shorter post-anesthesia care (PACU) and hospital stays then patients who were not. Please see Important Safety Information for BARHEMSYS  below.BYFAVO¬Æ (remimazolam for injection)7 is a rapid onset/offset procedural sedative with an established safety and efficacy profile. Additional benefits include predictability and a readily available reversal agent. Please see Important Safety Information  including boxed warning  below. BYFAVO has a compelling commercial opportunity  addressing a clear unmet need. There has been no innovation in the sedation space for over 20 years. Customers seek a fast onset  titratability  and rapid recovery for quick discharge  and shorter procedure times allow for increased procedural volumes. BYFAVO has a broad label and potential health economic benefits and may enable shorter procedure times and greater patient throughput. It is indicated for procedural sedation in adults in procedures lasting 30 minutes or less and has a substantial clinical data package demonstrating efficacy and safety in colonoscopies and bronchoscopies  including the most challenging patients.AdvisorsCooley (UK) LLP acted as legal advisor and William Blair & Company  L.L.C. acted as exclusive financial advisor to Eagle Pharmaceuticals in connection with the transaction.

WilsonIn-Site Communications  Inc.T: 212-452-2793E: lwilson@insitecony.comImportant Safety Information for BARHEMSYS¬Æ (amisulpride) InjectionContraindicationBARHEMSYS is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to amisulpride.QT ProlongationBARHEMSYS causes dose- and concentration-dependent prolongation of the QT interval. The recommended dosage is 5 mg or 10 mg as a single intravenous (IV) dose infused over 1 to 2 minutes.Avoid BARHEMSYS in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients taking droperidol.Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is recommended in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias/cardiac conduction disorders  electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.  hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia)  congestive heart failure  and in patients taking other medicinal products (e.g.  ondansetron) or with other medical conditions known to prolong the QT interval.Adverse ReactionsCommon adverse reactions reported in ‚â• 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 5 mg (n=748) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=741) in clinical trials for the prevention of PONV were: chills (4% vs. 3%)  hypokalemia (4% vs. 2%)  procedural hypotension (3% vs. 2%)  and abdominal distention (2% vs. 1%).Serum prolactin concentrations were measured in one prophylaxis study where 5% (9/176) of BARHEMSYS-treated patients had increased blood prolactin reported as an adverse reaction compared with 1% (1/166) of placebo-treated patients.The most common adverse reaction  reported in ‚â• 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 10 mg (n=418) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=416)  in clinical trials for the treatment of PONV was infusion site pain (6% vs. 4%).Use in Specific PopulationsLactationAmisulpride is present in human milk. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed child and no information on the effects of amisulpride on milk production.BARHEMSYS may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels  which may lead to a reversible increase in maternal milk production. In a clinical trial  serum prolactin concentrations in females (n=112) increased from a mean of 10 ng/mL at baseline to 32 ng/mL after BARHEMSYS treatment and from 10 ng/mL to 19 ng/mL in males (n=61). No clinical consequences due to elevated prolactin levels were reported.To minimize exposure to a breastfed infant  lactating women may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk for 48 hours after receiving a dose of BARHEMSYS.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric UseNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients  and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients  but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.Renal ImpairmentAvoid BARHEMSYS in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). The pharmacokinetics of amisulpride in patients with severe renal impairment have not been adequately studied in clinical trials. Amisulpride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys  and patients with severe renal impairment may have increased systemic exposure and an increased risk of adverse reactions.No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment(eGFR ‚â• 30 mL/min/1.73 m2).Drug InteractionsBARHEMSYS causes dose- and concentration-dependent QT prolongation. To avoid potential additive effects  avoid use of BARHEMSYS in patients taking droperidol.ECG monitoring is recommended in patients taking other drugs known to prolong the QT interval (e.g.  ondansetron).Reciprocal antagonism of effects occurs between dopamine agonists (e.g.  levodopa) and BARHEMSYS. Avoid using levodopa with BARHEMSYS.Important Safety Information for BYFAVO‚Ñ¢ (remimazolam) InjectionIndicationsBYFAVO is a benzodiazepine indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less.Important Safety InformationWARNING: PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT FOR MONITORING AND RESUSCITATION AND RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOID ANALGESICSPersonnel and Equipment for Monitoring and ResuscitationOnly personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation  and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure  should administer BYFAVO.Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction  hypoventilation  and apnea  including the maintenance of a patent airway  supportive ventilation  and cardiovascular resuscitation.BYFAVO has been associated with hypoxia  bradycardia  and hypotension. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and during the recovery period.Resuscitative drugs  and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag-valve-mask‚Äìassisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO.Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioid Analgesics and Other Sedative-HypnoticsConcomitant use of benzodiazepines  including BYFAVO  and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation  respiratory depression  coma  and death. The sedative effect of intravenous BYFAVO can be accentuated by concomitantly administered CNS depressant medications  including other benzodiazepines and propofol. Continuously monitor patients for respiratory depression and depth of sedation.ContraindicationBYFAVO is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to dextran 40 or products containing dextran 40.Personnel and Equipment for Monitoring and ResuscitationClinically notable hypoxia  bradycardia  and hypotension were observed in Phase 3 studies of BYFAVO. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and through the recovery period. Only personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation  and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure  should administer BYFAVO. Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction  hypoventilation  and apnea  including the maintenance of a patent airway  supportive ventilation  and cardiovascular resuscitation. Resuscitative drugs  and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag-valve-mask‚Äìassisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO. Consider the potential for worsened cardiorespiratory depression prior to using BYFAVO concomitantly with other drugs that have the same potential (e.g.  opioid analgesics or other sedative-hypnotics). Administer supplemental oxygen to sedated patients through the recovery period. A benzodiazepine reversal agent (flumazenil) should be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO.Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioid Analgesics and Other Sedative-HypnoticsConcomitant use of BYFAVO and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation  respiratory depression  coma  and death. The sedative effect of IV BYFAVO can be accentuated when administered with other CNS depressant medications (eg  other benzodiazepines and propofol). Titrate the dose of BYFAVO when administered with opioid analgesics and sedative-hypnotics to the desired clinical response. Continuously monitor sedated patients for hypotension  airway obstruction  hypoventilation  apnea  and oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects may be more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea  the elderly  and ASA-PS class III or IV patients.Hypersensitivity ReactionsBYFAVO contains dextran 40  which can cause hypersensitivity reactions  including rash  urticaria  pruritus  and anaphylaxis. BYFAVO is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to dextran 40 or products containing dextran 40.Neonatal SedationUse of benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression  lethargy  hypotonia) in the neonate. Observe newborns for signs of sedation and manage accordingly.Pediatric NeurotoxicityPublished animal studies demonstrate that anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of this is not clear. However  the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery  other procedures  or tests that cannot be delayed  and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions reported in >10% of patients (N=630) receiving BYFAVO 5-30 mg (total dose) and undergoing colonoscopy (two studies) or bronchoscopy (one study) were: hypotension  hypertension  diastolic hypertension  systolic hypertension  hypoxia  and diastolic hypotension.Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancyThere are no data on the specific effects of BYFAVO on pregnancy. Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to benzodiazepines during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression.LactationMonitor infants exposed to BYFAVO through breast milk for sedation  respiratory depression  and feeding problems. A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 5 hours after BYFAVO administration.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. BYFAVO should not be used in patients less than 18 years of age.Geriatric UseNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. However  there is a potential for greater sensitivity (eg  faster onset  oversedation  confusion) in some older individuals. Administer supplemental doses of BYFAVO slowly to achieve the level of sedation required and monitor all patients closely for cardiorespiratory complications.Hepatic ImpairmentIn patients with severe hepatic impairment  the dose of BYFAVO should be carefully titrated to effect. Depending on the overall status of the patient  lower frequency of supplemental doses may be needed to achieve the level of sedation required for the procedure. All patients should be monitored for sedation-related cardiorespiratory complications.Abuse and DependenceBYFAVO is a federally controlled substance (CIV) because it contains remimazolam which has the potential for abuse and physical dependence.1Assumes a number of doses per patient at a WAC price of $85 per 10mg dose for the prophylaxis and rescue addressable market.

Morgan Offer Direct Access to Danish Market,1 day ago,From The Markets Euronext & J.P. Morgan Offer Direct Access to Danish MarketEuronext Securities Copenhagen announced that J.P. Morgan has signed an agreement to become a direct participant in the Danish market.The agreement reflects a growing trend of shortening the value chain between issuers and investors. Across Europe  it is becoming more relevant for international players in the custody business to directly access local markets through direct connectivity with local CSDs. There are obvious advantages of this for both custodians and the clients they serve  ranging from reduced costs  a shortened custody chain  enhanced transparency and operational efficiencies. Euronext Securities is responding to this trend by converging the infrastructure and expanding services.Anthony Attia  Global Head of Primary Markets and Post Trade at Euronext  commented: ‚ÄúWe have had a close relationship with J.P. Morgan for a number of years  and we are proud to bring this collaboration to the next level and support them in their role as an Account Controller on the Danish market. Shortening of the custody value chain is a key assumption of Euronext‚Äôs ‚ÄúGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äù strategic plan. Today‚Äôs announcement shows this assumption is right. Structural changes like this one do not only produce tangible benefits for international clients  they fundamentally better connect European economies to global capital markets. Concretely international investors now have a more direct and efficient access to 1.5 trillion euros of assets issued in the Danish capital market.The most efficient way of servicing a growing marketFor J.P. Morgan  direct interface to the Danish market through local CSD connectivity will help drive its significant asset servicing presence in the Danish and Nordic markets.Hannah Elson  Head of Global Custody at J.P. Morgan commented: ‚ÄòWe are excited to partner with Euronext Securities in providing direct market access in Denmark to our global clients. A shorter custody chain brings significant efficiencies and enhances the overall client experience. This move further strengthens our franchise and growth plans across the Nordic Region and demonstrates our commitment to delivering efficient market access to global investors‚Äô.‚ÄùSource: Euronext,neutral,0.01,0.96,0.02,positive,0.7,0.27,0.03,True,English,"['J.P.

However  the preliminary  unofficial volume indications received from the EC would not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of Valneva‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine program. This would also impede the future development of the program beyond the current product profile.If such indications are confirmed  Valneva will not be able to enter into an amendment to the APA that could allow for a reduced order  and the EC is thus likely to terminate the agreement. As a result  Europeans would not have access to Valneva‚Äôs inactivated vaccine VLA2001.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  ‚ÄúWe hope that the EC and its member states will continue to evaluate the potential advantages of an inactivated vaccine. There is emerging evidence that hybrid immunity ‚Äì from a combination of vaccination and natural infection ‚Äì increases protection against development of severe COVID-19 caused by different variants of concern  and our inactivated vaccine closely mimics natural infection by exposing vaccinees to the entire inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus. Additionally  market research studies in six European countries indicated material interest in an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine for primary or booster vaccination. We continue to receive messages from people looking for a more traditional vaccine technology and we hope to receive a meaningful order size to further support public health in Europe‚Äù.Story continuesIn parallel  the regulatory process with the European Medicine Agency (EMA) continues as planned. EMA accepted the filing of Marketing Authorization Application on May 19  20222 and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is expected to take a final vote during the week of June 21  2022. Valneva also continues to work with agencies outside of the European Union for potential future approvals and additional purchase agreements.About VLA2001VLA2001 is currently the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted vaccine candidate in clinical trials against COVID-19 in Europe. It is intended for active immunization of at-risk populations to prevent carriage and symptomatic infection with COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic and potentially later for routine vaccination including addressing new variants. VLA2001 may also be suited for boosting  as repeat booster vaccinations have been shown to work well with whole virus inactivated vaccines. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva‚Äôs established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva‚Äôs licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO¬Æ. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B¬Æ vaccine. VLA2001‚Äôs manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLa√´titia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to possible purchase agreements and regulatory approval of VLA2001.

6307,EuroNext,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veon-ceo-key-developments-investors-152900695.html,From VEON CEO: Key Developments Update for Investors and Partners,Today the Chief Executive Officer of VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON) (Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides mobile connectivity and services  updated the Company's stakeholders on key financial and business developments.,"AMSTERDAM  June 10  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today the Chief Executive Officer of VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON) (Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides mobile connectivity and services  updated the Company's stakeholders on key financial and business developments.In his letter  VEON's CEO Kaan Terzioƒülu wrote:Dear VEON stakeholder I am pleased to update you on our latest achievements in key areas of interest for VEON Group. Since my last letter we have closed several important transactions and we are driving several others towards completion  while the operating performance of our companies remains healthy.As a global operator providing digital services to almost 220 million people across eight countries  VEON (NASDAQ: VEON) (Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) continues to attract international investors such as EXOR Capital (UK)  Shah Capital (US)  Kopernik Global Investors (US) and PIMCO (US)  who recently increased their holdings of our shares  according to the latest public filings. I would like to express my appreciation for your continued trust in VEON.Liquidity  capital structure and M&AThis week we announced the successful closing of the sale of our Georgian operations to our former local partner  delivering proceeds of USD 45 million  equivalent to 3.5 times 2021 EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16). This is another step in strengthening our focus on high-growth markets with a critical mass of users  streamlining our Group operations to create long-term value for customers  partners and shareholders. Beeline Georgia is a leader in terms of 4G penetration and digital services  thanks to its successful execution of VEON's digital operator strategy. The local management team and the new Georgian shareholder are committed to the successful development of the company and to supporting the digital transformation of the country.Another important focus area for VEON recently has been liquidity management and we have increased our Group's total cash and deposits to approximately USD 2.4 billion  including USD 1.8 billion equivalent of USD- and EUR-denominated cash and deposits held by the headquarters in Amsterdam. This was achieved after we further enhanced VEON Group's cash position by increasing our current revolving credit facility utilization to USD 973 million  as announced on 25 May 2022. As stated previously  we do not have any material debt maturing in 2022.Story continuesIn addition to HQ-level liquidity  the self-sufficient nature of our operating companies in terms of financing was again highlighted recently. Jazz in Pakistan and Banglalink in Bangladesh have successfully raised local long-term funding to cover their spectrum requirements  with 10-year PKR 40 billion (c. USD 222 million) and 5-year BDT 12 billion (c. USD 135 million) loans  respectively. We have also made material progress in the simplification of our capital structure. As communicated on 21 April 2022  a total of RUB 90 billion in loans were novated to PJSC VimpelCom  with the former borrower (VEON Finance Ireland) and the former guarantor (VEON Holdings BV) having been released. This transaction aligned ruble liabilities with ruble revenues and reduced HQ external debt. We are also working on rationalizing VEON Group's ownership structure of Beeline Kazakhstan.The next important step in portfolio management is now the pending completion of the put option for Djezzy in Algeria for USD 682 million  as disclosed in our 1Q22 trading update on 28 April 2022. This will both better streamline our operations and further improve our cash position.Supporting connectivity across our marketsToday the humanitarian need for connectivity is as important as other basic needs such as food  water  shelter and health care. In fact  connectivity is often a crucial lifeline for each one of us  as we rely on telecommunications networks to secure basic needs  stay connected with loved ones  access reliable information and use key digital services.In Ukraine  the Kyivstar team continues to make an extraordinary effort to keep the networks running despite the damage to towers and power supplies. Since the beginning of the conflict  more than 3 400 repairs of base stations have been performed  and some 26 500 meters of broken fiber-optics have been replaced. More than 90% of Kyivstar's network is still operational. We have added 100 new base stations across the Western part of the country and upgraded hundreds more with the latest technologies to enable uninterrupted communications.Growth across our footprint driven by the digital operator modelThe latest available data shows that our double and multiplay 4G subscribers reached 35% of the Group's monthly active customer base. This supported continued high single-digit local currency year-on-year growth in the Group's service revenues  both in April and May.In Pakistan  Jazz continues to perform strongly  enabled by growth in 4G customer base. As of May  it serves 50% of its customer base with 4G connectivity. With its 4G offering  Jazz continues to lead the market in terms of both revenue and customer base growth.In Bangladesh  our planned additional network coverage is expanding fast. The positive impact of this was already evident in Q1 as Banglalink recorded 8.6% year-on-year revenue growth. This performance has further accelerated: Banglalink's topline grew at a double-digit year-on-year pace in both April and May  driven by the 45% increase in its double and multiplay 4G customers.Beeline Kazakhstan is heading toward its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit topline growth  powered by the highest customer base 4G penetration among our larger operations. Over 66% of Beeline Kazakhstan's customers are now 4G users  bringing it closer to the 70% 4G penetration ambition that we set out at our Investor Day in December 2021. I had the opportunity this week to personally reiterate our commitment to support the Government's priorities for mobile communications  internet coverage and digital transformation  along with its long-term ambition of achieving net zero CO 2 emissions  at a plenary session of the Foreign Investors' Council in Kazakhstan  attended by key members of the Government and chaired by the country's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.I spent a couple of days with the Group management team in Uzbekistan at the beginning of May  witnessing first-hand the Beeline team's excellent work in building a success story. Beeline's robust double-digit performance continued during April and May  driven by increasing customer satisfaction  which we see in NPS and market share performance  and an impressive  sustained 4G growth. Beeline has also recently launched new bundles  to which nearly 1.2 million customers signed up in the first few months  including more than half a million customers with digital-enabled offers.In Algeria  as we near completion of the sale of Djezzy  we have been building on five consecutive quarters of growth  welcoming the recent addition of 2300 MHz band spectrum and committing around USD 20 million in additional capex to rapidly deliver increased 4G performance in densely populated urban areas.2022 AGM to convene on 29 JuneAs announced on 25 May 2022  the VEON Board of Directors has set the Company's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders for 29 June 2022. The Board has recommended 11 Directors. Eight of the nominees ‚Äì Hans-Holger Albrecht  Yaroslav Glazunov  Andrei Gusev  Gunnar Holt  Karen Linehan  Irene Shvakman  Vasily Sidorov and Michiel Soeting ‚Äì currently sit on the Board  while the remaining three ‚Äì Augie Fabela  Stan Miller and Morten Lundal ‚Äì are new candidates.We invite all our shareholders to participate in the forthcoming AGM  which will be held in virtual form. I speak for all of the management team when I say that I look forward to working with the incoming Board  benefiting from their wealth of operational  financial and governance experience.We welcome your questionsShould you have any questions on the topics covered in this letter  or other matters related to VEON Group  please do contact our IR team via ir@veon.com.
