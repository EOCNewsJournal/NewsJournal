The technology can be adapted for all vehicles equipped with a special “receiver” that transfers the energy incoming from the road infrastructure directly to the electric motor  extending the range  while conserving the vehicle battery charge.The pilot project of Stellantis and all partners involved is coordinated by A35 Brebemi  a company owned by the global transportation infrastructure operator Aleatica that focuses on sustainable and innovative mobility solutions.“Our long-term strategic plan  Dare Forward 2030  is based on the premise of bringing ‘cutting-edge freedom of mobility’ to all and this project is the very essence of where we’re headed as a company ” said Anne-Lise Richard  Head of Global e-Mobility Business Unit  Stellantis. “Working with this incredible group of partners  we have proven that inductive recharging technology can power our electrified future. These joint projects are exciting steps as we work to achieve longer battery lifespan  lower range anxiety  greater energy efficiency  smaller battery size  outstanding performance and lower weight and cost.”Story continuesWork at “Arena del Futuro” shows that a BEV  like the F iat New 500 outfitted to test the system  can travel at typical highway speeds without consuming the energy stored in its battery. Tests are showing that the efficiency of the energy flow from the asphalt to the car is comparable to the typical efficiency of fast charging stations  so the driver does not need to stop to recharge. Furthermore  measurements on magnetic field intensity prove that there is no impact on the driver and passengers.At the event in Chiari  a Maserati Grecale Folgore was displayed to announce Maserati’s upcoming involvement in the project. Folgore identifies the full electric version of Maserati  which will electrify its entire product range by 2025. The Grecale Folgore will be outfitted and run on the ""Arena del Futuro” circuit to collect data and deploy a detailed performance analysis.“Arena del Futuro” is powered by direct current (DC)  which offers several concrete and unique advantages  including:Reducing the power losses in the energy distribution process;Guaranteeing a direct integration with renewable energy sources without the need to convert DC into AC;Allowing the use of thinner cables than the AC current distribution with evident advantages in terms of packaging  weight and harmonic pollution; and Using aluminum cables for current distribution  which is easier to source  costs half compared to copper  and is lighter and easier to recycle in a circular economy business model.DWPT is one of the technologies intended to simplify the customer approach to electric mobility and ultimately to respond in a tangible way to the requirements for decarbonization and environmental sustainability in the mobility sector. Time magazine cited in-road inductive charging system behind “Arena del Futuro” as one of the 100 most important inventions of 2021.These goals are achievable thanks to the innovative technologies offered by 5G  IoT (Internet of Things) and AI-based application solutions  which facilitate the exchange of information between the vehicle and the system management platform  increasing road safety and travel efficiency. Inductive energy transfer of DWPT means there are no exposed cables  keeping the road surface safe for people to walk on.The technology attracts interest for commercial development globally due to its versatility in its dynamic and static inductive versions. In addition to being useful on roads and motorways  it is also suitable when combined with other infrastructures like harbors  airports  and parking lots.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

As communicated on 21 April 2022  a total of RUB 90 billion in loans were novated to PJSC VimpelCom  with the former borrower (VEON Finance Ireland) and the former guarantor (VEON Holdings BV) having been released. This transaction aligned ruble liabilities with ruble revenues and reduced HQ external debt. We are also working on rationalizing VEON Group's ownership structure of Beeline Kazakhstan.The next important step in portfolio management is now the pending completion of the put option for Djezzy in Algeria for USD 682 million  as disclosed in our 1Q22 trading update on 28 April 2022. This will both better streamline our operations and further improve our cash position.Supporting connectivity across our marketsToday the humanitarian need for connectivity is as important as other basic needs such as food  water  shelter and health care. In fact  connectivity is often a crucial lifeline for each one of us  as we rely on telecommunications networks to secure basic needs  stay connected with loved ones  access reliable information and use key digital services.In Ukraine  the Kyivstar team continues to make an extraordinary effort to keep the networks running despite the damage to towers and power supplies. Since the beginning of the conflict  more than 3 400 repairs of base stations have been performed  and some 26 500 meters of broken fiber-optics have been replaced. More than 90% of Kyivstar's network is still operational. We have added 100 new base stations across the Western part of the country and upgraded hundreds more with the latest technologies to enable uninterrupted communications.Growth across our footprint driven by the digital operator modelThe latest available data shows that our double and multiplay 4G subscribers reached 35% of the Group's monthly active customer base. This supported continued high single-digit local currency year-on-year growth in the Group's service revenues  both in April and May.In Pakistan  Jazz continues to perform strongly  enabled by growth in 4G customer base. As of May  it serves 50% of its customer base with 4G connectivity. With its 4G offering  Jazz continues to lead the market in terms of both revenue and customer base growth.In Bangladesh  our planned additional network coverage is expanding fast. The positive impact of this was already evident in Q1 as Banglalink recorded 8.6% year-on-year revenue growth. This performance has further accelerated: Banglalink's topline grew at a double-digit year-on-year pace in both April and May  driven by the 45% increase in its double and multiplay 4G customers.Beeline Kazakhstan is heading toward its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit topline growth  powered by the highest customer base 4G penetration among our larger operations. Over 66% of Beeline Kazakhstan's customers are now 4G users  bringing it closer to the 70% 4G penetration ambition that we set out at our Investor Day in December 2021. I had the opportunity this week to personally reiterate our commitment to support the Government's priorities for mobile communications  internet coverage and digital transformation  along with its long-term ambition of achieving net zero CO 2 emissions  at a plenary session of the Foreign Investors' Council in Kazakhstan  attended by key members of the Government and chaired by the country's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.I spent a couple of days with the Group management team in Uzbekistan at the beginning of May  witnessing first-hand the Beeline team's excellent work in building a success story. Beeline's robust double-digit performance continued during April and May  driven by increasing customer satisfaction  which we see in NPS and market share performance  and an impressive  sustained 4G growth. Beeline has also recently launched new bundles  to which nearly 1.2 million customers signed up in the first few months  including more than half a million customers with digital-enabled offers.In Algeria  as we near completion of the sale of Djezzy  we have been building on five consecutive quarters of growth  welcoming the recent addition of 2300 MHz band spectrum and committing around USD 20 million in additional capex to rapidly deliver increased 4G performance in densely populated urban areas.2022 AGM to convene on 29 JuneAs announced on 25 May 2022  the VEON Board of Directors has set the Company's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders for 29 June 2022.

Here’s the way to bump up your profits,Matt Roberts buys three shares in the iShares Core S&P 500 exchange traded fund (ETF) and two shares in the Vanguard FTSE All-World Index ETF for h,Every month Matt Roberts buys three shares in the iShares Core S&P 500 exchange traded fund (ETF) and two shares in the Vanguard FTSE All-World Index ETF for his stocks and shares Isa.This gives him “instant diversification” for his portfolio — his number one objective. Exchange traded funds are listed on the stock exchange as companies in their own right and use a computer algorithm to replicate the return of a popular stock index such as the S&P 500 and FTSE 100.Once he has done that  Roberts  32  who works as a medical research scientist  looks through his Excel spreadsheet to find out which companies have paid him the highest dividends relative to the amount he has invested and buys more of their shares. These tend to be in businesses such as the oil giants BP and Shell and consumer goods brand owners Unilever and Procter & Gamble.The second objective of the Isa  which he holds with the platform Freetrade  is to provide him with a second revenue stream. The plan for this is to supplement his salary and  ultimately  to boost his retirement income.He also hopes that these dividend-paying firms will help him beat the pitiful 0.1 per cent interest that his £15 000 worth of savings were generating in his current account three years ago.AdvertisementRoberts  originally from Manchester but living in Loughborough  is thankful that  unlike his friends  he resisted the temptation of the meme-stock phenomenon where an army of individual traders worked together to suddenly push up the price of businesses such as the gaming retailer GameStop and the cinema chain AMC. Roberts’s portfolio  now worth about £24 000  remains in the green. His friends  on the other hand  have now lost money.We have become accustomed to seeing companies that pay dividends perform poorly relative to the wider stock market. That’s because ever since the global financial crisis the stock market has been driven by large technology companies that pay no  or very low  dividends.During the 2010s the MSCI World  an index of the largest 1 539 businesses in developed countries  delivered total returns of 164.7 per cent  according to the data provider FE fundinfo. That compares with 143.9 per cent from the MSCI World High Dividend Yield index  which is made up of 327 firms that pay higher-than-average dividend yields.Historically  though  dividends drive returns for investors. The high dividend index beat the MSCI World’s return in each of the three preceding decades. Since November 1975 the MSCI World High Dividend Yield index is up 17 401 per cent  versus a gain of 11 484 per cent for the MSCI World. On a £1 000 lump sum investment that’s a difference of £59 169.SponsoredThe reason for this is what Albert Einstein once reportedly called the eighth wonder of the world: compound interest. Reinvesting the dividends that you receive compounds over the years to ramp up your returns.If you had a £100 investment in a hypothetical company with a 5 per cent dividend yield and a share price that doesn’t go up or down  and you did not reinvest your dividends  you would have your £100 investment and £50 cash after five years and your £100 investment and £200 cash after 40 years. If you did reinvest those dividends you would have shares worth £162.89 after five years and £704 after 40.As interest rates rise  investors are beginning to prefer the certainty of dividends today  rather than potential profit further down the line.Funds investing in companies globally with the aim of generating dividend income had net inflows of £1.3 billion between February and April 2022  according to the Investment Association. Funds investing in companies globally without an income requirement had net outflows of £328 million.AdvertisementKyle Caldwell from the investment platform Interactive Investor said: “As market volatility increases  so typically does interest in dividend investments. Income investments offer steady cash-flow and also allow investors to participate in any gains in value the investment may enjoy.”Global dividends are expected to be more than $1.5 trillion in 2022 for the first time  according to Janus Henderson Investors  a rise of 4.76 per cent from 2021’s total. For those looking to invest in dividend-paying stocks  the UK market is fertile hunting ground. The Vanguard FTSE 100 ETF offers a dividend yield of 3.35 per cent  versus 1.25 per cent for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.The performance of the FTSE 100 index of leading UK firms has been a perennial disappointment: it is up just 8.7 per cent since 2000. However  if you had reinvested dividends received from those firms you would have made a return of 142 per cent.Banks  which tend to become more profitable when interest rates are rising because their net interest margin (the interest they receive on their investments minus the interest they pay their customers) rises  are also worth a look.Andrew Koch from Legal & General Investment Management likes NatWest  which yields 4.5 per cent. Koch thinks the firm can increase its dividend because of these expected higher profits.Oil producers and defence companies have performed well so far this year  but David Cumming from BNY Mellon Investment Management thinks that Shell and BAE Systems remain cheap  despite being up 40 per cent so far this year.The war in Ukraine will boost profits  Cumming said. Oil prices will remain high (and could even rise further) for as long as the war continues  while countries are increasing their defence spending because of the conflict.AdvertisementCumming also highlighted the engineering firm Smiths Group  which has exposure to both industries through John Crane  which provides equipment to oil and gas firms  and Smiths Detection  which makes defence systems for governments.The share prices of housebuilders have fallen this year because they may have to foot the bill for the cladding scandal after the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017. But Cumming thinks this has now been priced in and that Bellway and Taylor Wimpey shares are cheap.Dunelm  the home furnishings seller  will probably have a slowdown in sales as the consumer gets squeezed by the rising cost of living  but James de Uphaugh  manager of the Edinburgh Investment Trust  said that it was a conservative  family-run firm that had the potential for a special dividend to supplement its 4 per cent yield.Shares in Inditex  the Spanish owner of the Zara and Massimo Dutti fashion brands  are back to the same level they were at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. That was a time when all of the firm’s shops were closed and it had a poor internet shopping offering  said Nick Clay from the fund house Redwheel. Now the firm has an excellent online presence and sales are near pre-pandemic levels.Newmont is a goldminer and its shares are up 11 per cent so far this year. De Uphaugh thinks that shareholders in the firm could be rewarded with a special dividend.Some companies have consistently figured in the list of the world’s ten largest dividend payers every year since 2015  so could be worth looking at. These include Microsoft  Apple  AT&T and Exxon Mobil.Fund managers that look for companies they believe are high quality and can generate good returns on capital could be interesting in a time of high inflation because it is hoped that their underlying holdings can increase their prices without sales falling.AdvertisementCaspar Rock from the wealth manager Cazenove Capital likes Fidelity Global Dividend fund  which yields 2.5 per cent and holds the German stock exchange firm Deutsche Boerse  the consumer goods firm Unilever and the Swiss drugmaker Roche.Jason Hollands from the platform Bestinvest suggested the TB Evenlode Global Income fund  which yields 2.4 per cent and holds shares in the information provider Wolters Kluwer  the medical device firm Medtronic and the software provider Microsoft.Alan Brierley from the research company Investec thinks that Finsbury Growth & Income Investment Trust  which yields 2.2 per cent and is run by Nick Train  could be worth buying. Shares are down 12 per cent over the past 12 months and  at 792p  are much lower than the value of its underlying holdings at 841p.For funds investing in cheap UK stocks  Brierley likes Edinburgh Investment Trust and Temple Bar Investment Trust  while Shavar Halberstadt from Winterflood suggested Merchants Trust.Investment trusts  which are similar to funds but are traded on the London Stock Exchange as companies in their own right  can be a good place to look for income. Stifel  the research firm  highlights 24 trusts that invest in stocks and shares that yield more than 4 per cent.Some have been popular with retail investors  according to Interactive Investor. These include City of London  BlackRock World Mining  Henderson Far East Income and Murray International.Elsewhere  the iShares UK Dividend ETF  which yields 5.3 per cent and holds the cigarette makers British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands as well as the insurer Legal & General  has been popular with investors on Freetrade.What to be wary of?It might be tempting to look for the highest yield  but the yield is simply a mathematical equation (dividend per share minus share price divided by 100). The yield rises if the dividend per share goes up but also when the share price goes down. The miner Ferrexpo yields 17.5 per cent but that is because shares have fallen 60 per cent over the past 12 months. “Don’t be surprised if Ferrexpo chops the dividend eventually ” Dan Lane from Freetrade warned.Dividend cover is a key metric used to figure out whether a company can continue to pay its current level of dividend. Work it out by dividing the earnings per share figure found on its balance sheet by its dividend per share.Be wary of a dividend cover of one or lower because “the company is using most if not all of its profits to fund the dividend ” said Caldwell. Ideally  you want a ratio of 2 or above.Look for companies with a strong balance sheet. These are more likely to be able to afford to pay dividends. Return on capital employed (ROCE) is possibly the best measure of this and can be worked out by dividing the company’s profits by the assets of the business. “There’s no golden rule that dictates what a good or bad figure is.
