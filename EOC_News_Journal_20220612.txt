Its devices are digitally connected to individuals‚Äô smartphones and are used for the disposal of injector pens and syringes and tracking of individual patients‚Äô adherence to medication regimes. The system will also remind people to stick with their course of medicine if necessary.The company floated on Euronext Dublin last December after raising ‚Ç¨25 million in an initial public offering (IPO) aimed at increasing its number of devices in North America and Europe to 100 000 by the end of next year from almost 10 200 last year. The plan also envisaged tripling HealthBeacon‚Äôs workforce to 150 - it currently has 70 employees.However  shares in HealthBeacon have fallen by as much as a third from their ‚Ç¨5.85 IPO price  as technology-related stocks have borne the brunt of a global equities sell-off in 2022. Still  the stock has rallied off its lows in recent days.Mr Joyce described the timing of the HealthBeacon deal late last year  making it only one of two Irish companies to float in 2022  as a ‚Äúgood decision‚Äù.‚ÄúAn earlier stage company [like HealthBeacon] wouldn‚Äôt otherwise have been able to pull an IPO off  and we would have had to look to the private markets for money and stay private for longer ‚Äù he said.,neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.3,0.13,0.57,True,English,"['dual Nasdaq listing', 'HealthBeacon', 'future', 'Dublin-based medical technology company', 'US technology-focused stock exchange', 'The Irish Times', 'digital sharps bin', 'initial public offering', 'global equities sell', 'two Irish companies', 'individual patients‚Äô adherence', 'earlier stage company', 'Nasdaq exchange', 'dual listing', 'New York', 'trading activity', 'chief executive', 'Jim Joyce', 'good advice', 'market sources', 'market valuation', 'current size', 'regulatory burden', 'medication schedule', 'injector pens', 'medication regimes', 'Euronext Dublin', 'North America', 'next year', 'technology-related stocks', 'recent days', 'Mr Joyce', 'good decision', 'private markets', 'second quotation', '‚Ç¨5.85 IPO price', 'HealthBeacon deal', 'future', 'liquidity', 'founder', 'interview', 'prospects', 'multiple', 'costs', 'medicines', 'home', 'devices', 'smartphones', 'disposal', 'syringes', 'tracking', 'system', 'people', 'course', 'number', 'Europe', 'end', 'plan', 'workforce', '70 employees', 'shares', 'brunt', 'lows', 'timing', 'money', 'longer']",2022-06-12,2022-06-12,irishtimes.com
