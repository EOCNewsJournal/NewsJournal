The resolutions under 6A-6B below are conditional on each other and all decisions are therefore proposed to be adopted in one context.6A. Introduction of the Share Option Programme 2022Background and rationaleThe Company's Board believes that incentive programmes contribute to higher motivation and commitment among the employees and strengthen the bonds between the employees and the Company. The Smart Eye group has a global presence and an increased exposure to international labour markets  especially the US  which makes it essential for the Company to be able to offer remuneration to current and future employees in line with the market. For the purpose of enabling the Company to attract necessary competence and to engage the current employees in the Company's present and future development the Board further considers competitive compensations to be necessary. In view of these considerations  it is the Board's opinion that the Share Option Programme 2022  combined with other remuneration  will benefit both the employees and the Company's shareholders through long-term increased share value.Summary of the programmeThe Share Option Programme 2022 is proposed to comprise of the CEO  senior executives  key individuals and other employees  meaning that not more than approximately 188 employees within the Smart Eye group will be able to participate. Under the Share Option Programme 2022  participants are given the opportunity to receive shares free of charge  so called ""Performance Shares""  in accordance with the terms and conditions described below.Within the scope of the Share Option Programme 2022 the Company can grant participants rights to Performance Shares  entailing the right to  provided that certain criteria are fulfilled  receive Performance Shares free of charge (""Rights"").Terms and conditionsThe maximum number of Performance Shares will amount to 440 000  whereby 378 500 shares shall be allotted to participants and 61 500 shares shall be used by the Company to cover social security contributions associated with the programme. Vesting of Rights occurs during the period from 15 July 2022 up to and including 15 July 2025 (""Vesting Period""). Vesting of Rights will be made proportionately with one third (1/3) per year and requires that the participants' employment remains as of 15 July 2023  15 July 2024 and 15 July 2025  respectively. To be granted the maximum amount of Rights  the participant must have been employed throughout the whole Vesting Period. The Rights may not be transferred or pledged. Every Right entitles the participant to receive one Preference Share free of charge at the end of the Vesting Period (with some exceptions whereas the Vesting Period can be brought forward). If the participants' employment is terminated before a Vesting Period the participant shall retain already vested Rights  however  the Rights shall not entitle to Performance Shares prior to the end of the Vesting Period. Allotment of Performance Shares free of charge is  except for the above stated  conditional on the achievement of the performance target established by the Board of Directors. The performance target entails that the price of the Smart Eye share at the time of allotment of Performance Shares shall amount to at least 130 per cent of the average volume‚Äëweighted price for the Smart Eye share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market during five (5) subsequent banking days in relation to the date of the resolution of the extraordinary general meeting (""Performance Criteria""). In the event that the Performance Criteria is not achieved or exceeded  no allotment of Performance Shares will occur. The Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the Board  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the Share Option Programme 2022  in accordance with the presented terms and guidelines including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in‚Äëbetween bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the Smart Eye group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the Share Option Programme 2022 no longer fulfils their objectives. The Company shall  within three (3) months from the end of the Vesting Period  ensure that Performance Shares corresponding to the number of vested Rights are delivered to participants. The Board of Directors shall  in connection therewith  be entitled to postpone the date of delivery of Performance Shares if the participant is not allowed to acquire shares during the period.Allocation of RightsThe Share Option Programme 2022 shall comprise of not more than approximately 188 employees within the Smart Eye group. The maximum number of Rights that can be allotted free of charge per participant and category follows from the table below.Category Maximum number of Rights per person Maximum number of Rights per category CEO - category 1 15 000 15 000 Senior executives- category 2 10 000 105 000 Key individuals - category 3 5 000 200 000 Others - category 4 750 58 500Remaining Rights in a category can be used in an alternative category.Costs for the programmeThe Share Option Programme 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with K3 which means that the Rights shall be expensed as a non-cash personnel cost during the Vesting Period. The costs for the Share Option Programme 2022 are presumed to amount to approximately MSEK 14.4  excluding social security contributions  calculated in accordance with K3 on the basis of the following assumptions: (i) that 378 500 Rights are delivered to participants  (ii) that the shares average volume-weighted closing price at the beginning of the Share Option Programme 2022 amounts to SEK 70 per share  (iii) that the Performance Criteria is fully achieved  and (iv) an estimated annual employee turnover of 5 percent. Based on the same assumptions as above  and subject to social security contributions of approximately 30 per cent and a share price increase of 50 per cent from the beginning of the Share Option Programme 2022 until participants are allotted Performance Shares  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 6.6. In accordance with K3 the total costs for the Share Option Programme 2022  excluding social security contributions which will be covered through hedging measures in the form of warrants  are estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 4.8 per year during the Vesting Period  based on the same assumption as above mentioned. Since the costs of social security contributions will be secured through hedging measures in the form of issuance of warrants it is assessed that the Share Option Programme 2022 will have no impact on the Company's cash flow.Effects on key ratios and dilutionUpon maximum allotment of Performance Shares and provided that hedging measures under item 6(b) below are adopted  meaning that not more than 378 500 shares will be delivered to participants in accordance with the Share Option Programme 2022  and that 61 500 shares will be used to cover any social security contributions resulting from the Share Option Programme 2022  the additional dilution effect will amount to approximately 2 per cent of the total number of shares in the Company per the day of the convening notice. If all outstanding incentive programmes are included in the calculation the total dilution effect amounts to approximately 4 per cent of the total number of shares in the Company per the day of the convening notice.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and under the assumption that the Share Option Programme 2022 had been introduced during 2021 instead  it is estimated that the key ratio operating profit for the full year 2021 would decrease from SEK -130.9 to approximately SEK ‚Äë135.7.Preparation of the proposalThe Share Option Programme 2022 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with external advisers.Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmesInformation regarding the Company's current incentive programmes is available in the Company's Q1 report 2022 under the heading ""Share-based incentive programmes"" and the main terms and conditions of the programmes are available on the Company's website  www.smarteye.se. Apart from the programmes now mentioned  there are no other share-based incentive programmes in Smart Eye.6B. Directed issue and transfer of warrants  Series 2022/2025 in accordance with the Share Option Programme 2022Delivery of Performance Shares and hedging measuresTo be able to implement the Share Option Programme 2022 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes on a directed issue of warrants in accordance with the below and the terms and conditions for the Share Option Programme 2022.Directed issue of warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves to issue not more than 440 000 warrants  as a result of which the Company's share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 44 000. The following conditions shall apply.Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company. The right to subscribe for warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption right  vest with the wholly-owned subsidiary JN Data i G√∂teborg AB with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants in accordance with the Company's obligations under the Share Option Programme 2022. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. The subscription for warrants shall be made no later than 15 July 2022 on a special subscription list. The Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the time for subscription. The subscription of shares through warrants shall be made during a period from 15 July 2025 to and including 15 October 2025. The Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the time for subscription. The subscription price for each share at the time of exercise of the warrants shall correspond to the quota value of the share at the time of subscription of the shares. New shares pursuant to subscription entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately after subscription has been effectuated. The warrants shall in all other respects be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in Appendix A.The exercise price upon exercise of warrants and the number of shares to which each warrant provides an entitlement to subscribe may be adjusted in accordance with section 8 of the terms and conditions for warrants  see Appendix A.It is further proposed that the Board of Directors  or whomever they appoint  should be authorised to undertake such minor adjustments in the decision that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make such minor adjustments to the Share Option Programme 2022 as prompted by applicable foreign laws and regulations.Oversubscription cannot take place.The rationale for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights is to implement the Share Option Programme 2022 for employees within the Smart Eye group.The Board of Directors have prepared documents in accordance with Chapter 14  section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).Special authorisationsThe Board of Directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decisions above and to ensure that the Share Option Programme 2022 is introduced in accordance with the above mentioned.The Board further proposes that the extraordinary general meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.MISCELLANEOUSSpecial majority requirementThe Board of Directors' proposal for resolutions in accordance with 6A - 6B above constitute a package  as the various proposals are dependent on and strongly linked to each other. Therefore  it is proposed that the extraordinary general meeting make a single resolution in connection with the abovementioned proposals  in compliance with the majority requirement specified in Chapter 16  Section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that the resolution shall be supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Number of shares and votesThe number of shares and votes in Smart Eye amounts to 22 148 650 per the day for the issuance of this notice.

6349,Euroclear,Google API,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-plc-first-quarter-2022-083600678.html,Shell Plc First Quarter 2022 Euro and GBP Equivalent Dividend Payments,12 hours ago,June 13  2022The Board of Shell plc (‚ÄúShell‚Äù) today announced the pounds sterling and euro equivalent dividend payments in respect of the first quarter 2022 interim dividend  which was announced on May 5  2022 at US$0.25 per ordinary share.Shareholders have been able to elect to receive their dividends in US dollars  euros or pounds sterling. Holders of ordinary shares who have validly submitted US dollars  euros or pounds sterling currency elections by June 7  2022 will be entitled to a dividend of US$0.25  ‚Ç¨0.2346 or 20.01p per ordinary share  respectively.Absent any valid election to the contrary  persons holding their ordinary shares through Euroclear Nederland will receive their dividends in euros at the euro rate per ordinary share shown above. Absent any valid election to the contrary  shareholders (both holding in certificated and uncertificated form (CREST members)) and persons holding their shares through the Shell Corporate Nominee will receive their dividends in pounds sterling  at the pound sterling rate per ordinary share shown above.Euro and pounds sterling dividends payable in cash have been converted from US dollars based on an average of market exchange rates over the three dealing days from June 8 to June 10  2022.This dividend will be payable on June 27  2022 to those members whose names were on the Register of Members on May 20  2022.Taxation - cash dividendWith Shell‚Äôs tax residence moved to the UK  dividends paid to shareholders on their ordinary shares will not attract Dutch dividend withholding tax. This means that holders of the former A shares receive their dividends in full as Dutch dividend withholding tax is no longer withheld on these dividends. Holders of the former B shares receive their dividends directly from Shell as these dividends will no longer be paid through the Dividend Access Mechanism.If you are uncertain as to the tax treatment of any dividends you should consult your tax advisor.Story continuesNoteA different currency election date may apply to shareholders holding shares in a securities account with a bank or financial institution ultimately holding through Euroclear Nederland. This may also apply to other shareholders who do not hold their shares either directly on the Register of Members or in the corporate sponsored nominee arrangement. Shareholders can contact their broker  financial intermediary  bank or financial institution for the election deadline that applies.EnquiriesShell Media RelationsInternational +44 (0) 207 934 5550Americas +1 832 337 4355CAUTIONARY NOTEThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this announcement ‚ÄúShell‚Äù  ‚ÄúShell Group‚Äù and ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words ‚Äúwe‚Äù  ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúour‚Äù are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‚Äò‚ÄòSubsidiaries‚Äô‚Äô  ‚ÄúShell subsidiaries‚Äù and ‚ÄúShell companies‚Äù as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as ‚Äújoint ventures‚Äù and ‚Äújoint operations‚Äù  respectively. ‚ÄúJoint ventures‚Äù and ‚Äújoint operations‚Äù are collectively referred to as ‚Äújoint arrangements‚Äù. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as ‚Äúassociates‚Äù. The term ‚ÄúShell interest‚Äù is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management‚Äôs current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management‚Äôs expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ‚Äúaim‚Äù  ‚Äúambition‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòanticipate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòbelieve‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòcould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòestimate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòexpect‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äògoals‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòintend‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòmay‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòobjectives‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòoutlook‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòplan‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòprobably‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòproject‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòrisks‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúschedule‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòseek‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòshould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòtarget‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòwill‚Äô‚Äô and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell‚Äôs products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  June 13  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell‚Äôs net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

The resolutions under 6A-6B below are conditional on each other and all decisions are therefore proposed to be adopted in one context.6A. Introduction of the Share Option Programme 2022Background and rationaleThe Company‚Äôs Board believes that incentive programmes contribute to higher motivation and commitment among the employees and strengthen the bonds between the employees and the Company. The Smart Eye group has a global presence and an increased exposure to international labour markets  especially the US  which makes it essential for the Company to be able to offer remuneration to current and future employees in line with the market. For the purpose of enabling the Company to attract necessary competence and to engage the current employees in the Company‚Äôs present and future development the Board further considers competitive compensations to be necessary. In view of these considerations  it is the Board‚Äôs opinion that the Share Option Programme 2022  combined with other remuneration  will benefit both the employees and the Company‚Äôs shareholders through long-term increased share value.Summary of the programmeThe Share Option Programme 2022 is proposed to comprise of the CEO  senior executives  key individuals and other employees  meaning that not more than approximately 188 employees within the Smart Eye group will be able to participate. Under the Share Option Programme 2022  participants are given the opportunity to receive shares free of charge  so called ‚ÄúPerformance Shares‚Äú  in accordance with the terms and conditions described below.Within the scope of the Share Option Programme 2022 the Company can grant participants rights to Performance Shares  entailing the right to  provided that certain criteria are fulfilled  receive Performance Shares free of charge (‚ÄúRights‚Äú).Terms and conditionsThe maximum number of Performance Shares will amount to 440 000  whereby 378 500 shares shall be allotted to participants and 61 500 shares shall be used by the Company to cover social security contributions associated with the programme. Vesting of Rights occurs during the period from 15 July 2022 up to and including 15 July 2025 (‚ÄúVesting Period‚Äú). Vesting of Rights will be made proportionately with one third (1/3) per year and requires that the participants‚Äô employment remains as of 15 July 2023  15 July 2024 and 15 July 2025  respectively. To be granted the maximum amount of Rights  the participant must have been employed throughout the whole Vesting Period. The Rights may not be transferred or pledged. Every Right entitles the participant to receive one Preference Share free of charge at the end of the Vesting Period (with some exceptions whereas the Vesting Period can be brought forward). If the participants‚Äô employment is terminated before a Vesting Period the participant shall retain already vested Rights  however  the Rights shall not entitle to Performance Shares prior to the end of the Vesting Period. Allotment of Performance Shares free of charge is  except for the above stated  conditional on the achievement of the performance target established by the Board of Directors. The performance target entails that the price of the Smart Eye share at the time of allotment of Performance Shares shall amount to at least 130 per cent of the average volume‚Äëweighted price for the Smart Eye share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market during five (5) subsequent banking days in relation to the date of the resolution of the extraordinary general meeting (‚ÄúPerformance Criteria‚Äú). In the event that the Performance Criteria is not achieved or exceeded  no allotment of Performance Shares will occur. The Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the Board  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the Share Option Programme 2022  in accordance with the presented terms and guidelines including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in‚Äëbetween bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the Smart Eye group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the Share Option Programme 2022 no longer fulfils their objectives. The Company shall  within three (3) months from the end of the Vesting Period  ensure that Performance Shares corresponding to the number of vested Rights are delivered to participants. The Board of Directors shall  in connection therewith  be entitled to postpone the date of delivery of Performance Shares if the participant is not allowed to acquire shares during the period.Allocation of RightsThe Share Option Programme 2022 shall comprise of not more than approximately 188 employees within the Smart Eye group. The maximum number of Rights that can be allotted free of charge per participant and category follows from the table below.Category Maximum number of Rights per person Maximum number of Rights per category CEO ‚Äì category 1 15 000 15 000 Senior executives- category 2 10 000 105 000 Key individuals ‚Äì category 3 5 000 200 000 Others ‚Äì category 4 750 58 500Remaining Rights in a category can be used in an alternative category.Costs for the programmeThe Share Option Programme 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with K3 which means that the Rights shall be expensed as a non-cash personnel cost during the Vesting Period. The costs for the Share Option Programme 2022 are presumed to amount to approximately MSEK 14.4  excluding social security contributions  calculated in accordance with K3 on the basis of the following assumptions: (i) that 378 500 Rights are delivered to participants  (ii) that the shares average volume-weighted closing price at the beginning of the Share Option Programme 2022 amounts to SEK 70 per share  (iii) that the Performance Criteria is fully achieved  and (iv) an estimated annual employee turnover of 5 percent. Based on the same assumptions as above  and subject to social security contributions of approximately 30 per cent and a share price increase of 50 per cent from the beginning of the Share Option Programme 2022 until participants are allotted Performance Shares  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 6.6. In accordance with K3 the total costs for the Share Option Programme 2022  excluding social security contributions which will be covered through hedging measures in the form of warrants  are estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 4.8 per year during the Vesting Period  based on the same assumption as above mentioned. Since the costs of social security contributions will be secured through hedging measures in the form of issuance of warrants it is assessed that the Share Option Programme 2022 will have no impact on the Company‚Äôs cash flow.Effects on key ratios and dilutionUpon maximum allotment of Performance Shares and provided that hedging measures under item 6(b) below are adopted  meaning that not more than 378 500 shares will be delivered to participants in accordance with the Share Option Programme 2022  and that 61 500 shares will be used to cover any social security contributions resulting from the Share Option Programme 2022  the additional dilution effect will amount to approximately 2 per cent of the total number of shares in the Company per the day of the convening notice. If all outstanding incentive programmes are included in the calculation the total dilution effect amounts to approximately 4 per cent of the total number of shares in the Company per the day of the convening notice.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and under the assumption that the Share Option Programme 2022 had been introduced during 2021 instead  it is estimated that the key ratio operating profit for the full year 2021 would decrease from SEK -130.9 to approximately SEK ‚Äë135.7.Preparation of the proposalThe Share Option Programme 2022 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with external advisers.Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmesInformation regarding the Company‚Äôs current incentive programmes is available in the Company‚Äôs Q1 report 2022 under the heading ‚ÄúShare-based incentive programmes‚Äù and the main terms and conditions of the programmes are available on the Company‚Äôs website  www.smarteye.se. Apart from the programmes now mentioned  there are no other share-based incentive programmes in Smart Eye.6B. Directed issue and transfer of warrants  Series 2022/2025 in accordance with the Share Option Programme 2022Delivery of Performance Shares and hedging measuresTo be able to implement the Share Option Programme 2022 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes on a directed issue of warrants in accordance with the below and the terms and conditions for the Share Option Programme 2022.Directed issue of warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves to issue not more than 440 000 warrants  as a result of which the Company‚Äôs share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 44 000. The following conditions shall apply.Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company. The right to subscribe for warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emption right  vest with the wholly-owned subsidiary JN Data i G√∂teborg AB with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants in accordance with the Company‚Äôs obligations under the Share Option Programme 2022. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. The subscription for warrants shall be made no later than 15 July 2022 on a special subscription list. The Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the time for subscription. The subscription of shares through warrants shall be made during a period from 15 July 2025 to and including 15 October 2025. The Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the time for subscription. The subscription price for each share at the time of exercise of the warrants shall correspond to the quota value of the share at the time of subscription of the shares. New shares pursuant to subscription entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately after subscription has been effectuated. The warrants shall in all other respects be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in Appendix A.The exercise price upon exercise of warrants and the number of shares to which each warrant provides an entitlement to subscribe may be adjusted in accordance with section 8 of the terms and conditions for warrants  see Appendix A.It is further proposed that the Board of Directors  or whomever they appoint  should be authorised to undertake such minor adjustments in the decision that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make such minor adjustments to the Share Option Programme 2022 as prompted by applicable foreign laws and regulations.Oversubscription cannot take place.The rationale for the deviation from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emption rights is to implement the Share Option Programme 2022 for employees within the Smart Eye group.The Board of Directors have prepared documents in accordance with Chapter 14  section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).Special authorisationsThe Board of Directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decisions above and to ensure that the Share Option Programme 2022 is introduced in accordance with the above mentioned.The Board further proposes that the extraordinary general meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.MISCELLANEOUSSpecial majority requirementThe Board of Directors‚Äô proposal for resolutions in accordance with 6A ‚Äì 6B above constitute a package  as the various proposals are dependent on and strongly linked to each other. Therefore  it is proposed that the extraordinary general meeting make a single resolution in connection with the abovementioned proposals  in compliance with the majority requirement specified in Chapter 16  Section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that the resolution shall be supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Number of shares and votesThe number of shares and votes in Smart Eye amounts to 22 148 650 per the day for the issuance of this notice. The Company does not hold any treasury shares.DocumentsThe Board‚Äôs complete proposal for resolution under item 6 and documents referred to in the Swedish Companies Act are available on the Company‚Äôs website  www.smarteye.se  at the Company‚Äôs premises with address Smart Eye Aktiebolag (publ)  F√∂rsta L√•nggatan 28 B  SE-413 27 Gothenburg  Sweden and will be sent to those shareholders who so request and state their postal address or e-mail address.Information before the extraordinary general meetingThe Board of Directors and the CEO shall  if requested by a shareholder  and if the Board of Directors‚Äô believes that it can be done without material harm to the Company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda. A request for such information shall be made in writing to Smart Eye Aktiebolag (publ)  F√∂rsta L√•nggatan 28 B  SE-413 27 Gothenburg  Sweden  or via e-mail to [email protected]  no later than on Monday 20 June 2022.

Any corporation which is a member can authorise one or more person(s) to act as its representative(s) at the meeting. An abstention (or ""vote withheld"") option has been included on the Form of Proxy. The legal effect of choosing the abstention option on any resolution is that the shareholder concerned will be treated as not having voted on the relevant resolution. The number of votes in respect of which there are abstentions  will however  be counted and recorded  but disregarded in calculating the number of votes for or against each resolution. In accordance with Regulation 41 of the UncertiÔ¨Åed Securities Regulations 2001  the Company speciÔ¨Åes that only those shareholders registered in the register of members of the Company as at 1.00 p.m. on 29 June 2022 or  in the event that the meeting is adjourned  in such register not later than 48 hours before the time of the adjourned meeting  shall be entitled to attend  or vote (whether in person or by proxy) at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at the relevant time. Changes after the relevant time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.

If you do not have such a right  or you do have such a right but do not wish to exercise it  you may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the shareholder who nominated you as to the exercise of the voting rights attached to the ordinary shares in respect of which you have been nominated.

Esken Limited 5 Notice of Meeting 2022 Shareholders are entitled to appoint a proxy in respect of some or all of their Shares and may also appoint more than one proxy  provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by such holder. Shareholders who wish to appoint more than one proxy in respect of their holding of Shares should contact Link Group for further Forms of Proxy. Completion and return of a Form of Proxy  or the appointment of a proxy electronically using CREST (or any other procedure described below)  will not prevent you from attending  asking questions and voting in person at the AGM  or any adjournment thereof  if you wish and are entitled to do so. Online appointment of proxies Shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint a proxy electronically by logging on to the Registrar's website at www.signalshares.com and entering the Voting ID  Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number shown on their Form of Proxy. For an electronic proxy appointment to be valid  the appointment must be received by the Company's registrar  Link Group  no later than 11.00 a.m. London time on 11 July 2022 (or  in the case of adjournment(s)  not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned meeting). Full details of the procedure to be followed to appoint a proxy electronically are given on the website. Electronic appointment of proxies through CREST If you hold Shares in uncertificated form through CREST and wish to appoint a proxy or proxies for the meeting (or any adjourned meeting) by using the CREST electronic proxy appointment service  you may do so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed any voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with the specifications of Euroclear and must contain the information required for such instructions as described in the CREST Manual. The message (regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instructions given to a previously appointed proxy) must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the Company's registrar  Link Group  not less than 48 hours before the time fixed for the AGM (not counting non-working days) (or adjourned meeting). For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which Link Group is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time  any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers  should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed any voting service provider(s)  to procure that his/her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in the CREST Regulations.

Recommendation The Board considers the passing of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM to be in the best interests of the Company and Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly  the Board recommends that Shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM  as the Directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings of Ordinary Shares  which amount in aggregate to 3 146 700 Ordinary Shares representing approximately 0.31% per cent. of the issued Ordinary Shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares) at the Latest Practicable Date.

But that‚Äôs exactly what happened last month when the Central Bank ordered the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange (the main foreign securities exchange in Russia) to block a large part of its clients‚Äô assets. The move affected all securities whose storage and settlement passed through the National Settlement Depository (NSD). The only exceptions were foreign shares issued by Russian companies HeadHunter  Yandex  Ozon  Cian  TCS Group and Fix Price  wrote Russian independent news outlet The Bell.International securities settlement house Euroclear ceased operations with the NSD and blocked its account back in March. But last week‚Äôs Central Bank freeze orders definitively separated freely-traded foreign securities from those which are now not tradable. The Central Bank restrictions impacted 995 foreign issuers out of more than 1 650 that previously traded on the exchange.

Holders of ordinary shares who have validly submitted US dollars  euros or pounds sterling currency elections by June 7  2022 will be entitled to a dividend of US$0.25  ‚Ç¨0.2346 or 20.01p per ordinary share  respectively.Absent any valid election to the contrary  persons holding their ordinary shares through Euroclear Nederland will receive their dividends in euros at the euro rate per ordinary share shown above. Absent any valid election to the contrary  shareholders (both holding in certificated and uncertificated form (CREST members)) and persons holding their shares through the Shell Corporate Nominee will receive their dividends in pounds sterling  at the pound sterling rate per ordinary share shown above.ADVERTISEMENTEuro and pounds sterling dividends payable in cash have been converted from US dollars based on an average of market exchange rates over the three dealing days from June 8 to June 10  2022.This dividend will be payable on June 27  2022 to those members whose names were on the Register of Members on May 20  2022.Taxation - cash dividendWith Shell‚Äôs tax residence moved to the UK  dividends paid to shareholders on their ordinary shares will not attract Dutch dividend withholding tax. This means that holders of the former A shares receive their dividends in full as Dutch dividend withholding tax is no longer withheld on these dividends. Holders of the former B shares receive their dividends directly from Shell as these dividends will no longer be paid through the Dividend Access Mechanism.If you are uncertain as to the tax treatment of any dividends you should consult your tax advisor.NoteA different currency election date may apply to shareholders holding shares in a securities account with a bank or financial institution ultimately holding through Euroclear Nederland. This may also apply to other shareholders who do not hold their shares either directly on the Register of Members or in the corporate sponsored nominee arrangement. Shareholders can contact their broker  financial intermediary  bank or financial institution for the election deadline that applies.EnquiriesShell Media RelationsInternational +44 (0) 207 934 5550Americas +1 832 337 4355CAUTIONARY NOTEThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management‚Äôs current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management‚Äôs expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ‚Äúaim‚Äù  ‚Äúambition‚Äù  ‚Äúanticipate‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòbelieve‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòcould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòestimate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòexpect‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äògoals‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòintend‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòmay‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòobjectives‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòoutlook‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòplan‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòprobably‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòproject‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòrisks‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúschedule‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòseek‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòshould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòtarget‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòwill‚Äô‚Äô and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell‚Äôs products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  June 13  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTShell‚Äôs net carbon footprintADVERTISEMENTAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

A deal worth $30 billion. Plenitude IPO to be completed by the end of June.,"Cineberg/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesTo follow up with Eni is important to report two interesting news (NYSE:NYSE:E). The group announced this morning its intention to proceed with the initial public offering of Plenitude - the company's shares will be on Euronext Milan in the coming weeks. The offer will be dedicated to the Italian general public and also to the private placement reserved for qualified investors  including foreign ones. The free float required for the purposes of the listing will be realized through the sale of shares by Eni. The process  Eni specifies ""will attract new capital to Eni  maximizing the value of Plenitude and the stake owned by Eni and unlocking new resources to be allocated for the energy transition path"". According to the rumors  IPO should concern about 30% of Plenitude's capital  and the company should be valued at around 10 billion euros.As for the date of the listing  the goal was to complete the IPO by the end of June. The company's plan also includes the creation of long-term value for shareholders  both through capital appreciation and through dividend distribution - coupon distribution is going to be set to 25% of the consolidated net profit (starting from 2023).Aside from the numbers  Eni's goal ""will help millions of customers across Europe switching to sustainable energy. Partially selling the business will unlock significant value and accelerate its growth  helping Eni cut the Scope 3 emissions currently generated by our customers - a key step to achieving our net-zero target"" said Eni's CEO  Claudio Descalzi.Qatar developmentThe Italian group is in partnership with Exxon Mobil (XOM)  TotalEnergies (TTE)  Shell (SHEL)  and ConocoPhillips (COP) for the expansion of North Field  the largest liquefied gas field in the world. Along with the other oil majors  Eni was chosen by Qatar as a partner in the nearly $30 billion expansion plan.The project plans to expand the field  which will strengthen Qatar's position leading it to become the world's largest exporter of liquefied gas and ensuring long-term gas supply to Europe as the continent seeks alternatives to Russian gas. This is especially good news for the European Union.More will be known over the weekend  since Qatar Energy  it is the state-controlled group  had announced it would hold a press conference and signing ceremony on Sunday. This can be a positive catalyst for Eni.ConclusionPlenitude's IPO is well priced by the market  though there could be extra positive upsides thanks to the Qatar development. At this stage  we remain neutral on the Italian major  but we will definitely continue to monitor future proceedings.Previous coverage in Oil & Gas:",neutral,0.11,0.85,0.04,positive,0.84,0.12,0.04,True,English,"['Eni Stock', 'Positive News', 'NYSE', 'largest liquefied gas field', 'initial public offering', 'two interesting news', 'extra positive upsides', 'Italian general public', 'energy transition path', 'other oil majors', 'long-term gas supply', '$30 billion expansion plan', 'largest exporter', '10 billion euros', 'good news', 'positive catalyst', 'Russian gas', 'sustainable energy', 'North Field', 'Italian major', 'long-term value', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'Euronext Milan', 'coming weeks', 'private placement', 'qualified investors', 'free float', 'new resources', 'dividend distribution', 'coupon distribution', 'net profit', 'Scope 3 emissions', 'key step', 'net-zero target', 'Claudio Descalzi', 'Italian group', 'Exxon Mobil', 'European Union', 'press conference', 'signing ceremony', 'future proceedings', 'Previous coverage', 'Qatar Energy', 'new capital', 'capital appreciation', 'significant value', 'state-controlled group', 'Qatar development', 'Cineberg', 'Eni', 'NYSE', 'intention', 'company', 'shares', 'foreign', 'purposes', 'listing', 'sale', 'process', 'stake', 'rumors', 'IPO', 'date', 'goal', 'June', 'creation', 'shareholders', 'numbers', 'millions', 'customers', 'business', 'growth', 'CEO', 'partnership', 'XOM', 'TotalEnergies', 'TTE', 'Shell', 'ConocoPhillips', 'world', 'project', 'position', 'continent', 'alternatives', 'More', 'weekend', 'Sunday', 'Conclusion', 'market', 'stage']",2022-06-13,2022-06-13,seekingalpha.com
