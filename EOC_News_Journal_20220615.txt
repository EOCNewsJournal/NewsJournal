6407,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pimco-warned-us-treasury-russia-101515253.html,Pimco Warned US Treasury That Russia Sanctions Will Hit Pensions,(Bloomberg) -- Pacific Investment Management Co. has warned the US Treasury about the fallout on investors from the strict sanctions that are pushing Russia ...,(Bloomberg) -- Pacific Investment Management Co. has warned the US Treasury about the fallout on investors from the strict sanctions that are pushing Russia toward default.Most Read from BloombergExecutives at the asset management giant told the US Treasury about losses that US pension funds will face if fund managers are forced to write down their Russian holdings  according to people familiar with the matter. They have also made the point that a Russian default would allow President Vladimir Putin to keep foreign currency reserves that would have otherwise been paid to creditors  giving him more money for war efforts  said the people  who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.Pimco held the equivalent of about $1.8 billion of Russian sovereign bonds as well as exposure through credit-default swaps in its largest fund  the $124 billion Income Fund  according to its first quarter holdings report released last month. Pimco managed $2.2 trillion overall at year-end.‚ÄúPimco -- given its fiduciary duty to its clients -- has engaged with US Treasury to express some of those key consequences of Russia defaulting ‚Äù a spokesman for Newport Beach  California-based Pimco said in a statement.Russia has argued it‚Äôs fulfilled all obligations even as its bond payments are stuck on their path to foreign investors by tighter US and European Union sanctions. That‚Äôs left fund managers who own the country‚Äôs foreign debt in an awkward position -- making the case for payments that ultimately flow to their clients while running the risk of appearing to tell governments to relax their response to a conflict that‚Äôs already cost thousands of lives.Story continuesA representative for the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Department of the Treasury declined to comment on any discussions with Pimco about Russian sanctions.The US Treasury stepped up financial sanctions further last week on Russia by barring investors from buying the country‚Äôs debt in the secondary market. The new rules mean US firms can hold or sell Russian corporate or sovereign debt  but can‚Äôt purchase it. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are withdrawing from handling trades of Russian debt following the move  Bloomberg reported this week.The ban comes as Russia tries to avoid a sovereign default on foreign currency debt by finding a way around sanctions that are preventing it getting money to bondholders. Two payments of about $100 million in total due May 27 are stuck at Euroclear Bank SA. Meanwhile  a missed interest payment has triggered all of Russia‚Äôs outstanding credit default swaps  which covered a net $1.5 billion of Russian debt as of the end of last month.Money managers have spent months pouring over the legal fine print in Russia‚Äôs debt documentation to understand what might constitute a default. Despite the technicalities  there‚Äôs little doubt Russia is at risk of sliding into its first external bond default since the aftermath of the 1917 revolution.Read More: Pimco Fund Added to Russia Swap Exposure in Weeks Before War (1)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek¬©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.02,0.3,0.68,mixed,0.05,0.13,0.83,True,English,"['US Treasury', 'Russia Sanctions', 'Pimco', 'Pensions', 'Goldman Sachs Group Inc.', 'first quarter holdings report', 'Pacific Investment Management Co.', 'outstanding credit default swaps', 'first external bond default', 'asset management giant', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'Euroclear Bank SA', 'legal fine print', 'foreign currency reserves', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'US pension funds', '$124 billion Income Fund', 'European Union sanctions', 'foreign currency debt', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Russian sovereign bonds', 'The US Treasury', 'Russian holdings', 'credit-default swaps', 'bond payments', 'sovereign default', 'foreign debt', 'Russian default', 'sovereign debt', 'tighter US', 'US Department', 'US firms', 'fund managers', 'largest fund', 'Russian sanctions', 'Russian corporate', 'Russian debt', 'strict sanctions', 'fiduciary duty', 'key consequences', 'Newport Beach', 'awkward position', 'financial sanctions', 'secondary market', 'new rules', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'interest payment', 'last month', 'debt documentation', 'little doubt', 'foreign investors', 'Two payments', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Pimco Fund', 'war efforts', 'California-based Pimco', 'Money managers', 'fallout', 'Executives', 'losses', 'people', 'matter', 'point', 'creditors', 'equivalent', 'exposure', 'year-end', 'clients', 'spokesman', 'statement', 'obligations', 'path', 'country', 'case', 'risk', 'governments', 'response', 'conflict', 'thousands', 'lives', 'Story', 'representative', 'Office', 'discussions', 'trades', 'move', 'way', 'bondholders', 'total', 'May', 'net', 'months', 'technicalities', 'aftermath', '1917 revolution', 'Weeks']",2022-06-14,2022-06-15,finance.yahoo.com

BNY Mellon‚Äôs triparty infrastructure can also be used to settle US dollar intraday repo transactions executed on the platform.Finteum claims it is one of the first interbank venues to offer FX swaps and repo alongside each other in the same platform  something which is valuable to bank treasury teams  which use these two markets interchangeably for funding.Brian Nolan  co-founder  Finteum  says: ""Given the rising interest rate environment  intraday markets play an important role in banks‚Äô liquidity optimisation strategy.

TCS‚Äô focus on technology  creativity and talent development  combined with cost efficiency and rigorous management  will drive the company to operate as a client-focused  technology-driven and profitable global studio delivering high-quality projects. Building upon its successes  TCS‚Äô mission is to drive growth and margin enhancement across its divisions by facilitating collaboration among TCS‚Äô different creative and production capabilities  and by adapting client servicing to the post-Covid-19 era. TCS possesses a strong  experienced management team with proven track records and deep sector expertise.TCS‚Äô key strategic pillars are to:Expand capacity to meet strong demand and invest in new markets;Develop the Technicolor Creative Studios brand to be seen as an Employer of Choice by talent;Continue to invest in R&D and Technology;Leverage existing capabilities to capture the Metaverse opportunity.TCS is positioned for accelerated structural growth in a large and growing TAMTCS is benefiting from strong positioning on its key markets  which are all growing2:MPC   which represents 40% of TCS 2021 combined revenues  is a leader in Film and Episodic. In 2021  the Film & Episodic VFX market globally had an estimated value of approximately $4.6 billion. By 2025  the Film & Episodic VFX market is expected to increase to $7.3 billion  representing an approximate 12% compound annual growth rate (‚ÄúCAGR‚Äù) from 2021  as the industry returns to full production and the content arms race continues;The Mill   which represents 44% of TCS 2021 combined revenues  produces ground-breaking advertising  branded content and interactive marketing solutions. In 2021  the Brand Experience & Advertising Production market globally had an estimated value of approximately $30 billion  and is expected to increase to $39 billion by 2025  representing an approximate 7% CAGR from 2021  expanding beyond traditional media. Advertising spending is  however  sensitive to the macroeconomic environment and GDP growth. Should a recession occur  recession-adjusted forecasts (excluding Metaverse Virtual Asset Creation) could result in a c.10% smaller estimated market size by 2025 according to FTI Consulting estimates;Mikros Animation is our CGI animation studio dedicated to feature films  and short form and long form episodic content  serving a variety of clients globally. In 2021  it represented 14% of TCS 2021 combined revenues. CGI Animation Services‚Äô market globally had an estimated value of approximately $2.3 billion in 2021  and is expected to increase to $2.9 billion by 2025  representing a c.6% CAGR from 2021  driven by an increase in the volume of digital episodic content;Technicolor Games is a leading art services studio for the gaming industry  and represents 2% of TCS 2021 combined revenues. The global market for outsourced game services is expected to grow rapidly  from $3.3bn in 2021 to $5.7bn in 2025  representing a 15% CAGR.Combined Financial Statements and New Key Performance IndicatorsDuring the Capital Markets Day  Laurent Carozzi  current CFO of Technicolor SA and future CFO of TCS  will present the Combined Financial Accounts along with the new key performance indicators.As part of the spin-off  TCS has updated its KPIs  with the goal of becoming more comparable with its peers and market practices  and to further align them with the way the business is managed. More precisely TCS intends to follow three KPIs:Adjusted EBITDA after lease (new definition);Adjusted EBITA after lease (new definition);Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after lease (new definition).As a general principle  these KPIs reflect the following:Operating leases (rents): under IFRS 16  operating leases are capitalized and included in debt. Under the new KPI definitions  they are considered as an operational expense  which improves comparability with peers‚Äô reporting under US GAAP;Cloud rendering and other usage-based IT costs: under previous KPI definitions  these costs are accounted for as either intangible assets (third-party software) or contract costs (cloud rendering) depreciation. However  in light of the evolution of invoicing schemes applied for third-party software (which is increasingly invoiced based upon usage as opposed to fixed-term licenses)  under the new KPI definitions these costs will be treated as operating expenses;Capital leases: under IFRS  capital leases (e.g.  IT infrastructure and workstations) are accounted for as tangible or intangible assets. Under the new KPI definition  capital leases will be included in the adjusted operating free cash flow.Combined financial statements  along with detailed definitions and reconciliations of each KPI with previous definitions  are available as an appendix of the present press release.The spin-off is expected to be completed in Q3 2022  subject to (i) the shareholders‚Äô approval of the terms of the spin-off; (ii) the completion of the refinancing discussions with creditors on terms satisfactory to Technicolor Ex-TCS (Vantiva) and TCS; and (iii) customary conditions  consultations and regulatory approvals.OutlookTCS is confirming the forward-looking assumptions published on June 6th  2022 while providing additional elements in line with the new KPIs.Overall  demand for TCS‚Äô highest quality VFX & Animation artistry and cutting-edge technology is expected to continue to grow significantly throughout 2022 and 2023.At MPC and Mikros Animation  the divisions continue to be awarded multiple new projects  resulting in more than 80% of the revenue pipeline for MPC and Mikros Animation being already committed for 2022 as of the end of April 2022. In addition  the number of feature animation projects in production has grown from two in 2019 to six features in 2022;At the Mill  whose activity is closely related to advertising spending  activity growth is being restricted by the current global economic environment. As a result  the Mill is now expecting slower growth than initially anticipated over the period  with the main impact in 2022. Actions to mitigate the impact on margin have already been identified and initiated relating to costs and operational efficiencies;At Technicolor Games  demand for games content is expected to continue growing  along with the expansion of the Technicolor Games service offering beyond art services into co-development and quality assurance (‚ÄúQA‚Äù) services.Significant investment in artist recruitment  retention  and training (including TCS Academy programs) continues  as delivering all pipeline projects remains the main challenge for 2022  as a consequence of the shortage of talent in the market. As of March 31  2022  TCS headcount approximated c. 11 700 employees across 11 countries.These market trends result in management targeting the following3:Adjusted EBITDA1 (old definition) of ‚Ç¨165-175 million in 2022 and ‚Ç¨185-205 million in 2023  as presented on June 6 th   2022 press release  corresponding toan Adjusted EBITDA1 after lease (new definition) of ‚Ç¨120‚Äì130 million in 2022 and ‚Ç¨140‚Äì160 million in 2023. As part of its new KPIs policy  TCS will now guide the market on Adjusted EBITDA after lease (new definition).TCS results are sensitive to its main currencies valuations - notably the US dollar  the Canadian dollar  and the British pound ‚Äì which have evolved favorably since the beginning of the year. Hedging arrangements are in place to mitigate forex risks.In addition  TCS‚Äô normalized level of capex (excluding other usage-based IT costs) is expected to range between 4% and 5% of revenues  while trending down in the medium term as part of operational efficiency gains; and changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities (excluding cloud rendering) are expected to result in around ‚Ç¨10 million cash outflows impact per annum. Capital lease outflows are expected to revert to a normalized level of between ‚Ç¨15 and ‚Ç¨25 million per annum  in line with 2019 levels before the impact of the pandemic on the industry.In the medium term  the Group aims at improving its margin profile through multiple sources:At MPC  TCS anticipates improving margins by targeting higher value projects and volumes with the major streaming platforms  resulting in better operating leverage;At The Mill  TCS will continue its transformation program with improved bid selection  pricing strategy  and efficiencies  increased utilization of TCS‚Äô Indian production platform  and the ongoing synergies from the consolidation of the brands;At Mikros Animation  TCS expects to improve its margins by continuing to increase the volume of feature-quality projects.These sources of margin profile improvements will be combined with proven benefits of the global integrated model  notably with the expansion of capacity in India. Headcount in India is expected to increase to c. 70% of direct headcount (compared to 63% in 2021 and 55% in 2019).TCS Financial PolicyAs part of the refinancing process  Technicolor SA has entered into discussions with Barclays and Angelo Gordon who have committed to provide a ‚Ç¨375 million debt package to Vantiva subject to customary conditions and approvals. As a result  TCS is now contemplating a term loan of approximately ‚Ç¨600 million and a ‚Ç¨40 million Revolving Credit Facility.The Group‚Äôs priority is to focus on deleveraging over the next two years to align leverage with publicly listed peers (and ~3.5x Net Leverage4 in the medium term).TCS does not plan to propose dividends in the near to midterm.Capital Markets Day DetailsThe Capital Markets Day  dedicated to financial analysts and institutional investors  will begin at 1pm BST (2pm CEST) in London and virtually.

More precisely:Operating leases (rents): under IFRS 16  operating leases are capitalized and included in debt (with related interest expenses accounted for in financial results). Total rent paid (mostly real estate rent related) over the period is subtracted from non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA after lease  as considered as an operational expense  which improves comparability with peers‚Äô reporting under US GAAP;Cloud rendering and other usage-based IT costs: under previous KPI definitions  these costs are accounted for as either intangible assets (third-party software) or contract costs (cloud rendering) depreciation. However  in light of the evolution of invoicing schemes applied for third-party software (which is increasingly invoiced based upon usage as opposed to fixed-term licenses)  the Group‚Äôs non-GAAP key performance indicators will instead treat usage-based IT costs as operating expenses. Accordingly  as cloud rendering and other usage-based IT costs are treated as operating expenses  the Group‚Äôs non-GAAP key performance indicator related to free cash flow will include the following adjustments:(i) Capital expenditures will exclude usage-based third-party software; and(ii) Change in working capital will exclude cloud rendering;Capital leases: under IFRS  capital leases (e.g.  IT infrastructure and workstations) are accounted for as tangible or intangible assets (and accordingly in net financing cash generated from (used in) continuing activities).

In particular  Film & Episodic VFX projects are increasingly split among a significant number of VFX vendors due to tightening production deadlines and clients‚Äô wanting to diversify vendor risk. Furthermore  customers‚Äô insourcing of VFX and/or animation services may limit or reduce the addressable market in the future.Client concentration: a significant part of the Group‚Äôs business remains dependent upon its relationships with key content producers  including the major Hollywood studios  streaming providers and directors‚Äìany substantial deterioration in these relationships may negatively impact the Group‚Äôs business and financial performance. Customer consolidation may also lead to an overall reduction in the volume of production on new content that requires VFX or animation servicesCustomer project management: potential difficulty for the Group to anticipate and allocate resources appropriately to execute projects on time and on budget  to reduce variances between projects and to adapt to changes imposed by customers according to their production and release schedules  particularly for projects across multiple countries and time zones.Attract talents & invest in culture: dependency on the recruitment and engagement of specialised personnel with a strong skills set (creative  technical  operational  etc.)  with specific industry knowledge. The lack of a strategy/value proposition or cultural projects for the inclusion of the People & Talent function  combined with declining financial results  could reduce the attractiveness of the GroupSkills & knowledge management  development & retention: transformation  the current financial situation  lack of investment in systems  poaching by competitors and the absence of a strong culture  workplace wellness programs and key talent identification processes (such as high potential programs)  may impact  depending on the business and the country or region  the ability to retain experience and employees in strategic positions  resources on which the Group reliesCybersecurity: due to the existence of highly sensitive and confidential content  the secure management and transmission of Company and client information is a critical component of the Group‚Äôs business. Unreliable content security systems and protocols can compromise both sensitive information and Group assetsInterest rate and exchange rate fluctuations: the Group faces both exchange rate translation  as fluctuation can have an impact on the value of the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in Group‚Äôs Combined Financial Statements  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency. The Group also faces transaction risk  mainly in its sales in U.S. dollar versus Canadian dollar  versus British pound and versus Indian rupeeEvolving legal compliance & ethics: the Group operates a global business that exposes it to risks associated with conducting business in multiple jurisdictions. The laws and regulations to which the Group may be subject include  but are not limited to  general business practices  competitive practices  anti-corruption  handling of personal data  consumer protection  corporate governance  employment laws  local and international tax regulations and intellectual property rights. Any major changes in these laws and regulations could impact the Group‚Äôs businessesRisk Factor related to spin -offSpin-off: the main risk associated with the spin-off is that the Company may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the spin-off  and the spin-off may adversely affect its business1For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA after lease  refer to the Appendix section of the present press release.2 The market information  including size and growth potential  is taken primarily from independent sources such as FTI Consulting (Vendor Due Diligence Report  April 2022).

It also includes management assumption reflecting accounting changes implied by the IFRIC interpretation on Saas adjustment  relating to the configuration or customization costs in a cloud computing arrangement.

For 2023  these impacts are expected to be less material.

Abroad  the casino in Ostend (Belgium) also remained closed. The Swiss casinos of Meyrin and Crans-Montana were able to welcome again their customers with no curfew  as from 19th April 2021  but while respecting health constraints. The Djerba casino (Tunisia) remained open but constrained by a curfew starting at 10 p.m. Swiss online games  deployed on 16th November 2020  and Belgian online games and betting were active throughout the quarter.All casinos are open during the 2nd quarter of the year under review (February 2022 to April 2022)  but continue to suffer from the health constraints in place  which affect their attendance:In France  the ‚Äúvaccination pass‚Äù  introduced on 24th January 2022  remained in force until 13th March 2022 included  limiting customers‚Äô access to the casinos;While attendance is thus down (-19.7%) compared to the 2nd quarter of 2019 (February 2019 to April 2019  last period excluding the Covid crisis)  the average basket increased by +20.8% to ‚Ç¨ 89 on the same period (with a French GGR down -4.0%). It should be noted that the drop in attendance has eased since the lifting of the vaccination pass (-13.7% between 14th March and 30th April 2022 compared to the same period in 2019).In Switzerland  the presentation of the ""vaccination pass"" has been lifted as from 17th February 2022.In addition  the 2nd quarter 2022 takes into account the scope effects especially related to:the disposal on 31 st January 2022 of the stake held in the Crans-Montana casino (GGR of ‚Ç¨ 3.3 M in the 2 nd quarter of 2019  the casino being closed in Q2 2020 and for most of Q2 2021) the cessation of the online games and betting in Belgium and of the management of the Ostend casino since 29th July 2021 (during the 2nd quarter of 2021  the GGR in Belgium amounted to ‚Ç¨ 22.8 M and to ‚Ç¨ 11.5 M in the 2nd quarter of 2020).Story continuesTurnover 2nd quarter 2022: ‚Ç¨ 89.1 MTaking into account the aforementioned items  the Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) stands at ‚Ç¨ 148.2 M during the 2nd quarter of 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨ 25.1 M in 2021. Particularly  the ramping up of the Swiss online games whose GGR amounts to ‚Ç¨ 3.3 M compared to ‚Ç¨ 1.1 M in the 2nd quarter of 2021  should be noted. After levies  the Net Gaming Revenue (NGR) triples to ‚Ç¨ 70.8 M (compared to ‚Ç¨22.0 M in N-1).Overall  revenue for the 2nd quarter 2022 amounts to ‚Ç¨ 89.1 M  compared to ‚Ç¨ 23.6 m in 2021 (x3.8) and ‚Ç¨ 105.3m in 2019  down -15.4 %. Off-gaming activity generates revenue of ‚Ç¨ 18.7 M compared to ‚Ç¨ 1.6 M in N-1 (x11.7) and ‚Ç¨ 22.2 M in 2019  due to the reopening of all of the Group's activities.Overall  at a constant scope  the turnover for the 2nd quarter 2022 records a limited decline of -6.2% compared to the comparable period of 2019 pre-Covid.Turnover 1st half-year 2022: ‚Ç¨ 187.2 M (compared to ‚Ç¨ 47.2 M in 2021)At the end of April  the aggregate turnover for 6 months quadruples and amounts to ‚Ç¨ 187.2 M  with a tripled Net Gaming Revenue amounting to ‚Ç¨ 153.4 M  in a dynamic climate of business development initiated since the end of the constraints linked to the vaccination pass. Overall  at constant scope  revenue for the 1st half of 2022 is down -8.5% compared to the same period of 2019 pre-Covid.End of renovation works in Hy√®resAfter a long period of refurbishment  largely disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic  the Hy√®res casino reopened in its entirety on Wednesday 15th April.

SpinCo would be managed by Philippe Oliva  capitalizing on his vast international experience in the Digital sector  and would aim at achieving strong sustainable growth and double-digit margins underpinned by solid underlying market trends and synergy opportunities between BDS and Digital.TFCo (Atos) would be composed of Atos‚Äô Tech Foundations business line  which in 2021 generated revenue of ‚Ç¨5.4 billion (excluding Unified Communications & Collaboration (UCC))  declining organically by -12%  and a -1.1% operating margin. TFCo would be managed by Nourdine Bihmane  who brings a wealth of experience in the technology sector. TFCo would aim at delivering a full turnaround and restore growth  profitability and cash generation by 2026.Story continuesRodolphe Belmer  Chief Executive Officer of Atos  said: ‚ÄúToday we announce our intention to take the in-depth transformation of the Group  started at the beginning of the year  one step further. This potential new path for Atos would aim to optimize the two distinct markets that the Group operates in  both with fundamentally different dynamics: on the one hand  the infrastructure-driven  asset-led market  and  on the other hand  the digital applications and security driven market.Separating these two businesses would create two companies  leaders in their respective segments with proven and recognized track records: Tech Foundations is a trusted partner of choice for managing and modernizing mission critical systems  broadly recognized by the market for leading positions in Digital Workplace and Hybrid Infrastructure; and SpinCo would be strategically positioned on the data & security markets  recognized as the worldwide leader in managed security and #3 in supercomputing.By specializing in two businesses on different and equally attractive paths  each company would focus on what they do best for their customers  creating significant new investment capacity for both and giving both the chance for long term success  growth and achievement. I would like to thank our talented and dedicated employees  who have embarked on the Group‚Äôs transformation journey since the beginning of the year.‚ÄùBertrand Meunier  Chairman of the Board of Directors of Atos  added: ""Having examined a number of possible options  Atos‚Äô Board of Directors is convinced that the envisioned project  presented today by the management  is the best possible for the Group  and would create the highest value for all Atos Stakeholders.‚ÄùThe contemplated project would maximize value for all Atos‚Äô stakeholders by:Creating two companies  with an increased focus on their respective strategies and markets  each with a dedicated management team  the agility to better serve their customers and to execute their respective transformation plans;Providing each company with an adequate capital structure adapted to its respective growth and cash generation profile;Unlocking value of SpinCo by creating a publicly listed company exposed to high-growth and high-margin markets;Supporting TFCo‚Äôs transformation and fully financing its turnaround  thereby restoring its financial performance  while keeping optionality to participate in market consolidation;Creating a wealth of professional development opportunities for employees.Studying the creation of two strong leaders in their respective marketsSpinCo (Evidian): a leading player positioned in the high-growth digital transformation  big data and cybersecurity marketsSpinCo (Evidian) would be positioned in high growth markets  driven by the shift to public cloud  increasing need for cybersecurity  big data and analytics going mainstream  and the development of smart applications. SpinCo would be led by a seasoned management team with a successful track record  under the leadership of Philippe Oliva (and appointed deputy Group CEO in charge of the Digital/BDS perimeter) and Anil Agrawal as CFO. In 2021  the SpinCo perimeter generated ‚Ç¨4.9 billion revenue  a 7.8% operating margin and a c. ‚Ç¨150 million free cash flow before interest and tax. SpinCo would bring together two of Atos‚Äô existing business lines:Digital : with 50 000 experts 2 and strong partnerships with hyperscalers and market leading software vendors  Digital partners with customers in their digital journey to help them transform their businesses. In a fast-growing market supported by the shift to cloud and an increasing demand for digital transformation  Digital is well positioned to grow. Led by Rakesh Khanna  Digital generated ‚Ç¨3.5 billion in revenue and a high single-digit operating margin in 2021. Digital‚Äôs 2022-2026 acceleration plan  for a total cost of c. ‚Ç¨370 million over the period  would aim at improving its sales performance in order to unlock growth potential  and transforming its delivery model in order to enhance profitability.Big Data and Security (BDS): with 9 000 highly talented experts2  BDS is the trusted partner for secure data intelligence  through two activities: Digital Security and Advanced Computing. Recognized by Gartner as the #1 player in Managed Security Services worldwide and by Hyperion as the #3 player worldwide in Supercomputing  BDS enjoys a strong position in its markets  to capitalize on a growing demand for cybersecurity and advanced computing products and services. Led by Jean-Philippe Poirault  BDS generated ‚Ç¨1.4 billion in revenue and a mid-single-digit operating margin in 2021 (driven down by the Advanced Computing division while Digital Security stood at a high-single digit). Investments in BDS over 2022-2026  for a total amount of c. ‚Ç¨40 million  would aim at accelerating growth  notably by repositioning its advanced computing portfolio  and stepping up operating margin  through renewed growth and improved cost base.SpinCo would benefit from strong commercial and managerial synergy opportunities between its two business lines  in particular with the fertilization of Digital‚Äôs customer base by BDS and with a joint go-to-market strategy. In total  SpinCo‚Äôs acceleration plan is expected to represent an investment of ‚Ç¨0.4 billion over the next five years. This is expected to allow SpinCo to deliver c. 7% organic growth on average over 2022-2026 (starting from an expected ‚Ç¨5.3 billion in 2022)  to gradually improve its operating margin to 12% in 2026 and generate ‚Ç¨700 million in free cash flow before interest and tax  corresponding to a 75% to 80% OMDA conversion3. SpinCo‚Äôs leverage target would be below 3.0x OMDA as of 2024.TFCo (Atos): leader in Managed Infrastructure Services  Digital Workplace and Professional ServicesTFCo (Atos) would consist of Atos‚Äô Tech Foundations business line  focused on designing  building and managing complex and vital information systems worldwide. Led by Nourdine Bihmane (and appointed Group deputy CEO in charge of the Tech Foundations perimeter) and Darren Pilcher  CFO  Tech Foundations is positioned on the infrastructure and private cloud market  which is currently experiencing a mix shift from traditional to next generation infrastructure. With 48 000 employees2 across the world and serving more than 1 200 customers across geographies and industries  Tech Foundations generated  in 2021 (excluding UCC)  ‚Ç¨5.4 billion in revenue  a -1.1% operating margin and a ‚Ç¨-507 million free cash flow before interest and tax (including an exceptional ‚Ç¨-180 million cash out related to the funding of a restructuring plan in Germany and working capital normalization for around ‚Ç¨-200 million).In order to adapt to the shifting market trends described above  TFCo would implement an ambitious turnaround plan that would ultimately reposition the business for growth  profitability and cash generation. This plan  for a total cost of ‚Ç¨1.1 billion over the 2022-2026 period  is articulated around 3 key steps:Refocus: rationalizing the activity portfolio to pave the way for transformation  by exiting non-strategic businesses and turning around or exiting negative margin accounts;Recover: resetting the cost structure by addressing structural issues across right shoring  age pyramid  reducing third-party spending and consolidating data centers and facilities to drive cost savings;Rebound: stabilize revenue and then pivot to growth  thanks to the development of next generation offerings and investments in sales capabilities.TFCo is expected to generate c. ‚Ç¨5.0 billion in revenue in 2022 (excluding UCC). As the turnaround plan is being executed  revenue is expected to decrease to c. ‚Ç¨4.1 billion in 2024 before stabilizing in 2025 and resuming a growth trajectory form 2026 onwards. Operating margin is expected to turn positive in 2025 and to exceed 5% in 2026. Free cash flow before interest and tax is expected at ‚Ç¨150 million in 2026 and growing around ‚Ç¨50 million per year thereafter  which would enable TFCo to have a solid stand-alone path or participate in industry consolidation.FinancingShould Atos decide to move forward with this project  the Group estimates its total funding needs for the 2022-2023 period  until the contemplated separation would become effective  to be around ‚Ç¨1.6 billion. This amount of ‚Ç¨1.6 billion is based on a ‚Ç¨3.4 billion cash position as of December 2021 and a ‚Ç¨2.8 billion minimum cash needed to run the Group‚Äôs operations as of December 2023  and takes into account:An estimated ‚Ç¨-1.4 billion total cash outflow  including the costs of the transformation plans of both SpinCo and TFCo  for their portion to be expensed in 2022 and 2023  (c. ‚Ç¨-0.9 billion)  a potential further increase in working capital in the context of the Group transformation  (c. ‚Ç¨-0.4 billion)  the Cloudreach acquisition  as well as free cash flows and other items for the 2022-2023 period;Debt repayments for an estimated cumulative amount of ‚Ç¨-1.5 billion over the period;Proceeds expected from a contemplated non-core businesses disposal program (mostly within SpinCo)  for ‚Ç¨0.7 billion.This funding requirement is covered by the Group‚Äôs current liquidity at hand  and the Group is currently in advanced discussions with two of its financing banks.After the completion of the contemplated separation  the capital structure of both Spin Co and TFCo would be designed to fit their respective financial profile and funding needs.Contemplated transaction calendar and detailsIf it is decided to move forward with the project  the objective would be to complete the separation into two entities (involving a prior reorganization of the Group) during the second half of 2023  and to complete the listing and distribution of SpinCo shares by the end of 2023  according to the preferred scenario at this stage. Atos‚Äô Board of Directors has approved the launch of the in-depth study of the contemplated transaction. The decision on this reorganization and separate listing project and its terms and conditions will be made after the ongoing in-depth analysis has been completed; it remains conditional on general market conditions and would be subject to customary processes  including governance bodies and shareholders‚Äô approval as well as consultation with the relevant employee representative bodies. Further information on any significant developments in this respect will be made to the market in due time  in accordance with applicable regulations.In the preferred scenario at this stage  Atos‚Äô shareholders would retain their current shares of Atos and would receive SpinCo shares as in-kind distributions. SpinCo would be listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange. After completion of the envisaged transaction  it is currently contemplated that Atos shareholders would hold 100% of TFCo and 70% of Spin Co. The remaining 30% stake in Spin Co would be held by TFCo and monetized over time to refinance TFCo‚Äôs turnaround costs.While SpinCo and TFCo management teams will be fully dedicated to their day-to-day operations and the execution of their respective transformation plans  the potential separation process will be managed by a dedicated team led by Rodolphe Belmer  Atos Chief Executive Officer  alongside Diane Galbe  Atos Chief Strategy Officer.Atos 2022 financial outlookRevenue growth at constant currency of -0.5% to +1.5%;Operating margin of 3% to 5%;Free cash flow between ‚Ç¨-150 million and ‚Ç¨ 200 million.Business trends at the date of this press release confirm revenue growth and free cash flow ranges and point towards the lower half of the operating margin range.AdvisorsD'Angelin & Co  Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE  Perella Weinberg Partners LP and Rothschild & Co are acting as financial advisors to Atos.

In the context of the company‚Äôs expected performance recovery  with a 7% to 8% operating margin targeted in 2024  the company is confident that no further dilutive measures will be needed. The Company‚Äôs sound financial liquidity position (‚Ç¨10.8 billion of cash at hand as of March 31 st 2022) and promising outlook will allow Air France-KLM to repay additional outstanding state aid  which will further improve the financing costs of the Company.The Company confirms its objective to reduce its Net debt / EBITDA ratio to reach 2.0x to 2.5x by 2023.Main shareholders subscriptionThe French state  Air France-KLM‚Äôs largest shareholder (with 28.6% of the Company‚Äôs share capital and 28.1% of voting rights)  participated on an irreducible basis to the full extent of its Rights  corresponding to a subscription of 551 404 728 New Shares.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta‚Äôs website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYIn May  the CLO market experienced a brutal price adjustment  reversing 4 months of solid outperformance relative to classic credit and equity markets. In May Volta NAV was down 11.8%  and with a year-to-date performance for Volta at -10.5%  the five-month performance has moved to be roughly in line with that of US or European High Yield  which are down respectively at -7.8% and -8.7%.Over the investment cycle  Volta is targeting a far higher return than conventional high-yield bonds and continues to receive a cash-on-cash return in the high teens from its investments  which is our expectation even in mildly stressed markets.In May  Volta received the equivalent of ‚Ç¨1.6m in terms of interest and coupons. For the 6 months ended May 2022  Volta received ‚Ç¨22.7m interest and coupons representing a 19.3% annualized cash flow to NAV.Turning to the broad underlying asset classes  the monthly performances** were: +2.4% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  -13.6% for CLO equity tranches; -9.0% for CLO debt; -0.4% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (together representing 2.9% of NAV).At the time of writing this comment  there is anecdotal evidence of improving prices in the secondary market and we expect that part of the downward price adjustment in May to be recouped in June.Our medium-term view is unchanged: we still think that we may see an increase in default rates: towards circa 1% this year  rising to the 2% to 3% range for 2023 (albeit US loans being less impacted than European). We consider such default levels should not be a concern given that the longer-term historical average is slightly below 3%.Story continuesAlthough the consensus view is that inflation is an issue  it is worthwile reflecting that inflation has not been a major problem for the credit market historically. Despite rising inflationary pressures over the last 18 months  default rates have remained very low (over the last 12 months default rates are at 0.2% in the US and 0.8% in Europe). Furthermore  the longest period of inflation (for the last 50 years) was between 1972 and 1981 and that period coincides with the longest period of benign defaults in the US (through these 10 years the US high-yield bond and loan markets averaged annual default rates close to 1.5/2%). It is all too easy to underestimate the effect of inflation on debt erosion. In 2021  the vast majority of CLO loans  both in Europe and the US were refinanced  and now have maturities in 2028/29. Everything else being equal  with 5% inflation and 2% growth  the real value of 1$ debt is only 62 cents after 7 years  far easier to refinance.It is also worthwhile reflecting that in 2020/21  in just 2 years  corporate profits rose by 30% or so (in the US and Europe). US corporate profits (excluding financials)  for example  reached an unprecedented high last year at 8% of US GDP (a 50-year record high)  compared with an average level for the last 25 years of 6.18%. When considering the last 15 years (including the GFC and the Covid Crisis) defaults have tended to start to seriously materialize once corporate profits fall below 6% of GDP (the previous two lows were 4.43% in Q2 2009 and 5.49% in Q2 2020). This suggests that if overall profits were to be flat or even to decrease by 10 or 15% in the coming 2 years it is not expected to cause any significant wave of defaults.Looking ahead to the next few quarters  we do not believe that there are any signs that Volta is likely to suffer from a diversion of cash flows from its CLO Equity positions. Indeed  Volta cashflows have been increasing every month for the last 4 months (measured as the rolling 6-month cashflows to avoid seasonality). Receiving a continuing high level of cash flows should allow us to take advantage of opportunities arising from the current market environment while maintaining the payment of a steady quarterly dividend.As at the end of May 2022  Volta‚Äôs NAV was ‚Ç¨233.0m or ‚Ç¨6.37 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 4.0% of Volta‚Äôs GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta‚Äôs NAV has already been published. Volta‚Äôs policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta‚Äôs appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 3.4% as at 30 April 2022 and 0.6% as at 31 March 2022.** ‚Äúperformances‚Äù of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas Securities Services S.C.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

6462,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.dw.com/en/wheat-prices-soar-will-they-remain-elevated/a-62118942,Wheat prices soar ‚Äî but will the costs remain high?,Global prices for the commodity have doubled recently  for which Russia's invasion of Ukraine is partly yet not fully to blame. DW looks into what's moving wheat prices and what role financial speculation plays in this. Until the end of February  the wheat tr‚Ä¶,"Until the end of February  few would have described the wheat trade as an exciting business. Global market prices for the commodity had been hovering around ‚Ç¨200 ($312) a ton for many years. But with the war in Ukraine  this has changed fundamentally.Russia's invasion of its neighbor has caused the commodity to jump to ‚Ç¨400 per ton ‚Äî a doubling that has come as a shock  especially for poorer countries whose citizens spend a significant amount of their disposable incomes on food.Out of a total worldwide wheat harvest of 785 million tons annually  only about one quarter ends up sold as a commodity on the global market. Most of the wheat is consumed as part of people's daily diet in the countries where it is produced. Quality and prices can differ widely depending on the growing region.Two global trading platformsAlthough it is usually a local product  the price for wheat is decided on specialized global trading platforms  so-called commodities exchanges.""There are two globally significant derivatives marketplaces for wheat in the world ‚Äî the Chicago Board of Trade  CBOT  and Euronext in Paris "" said Wolfgang Sabel from Kaack Terminhandel  a Cloppenburg-based financial services provider for trading in agricultural commodities.""These exchanges are setting global benchmarks for prices under the regulatory authority of the state with the help of standardized rules and regulations. Only supply and demand determine the prices "" he told DW.Standardized measuring means that the amount and the quality of a commodity are strictly regulated. Wheat can be labeled  for example  as 50 tons of bread wheat grown in the EU  with a protein content of 11% and maximum moisture of 15%. Such standardization makes it possible to trade wheat all around the world.For producers  traders and refiners of wheat  the prices set at the exchanges generally serve as wholesale prices that guide price-setting for downstream wheat products  said Sabel. But global market-based and local wheat prices can also differ  he added.Insurance and speculationApart from stipulating global market prices  CBOT and Euronext also offer those involved in wheat trading the possibility of hedging their deals against the vagaries of market developments.As an example  Sabel mentioned the purchasing policy of a wheat mill that is negotiating a contract with a supermarket chain for a larger number of one-pound (500 gram) packages of wheat flour for delivery in September. ""You cannot know what the wheat price will be in September. But what you can do is buy a futures contract for wheat on the exchange.""Futures contracts are contracts traded at CBOT and Euronext to insure against unexpected price swings in the future. In the case of the wheat mill  it can now buy wheat futures for delivery in September to secure the current market price for its calculation for the contract with the supermarket chain.Sabel also explained what will happen if the market price in September is actually higher than the ‚Ç¨300 futures contract bought by the wheat mill. Should the price in September be  say  ‚Ç¨400  the wheat mill initially pays the higher price to its supplier but at the same time receives a ‚Ç¨100 payment from the issuer of the futures contract. In the end  the mill will have spent exactly the ‚Ç¨300 per ton of wheat it based its calculation on. Futures contracts are available for purchases to be made up to two years into the future  Sabel added.The global wheat crisis is already being felt by consumers as retail prices of flour are risingA matter of calculationFarmers also resort to futures contracts to insulate against price swings for their produce  said Sabel. For example  if a farmer issues a ‚Ç¨300 contract for his wheat and the market price unexpectedly rises to ‚Ç¨400  he can sell the wheat for ‚Ç¨400 but must pay the difference of ‚Ç¨100 to the holder of his futures contract.The loss  however  turns into a profit in times of falling prices. Should the wheat price drop to ‚Ç¨200 upon delivery  the holder of his ‚Ç¨300 contract must pay him ‚Ç¨100 into his financial account at the exchange.So  the basis for all this financial maneuvering is real existing wheat  but the price-setting via the derivatives marketplaces is working largely without quantities of wheat actually being shipped around in the real world. ""The exchanges are merely balancing out the different accounts without interfering physically in the wheat trade "" said Sable.Sabel  who is a futures broker himself  manages contracts for producers  traders  and refiners of wheat  but said you don't necessarily need a professional pedigree in any specific commodity trade to buy and sell at the exchanges. There are many speculators seeking to profit from the price swings  he added  as well as arbitrage traders who aim to exploit the small differences in prices between regions and marketplaces.Founded in 1848  the CBOT originally traded only agricultural commodities. Now it offers options and futures contractsTraders' paradiseAt the moment  few experts would contest that the current surge in the wheat price to ‚Ç¨400 is the result of the war between Russia and Ukraine. The two countries together produce about 60 million tons of the 200 million tons traded annually around the world.""The world cannot do without the harvests from Ukraine and Russia. Their amounts are simply too big "" said Sabel  noting that news from the frontline can influence prices as much as likely forecasts for the next grain harvest in the United States.Exorbitant wheat prices  however  are always bad news for the developing world  especially for countries in Africa. ""In these countries  people spend between 60% and 80% of their disposable income on food. If bread becomes double as expensive because wheat has surged from ‚Ç¨200 to ‚Ç¨400 per ton that has an impact "" he said.Watch video 02:40 How could the war in Ukraine cause a food crisis?In Germany  bread prices have also risen substantially  and the German Farmers' Association expects them to remain elevated due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. In addition  the COVID-19 health crisis has triggered a series of supply problems.""We are grappling with a severe shortage of fertilizers  and exorbitant prices for them "" the organization's president  Joachim Rukwied  said recently. Also  disrupted supply chains have led to a scarcity of spare parts for agricultural machinery  which would make a swift increase in agricultural production ""unrealistic "" he added.Commodities broker Wolfgang Sabel agrees  saying that at least until the end of next year ""wheat will remain expensive.""This article was originally written in German.",neutral,0.01,0.66,0.32,mixed,0.12,0.2,0.68,True,English,"['Wheat prices', 'costs', 'two globally significant derivatives marketplaces', 'Cloppenburg-based financial services provider', 'specialized global trading platforms', 'total worldwide wheat harvest', 'Two global trading platforms', 'one-pound (500 gram) packages', 'downstream wheat products', 'global wheat crisis', 'unexpected price swings', 'real existing wheat', 'Global market prices', 'current market price', 'specific commodity trade', 'local wheat prices', 'two years', 'significant amount', 'global benchmarks', 'global market-based', 'financial account', 'financial maneuvering', 'local product', 'current surge', 'market developments', 'exciting business', 'many years', 'disposable incomes', 'one quarter', 'daily diet', 'growing region', 'Chicago Board', 'Kaack Terminhandel', 'agricultural commodities', 'regulatory authority', 'standardized rules', 'Standardized measuring', 'protein content', 'maximum moisture', 'Such standardization', 'purchasing policy', 'supermarket chain', 'larger number', 'higher price', 'same time', 'different accounts', 'futures broker', 'professional pedigree', 'many speculators', 'small differences', 'real world', 'wheat trade', 'bread wheat', 'wheat futures', 'wholesale prices', 'retail prices', 'Futures contracts', 'wheat mill', 'poorer countries', '785 million tons', '‚Ç¨300 futures contract', 'arbitrage traders', ""Traders' paradise"", 'wheat flour', 'commodities exchanges', 'Wolfgang Sabel', '50 tons', '‚Ç¨300 contract', 'end', 'February', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'neighbor', 'doubling', 'shock', 'citizens', 'food', 'part', 'people', 'Quality', 'CBOT', 'Euronext', 'Paris', 'state', 'help', 'regulations', 'supply', 'demand', 'DW.', 'example', 'producers', 'refiners', 'price-setting', 'Insurance', 'speculation', 'possibility', 'deals', 'vagaries', 'delivery', 'September', 'case', 'calculation', 'supplier', '‚Ç¨100 payment', 'issuer', 'purchases', 'consumers', 'matter', 'Farmers', 'holder', 'loss', 'profit', 'times', 'falling', 'basis', 'quantities', 'regions', 'options', 'moment', 'experts']",2022-06-14,2022-06-15,dw.com

VANTIVA management will illustrate the future new company‚Äôs strategic direction and roadmap to drive growth  as well as its financial objectives.A separate press release presenting TCS‚Äô vision and strategy is issued today.VANTIVA will be composed of two businesses with leading positions in their respective markets and with solid growth fundamentals: Connected Home   and DVD Services which will become VANTIVA Supply Chain ServicesVANTIVA forward looking assumptions published on June 6 th are confirmed: Adjusted EBITDA 1 from continuing operations above ‚Ç¨140 million for 2022 and above ‚Ç¨140 million in 2023; Adjusted EBITA comprised between ‚Ç¨38-‚Ç¨48 million in 2022 and between ‚Ç¨29-39 million in 2023; Free Cash Flow before Tax and Financial comprised between ‚Ç¨62-‚Ç¨72 million in 2022 and between ‚Ç¨43-63 million in 2023.Richard Moat  Chief Executive Officer of Technicolor SA and future Chairman of VANTIVA  said:‚ÄúAfter two years of successful transformation significantly improving Technicolor‚Äôs operational and financial performance  we are now ready to begin a new chapter of value creation. Subject to shareholder approval  and after the spin off of Technicolor Creative Studios  Technicolor will open a new chapter and become VANTIVA  composed of Connected Home and VANTIVA Supply Chain Services (the former DVD Services division)  two market-leading businesses  operated by world-class management teams. Together  they are ideally positioned to leverage their unique strengths and assets to reinforce their leadership position in existing and new growing markets. I am confident that with Luis and the talented teams of Connected Home and VANTIVA Supply Chain Services  VANTIVA will continue delivering the best products and services to clients and drive long-term growth.‚ÄùStory continuesLuis Martinez-Amago  President of Connected Home and future Chief Executive Officer of VANTIVA  said:‚ÄúAs VANTIVA future CEO  I am excited to take on this new role and to build on the already strong foundations that Connected Home and VANTIVA Supply Chain Services have developed over the last two years of transformation. After the spin off of Technicolor Creative Studios  our new standalone company will be able to grow on its own terms and follow its own strategy.VANTIVA‚Äôs streamlined structure will enable the company to further reinforce its existing relationships with all its customers. It creates a unique opportunity to establish an identity that is completely aligned with the needs of its core markets  while executing its growth strategy in new domains.As one company  we will benefit from Connected Home‚Äôs comprehensive product offering and leadership2 position in customer-premises equipment in video and broadband as well as from VANTIVA Supply Chain Services‚Äô undisputed leadership in disc  and diversification strategy in high-growth adjacent businesses. By combining our expertise  action-oriented cultures  well-established customer relationships  robust balance-sheet and world-class management teams  I am confident that we are positioned to generate enhanced value to all of our stakeholders. I look forward to working alongside management and our entire teams as we enter a new chapter of success and growth.‚ÄùTechnicolor Ex-TCS to become VANTIVATechnicolor SA is announcing the launch of its new brand: VANTIVA. The new brand will be comprised of the Connected Home and DVD Services operations.VANTIVA‚Äôs streamlined structure will enable the company to further reinforce its existing relationships with all of its customers. It creates a unique opportunity to establish an identity that is completely aligned with the needs of its core markets  while executing its growth strategy in new domains.The change of the corporate name of Technicolor SA to VANTIVA SA is subject to the approval of Technicolor SA shareholders  during the shareholders‚Äô meeting to approve the spin off that will be convened in the third quarter of 2022.Connected Home - Focus on growthConnected Home is the worldwide leading provider of broadband gateways and video set-top-boxes3  supplying the critical link between service providers and end user customers. Over the past two years  Connected Home went through a successful transformation plan to increase productivity and profitability and simplify its business structure.Connected Home represented 69% of VANTIVA revenues in 2021  out of which 64% were Broadband and 36% were Video. Connected Home Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2021 amounted to 6.7%.Under VANTIVA  Connected Home will continue to grow and diversify its business through a sustainable growth strategy  focused on the most attractive segments of growing broadband and video streaming markets. In today‚Äôs connected environment  customer-premises equipment (‚ÄúCPE‚Äù) is a crucial component for internet and video services all around the world and  going forward  access products will be essential given the accelerated transition to a GigaBit economy  metaverse services and distributed networks. In parallel  Android TV solutions are gradually replacing traditional PayTV  representing a growing segment within the video market. As a result  Connected Home‚Äôs targeted segments of CPE are expected to grow at 9%4 on average from 2021 to 2025.Moving forward  Connected Home‚Äôs strategy will be based on three growth pillars:Growing its core businesses: broadband and video segment with a focus on Android TV;Optimizing its operations with faster time-to-market  increased engineering throughput and leaner operations; andReinforcing its supply chain resilience to handle market disruptions.This strategy is expected to enable the division to pursue profitable growth in its core business.In the medium-term  Connected Home will also focus on a diversification strategy into Internet of Things (‚ÄúIoT‚Äù) for verticals  capitalizing on the digital transformation of enterprises through IoT. This diversification will be operated through partnerships with IoT  cloud platform and independent software companies  either organically or inorganically.VANTIVA Supply Chain Services ‚Äì a strategy of diversificationToday  the Company also announces that the DVD services operations will now be known as VANTIVA Supply Chain Services (‚ÄúVSCS‚Äù)  in order to reflect the reality of its underlying business. VSCS is the world‚Äôs leader for disc manufacturing  packaging and distribution for all major studios  with 65% global market share  and 90% in North America5  in a disc market which is underpinned by a sizeable consumer market of $4 billion per year6. Nevertheless  disc volumes are expected to experience secular decline over the next 5 years and then plateau for a few years.VSCS represented 31% of VANTIVA revenues in 2021 at ‚Ç¨701 million and had an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.5%.VSCS is benefiting from proven experience  capability  and innovation  with combined unique selling propositions around manufacturing  supply chain and fulfilment  and transportation. After two years of restructuring  VSCS has successfully optimized its disc business and implemented a clear diversification strategy aimed at leveraging all verticals  assets and capabilities in:Establishing Vinyl production manufacturing  packaging and distribution in North America and then in Europe & Australia. Vinyl volume is expected to grow significantly over the next 5 years as we expand market share;Further expanding Non-Disc Supply-Chain & fulfilment;Expanding the Microfluidics business;Enhancing transportation freight brokerage in North America; andLaunching new product lines and expanding manufacturing and fulfillment capabilities.This diversification strategy is expected to support revenue growth  and profitability in the medium term  with growth activities expected to overtake DVD revenue in the medium term.OutlookUnderlying market assumptions for VANTIVA remain unchanged:Worldwide demand for Connected Home broadband equipment is expected to remain strong in 2022  as customers seek to improve their connectivity. However  ongoing component shortages and pricing challenges will continue to impact our ability to serve end customer demand throughout 2022. Nonetheless  efficiency measures  gradual improvements in delivery and continuous discussions with both suppliers and customers should continue to help offset these headwinds. While we do not have any assets or direct customers or suppliers in Russia and Ukraine  the ongoing conflict has generated additional uncertainty in terms of supply. This has led to an increase in transit times to some European customers  as we transition from rail to sea transportation for products that used to move through Russia. The Group is extending its existing action plans  and is maintaining continuous discussions with both suppliers and customers to compensate for these potential factors;For VANTIVA Supply Chain Services  higher year-on-year new release volumes are expected as theatrical attendance continues to normalize  but this will be slightly offset by lower catalog volumes. Financial performance will also by improved through continuing cost efficiencies. As part of the Group‚Äôs plan to accelerate the diversification of the business  the division is continuing to work on significantly expanding non-disc activities.As a result  for 2022 and 2023 management expectations7 are:Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations above ‚Ç¨140 million for both 2022 and 2023  with improvement from topline offset by diversification costs in 2023;Adjusted EBITA of between ‚Ç¨38-‚Ç¨48 million in 2022 and between ‚Ç¨29-39 million in 2023;Free Cash Flow before Tax and Financial of between ‚Ç¨62-‚Ç¨72 million in 2022 and between ‚Ç¨43-63 million in 2023. The Group does not anticipate further contraction of payment terms in the near future.In addition  VANTIVA results are sensitive to its main currency valuations - notably the US dollar ‚Äì which has evolved favorably since the beginning of the year. Hedging arrangements are in place to address the associated forex risks.VANTIVA businesses are not capex intensive. At Connected Home the capex requirement on a normalized basis amounts to approximately ‚Ç¨25 million per year for production equipment (tools and test benches)  along with intangible investments for R&D. At VSCS capex is mainly for upgrade of production lines along with capex for new growth businesses with short payback terms. Considering working capital requirements  at Connected Home under normal circumstances the need for cash to fund the key component operations is netted by the cash generated from finished goods. However  asymmetric deliveries or demand pushout can create the need for more working capital during the year. At VSCS  seasonality ties up working capital during the first half of the year.Financials 8VANTIVA revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨2 250 million in 2021 and ‚Ç¨2 475 million in 2020. This decline in sales mainly resulted from the impact of component shortages and increased lead time at Connected Home  despite strong underlying demand. At VSCS  lower disc volumes were partially offset by growth in distribution and freight brokerage.Despite the lower top line  VANTIVA improved profitability in 2021 compared to 2020 thanks to transformation activities and operational efficiencies at both Connected Home and VSCS. As a result  VANTIVA adjusted EBITDA amounted to ‚Ç¨141 million in 2021 (6.3% margin) compared to ‚Ç¨133 million in 2020 (5.4% margin)VANTIVA generated positive operating free cash flow9 in 2020 and 2021 of respectively ‚Ç¨29 million and ‚Ç¨11 million  with higher restructuring cash out in 2021.

SpinCo would be managed by Philippe Oliva  capitalizing on his vast international experience in the Digital sector  and would aim at achieving strong sustainable growth and double-digit margins underpinned by solid underlying market trends and synergy opportunities between BDS and Digital.would bring together Atos‚Äô Digital and Big Data and Security (BDS) business lines  which generated in 2021 a combined ‚Ç¨4.9 billion revenue  growing organically by +5%  and a 7.8% operating margin. SpinCo would be managed by Philippe Oliva  capitalizing on his vast international experience in the Digital sector  and would aim at achieving strong sustainable growth and double-digit margins underpinned by solid underlying market trends and synergy opportunities between BDS and Digital. TFCo (Atos) would be composed of Atos‚Äô Tech Foundations business line  which in 2021 generated revenue of ‚Ç¨5.4 billion (excluding Unified Communications & Collaboration (UCC))  declining organically by -12%  and a -1.1% operating margin. TFCo would be managed by Nourdine Bihmane  who brings a wealth of experience in the technology sector. TFCo would aim at delivering a full turnaround and restore growth  profitability and cash generation by 2026.Rodolphe Belmer  Chief Executive Officer of Atos  said: ‚ÄúToday we announce our intention to take the in-depth transformation of the Group  started at the beginning of the year  one step further. This potential new path for Atos would aim to optimize the two distinct markets that the Group operates in  both with fundamentally different dynamics: on the one hand  the infrastructure-driven  asset-led market  and  on the other hand  the digital applications and security driven market.Separating these two businesses would create two companies  leaders in their respective segments with proven and recognized track records: Tech Foundations is a trusted partner of choice for managing and modernizing mission critical systems  broadly recognized by the market for leading positions in Digital Workplace and Hybrid Infrastructure; and SpinCo would be strategically positioned on the data & security markets  recognized as the worldwide leader in managed security and #3 in supercomputing.By specializing in two businesses on different and equally attractive paths  each company would focus on what they do best for their customers  creating significant new investment capacity for both and giving both the chance for long term success  growth and achievement. I would like to thank our talented and dedicated employees  who have embarked on the Group‚Äôs transformation journey since the beginning of the year.‚ÄùBertrand Meunier  Chairman of the Board of Directors of Atos  added: ‚ÄúHaving examined a number of possible options  Atos‚Äô Board of Directors is convinced that the envisioned project  presented today by the management  is the best possible for the Group  and would create the highest value for all Atos Stakeholders.‚ÄùThe contemplated project would maximize value for all Atos‚Äô stakeholders by:Creating two companies  with an increased focus on their respective strategies and markets  each with a dedicated management team  the agility to better serve their customers and to execute their respective transformation plans;Providing each company with an adequate capital structure adapted to its respective growth and cash generation profile;Unlocking value of SpinCo by creating a publicly listed company exposed to high-growth and high-margin markets;Supporting TFCo‚Äôs transformation and fully financing its turnaround  thereby restoring its financial performance  while keeping optionality to participate in market consolidation;Creating a wealth of professional development opportunities for employees.Studying the creation of two strong leaders in their respective marketsSpinCo (Evidian): a leading player positioned in the high-growth digital transformation  big data and cybersecurity marketsSpinCo (Evidian) would be positioned in high growth markets  driven by the shift to public cloud  increasing need for cybersecurity  big data and analytics going mainstream  and the development of smart applications. SpinCo would be led by a seasoned management team with a successful track record  under the leadership of Philippe Oliva (and appointed deputy Group CEO in charge of the Digital/BDS perimeter) and Anil Agrawal as CFO. In 2021  the SpinCo perimeter generated ‚Ç¨4.9 billion revenue  a 7.8% operating margin and a c. ‚Ç¨150 million free cash flow before interest and tax. SpinCo would bring together two of Atos‚Äô existing business lines:Digital : with 50 000 experts 2 and strong partnerships with hyperscalers and market leading software vendors  Digital partners with customers in their digital journey to help them transform their businesses. In a fast-growing market supported by the shift to cloud and an increasing demand for digital transformation  Digital is well positioned to grow. Led by Rakesh Khanna  Digital generated ‚Ç¨3.5 billion in revenue and a high single-digit operating margin in 2021. Digital‚Äôs 2022-2026 acceleration plan  for a total cost of c. ‚Ç¨370 million over the period  would aim at improving its sales performance in order to unlock growth potential  and transforming its delivery model in order to enhance profitability.: with 50 000 experts and strong partnerships with hyperscalers and market leading software vendors  Digital partners with customers in their digital journey to help them transform their businesses. In a fast-growing market supported by the shift to cloud and an increasing demand for digital transformation  Digital is well positioned to grow. Led by Rakesh Khanna  Digital generated ‚Ç¨3.5 billion in revenue and a high single-digit operating margin in 2021. Digital‚Äôs 2022-2026 acceleration plan  for a total cost of c. ‚Ç¨370 million over the period  would aim at improving its sales performance in order to unlock growth potential  and transforming its delivery model in order to enhance profitability. Big Data and Security (BDS): with 9 000 highly talented experts2  BDS is the trusted partner for secure data intelligence  through two activities: Digital Security and Advanced Computing. Recognized by Gartner as the #1 player in Managed Security Services worldwide and by Hyperion as the #3 player worldwide in Supercomputing  BDS enjoys a strong position in its markets  to capitalize on a growing demand for cybersecurity and advanced computing products and services. Led by Jean-Philippe Poirault  BDS generated ‚Ç¨1.4 billion in revenue and a mid-single-digit operating margin in 2021 (driven down by the Advanced Computing division while Digital Security stood at a high-single digit). Investments in BDS over 2022-2026  for a total amount of c. ‚Ç¨40 million  would aim at accelerating growth  notably by repositioning its advanced computing portfolio  and stepping up operating margin  through renewed growth and improved cost base.SpinCo would benefit from strong commercial and managerial synergy opportunities between its two business lines  in particular with the fertilization of Digital‚Äôs customer base by BDS and with a joint go-to-market strategy. In total  SpinCo‚Äôs acceleration plan is expected to represent an investment of ‚Ç¨0.4 billion over the next five years. This is expected to allow SpinCo to deliver c. 7% organic growth on average over 2022-2026 (starting from an expected ‚Ç¨5.3 billion in 2022)  to gradually improve its operating margin to 12% in 2026 and generate ‚Ç¨700 million in free cash flow before interest and tax  corresponding to a 75% to 80% OMDA conversion3. SpinCo‚Äôs leverage target would be below 3.0x OMDA as of 2024.TFCo (Atos): leader in Managed Infrastructure Services  Digital Workplace and Professional ServicesTFCo (Atos) would consist of Atos‚Äô Tech Foundations business line  focused on designing  building and managing complex and vital information systems worldwide. Led by Nourdine Bihmane (and appointed Group deputy CEO in charge of the Tech Foundations perimeter) and Darren Pilcher  CFO  Tech Foundations is positioned on the infrastructure and private cloud market  which is currently experiencing a mix shift from traditional to next generation infrastructure. With 48 000 employees2 across the world and serving more than 1 200 customers across geographies and industries  Tech Foundations generated  in 2021 (excluding UCC)  ‚Ç¨5.4 billion in revenue  a -1.1% operating margin and a ‚Ç¨-507 million free cash flow before interest and tax (including an exceptional ‚Ç¨-180 million cash out related to the funding of a restructuring plan in Germany and working capital normalization for around ‚Ç¨-200 million).In order to adapt to the shifting market trends described above  TFCo would implement an ambitious turnaround plan that would ultimately reposition the business for growth  profitability and cash generation. This plan  for a total cost of ‚Ç¨1.1 billion over the 2022-2026 period  is articulated around 3 key steps:Refocus: rationalizing the activity portfolio to pave the way for transformation  by exiting non-strategic businesses and turning around or exiting negative margin accounts;Recover: resetting the cost structure by addressing structural issues across right shoring  age pyramid  reducing third-party spending and consolidating data centers and facilities to drive cost savings;Rebound: stabilize revenue and then pivot to growth  thanks to the development of next generation offerings and investments in sales capabilities.TFCo is expected to generate c. ‚Ç¨5.0 billion in revenue in 2022 (excluding UCC). As the turnaround plan is being executed  revenue is expected to decrease to c. ‚Ç¨4.1 billion in 2024 before stabilizing in 2025 and resuming a growth trajectory form 2026 onwards. Operating margin is expected to turn positive in 2025 and to exceed 5% in 2026. Free cash flow before interest and tax is expected at ‚Ç¨150 million in 2026 and growing around ‚Ç¨50 million per year thereafter  which would enable TFCo to have a solid stand-alone path or participate in industry consolidation.FinancingShould Atos decide to move forward with this project  the Group estimates its total funding needs for the 2022-2023 period  until the contemplated separation would become effective  to be around ‚Ç¨1.6 billion. This amount of ‚Ç¨1.6 billion is based on a ‚Ç¨3.4 billion cash position as of December 2021 and a ‚Ç¨2.8 billion minimum cash needed to run the Group‚Äôs operations as of December 2023  and takes into account:An estimated ‚Ç¨-1.4 billion total cash outflow  including the costs of the transformation plans of both SpinCo and TFCo  for their portion to be expensed in 2022 and 2023  (c. ‚Ç¨-0.9 billion)  a potential further increase in working capital in the context of the Group transformation  (c. ‚Ç¨-0.4 billion)  the Cloudreach acquisition  as well as free cash flows and other items for the 2022-2023 period;Debt repayments for an estimated cumulative amount of ‚Ç¨-1.5 billion over the period;Proceeds expected from a contemplated non-core businesses disposal program (mostly within SpinCo)  for ‚Ç¨0.7 billion.This funding requirement is covered by the Group‚Äôs current liquidity at hand  and the Group is currently in advanced discussions with two of its financing banks.After the completion of the contemplated separation  the capital structure of both Spin Co and TFCo would be designed to fit their respective financial profile and funding needs.Contemplated transaction calendar and detailsIf it is decided to move forward with the project  the objective would be to complete the separation into two entities (involving a prior reorganization of the Group) during the second half of 2023  and to complete the listing and distribution of SpinCo shares by the end of 2023  according to the preferred scenario at this stage. Atos‚Äô Board of Directors has approved the launch of the in-depth study of the contemplated transaction. The decision on this reorganization and separate listing project and its terms and conditions will be made after the ongoing in-depth analysis has been completed; it remains conditional on general market conditions and would be subject to customary processes  including governance bodies and shareholders‚Äô approval as well as consultation with the relevant employee representative bodies. Further information on any significant developments in this respect will be made to the market in due time  in accordance with applicable regulations.In the preferred scenario at this stage  Atos‚Äô shareholders would retain their current shares of Atos and would receive SpinCo shares as in-kind distributions. SpinCo would be listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange. After completion of the envisaged transaction  it is currently contemplated that Atos shareholders would hold 100% of TFCo and 70% of Spin Co. The remaining 30% stake in Spin Co would be held by TFCo and monetized over time to refinance TFCo‚Äôs turnaround costs.While SpinCo and TFCo management teams will be fully dedicated to their day-to-day operations and the execution of their respective transformation plans  the potential separation process will be managed by a dedicated team led by Rodolphe Belmer  Atos Chief Executive Officer  alongside Diane Galbe  Atos Chief Strategy Officer.Atos 2022 financial outlookRevenue growth at constant currency of -0.5% to +1.5%;Operating margin of 3% to 5%;Free cash flow between ‚Ç¨-150 million and ‚Ç¨ 200 million.Business trends at the date of this press release confirm revenue growth and free cash flow ranges and point towards the lower half of the operating margin range.AdvisorsD‚ÄôAngelin & Co  Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE  Perella Weinberg Partners LP and Rothschild & Co are acting as financial advisors to Atos.

Sometimes museums have to close their doors for several da‚Ä¶,"thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department: ""Metaverses will give birth to the best‚Ä¶ and the most nebulous. Numerous fragments of this new dimension already exist revealing an astonishing potential for possible applications: while some Metaverses function as extensions to our very real world  others invent new universes governed by their own rules. The choices made by Facebook (Meta) and Sandbox are currently dominating the news  but many other forms of Metaverse are being constructed in different contexts  notably in the art world and around Artprice"".Diving into the digital age‚Ä¶Over the past ten years  virtual tours have gradually imposed themselves as an option in the art world. Today many museums  fairs  and auction houses offer virtual strolls through their exhibition spaces on smartphones  tablets  and computers.This alternative access to art allows amateurs and professionals alike to appreciate works with highly enriched content and it  therefore  represents a complementary way of discovering (or rediscovering) an exhibition that satisfies a growing need for flexibility. The extraordinary demand for NFTs has indeed demonstrated that flexibility is key to the modern consumption of art. The platforms that allow the exchange of these digital certificates are accessible day and night  from any point on the earth  provided there is an internet connection.Whereas virtual exhibition tours were originally created as photo-montages  new technologies now use 3D design software as well as Artificial Intelligence. The solutions developed  among others  by the Universal Art Museum  Genesis Penthouse or Spatial make it possible to ""hang"" an entire collection of artworks in a digital space with almost infinite scenographic freedom.https://www.the-uma.org/en/https://www.nftoasis.co/genesis-penthousehttps://spatial.io/Welcome to the ""other side""...If these ideas remain relatively obscure to the general public  many of the most important projects in the NFT sphere suggest the imminent arrival of their corresponding Metaverses. This is already the case for Yuga Labs with the launch of its ""Otherdeed for Otherside"".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcOyqZtZs8gAt the pinnacle of BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club) fame and backed by its prestigious community  Yuga Labs organized the first sale of land in its Metaverse called The Otherside. The immense enthusiasm for the BAYC project and a very attractive mint price ($305 APE ~ $6 000) pushed the Ethereum Blockchain beyond its limits of use: the 'gas' fees soared and a fair number of participants were unable to acquire a plot of land despite having paid substantial fees. The designers fortunately committed to compensating users who lost their way in the sale.The floor price for a piece of land currently stands at 2.55 ETH (~$2 500) while the last Ape sold at public auction fetched $3.4 million.https://opensea.io/collection/otherdeedhttps://www.artprice.com/artist/1011081/yuga-labs/lots/pasts/27/nftContemporary artist Takashi Murakami has announced that he wants to build a Metaverse which would be like the sum of all his projects murakamiflowers.kaikaikiki.com:""Normally  60 years old may indicate you are in the final stage of life  but as I said earlier  my artworks are designed so that their mechanism would start working after my death. So this is truly the start line for me.I tried to recreate in the digital world a scene where the foot of Japan's sacred mountain  Fuji  is in full bloom with cherry blossoms. I drew a delusional picture of a future virtual space where  along with M.F [Murakami Flowers]  my various titles and business endeavors will be reconstructed in the digital world.""Murakami's project may well be somewhat nebulous  but  like many other Metaverse projects  it will no doubt harbor several fascinating surprises.[Image : https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/06/artmarket-com-head-office-heart-of-the-abode-of-chaos-3d-immersion-360.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

6502,Euroclear,Bing API,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/putin-broken-market-puts-trades-040000564.html,Putin‚Äôs Broken Market Link Puts Trades Worth Billions in Limbo,Russia‚Äôs central bank is keeping a close watch on a key piece of market infrastructure targeted by European Union sanctions.Most Read from BloombergAmericans Are Building Vacation-Home Empires With Ea,(Bloomberg) -- Russia‚Äôs central bank is keeping a close watch on a key piece of market infrastructure targeted by European Union sanctions.Most Read from BloombergAsked after Friday‚Äôs interest-rate decision whether the Bank of Russia would join potential lawsuits to fight a freeze on the National Settlement Depository  Governor Elvira Nabiullina said officials are ‚Äúworking on the best strategy and tactics.‚ÄùFew institutions better represent Russia‚Äôs sudden financial isolation since the invasion of Ukraine than the NSD. After the attack  more than a hundred billion dollars‚Äô worth of stocks and bonds were left blocked after the world‚Äôs biggest settlement systems froze its accounts  according to estimates by the ITI Capital brokerage in Moscow.And since the European Union blacklisted the NSD directly at the start of June  there‚Äôs little chance transactions with those assets will be freed up anytime soon.Here‚Äôs a closer look at Russia‚Äôs crumbling market bridge:Foreign TiesHoused in modern offices opposite Moscow‚Äôs 19th century Yelokhovsky Cathedral  the NSD established links over the years with foreign clearing houses  custodian banks and international securities regulators.That gave overseas investors easy access to Russian assets  helping curb trading overheads and pushing down the cost of capital for local corporations and the government.But the wave of international sanctions and local capital controls that followed President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine have cut Russia off from financial markets  pushing the government toward its first foreign default in a century.The NSD‚Äôs accounts at the world‚Äôs biggest settlement systems -- Euroclear Bank SA and Clearstream Banking AG -- are the source of most pain.Story continuesPimco Warned US Treasury That Russia Sanctions Will Hit PensionsImpact of WarIn the wake of the Feb. 24 attack  Euroclear froze transactions with the NSD as it vetted the depository to make sure it wasn‚Äôt in breach of sanctions  according to people familiar with the situation  who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details aren‚Äôt public.The processing of trades slowed almost to a standstill  and then at the start of this month  the European Union blacklisted the NSD outright.The depository was deemed to be ‚Äúdirectly and indirectly enabling‚Äù the Russian government  because of the ‚Äúhigh degree‚Äù of state control over its owner -- the Moscow Exchange -- the EU said in its official journal.Euroclear implemented an asset freeze on the NSD in response  halting the due diligence it had been conducting. For its part  the NSD promptly suspended transactions in euros  announcing an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù situation.Scope of the DamageThe limits on the NSD‚Äôs accounts froze securities worth tens of billions of dollars.Non-residents had exposure equivalent to about $48 billion of Russian equity and $38 billion of fixed income -- mostly government ruble bonds known as OFZs -- via the NSD  according to Iskander Lutsko  chief investment strategist at ITI  one of Russia‚Äôs top ten brokerages. Euroclear has also blocked about $27 billion of foreign assets  principally shares  held by Russians  Lutsko said.Despite the sanctions  Russian companies and the state have so far managed to pay investors about $6.5 billion in coupons and maturities since early March  according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. Locals relying on their NSD account at Euroclear to access those payments have missed out.The conversion of depository receipts of Russian companies listed abroad into local shares has also stopped due to the block on the NSD.BottleneckBefore the most recent restrictions  transactions involving assets denominated in currencies other than the ruble were eligible for settlement provided the securities or the counter-parties involved weren‚Äôt the subject of EU penalties  according to Euroclear‚Äôs website.For each deal with a Russian counter-party  Euroclear required a so-called MT 599 attestation to prove no penalties were breached and due diligence had been performed.While this allowed unsanctioned Russian banks and market participants with their own Euroclear accounts to keep settling their trades  those going via the NSD‚Äôs accounts at Euroclear were blocked.OFZ OptimismRussia‚Äôs isolation contrasts with the optimism of a decade ago  when the Russian Finance Ministry was pushing ahead with a direct link to international clearing houses for its local OFZ bonds.Eventually  Euroclear started direct settlement of Russian ruble-denominated government debt in February 2013  opening the market to foreign investors  who no longer needed to trade via local brokers.Access to municipal and corporate debt markets followed in the months after  while it took several years more for global custodian banks to be able to open direct accounts at the NSD.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek¬©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.0,0.02,0.98,mixed,0.1,0.15,0.75,True,English,"['Broken Market Link', 'Putin', 'Trades', 'Billions', 'Limbo', 'hundred billion dollars‚Äô worth', '19th century Yelokhovsky Cathedral', 'Russian ruble-denominated government debt', 'Governor Elvira Nabiullina', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'Clearstream Banking AG', 'chief investment strategist', 'top ten brokerages', 'corporate debt markets', 'international clearing houses', 'Russian Finance Ministry', 'biggest settlement systems', 'foreign clearing houses', 'first foreign default', 'global custodian banks', 'unsanctioned Russian banks', 'sudden financial isolation', 'crumbling market bridge', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'local capital controls', 'little chance transactions', 'ITI Capital brokerage', 'international securities regulators', 'local OFZ bonds', 'National Settlement Depository', 'government ruble bonds', 'European Union sanctions', 'Euroclear Bank SA', 'financial markets', 'Russian government', 'isolation contrasts', 'international sanctions', 'Russian equity', 'Russian companies', 'Russian counter-party', 'Foreign Ties', 'local corporations', 'direct settlement', 'local brokers', 'foreign investors', 'central bank', 'close watch', 'key piece', 'market infrastructure', 'interest-rate decision', 'potential lawsuits', 'best strategy', 'Few institutions', 'closer look', 'modern offices', 'trading overheads', 'most pain', 'US Treasury', 'high degree', 'official journal', 'due diligence', 'fixed income', 'early March', 'recent restrictions', 'MT 599 attestation', 'market participants', 'OFZ Optimism', 'direct link', 'Russian assets', 'foreign assets', 'local shares', 'Bloomberg News', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'depository receipts', 'overseas investors', 'easy access', 'Feb. 24 attack', 'state control', 'asset freeze', 'emergency‚Äù situation', 'Iskander Lutsko', 'several years', 'Moscow Exchange', 'direct accounts', 'The NSD', 'NSD account', 'EU penalties', 'Russia Sanctions', 'Euroclear accounts', 'NSD.', 'Friday', 'officials', 'tactics', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'stocks', 'world', 'estimates', 'start', 'June', 'links', 'cost', 'wave', 'source', 'Story', 'Pimco', 'Pensions', 'Impact', 'War', 'wake', 'breach', 'people', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'details', 'processing', 'trades', 'standstill', 'month', 'owner', 'response', 'euros', 'Scope', 'Damage', 'limits', 'tens', 'billions', 'Non-residents', 'exposure', 'equivalent', 'OFZs', 'Russians', 'coupons', 'maturities', 'data', 'Locals', 'payments', 'conversion', 'block', 'Bottleneck', 'currencies', 'counter-parties', 'subject', 'website', 'deal', 'February', 'municipal']",2022-06-15,2022-06-15,ca.news.yahoo.com

BNY Mellon‚Äôs triparty infrastructure can also be used to settle U.S ...,FinteumFinteum OverviewAn explanation of how banks can leverage the Finteum PlatformFourteen large banks have trialled a platform for intraday FX swaps and intraday repo and a subset of so-called ‚ÄòKey Participant‚Äô banks are planning to go liveIntraday FX swaps are an important innovation for banks  where traditionally the shortest tenor transactions are overnight FX swapsThe initiative has the potential to save each of the Key Participant banks millions of dollars every year and the Key Participant opportunity is open to all banksFX and Repo are among the world‚Äôs largest and most liquid marketsThe collaboration with Euroclear and the addition of Repo are exciting steps forward for the initiativeFinteum is improving on its DLT-based platform and expanding to DLT and non-DLT settlementLONDON  June 14  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Treasury and technology teams from fourteen large banking groups  including NatWest Group  BNY Mellon‚Äôs corporate treasury function  Barclays  Citi and 10 additional banks have trialled a platform by London-based fintech Finteum. The solution helps banks to manage intraday liquidity through the development of new interbank markets. The platform will go live in 2023.The platform enables payment-vs-payment intraday FX swaps as well as delivery-vs-payment intraday repo transactions. The banks were headquartered across Europe  North America and Asia and were joined by representatives from national prudential authorities and liquidity experts from UK Finance  the collective voice for the banking and finance industry  who observed. The combined balance sheets of the participating banks was $19.8 trillion - among the largest group of banks ever to trial a new piece of market infrastructure.Three large European banking groups  a subset of the 14 that participated in the trial  have already committed to go live on the Finteum Platform in Q2-Q3 2023  with real-money test trades expected later in 2022. These so-called ‚ÄòKey Participant‚Äô banks also help to influence the development priorities of the Finteum initiative. Other banks are assessing participation to become Key Participants following this latest trial  and the opportunity is open to all banks.Story continuesIn 2022  the Finteum Platform added intraday repo alongside intraday FX swaps due to interest from banks  which was an important change. For intraday repo  the trial assumed DvP settlement using Euroclear Bank‚Äôs existing triparty infrastructure  which would enable settlement within minutes without any tokenisation. BNY Mellon‚Äôs triparty infrastructure can also be used to settle U.S. dollar intraday repo transactions executed on the Finteum Platform. The Finteum Platform is one of the first interbank venues to offer FX swaps and repo alongside each other in the same platform. Bank treasury teams use these two markets interchangeably for funding.Using intraday markets  banks can borrow for hours at a time  enabling them to efficiently meet a temporary liquidity need. This helps them to safely optimise intraday liquidity buffers  which have been in focus since Basel III. In a poll of representatives across the 14 banks during the trial  59% said that  given the rising interest rate environment  liquidity optimisation was a high priority for 2022/3  with a further 19% responding it was higher priority than 2021. For the Key Participant banks  the Finteum initiative is an important component of their liquidity optimisation strategy  predicting it will reduce each Key Participant bank‚Äôs costs by millions of dollars per year. Banks can also use intraday markets to lend excess funds  representing a new revenue stream.FX swaps is among the largest markets in the world with more than $3.2 trillion of daily volume  according to the Bank for International Settlements. Repo volumes may be more than ‚Ç¨3 trillion daily  according to the International Capital Market Association. However  for most market participants  overnight is still the shortest tenor in both markets. The Finteum Platform uses R3's Corda enterprise blockchain  along with the best possible settlement solutions  to deliver its market-first intraday FX swaps execution service  and for intraday repo. The settlement rails could include DLT-based technology such as the Fnality Payment System and non-DLT technology such as Euroclear Bank‚Äôs triparty infrastructure.During the trial  the banks engaged in simulated trading and discussion sessions  focused on the capabilities and features of the software  and its potential benefits. Over the course of one of the hour-long trading sessions the banks executed 96 simulated intraday FX swap and repo transactions  based on 75 simulated orders in a central limit order book and 165 bilateral RFQs  with a simulated total of $11.1bn traded.Brian Nolan  Finteum co-founder  said: ‚ÄúGiven the rising interest rate environment  intraday markets play an important role in banks‚Äô liquidity optimisation strategy. We are excited to continue working with the Key Participant banks and including more banks in the group  ahead of go-live in 2023.‚ÄùFinteum raised angel funding and will close a seed funding round shortly to deliver on the go-live.Contact: info@finteum.comA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/228bbeb6-1b10-4313-8690-d178d281196f,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,positive,0.71,0.26,0.03,True,English,"['11 Additional Banks Trial Intraday FX Swap', 'Repo Trading Platform', 'NatWest Group', 'BNY Mellon', 'Finteum', 'Barclays', 'market-first intraday FX swaps execution service', 'U.S. dollar intraday repo transactions', 'Three large European banking groups', 'central limit order book', 'fourteen large banking groups', 'rising interest rate environment', 'best possible settlement solutions', 'International Capital Market Association', '96 simulated intraday FX swap', 'banks‚Äô liquidity optimisation strategy', 'Fourteen large banks', 'national prudential authorities', 'real-money test trades', 'first interbank venues', 'Corda enterprise blockchain', 'temporary liquidity need', 'new revenue stream', 'intraday liquidity buffers', 'shortest tenor transactions', 'most market participants', 'corporate treasury function', 'overnight FX swaps', 'Key Participant bank', 'London-based fintech Finteum', 'hour-long trading sessions', 'Key Participant opportunity', 'new interbank markets', 'Key Participant‚Äô banks', 'existing triparty infrastructure', 'Fnality Payment System', 'Bank treasury teams', 'The Finteum Platform', 'Key Participants', 'market infrastructure', 'International Settlements', 'simulated trading', 'intraday markets', 'liquidity experts', 'new piece', 'technology teams', 'discussion sessions', '75 simulated orders', 'simulated total', 'DvP settlement', 'settlement rails', 'Repo volumes', 'Finteum Overview', 'important innovation', 'liquid markets', 'exciting steps', 'GLOBE NEWSWIRE', 'BNY Mellon', 'North America', 'UK Finance', 'collective voice', 'finance industry', 'balance sheets', 'important change', 'two markets', 'Basel III', 'high priority', 'higher priority', 'important component', 'excess funds', 'daily volume', 'DLT-based technology', '165 bilateral RFQs', 'Brian Nolan', 'important role', 'DLT settlement', 'Euroclear Bank', 'DLT-based platform', 'same platform', '10 additional banks', 'participating banks', 'Other banks', 'NatWest Group', 'largest markets', 'DLT technology', 'development priorities', 'Finteum initiative', 'potential benefits', 'largest group', 'latest trial', '14 banks', 'explanation', 'subset', 'millions', 'dollars', 'world', 'collaboration', 'June', 'Barclays', 'vs', 'delivery', 'Asia', 'representatives', 'Q2-Q3', 'participation', 'Story', 'minutes', 'tokenisation', 'funding', 'hours', 'time', 'focus', 'poll', 'costs', 'year', 'R3', 'capabilities', 'features', 'software', 'course', 'founder', '2022']",2022-06-14,2022-06-15,uk.finance.yahoo.com

It is intended for active immunization of at-risk populations to prevent carriage and symptomatic infection with COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic and potentially later for routine vaccination including addressing new variants. VLA2001 may also be suited for boosting  as repeat booster vaccinations have been shown to work well with whole virus inactivated vaccines. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva‚Äôs established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva‚Äôs licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO¬Æ. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B¬Æ vaccine.

This key milestone has been completed on schedule in just 14 months  following the announcement of this strategic decision in April 2021 in the context of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.Strategic rationale and value creationRelocating Euronext‚Äôs Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy  into a best-in-class and green data centre facility  was a strategic decision made in response to multiple factors  including the dynamic created by Brexit  and a strong rationale for relocating Euronext‚Äôs core European trading activities in the European Union. This move allows Euronext to fully control and directly manage its core IT infrastructure  as well as a key service to clients  colocation  which was previously outsourced. It also allows the generation of colocation revenues  embedded in the upgraded synergies.The Aruba Global Cloud Data Centre meets the highest quality standards (rating 4 certification)  provides the maximum level of safety and resilience  and is 100% powered by renewable energy  enabling Euronext to minimise its environmental impact.Story continuesEuronext now operates a state-of-the-art colocation facility available to both members and non-members  opening up new opportunities for development of services  and contributing as of today to a part of the planned delivery of the ‚Ç¨100 million run-rate annual EBITDA synergies related to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition targeted for 2024.The Core Data Centre migration has been timed in order to pave the way for the migration of the Borsa Italiana equity and derivatives markets onto the Euronext Optiq¬Æ trading platform as soon as 2023.Powered by nature and clean energyThe migration to the new green Core Data Centre represents a key milestone in Euronext‚Äôs ‚ÄúFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äù commitment  part of its ESG strategy. Located in the Aruba Global Cloud Data Centre IT3‚Äôs certified and energy-efficient buildings  the new Core Data Centre is entirely powered by renewable energy  much of it self-produced through a large photovoltaic system and a hydroelectric unit. It also benefits from reduced power consumption thanks to very efficient cooling systems using geothermal and dynamic free cooling  and the use of cloud computing to reduce the number of servers. The new Core Data Centre allows Euronext to reduce its own carbon footprint  while also enabling its colocation clients to lower their environmental impact.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said: ‚ÄúThe migration of Euronext‚Äôs Core Data Centre to Italy  14 months after the closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition  marks a milestone in bringing back to the European Union the Core Data Centre that handles 25% of European trading volumes. It is the first major achievement within Euronext‚Äôs Growth for Impact 2024 strategic plan  paving the way for the migration of the Italian cash equities and derivatives markets to the Euronext Optiq¬Æ trading technology as soon as 2023. This migration triggered the first business synergies related to the Borsa Italiana Group integration. I would like to thank all our teams  our clients  and our service providers for this successful project  which will benefit the whole of the financial ecosystem while helping our clients reduce their own carbon footprints.‚ÄùCONTACTS MEDIA ‚Äì mediateam@euronext.com Aur√©lie Cohen (Europe) +33 1 70 48 24 45 parispressoffice@euronext.com Marianne Aalders (Amsterdam) +31 20 721 41 33 maalders@euronext.com Pascal Brabant (Brussels) +32 2 620 15 50 pbrabant@euronext.com Sandra Machado (Lisbon) +351 210 600 614 smachado@euronext.com Andrea Monzani (Europe/Milan/Rome) +39 02 72 42 62 13 italypressoffice@euronext.com Cathrine Lorvik Segerlund (Oslo) +47 41 69 59 10 clsegerlund@euronext.com Sarah Mound (Paris  Dublin) +33 1 70 48 24 45 smound@euronext.com ANALYSTS & INVESTORS ‚Äì ir@euronext.com Aur√©lie Cohen +33 1 70 48 24 27 ir@euronext.com Cl√©ment Kubiak +33 1 70 48 26 33 ir@euronext.comAbout EuronextEuronext is the leading pan-European market infrastructure  connecting European economies to global capital markets  to accelerate innovation and sustainable growth.

The key investment focus remains to look for solutions to the many unmet healthcare needs.The Life Sciences platform builds on the success and excellent returns generated by portfolio companies over four decades  including companies like Ablynx  where Gimv was a founding investor and Covagen  which was acquired by Johnson & Johnson. Current investments include Precirix  ImCheck  and ImmunOs  which recently raised $74 million in a Series B round led by Gimv.With this new platform  Gimv can further strengthen its capacity to invest larger tickets  with a typical initial investment of ‚Ç¨10-15 million per company.

In this respect  the‚Ä¶,LA HULPE  Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Unifiedpost Group (Euronext: UPG) (Unifiedpost  the Group or the Company) wants to clarify the senior facilities agreement it has concluded on March 7  2022 with U.S. investment firm Francisco Partners. In this respect  the Company publishes a consolidated clear overview of the main characteristics of the aforementioned agreement in order to fully inform the market.Key information Lender Francisco Partners (FP) Committed amount ‚Ç¨ 100 million Duration 5 years Structure Term Loan facility: ‚Ç¨ 75 million Capex facility: ‚Ç¨ 25 million Drawn margin 3.0% cash interest and 8.0% PIK interest1 Equity participation 3.0% of fully diluted share capital. FP received this right for providing the ‚Ç¨ 100 million committed financing and will not pay for this instrument Structuring fee 2.50% over Term Loan facility and Capex/Acquisition facility (‚Ç¨2.50 million in total)  paid on closing date  i.e. 7th March 2022 Financial covenant Quarterly liquidity test Use of proceeds of Term Loan and Capex facility General corporate purposes  refinancing of existing indebtedness  capital expenditure (including capitalized R&D)  payments of deferred considerations and fund potential future transactions to additionally expand capabilities and geographical coverageWhy this financing?On 7 March 2022  Unifiedpost signed a ‚Ç¨100 million five-year senior facilities agreement provided by Francisco Partners (the SFA). The SFA will allow Unifiedpost to do all necessary investments to be ready with a pan-European full service digital invoicing solution in time to ride the wave of digitization that will roll across Europe. In the coming 18 months in no less than 10 countries  all key Unifiedpost markets  B2B/ B2G e-invoicing will become mandatory. Unifiedpost‚Äôs target group ‚Äì which consists of 25 million SMEs and as many self-employed people in the EU ‚Äì will be obliged to send out their invoices in a digital manner.The proceeds will be used to refinance existing debt and further support Unifiedpost‚Äôs growth strategy in terms of R&D investments  working capital requirements  and the funding of potential future transactions to additionally expand capabilities and geographical coverage. Any potential acquisitions will be evaluated in function of strengthening the Company‚Äôs local market position in key countries. In doing so  Unifiedpost aims to offer all its shareholders and the financial markets guarantees for further strategic implementation and for the further valorisation of our organic growth potential.Lender: Francisco PartnersThe SFA is provided by Francisco Partners  a leading global investment firm that specializes in partnering with technology-enabled businesses.As part of the transaction  Francisco Partners obtained an equity fee commitment under a subscription agreement in the amount of ‚Ç¨12.756 million in consideration for the commitment by FP to enter into the SFA. This fee was deducted on 10 March 2022 by way of set-off from the proceeds of the first drawdown under the SFA. Pursuant to the subscription agreement  FP subscribed to 3% of the share capital of Unifiedpost Group  representing ‚Ç¨ 12.756 million of the share capital by means of a contribution in cash in return for 1 082 862 new shares  at a subscription price equal to ‚Ç¨ 11.78 per share (being the 30 day weighted average closing price of the Company‚Äôs shares admitted to trading on Euronext Brussels on the day prior to entering into the SFA).This capital increase in cash was completed on 18 March 2022. Following the issuance of these new shares  the share capital has increased from ‚Ç¨ 309 219 448.52 to ‚Ç¨ 321 975 562.88 and the total number of shares amounts to 34 546 431. Each of these shares gives one voting right at the general meeting of shareholders. This emphasises Francisco Partners‚Äô long-term commitment to Unifiedpost‚Äôs business model and growth strategy.Hybrid character of the financingThe financing scheme draws its hybrid character from the fact that the financing transaction entails both an equity participation of 3% of the share capital of Unifiedpost by the lender  and the fact that the loan bears a 3% cash interest and 8% interest paid in kind.2Breakdown of the credit and equity financingThe funds received at Closing Date amount to ‚Ç¨75 million (‚Ç¨62.3 million under the SFA and ‚Ç¨12.7 million by means of a contribution in cash in return for shares). They will be (or are) used as follows:‚Ç¨30 million to cover R&D expenditures;‚Ç¨20 million for refinancing of existing indebtedness;‚Ç¨25 million as a buffer for potential risks inherent to the Company‚Äôs business.The remaining ‚Ç¨25 million of the SFA remains undrawn without costs and remains available for future additional investments.DurationThe term is 5 years. After two years this can be redeemed without a prepayment penalty.StructureA Term Loan facility of ‚Ç¨ 75 million and a Capex facility of ‚Ç¨ 25 million entails a loan that must be used for capital expenditure.3 This Capex facility is available for 24 months from the closing date. There is no commitment fee applicable in case this facility is not drawn.Covenant detailsQuarterly liquidity test of a minimum of ‚Ç¨ 20 million  to be decreased to ‚Ç¨12.50 million when certain revenue thresholds are triggered4.Why hybrid financing?Unifiedpost believes that in order to achieve its goal  a hybrid financing is the preferred solution. Traditional financing was available  but not tailored to the current growth phase and financing needs of Unifiedpost. Francisco Partners is a partner who understands the Company‚Äôs goal and guarantees a high degree of contractual flexibility and solid financial foundations until Unifiedpost‚Äôs cash flow reaches break-even  as expected in the second half of 2023. This is another reason why the Company has chosen to bring hybrid financing forward so it can bridge this period.Unifiedpost was assisted by Nielen Schuman as debt advisor and Linklaters LLP.Financial Calendar 2022 12 August 2022 Publication H1 2022 Business Update 16 September 2022 Publication H1 2022 Financial Results 10 November 2022 Publication Q3 2022 Business UpdateAbout Unifiedpost GroupUnifiedpost is a leading cloud-based platform for SME business services built on ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù  ‚ÄúIdentity‚Äù and ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù.

6544,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-art-enters-the-metaverse-301568553.html,Artmarket.com: Art enters the Metaverse,PARIS  June 15  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Nothing will ever replace the unique experience of admiring an artwork in a museum  but that does not diminish the value of seeing art in books or on the internet. Sometimes museums have to close their doors for several da‚Ä¶,"thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department: ""Metaverses will give birth to the best‚Ä¶ and the most nebulous. Numerous fragments of this new dimension already exist revealing an astonishing potential for possible applications: while some Metaverses function as extensions to our very real world  others invent new universes governed by their own rules. The choices made by Facebook (Meta) and Sandbox are currently dominating the news  but many other forms of Metaverse are being constructed in different contexts  notably in the art world and around Artprice"".Diving into the digital age‚Ä¶Over the past ten years  virtual tours have gradually imposed themselves as an option in the art world. Today many museums  fairs  and auction houses offer virtual strolls through their exhibition spaces on smartphones  tablets  and computers.This alternative access to art allows amateurs and professionals alike to appreciate works with highly enriched content and it  therefore  represents a complementary way of discovering (or rediscovering) an exhibition that satisfies a growing need for flexibility. The extraordinary demand for NFTs has indeed demonstrated that flexibility is key to the modern consumption of art. The platforms that allow the exchange of these digital certificates are accessible day and night  from any point on the earth  provided there is an internet connection.Whereas virtual exhibition tours were originally created as photo-montages  new technologies now use 3D design software as well as Artificial Intelligence. The solutions developed  among others  by the Universal Art Museum  Genesis Penthouse or Spatial make it possible to ""hang"" an entire collection of artworks in a digital space with almost infinite scenographic freedom.https://www.the-uma.org/en/https://www.nftoasis.co/genesis-penthousehttps://spatial.io/Welcome to the ""other side""...If these ideas remain relatively obscure to the general public  many of the most important projects in the NFT sphere suggest the imminent arrival of their corresponding Metaverses. This is already the case for Yuga Labs with the launch of its ""Otherdeed for Otherside"".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcOyqZtZs8gAt the pinnacle of BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club) fame and backed by its prestigious community  Yuga Labs organized the first sale of land in its Metaverse called The Otherside. The immense enthusiasm for the BAYC project and a very attractive mint price ($305 APE ~ $6 000) pushed the Ethereum Blockchain beyond its limits of use: the 'gas' fees soared and a fair number of participants were unable to acquire a plot of land despite having paid substantial fees. The designers fortunately committed to compensating users who lost their way in the sale.The floor price for a piece of land currently stands at 2.55 ETH (~$2 500) while the last Ape sold at public auction fetched $3.4 million.https://opensea.io/collection/otherdeedhttps://www.artprice.com/artist/1011081/yuga-labs/lots/pasts/27/nftContemporary artist Takashi Murakami has announced that he wants to build a Metaverse which would be like the sum of all his projects murakamiflowers.kaikaikiki.com:""Normally  60 years old may indicate you are in the final stage of life  but as I said earlier  my artworks are designed so that their mechanism would start working after my death. So this is truly the start line for me.I tried to recreate in the digital world a scene where the foot of Japan's sacred mountain  Fuji  is in full bloom with cherry blossoms.

It also allows the generation of colocation revenues  embedded in the upgraded synergies.The Core Data Centre migration has also been timed in order to pave the way for the migration of the Borsa Italiana equity and derivatives markets onto the Euronext Optiq trading platform  expected in 2023.The new Core Data Centre is entirely powered by renewable energy  much of it self-produced through a large photovoltaic system and a hydroelectric unit.
