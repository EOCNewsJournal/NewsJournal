The Treasury Department has banned American money managers from buying any Russian debt or stocks in secondary markets on top of its existing embargo on new-issue purchases.On May 24  the Treasury Department announced it would no longer allow Russia to make debt payments owed to American bondholders  The Washington Post reported.Data by one of the world's largest financial securities transactions companies Euroclear shows that about $85 billion worth of securities held by foreign investors has been blocked.Russia has denounced America's decision  describing its actions as a default of the Western financial system  due to its failure to fulfill its financial obligations.Russia's Finance Ministry has said Moscow will continue to fulfill its state debt obligations  despite the tightening of external restrictions.The ban extends to all Russian debt and all Russian firms' shares are affected  not just those ones named in sanctions  according to a statement published on the Treasury's website on Monday.A former US sanctions official has said the United States is pushing Russia toward default by blocking debt payments  as Washington ups the ante in its economic warfare against Moscow over the conflict with Ukraine.Moscow has so far successfully managed to make its international bond payments despite the US-led sanctions that have hindered the process though.Russia has not defaulted on its external debt for more than 100 years. It has several billions of international bonds and last month made overdue bond payments to avoid default.Western countries have slapped unprecedented sanctions on Russia since President Vladimir Putin declared a military campaign against Ukraine on February 24.The Biden administration has imposed harsh economic and banking sanctions on Russia in response to Russia's military actions in Ukraine.US President Joe Biden said the sanctions would limit Russia's ability to do business in dollars  euros  pounds and yen.Biden claimed that the only other alternative to the sanctions would be to start a ""Third World War.""NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",negative,0.02,0.31,0.67,negative,0.01,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['US Wall Street banks', 'Russian debt', 'Report', 'largest financial securities transactions companies', 'Two US Wall Street banks', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'US President Joe Biden', 'former US sanctions official', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'Iran Press TV', 'Western financial system', 'The Biden administration', 'American money managers', 'overdue bond payments', 'client-related market-making activities', 'international bond payments', 'Third World War', 'The United States', ""Goldman Sachs' wind-down"", 'state debt obligations', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'The Treasury Department', 'The Washington Post', 'financial obligations', 'US Treasury', 'US investors', 'debt payments', 'American bondholders', 'international bonds', 'Western countries', 'foreign investors', 'Russian debt', 'external debt', 'economic warfare', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'market professionals', 'interested buyers', 'OFAC guidance', 'Russian entities', 'secondary markets', 'existing embargo', 'new-issue purchases', '$85 billion worth', 'Finance Ministry', 'external restrictions', 'Russian firms', 'several billions', 'military campaign', 'harsh economic', 'other alternative', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'economic sanctions', 'US-led sanctions', 'unprecedented sanctions', 'banking sanctions', 'military actions', 'Report', 'Tuesday', 'June', 'trades', 'ante', 'Moscow', 'conflict', 'Ukraine', 'pullout', 'Bloomberg', 'sellers', 'debts', 'Sources', 'Office', 'relation', 'statement', 'pretext', 'stocks', 'top', 'May', 'Data', 'Euroclear', 'decision', 'default', 'failure', 'tightening', 'shares', 'website', 'Monday', 'process', '100 years', 'February', 'response', 'ability', 'business', 'dollars', 'euros', 'pounds', 'yen', '02']",2022-06-15,2022-06-16,globalsecurity.org
6501,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-art-enters-the-metaverse-301568553.html,Artmarket.com: Art enters the Metaverse,PARIS  June 15  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Nothing will ever replace the unique experience of admiring an artwork in a museum  but that does not diminish the value of seeing art in books or on the internet. Sometimes museums have to close their doors for several da‚Ä¶,"thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department: ""Metaverses will give birth to the best‚Ä¶ and the most nebulous. Numerous fragments of this new dimension already exist revealing an astonishing potential for possible applications: while some Metaverses function as extensions to our very real world  others invent new universes governed by their own rules. The choices made by Facebook (Meta) and Sandbox are currently dominating the news  but many other forms of Metaverse are being constructed in different contexts  notably in the art world and around Artprice"".Diving into the digital age‚Ä¶Over the past ten years  virtual tours have gradually imposed themselves as an option in the art world. Today many museums  fairs  and auction houses offer virtual strolls through their exhibition spaces on smartphones  tablets  and computers.This alternative access to art allows amateurs and professionals alike to appreciate works with highly enriched content and it  therefore  represents a complementary way of discovering (or rediscovering) an exhibition that satisfies a growing need for flexibility. The extraordinary demand for NFTs has indeed demonstrated that flexibility is key to the modern consumption of art. The platforms that allow the exchange of these digital certificates are accessible day and night  from any point on the earth  provided there is an internet connection.Whereas virtual exhibition tours were originally created as photo-montages  new technologies now use 3D design software as well as Artificial Intelligence. The solutions developed  among others  by the Universal Art Museum  Genesis Penthouse or Spatial make it possible to ""hang"" an entire collection of artworks in a digital space with almost infinite scenographic freedom.https://www.the-uma.org/en/https://www.nftoasis.co/genesis-penthousehttps://spatial.io/Welcome to the ""other side""...If these ideas remain relatively obscure to the general public  many of the most important projects in the NFT sphere suggest the imminent arrival of their corresponding Metaverses. This is already the case for Yuga Labs with the launch of its ""Otherdeed for Otherside"".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcOyqZtZs8gAt the pinnacle of BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club) fame and backed by its prestigious community  Yuga Labs organized the first sale of land in its Metaverse called The Otherside. The immense enthusiasm for the BAYC project and a very attractive mint price ($305 APE ~ $6 000) pushed the Ethereum Blockchain beyond its limits of use: the 'gas' fees soared and a fair number of participants were unable to acquire a plot of land despite having paid substantial fees. The designers fortunately committed to compensating users who lost their way in the sale.The floor price for a piece of land currently stands at 2.55 ETH (~$2 500) while the last Ape sold at public auction fetched $3.4 million.https://opensea.io/collection/otherdeedhttps://www.artprice.com/artist/1011081/yuga-labs/lots/pasts/27/nftContemporary artist Takashi Murakami has announced that he wants to build a Metaverse which would be like the sum of all his projects murakamiflowers.kaikaikiki.com:""Normally  60 years old may indicate you are in the final stage of life  but as I said earlier  my artworks are designed so that their mechanism would start working after my death. So this is truly the start line for me.I tried to recreate in the digital world a scene where the foot of Japan's sacred mountain  Fuji  is in full bloom with cherry blossoms. I drew a delusional picture of a future virtual space where  along with M.F [Murakami Flowers]  my various titles and business endeavors will be reconstructed in the digital world.""Murakami's project may well be somewhat nebulous  but  like many other Metaverse projects  it will no doubt harbor several fascinating surprises.[Image : https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/06/artmarket-com-head-office-heart-of-the-abode-of-chaos-3d-immersion-360.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

It is intended for active immunization of at-risk populations to prevent carriage and symptomatic infection with COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic and potentially later for routine vaccination including addressing new variants. VLA2001 may also be suited for boosting  as repeat booster vaccinations have been shown to work well with whole virus inactivated vaccines. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva‚Äôs established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva‚Äôs licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO¬Æ. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B¬Æ vaccine. VLA2001‚Äôs manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).Story continuesAbout Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLa√´titia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  design  data read-outs  anticipated results and completion of clinical trials for VLA2001.

This key milestone has been completed on schedule in just 14 months  following the announcement of this strategic decision in April 2021 in the context of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition.Strategic rationale and value creationRelocating Euronext‚Äôs Core Data Centre from the UK to Italy  into a best-in-class and green data centre facility  was a strategic decision made in response to multiple factors  including the dynamic created by Brexit  and a strong rationale for relocating Euronext‚Äôs core European trading activities in the European Union. This move allows Euronext to fully control and directly manage its core IT infrastructure  as well as a key service to clients  colocation  which was previously outsourced. It also allows the generation of colocation revenues  embedded in the upgraded synergies.The Aruba Global Cloud Data Centre meets the highest quality standards (rating 4 certification)  provides the maximum level of safety and resilience  and is 100% powered by renewable energy  enabling Euronext to minimise its environmental impact.Story continuesEuronext now operates a state-of-the-art colocation facility available to both members and non-members  opening up new opportunities for development of services  and contributing as of today to a part of the planned delivery of the ‚Ç¨100 million run-rate annual EBITDA synergies related to the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition targeted for 2024.The Core Data Centre migration has been timed in order to pave the way for the migration of the Borsa Italiana equity and derivatives markets onto the Euronext Optiq¬Æ trading platform as soon as 2023.Powered by nature and clean energyThe migration to the new green Core Data Centre represents a key milestone in Euronext‚Äôs ‚ÄúFit for 1.5¬∞‚Äù commitment  part of its ESG strategy. Located in the Aruba Global Cloud Data Centre IT3‚Äôs certified and energy-efficient buildings  the new Core Data Centre is entirely powered by renewable energy  much of it self-produced through a large photovoltaic system and a hydroelectric unit. It also benefits from reduced power consumption thanks to very efficient cooling systems using geothermal and dynamic free cooling  and the use of cloud computing to reduce the number of servers. The new Core Data Centre allows Euronext to reduce its own carbon footprint  while also enabling its colocation clients to lower their environmental impact.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said: ‚ÄúThe migration of Euronext‚Äôs Core Data Centre to Italy  14 months after the closing of the Borsa Italiana Group acquisition  marks a milestone in bringing back to the European Union the Core Data Centre that handles 25% of European trading volumes. It is the first major achievement within Euronext‚Äôs Growth for Impact 2024 strategic plan  paving the way for the migration of the Italian cash equities and derivatives markets to the Euronext Optiq¬Æ trading technology as soon as 2023. This migration triggered the first business synergies related to the Borsa Italiana Group integration.

The key investment focus remains to look for solutions to the many unmet healthcare needs.The Life Sciences platform builds on the success and excellent returns generated by portfolio companies over four decades  including companies like Ablynx  where Gimv was a founding investor and Covagen  which was acquired by Johnson & Johnson. Current investments include Precirix  ImCheck  and ImmunOs  which recently raised $74 million in a Series B round led by Gimv.With this new platform  Gimv can further strengthen its capacity to invest larger tickets  with a typical initial investment of ‚Ç¨10-15 million per company. With the aim to almost double its current portfolio to around 20 companies  Gimv will retain its Series A and B investment strategy with a particular focus on drug development. Other investment areas will include medical technology  digital health  life science tools and agro-biotechnology.Story continuesBram Vanparys*  who was a Partner in the Gimv Healthcare Platform  has been appointed to lead the new team of seven dedicated life science venture capital professionals  which will be further expanded over the coming years.Koen Dejonckheere  Chief Executive Officer of Gimv  commented: ‚ÄúIn addition to our four existing investment platforms Sustainable Cities  Smart Industries  Consumer and Healthcare  our newly launched Life Sciences platform will enable us to build on the strong track record of Gimv in Life Sciences investments. Additionally  it will help strengthen our position at the forefront of the European life science ecosystem  which is acknowledged globally for its innovation and excellence in developing lifesaving therapeutics.‚ÄùBram Vanparys*  Managing Partner and Head of Life Sciences at Gimv  said: ‚ÄúThe launch of the new Life Sciences platform represents an exciting next step for Gimv in the sector.

Together with the rest of the team  I look forward to this new chapter for Gimv.‚ÄùBart Diels**  Managing Partner and Head of Healthcare at Gimv  added: ‚ÄúAfter the establishment of a strong portfolio within the Healthcare platform  it is the right time to launch a targeted Life Sciences platform. Having a VC centered Life Sciences platform separate from a PE centered Healthcare platform allows more focus for both teams while preserving potential synergies. We‚Äôre convinced that our specialised approach  backed by an experienced team  is one of the core differentiators of Gimv‚Äôs investment strategy. I am proud of what we have achieved together over the past years and have great confidence in Bram and the team to further strengthen our Life Sciences franchise.‚ÄùContacts:GimvBram Vanparys*E: Bram.Vanparys@gimv.comT: +32 3 290 21 00Consilium Strategic CommunicationsAmber Fennell  Lucy FeatherstoneE: Gimv@consilium-comms.comT: +44 (0)20 3709 5700Notes to EditorsAbout GimvGimv is a European investment company  listed on Euronext Brussels.

Sometimes museums have to close their doors for several da‚Ä¶,"thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department: ""Metaverses will give birth to the best‚Ä¶ and the most nebulous. Numerous fragments of this new dimension already exist revealing an astonishing potential for possible applications: while some Metaverses function as extensions to our very real world  others invent new universes governed by their own rules. The choices made by Facebook (Meta) and Sandbox are currently dominating the news  but many other forms of Metaverse are being constructed in different contexts  notably in the art world and around Artprice"".Diving into the digital age‚Ä¶Over the past ten years  virtual tours have gradually imposed themselves as an option in the art world. Today many museums  fairs  and auction houses offer virtual strolls through their exhibition spaces on smartphones  tablets  and computers.This alternative access to art allows amateurs and professionals alike to appreciate works with highly enriched content and it  therefore  represents a complementary way of discovering (or rediscovering) an exhibition that satisfies a growing need for flexibility. The extraordinary demand for NFTs has indeed demonstrated that flexibility is key to the modern consumption of art. The platforms that allow the exchange of these digital certificates are accessible day and night  from any point on the earth  provided there is an internet connection.Whereas virtual exhibition tours were originally created as photo-montages  new technologies now use 3D design software as well as Artificial Intelligence. The solutions developed  among others  by the Universal Art Museum  Genesis Penthouse or Spatial make it possible to ""hang"" an entire collection of artworks in a digital space with almost infinite scenographic freedom.https://www.the-uma.org/en/https://www.nftoasis.co/genesis-penthousehttps://spatial.io/Welcome to the ""other side""...If these ideas remain relatively obscure to the general public  many of the most important projects in the NFT sphere suggest the imminent arrival of their corresponding Metaverses. This is already the case for Yuga Labs with the launch of its ""Otherdeed for Otherside"".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcOyqZtZs8gAt the pinnacle of BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club) fame and backed by its prestigious community  Yuga Labs organized the first sale of land in its Metaverse called The Otherside. The immense enthusiasm for the BAYC project and a very attractive mint price ($305 APE ~ $6 000) pushed the Ethereum Blockchain beyond its limits of use: the 'gas' fees soared and a fair number of participants were unable to acquire a plot of land despite having paid substantial fees. The designers fortunately committed to compensating users who lost their way in the sale.The floor price for a piece of land currently stands at 2.55 ETH (~$2 500) while the last Ape sold at public auction fetched $3.4 million.https://opensea.io/collection/otherdeedhttps://www.artprice.com/artist/1011081/yuga-labs/lots/pasts/27/nftContemporary artist Takashi Murakami has announced that he wants to build a Metaverse which would be like the sum of all his projects murakamiflowers.kaikaikiki.com:""Normally  60 years old may indicate you are in the final stage of life  but as I said earlier  my artworks are designed so that their mechanism would start working after my death. So this is truly the start line for me.I tried to recreate in the digital world a scene where the foot of Japan's sacred mountain  Fuji  is in full bloom with cherry blossoms. I drew a delusional picture of a future virtual space where  along with M.F [Murakami Flowers]  my various titles and business endeavors will be reconstructed in the digital world.""Murakami's project may well be somewhat nebulous  but  like many other Metaverse projects  it will no doubt harbor several fascinating surprises.[Image : https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/06/artmarket-com-head-office-heart-of-the-abode-of-chaos-3d-immersion-360.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

At Skolem  we are firm believers that DeFi will change our world over the next decade  and we are committed to increasing access to this important market by developing a scalable platform that can safely provide an entry point "" said JP Smith  Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Skolem. ""This fundraise underscores our partners' confidence in Skolem's platform and the much-needed reliability it offers institutions to help them and DeFi markets flourish.""""Skolem is a zero to one solution for institutional access to DeFi markets. The institutional DeFi stack requires security  execution  risk management  accounting  and compliance "" added Will Nuelle  Principal Investments at Galaxy Digital.

We are thrilled to support Skolem as they make DeFi access secure  convenient  and reliable.""""There is a clear and loud need from institutional investors for a solution like Skolem  which enables secure enterprise-grade access to the DeFi markets "" said Adam Carson  crypto lead at Point72 Ventures.

Moreover  it is seeking to develop a fundamentally different approach with the aim to defragment tech listings spread across national markets to give them a European profile and offer a sector-wide view to investors "" said Andrew Stanford  Executive Director of Corporate Equities at Allerton Busan Group.Neuer Markt  a unique tech segment on Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt  was established in 1997 as Europe's answer to Nasdaq but the dot-com bubble burst just five years later  and the market collapsed.Story continuesEfforts by the European Union to deepen its capital market have intensified after the United Kingdom left the EU and started to draw more listings to its London Exchange in effort to compete with the Amsterdam exchange run by Euronext.""Today  the European tech ecosystem is alive and kicking  with a growing number of pioneering SMEs and an ever-expanding community of investors emerging from investment firms just like our own.

Combining JCDecaux's premium airport inventory with VIOOH's programmatic capabilities will enable brands to create highly targeted  flexible and measurable DOOH campaigns across Heathrow Airport. This offering also enables more brands to tap into the airport audience - who have a high dwell time and are ready to spend - making this audience extremely desirable from a programmatic perspective due to these highly sought after audience segments.""Jean-Fran√ßois Decaux  Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: ‚ÄúAs travel opens up again  the airport continues to define prestige and luxury  underlining the importance of Heathrow as a key partner and as an environment for our international advertising clients and their agencies.

During the event  it will present its new medium-term roadmap and unveil its upgraded 2022 financial targets as well as its 2022-2025 ambitions.After undergoing a profound transformation over the past five years that has enhanced the Group‚Äôs resilience  Rexel is now well positioned for a new phase of profitable growth  driven both by further optimization of its core model and the development of a leadership position on topics shaping the future of the industry: ESG  energy transition solutions and advanced services. These are encapsulated in a new company-wide plan called Power Up 2025 and captured in robust medium-term financial and environmental targets.Guillaume Texier  CEO of Rexel  declared: ‚ÄúRexel is poised today to power up its profitable growth story. The combination of a historical acceleration of electrification  the increasing importance of scale and services and the benefits of Rexel‚Äôs deep transformation over the past five years offers a unique window of opportunity for Rexel to step up its performance. By unlocking further value in our core model and becoming a leader in ESG  energy transition solutions and services  Rexel  with the support of its highly committed teams  is set to deliver higher organic growth and enhanced profitability over the medium-term and will also create further value for its shareholders through disciplined bolt-on acquisitions and a share buyback program.‚ÄùRobust financial targets:2022 guidance upgrade: Rexel is raising its 2022 objectives  following a better-than-expected start to the year in all geographies and higher inflation  in an environment that remains uncertain. Same-day sales growth of between 7% and 9% (vs 4% to 6% previously)Adjusted EBITA margin of c. 6.7% including 50bps of positive one-off effects (vs above 6% previously)Free cash-flow conversion above 60% 2022-2025 four-year targets: Robust medium-term objectives Same-day sales growth of c. 4%-7% on a Compound Annual Growth Rate basisAdjusted EBITA margin of between 6.5% and 7% in 2025A well-balanced capital allocation with: Capex to sales of c. 0.9% over the period A yearly payout to shareholders of at least 40% of recurring net income Bolt-on acquisitions adding up to ‚Ç¨2 billion in sales over the period Share buyback of around ‚Ç¨400m over the periodAn indebtedness ratio of around 2xMore ambitious ESG targetsStory continuesThe Group‚Äôs Scopes 1 and 2 targets are upgraded to a 60% reduction in CO 2 emissions of our operations (vs. 2016) from -35% in absolute terms.The Scope 3 target is raised to a 60% reduction in CO 2 emissions from the use of products sold (vs. 2016) from -45% in intensity terms (equivalent to an upwards revision of our guidance to -45% from -31% in absolute terms).These targets will be achieved by capitalizing on the following building blocks:Building on a solid platform: Thanks to the digitalization of its business  an enhanced customer mix  a streamlined portfolio and a turnaround of operations in under-performing countries  Rexel is now a different company today from what it was five years ago. It is now more profitable and more resilient  with a greater ability to generate cash flow and a strengthened balance sheet that provides it with firepower to fuel growth. This upgraded business profile allowed Rexel to deliver its mid-term targets in 2021  one year ahead of plan  and constitutes a solid platform to drive further growth.A historical window of opportunity: The planets are aligned to offer a unique window of opportunity to support Rexel‚Äôs growth in the coming years  and the Group should benefit from a combination of market  industry and Rexel-specific factors. Sustainability priorities  notably Net Zero agendas  and rising energy concerns will drive a major acceleration in electrification needs. In this new environment  scale  supply chain excellence and strong supplier relationships should be a major differentiating factor for Rexel  and the Group‚Äôs transformation allows it to seize these new opportunities to accelerate growth  leveraging its processes  tools and best-practice sharing.Unlocking value in our core model: Rexel‚Äôs core model has been significantly strengthened but still offers significant upside potential  notably through supply chain excellence and a further ramp-up in digital. As part of its omnichannel approach  the Group has upgraded its logistics capabilities to address all client segments with excellence  notably through same-day delivery  and has developed innovative supply chain models to help overcome environmental constraints and labor scarcity  with 24/7 solutions such as lockers and automated branches. Rexel aims to triple the number of automated distribution centers by 2025 from 6 today. Rexel will also take digitalization to the next level  rolling out initiatives such as Sales alerts  Next Best Offer  Assortment Optimization and AI-enhanced pricing tools to an increasing number of countries. The share of digital in total sales should double to 50% by 2027 from 24% in 2021.Leadership in ESG  energy transition solutions and services: Rexel has a pivotal role to play across the value chain  from promoting ESG among its suppliers to increasing ESG services such as carbon trackers and selling a growing number of Green products. Rexel  which is already highly rated for ESG by leading agencies and is the only distributor in its segment to have targets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative  is strongly upgrading its CO 2 roadmap to reach its Net Zero ambitions in 2030. Rexel sees major opportunities to accelerate sales in segments related to the energy transition  such as HVAC  photovoltaic  Electric Vehicles and Industrial Automation. In addition to the strong commitment on environmental matters  we have also introduced ESG criteria in our Long-Term Incentive Plan on ESG Social and Governance pillars such as Diversity  Health & Safety and Ethics & compliance. Finally  Rexel has the ambition to significantly expand new services by 2025  notably by doubling revenue on this segment.The event will start at 1 PM CEST and will be broadcasted live at https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/mdoqw7qaThe presentation will be available at 12.30pm on our website www.rexel.com/en.To participate in the Q&A session  please dial in:France : +33 1 70 95 03 46 (code: 5657517)International: +44 (0) 20 7192 8338 (code: 5657517)ABOUT REXEL GROUPRexel  worldwide expert in the multichannel professional distribution of products and services for the energy world  addresses three main markets: residential  commercial  and industrial.

Cables accounted for approximately 17% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group‚Äôs sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group‚Äôs total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

The two companies aim to develop floating wind steel SEMI substructures that accelerates technology development for floating offshore wind  ensures cost reductions and develops local value opportunities.The collaboration builds on the two companies‚Äô joint ambition to drive industrialization of floating offshore wind. By teaming up at an early design phase of a floating wind farm project  the two parties seek to unlock value from integration and maximum use of fabrication capacities.Laure Mandrou  Senior Vice President Carbon-Free Solutions of Technip Energies  said ‚ÄúWe believe partnering is an essential step to reach net-zero. We are proud to enter this strategic partnership with Equinor  a long-lasting client with which we share a common vision and commitment: create a low-carbon future. This agreement extends our recent collaboration in the Floating Offshore Wind field  creating unique synergies by combining Technip Energies‚Äô and Equinor‚Äôs respective experiences in the development of core technologies and the delivery of groundbreaking projects.‚ÄùBeate Myking  Senior Vice President for Renewables Solutions in Equinor  commented: ‚ÄúWe are excited about our collaboration with Technip Energies  which allows us to further leverage and develop our floating toolbox to customize locally adapted industrial solutions for future floating offshore wind projects.‚ÄùGrowth in renewables is needed to succeed with the energy transition. A large part of this growth will come from floating wind as approximately 80 percent of the wind resources offshore are in deep waters that require a floating wind turbine solution. Even though costs have come down substantially  there is still a way to go for the floating technology to reach commerciality. From building the world first floating turbine  Hywind Demo  to the world first floating wind farm  Hywind Scotland  Equinor reduced the cost per megawatt by 70 percent. The strategic collaboration between Technip Energies and Equinor will contribute to industrializing floating offshore wind solutions.About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  with leadership positions in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)  hydrogen and ethylene as well as growing market positions in blue and green hydrogen  sustainable chemistry and CO 2 management.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Syst√®mes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group‚Äôs actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù section 1.9 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document (‚ÄòDocument d'enregistrement universel‚Äô) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2022  available on the Group‚Äôs website www.3ds.com .In particular  please refer to the risk factor ‚ÄúUncertain Global Economic Environment‚Äù in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:‚ÄúIn light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô solutions may represent a large portion of a customer‚Äôs investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within automotive  aerospace or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers‚Äô revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Syst√®mes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô diversification efforts in new industries;current inflation forecasts  as well as uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of this trend  could adversely affect the financial condition of Dassault Syst√®mes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô products ‚Äì already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers ‚Äì could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises ‚Äì health and geopolitical crises in particular ‚Äì could have consequences for the health and safety of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô employees. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing capabilities of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Syst√®mes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Syst√®mes‚Äô products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company‚Äôs business results.‚ÄùThe Group‚Äôs 2020-2024 non-IFRS EPS objective and key underlying financial estimates are based upon the following principal exchange rates over this timeframe: 1) an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.20 per ‚Ç¨1.00; 2) an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY125.0 to ‚Ç¨1.00 before hedging; as well as 3) a continuation of current exchange rates for other major currencies in which it transacts business. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group‚Äôs results of operations may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations. It is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for IFRS measurements. The supplemental non-IFRS financial information should be read only in conjunction with the Company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.

Check out why I think Raiffeisen's Q1 results are good.,"Anna Linda Knoll/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesFollowing our deep-dive analysis of the Russian impact on the European banks  we clearly emphasized Raiffeisen Bank International AG's implications (OTCPK:RAIFF). Just as a reminder  Russia has been for years the largest cash cow for the bank and the biggest single market in Eastern Europe. In the previous year alone  the subsidiary bank contributed around a third to the consolidated profit of ‚Ç¨1.4 billion. With Moscow's war of aggression against Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by the West  these days seem to be over. A red line under the Russia chapter has now become very likely. ""We are consistently pushing ahead with the evaluation of our strategic options  which also include an orderly withdrawal"" said the bank boss Johann Strobl interviewed by a local media agency.Raiffeisen Russia exposureSource: Raiffeisen Bank Q1 ResultsIn terms of its credit volume in Russia  the major bank in Vienna currently recorded a decline from ‚Ç¨11.6 billion (end of 2021) to ‚Ç¨10.6 billion. However  this amount may have increased again due to the recent stabilization of the ruble. Meanwhile  RBI remains committed to maintaining banking operations in Ukraine despite the war. ""Despite the extremely difficult framework conditions  our bank in Ukraine never had to interrupt its operations"" reported RBI CEO. ""As the market leader in the agricultural sector  it has been instrumental in financing the grain sector"" that is important for the country and for the whole world. However  Raiffeisen in Ukraine faced a loss of ‚Ç¨41 million in the first quarter (while the business in neighboring Belarus posted a profit of ‚Ç¨23 million).Looking at the overall results  the RBI Group  which is active in all of Eastern Europe in addition to Austria and has around 1 800 branches and almost 18 million customers  was able to significantly increase its Q1 earnings. At ‚Ç¨442 million  net profit was more than twice as high as in the same period of the previous year - thanks to growth in net interest and commission income and trading income.Nevertheless  the bank was forced to form higher provisions (impairments on financial assets)  primarily due to the ongoing war. In total  these had more than quadrupled from ‚Ç¨76 to ‚Ç¨319 million. At the same time  asset write-downs were ‚Ç¨209 million. This has pushed the CET1 capital ratio  which bank supervisors consider to be the most important indicator of equity capital  down - from 13.1 to 12.3% in a year-on-year comparison. However  CET stated that  ""it will strengthen again in the course of the year and will be very close to our target rate of around 13 percent towards the end of the year.""ConclusionDespite rising risk costs  the RBI boss sees his company's return on equity this year in the range of 8 to 10%. However  due to the war  the outlook for the year as a whole has been adjusted. For the above reason  we confirm our neutral rating even in considering downside risks  which are equally important. We prefer other names in the banking & diversified financial sector  such as Unicredit (OTCPK:UNCFF) and Euronext (OTCPK:EUXTF).Raiffeisen GuidanceSource: Raiffeisen Bank Q1 Results",positive,0.96,0.02,0.02,mixed,0.13,0.18,0.69,True,English,"['Eastern Europe Impact', 'Good Results', 'Raiffeisen', 'OTCMKTS', 'Raiffeisen Bank International AG', 'bank boss Johann Strobl', 'Raiffeisen Russia exposure Source', 'Raiffeisen Bank Q1 Results', 'Raiffeisen Guidance Source', 'Anna Linda Knoll', 'largest cash cow', 'local media agency', 'difficult framework conditions', 'rising risk costs', 'biggest single market', 'CET1 capital ratio', 'diversified financial sector', 'overall results', 'Q1 earnings', 'RBI boss', 'subsidiary bank', 'major bank', 'market leader', 'financial assets', 'bank supervisors', 'agricultural sector', 'grain sector', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'deep-dive analysis', 'Russian impact', 'European banks', 'Eastern Europe', 'red line', 'Russia chapter', 'strategic options', 'orderly withdrawal', 'credit volume', 'recent stabilization', 'first quarter', 'neighboring Belarus', '18 million customers', 'same period', 'net interest', 'commission income', 'trading income', 'higher provisions', 'same time', 'asset write-downs', 'important indicator', 'equity capital', 'target rate', 'neutral rating', 'downside risks', 'other names', 'RBI CEO', 'RBI Group', 'consolidated profit', 'net profit', 'previous year', 'year comparison', 'ongoing war', 'banking operations', 'implications', 'OTCPK', 'reminder', 'years', 'Moscow', 'aggression', 'Ukraine', 'sanctions', 'West', 'days', 'evaluation', 'terms', 'Vienna', 'decline', 'amount', 'ruble', 'country', 'world', 'loss', 'business', 'addition', 'Austria', '1,800 branches', 'growth', 'impairments', 'total', 'course', '13 percent', 'end', 'Conclusion', 'company', 'return', 'range', 'outlook', 'reason', 'Unicredit', 'UNCFF', 'Euronext', 'EUXTF']",2022-06-16,2022-06-16,seekingalpha.com
