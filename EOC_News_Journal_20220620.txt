(NYSE: PFE) today announced that they have entered into an Equity Subscription Agreement and have updated the term…,"SAINT-HERBLAIN  France & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that they have entered into an Equity Subscription Agreement and have updated the terms of their Collaboration and License Agreement for Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15. As previously announced on April 26  2022  Pfizer plans to initiate the Phase 3 study of VLA15 in the third quarter of 2022.As part of the Equity Subscription Agreement  Pfizer will invest €90.5 ($95) million in Valneva  representing 8.1% of Valneva’s share capital at a price of €9.49 per share  through a reserved capital increase to further support the strategic Lyme partnership between the two companies. The per share purchase price was determined based on the average closing price of the Company’s Shares on Euronext Paris during the 10 trading days preceding the date of the Equity Subscription Agreement. The equity investment is due to close on June 22  2022. Valneva is planning to use the proceeds from Pfizer’s equity investment to support its Phase 3 development contribution to the Lyme disease program.In addition  Valneva and Pfizer updated the terms of their collaboration and license agreement which they announced on April 30  20201. Valneva will now fund 40% of the remaining shared development costs compared to 30% in the initial agreement. Pfizer will pay Valneva tiered royalties ranging from 14% to 22%  compared to royalties starting at 19% in the initial agreement. In addition  the royalties will be complemented by up to $100 million in milestones payable to Valneva based on cumulative sales. Other development and early commercialization milestones are unchanged  of which $168 million remain  including a $25 million payment to Valneva upon Pfizer’s initiation of the Phase 3 study.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented “ Pfizer’s investment in Valneva highlights the quality of the work that we’ve done together over the past two years and is a strong recognition of Valneva’s vaccine expertise. This subscription agreement will contribute to our investment in the Phase 3 study while limiting the impact on our cash position. Lyme disease is spreading and represents a high unmet medical need which impacts the lives of millions of people in the Northern Hemisphere. We are looking forward to further investigating our VLA15 candidate in Phase 3  which will take us a step closer to potentially help protect both adults and children from this devastating disease.”“ Lyme disease continues to place a heavy burden on countries in North America and Europe  with an estimated 600 000 cases each year across both regions ” said Kathrin U. Jansen  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. “ As the geographic footprint of Lyme disease widens  the medical need for vaccination becomes even more imperative. We are excited to continue partnering with Valneva on the development of VLA15 and look forward to working together to progress the program with the goal of bringing forward a vaccine that could help prevent this debilitating disease.”Pending successful initiation and completion of the planned Phase 3 study for VLA15  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2025.DilutionThe 9 549 761 new ordinary shares to be issued to Pfizer pursuant to the Equity Subscription Agreement will represent a dilution of approximately 8.1% of the share capital of the Company. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Valneva’s capital before this capital increase will now hold a stake of 0.919%.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immunogenicity and safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 20172. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA151.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes (aka deer or blacklegged) ticks3. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere and according to a study published on June 13  2022 in BMJ Global Health  Lyme disease has likely infected 14.5% of the world’s population4. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system. The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens5.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

This report describes the Group’s consistent progress and a range of initiatives to engage with environmental  social and governance (ESG) frameworks and practices in the different markets in which it operates. In addition  it sets out new objectives focused on achieving a mid-term energy transition. This is the first independent report from Rubis Terminal  as a continuation of the reports released in the past years together with Rubis SCA. The standalone view of Rubis Terminal commitments and progress is a natural evolution  given Rubis Terminal’ growth  notably after the integration of TEPSA and the increasing importance of sustainability for all stakeholders.In 2021  more than 50% of Rubis Terminal's € 237m storage revenues including Turkey have been generated by the fertilizer  biofuels  vegetable oils and chemical products segments.""Although historically Rubis Terminal has focused on the storage  shipping and transportation of fossil fuel products to the end consumer  in recent years there has been an increased effort to diversify the product mix and reduce the proportion of fossil fuels. As a result  the proportion of storage revenues derived from fossil fuels has been reduced from 70% in 2016 to 48% in 2021 "" stated Bruno Hayem  CEO of Rubis Terminal.The report sets out in detail the different approaches being applied  and the commitment adopted in each of Rubis Terminal business lines:Chemicals: Using storage know-how to support our customers' transition.Biofuel products: Leveraging Rubis Terminal's expertise in biofuel feedstock management.Fuel products: Adapting products for the low-emission zone.Agri-food: Develop feedstock for agri-food products and downstream capabilities  such as the blending of fertilizers.In addition  Rubis Terminal periodically evaluates 45 KPIs that serve as a reference to monitor its progress in terms of decarbonization  safety  diversity and compliance  among others.You can access the report and consult the information HERE.About Rubis Terminal:Rubis Terminal is a leading independent storage player for petroleum  chemical and agri-food products in Europe.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced that they have entered into an Equity Subscription Agreement and have updated the terms of their Collaboration and License Agreement for Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15. As previously announced on April 26  2022  Pfizer plans to initiate the Phase 3 study of VLA15 in the third quarter of 2022.As part of the Equity Subscription Agreement  Pfizer will invest €90.5 ($95) million in Valneva  representing 8.1% of Valneva’s share capital at a price of €9.49 per share  through a reserved capital increase to further support the strategic Lyme partnership between the two companies. The per share purchase price was determined based on the average closing price of the Company’s shares on Euronext Paris during the 10 trading days preceding the date of the Equity Subscription Agreement. The equity investment is due to close on June 22  2022. Valneva is planning to use the proceeds from Pfizer’s equity investment to support its Phase 3 development contribution to the Lyme disease program.In addition  Valneva and Pfizer updated the terms of their collaboration and license agreement which they announced on April 30  20201. Valneva will now fund 40% of the remaining shared development costs compared to 30% in the initial agreement. Pfizer will pay Valneva tiered royalties ranging from 14% to 22%  compared to royalties starting at 19% in the initial agreement. In addition  the royalties will be complemented by up to $100 million in milestones payable to Valneva based on cumulative sales. Other development and early commercialization milestones are unchanged  of which $168 million remain  including a $25 million payment to Valneva upon Pfizer’s initiation of the Phase 3 study.Story continuesThomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented “Pfizer’s investment in Valneva highlights the quality of the work that we’ve done together over the past two years and is a strong recognition of Valneva’s vaccine expertise. This subscription agreement will contribute to our investment in the Phase 3 study while limiting the impact on our cash position. Lyme disease is spreading and represents a high unmet medical need which impacts the lives of millions of people in the Northern Hemisphere. We are looking forward to further investigating our VLA15 candidate in Phase 3  which will take us a step closer to potentially help protect both adults and children from this devastating disease.”“Lyme disease continues to place a heavy burden on countries in North America and Europe  with an estimated 600 000 cases each year across both regions ” said Kathrin U. Jansen  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. “As the geographic footprint of Lyme disease widens  the medical need for vaccination becomes even more imperative. We are excited to continue partnering with Valneva on the development of VLA15 and look forward to working together to progress the program with the goal of bringing forward a vaccine that could help prevent this debilitating disease.”Pending successful initiation and completion of the planned Phase 3 study for VLA15  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2025.DilutionThe 9 549 761 new ordinary shares to be issued to Pfizer pursuant to the Equity Subscription Agreement will represent a dilution of approximately 8.1% of the share capital of the Company. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Valneva’s capital before this capital increase will now hold a stake of 0.919%.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immunogenicity and safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 20172. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA151.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes (aka deer or blacklegged) ticks3. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere and according to a study published on June 13  2022 in BMJ Global Health  Lyme disease has likely infected 14.5% of the world’s population4. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system. The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens5.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Stellantis recently invested a total of €33 million in two of its global testing facilities to support the Company's long-term strategy to achieve best-in-class electric vehicle (EV) performance and master the highest level of autonomous driving technology while ensuring safe and reliable technology for its customers.These investments  among other R&D Capex  expand Stellantis’ global capability to engineer the future of mobility  accelerate its transformation into a sustainable mobility tech company and propel the Company toward the goals of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  notably a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2021 levels by 2030 and carbon net zero emissions by 2038.The recent enhancements include:Orbassano Safety Center   near Turin  Italy  is fully integrated with digital engineering processes and significantly upgraded to host four test tracks with four impact points and capabilities for full testing of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and automated driving technology for passenger cars  trucks  and light commercial vehicles.Wind Tunnel in Auburn Hills  Michigan  U.S.  being scaled up with the addition of moving ground plane technology  simulating on-road travel and providing more accurate aerodynamics measurement of vehicles. Reducing wind drag benefits the driving range of BEVs.Story continues""Our world-class tech hubs across the globe are doing the work today that will make tomorrow's Stellantis vehicles industry leaders in capability  performance and safety "" said Harald Wester  Stellantis Chief Engineering Officer. ""Our engineering community is fueled by talent  diversity and global reach  and we are intensely working with the other global functions  as our Monozokuri peers  to energize the core of our technological transformation. It gives us a comprehensive view of the challenges and enables us to consider and refine a full menu of mobility solutions that will put us in the front row of the race to innovate and improve.""Putting Electric Vehicles and Autonomous Driving to the TestKey goals of the Stellantis Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan include reaching 100% of passenger car BEV sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States by 2030.The €5 million in upgrades for the Orbassano Safety Center give it the capability to test all types of electrified vehicles - mild hybrid  plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles. The facility currently runs at least two crash tests a day and is on track to test more than 275 electrified vehicles this year. Vehicles tested at Orbassano can be certified to meet more than 175 international safety and technological standards.The impact zone of the test tracks is fitted with a Messring movable block for front and side-impact tests  and Orbassano runs some of the industry's most-challenging tests including the passenger-side small overlap test being used by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.Orbassano's test tracks include a computer-driven camera positioning system with 13 moveable outboard camera locations over the impact point. In addition  the tracks include the capability for underbody high-speed video  while up to five cameras can be mounted on board the test vehicle.All these views  plus the instrumented data  provide Stellantis engineers with invaluable data for evaluating current and future vehicle designs. Additionally  the data is shared with Stellantis facilities around the world  including the additional safety testing centers in Belchamp  France; Chelsea  Michigan  U.S.; and Betim  Brazil  to refine digital vehicle development models.This state-of-the-art facility is fully integrated with Stellantis’ safety digital engineering process  allowing the most efficient vehicle development and virtually covering all possible field crash scenarios.The new tracks are ready to accommodate future test modes related to the introduction of automated driving functions on all types of vehicles.Orbassano's arsenal includes static and dynamic test fixtures for factors such as pedestrian impact  roof crush and rollover  and test sleds to evaluate seating and vehicle interiors. Seat and interior testing become more critical as the adoption of future automated driving technologies hold the potential for new cabin seating configurations.A Better BreezeAerodynamic efficiency is a crucial difference-maker in the drive to optimize the distances electrified vehicles can travel on a single charge. That requires simulating the real driving world as accurately as possible.At the Stellantis wind tunnel complex in Auburn Hills  Michigan  construction is in progress to install moving ground plane technology (rolling road)  which simulates on-road travel while allowing test vehicles to remain static. Stellantis is investing $29.5 million in the project.Belts enable wheel movement at all four corners of the vehicle while a fifth belt runs beneath the vehicle as if it were rolling over a roadway. Moving ground plane technology also enables measurement of ventilation drag  which is the resistance associated exclusively with wheels and tires in motion. It accounts for up to 10 percent of total  real-world aerodynamic drag.The existing aerodynamic test facility in Auburn Hills generates wind speeds up to 140 mph. The moving ground plane installation  part of an estimated $85 million commitment included in the Company's 2019 contract with the United Auto Workers  is scheduled to become operational in 2024.The added capability will complement the world-class aero-acoustic wind tunnel in Auburn Hills as part of a global network of leading-edge centers also equipped with moving ground plane technology  including two facilities in Europe.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced that they have entered into an Equity Subscription Agreement and have updated the terms of their Collaboration and License Agreement for Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15. As previously announced on April 26  2022  Pfizer plans to initiate the Phase 3 study of VLA15 in the third quarter of 2022.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220619005037/en/As part of the Equity Subscription Agreement  Pfizer will invest €90.5 ($95) million in Valneva  representing 8.1% of Valneva’s share capital at a price of €9.49 per share  through a reserved capital increase to further support the strategic Lyme partnership between the two companies. The per share purchase price was determined based on the average closing price of the Company’s Shares on Euronext Paris during the 10 trading days preceding the date of the Equity Subscription Agreement. The equity investment is due to close on June 22  2022. Valneva is planning to use the proceeds from Pfizer’s equity investment to support its Phase 3 development contribution to the Lyme disease program.In addition  Valneva and Pfizer updated the terms of their collaboration and license agreement which they announced on April 30  20201. Valneva will now fund 40% of the remaining shared development costs compared to 30% in the initial agreement. Pfizer will pay Valneva tiered royalties ranging from 14% to 22%  compared to royalties starting at 19% in the initial agreement. In addition  the royalties will be complemented by up to $100 million in milestones payable to Valneva based on cumulative sales. Other development and early commercialization milestones are unchanged  of which $168 million remain  including a $25 million payment to Valneva upon Pfizer’s initiation of the Phase 3 study.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented “Pfizer’s investment in Valneva highlights the quality of the work that we’ve done together over the past two years and is a strong recognition of Valneva’s vaccine expertise. This subscription agreement will contribute to our investment in the Phase 3 study while limiting the impact on our cash position. Lyme disease is spreading and represents a high unmet medical need which impacts the lives of millions of people in the Northern Hemisphere. We are looking forward to further investigating our VLA15 candidate in Phase 3  which will take us a step closer to potentially help protect both adults and children from this devastating disease.”“Lyme disease continues to place a heavy burden on countries in North America and Europe  with an estimated 600 000 cases each year across both regions ” said Kathrin U. Jansen  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. “As the geographic footprint of Lyme disease widens  the medical need for vaccination becomes even more imperative.We are excited to continue partnering with Valneva on the development of VLA15 and look forward to working together to progress the program with the goal of bringing forward a vaccine that could help prevent this debilitating disease.”Pending successful initiation and completion of the planned Phase 3 study for VLA15  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2025.DilutionThe 9 549 761 new ordinary shares to be issued to Pfizer pursuant to the Equity Subscription Agreement will represent a dilution of approximately 8.1% of the share capital of the Company. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Valneva’s capital before this capital increase will now hold a stake of 0.919%.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferisensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immunogenicity and safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 20172. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA151.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borreliaburgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes (aka deer or blacklegged) ticks3. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere and according to a study published on June 13  2022 in BMJ Global Health  Lyme disease has likely infected 14.5% of the world’s population4. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.
