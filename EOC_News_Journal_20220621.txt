(NYSE: PFE) today announced that they have entered into an Equity Subscription Agreement and have updated the term‚Ä¶,"SAINT-HERBLAIN  France & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that they have entered into an Equity Subscription Agreement and have updated the terms of their Collaboration and License Agreement for Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15. As previously announced on April 26  2022  Pfizer plans to initiate the Phase 3 study of VLA15 in the third quarter of 2022.As part of the Equity Subscription Agreement  Pfizer will invest ‚Ç¨90.5 ($95) million in Valneva  representing 8.1% of Valneva‚Äôs share capital at a price of ‚Ç¨9.49 per share  through a reserved capital increase to further support the strategic Lyme partnership between the two companies. The per share purchase price was determined based on the average closing price of the Company‚Äôs Shares on Euronext Paris during the 10 trading days preceding the date of the Equity Subscription Agreement. The equity investment is due to close on June 22  2022. Valneva is planning to use the proceeds from Pfizer‚Äôs equity investment to support its Phase 3 development contribution to the Lyme disease program.In addition  Valneva and Pfizer updated the terms of their collaboration and license agreement which they announced on April 30  20201. Valneva will now fund 40% of the remaining shared development costs compared to 30% in the initial agreement. Pfizer will pay Valneva tiered royalties ranging from 14% to 22%  compared to royalties starting at 19% in the initial agreement. In addition  the royalties will be complemented by up to $100 million in milestones payable to Valneva based on cumulative sales. Other development and early commercialization milestones are unchanged  of which $168 million remain  including a $25 million payment to Valneva upon Pfizer‚Äôs initiation of the Phase 3 study.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented ‚Äú Pfizer‚Äôs investment in Valneva highlights the quality of the work that we‚Äôve done together over the past two years and is a strong recognition of Valneva‚Äôs vaccine expertise. This subscription agreement will contribute to our investment in the Phase 3 study while limiting the impact on our cash position. Lyme disease is spreading and represents a high unmet medical need which impacts the lives of millions of people in the Northern Hemisphere. We are looking forward to further investigating our VLA15 candidate in Phase 3  which will take us a step closer to potentially help protect both adults and children from this devastating disease.‚Äù‚Äú Lyme disease continues to place a heavy burden on countries in North America and Europe  with an estimated 600 000 cases each year across both regions ‚Äù said Kathrin U. Jansen  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. ‚Äú As the geographic footprint of Lyme disease widens  the medical need for vaccination becomes even more imperative. We are excited to continue partnering with Valneva on the development of VLA15 and look forward to working together to progress the program with the goal of bringing forward a vaccine that could help prevent this debilitating disease.‚ÄùPending successful initiation and completion of the planned Phase 3 study for VLA15  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2025.DilutionThe 9 549 761 new ordinary shares to be issued to Pfizer pursuant to the Equity Subscription Agreement will represent a dilution of approximately 8.1% of the share capital of the Company. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Valneva‚Äôs capital before this capital increase will now hold a stake of 0.919%.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium‚Äôs ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immunogenicity and safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 20172. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA151.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes (aka deer or blacklegged) ticks3. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere and according to a study published on June 13  2022 in BMJ Global Health  Lyme disease has likely infected 14.5% of the world‚Äôs population4. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system. The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens5.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients‚Äô LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

This report describes the Group‚Äôs consistent progress and a range of initiatives to engage with environmental  social and governance (ESG) frameworks and practices in the different markets in which it operates. In addition  it sets out new objectives focused on achieving a mid-term energy transition. This is the first independent report from Rubis Terminal  as a continuation of the reports released in the past years together with Rubis SCA.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced that they have entered into an Equity Subscription Agreement and have updated the terms of their Collaboration and License Agreement for Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15. As previously announced on April 26  2022  Pfizer plans to initiate the Phase 3 study of VLA15 in the third quarter of 2022.As part of the Equity Subscription Agreement  Pfizer will invest ‚Ç¨90.5 ($95) million in Valneva  representing 8.1% of Valneva‚Äôs share capital at a price of ‚Ç¨9.49 per share  through a reserved capital increase to further support the strategic Lyme partnership between the two companies. The per share purchase price was determined based on the average closing price of the Company‚Äôs shares on Euronext Paris during the 10 trading days preceding the date of the Equity Subscription Agreement. The equity investment is due to close on June 22  2022. Valneva is planning to use the proceeds from Pfizer‚Äôs equity investment to support its Phase 3 development contribution to the Lyme disease program.In addition  Valneva and Pfizer updated the terms of their collaboration and license agreement which they announced on April 30  20201. Valneva will now fund 40% of the remaining shared development costs compared to 30% in the initial agreement. Pfizer will pay Valneva tiered royalties ranging from 14% to 22%  compared to royalties starting at 19% in the initial agreement. In addition  the royalties will be complemented by up to $100 million in milestones payable to Valneva based on cumulative sales. Other development and early commercialization milestones are unchanged  of which $168 million remain  including a $25 million payment to Valneva upon Pfizer‚Äôs initiation of the Phase 3 study.Story continuesThomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented ‚ÄúPfizer‚Äôs investment in Valneva highlights the quality of the work that we‚Äôve done together over the past two years and is a strong recognition of Valneva‚Äôs vaccine expertise. This subscription agreement will contribute to our investment in the Phase 3 study while limiting the impact on our cash position. Lyme disease is spreading and represents a high unmet medical need which impacts the lives of millions of people in the Northern Hemisphere. We are looking forward to further investigating our VLA15 candidate in Phase 3  which will take us a step closer to potentially help protect both adults and children from this devastating disease.‚Äù‚ÄúLyme disease continues to place a heavy burden on countries in North America and Europe  with an estimated 600 000 cases each year across both regions ‚Äù said Kathrin U. Jansen  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. ‚ÄúAs the geographic footprint of Lyme disease widens  the medical need for vaccination becomes even more imperative. We are excited to continue partnering with Valneva on the development of VLA15 and look forward to working together to progress the program with the goal of bringing forward a vaccine that could help prevent this debilitating disease.‚ÄùPending successful initiation and completion of the planned Phase 3 study for VLA15  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2025.DilutionThe 9 549 761 new ordinary shares to be issued to Pfizer pursuant to the Equity Subscription Agreement will represent a dilution of approximately 8.1% of the share capital of the Company. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Valneva‚Äôs capital before this capital increase will now hold a stake of 0.919%.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium‚Äôs ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immunogenicity and safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 20172. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA151.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes (aka deer or blacklegged) ticks3. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere and according to a study published on June 13  2022 in BMJ Global Health  Lyme disease has likely infected 14.5% of the world‚Äôs population4. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.

Stellantis recently invested a total of ‚Ç¨33 million in two of its global testing facilities to support the Company's long-term strategy to achieve best-in-class electric vehicle (EV) performance and master the highest level of autonomous driving technology while ensuring safe and reliable technology for its customers.These investments  among other R&D Capex  expand Stellantis‚Äô global capability to engineer the future of mobility  accelerate its transformation into a sustainable mobility tech company and propel the Company toward the goals of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  notably a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2021 levels by 2030 and carbon net zero emissions by 2038.The recent enhancements include:Orbassano Safety Center   near Turin  Italy  is fully integrated with digital engineering processes and significantly upgraded to host four test tracks with four impact points and capabilities for full testing of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and automated driving technology for passenger cars  trucks  and light commercial vehicles.Wind Tunnel in Auburn Hills  Michigan  U.S.  being scaled up with the addition of moving ground plane technology  simulating on-road travel and providing more accurate aerodynamics measurement of vehicles. Reducing wind drag benefits the driving range of BEVs.Story continues""Our world-class tech hubs across the globe are doing the work today that will make tomorrow's Stellantis vehicles industry leaders in capability  performance and safety "" said Harald Wester  Stellantis Chief Engineering Officer. ""Our engineering community is fueled by talent  diversity and global reach  and we are intensely working with the other global functions  as our Monozokuri peers  to energize the core of our technological transformation. It gives us a comprehensive view of the challenges and enables us to consider and refine a full menu of mobility solutions that will put us in the front row of the race to innovate and improve.""Putting Electric Vehicles and Autonomous Driving to the TestKey goals of the Stellantis Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan include reaching 100% of passenger car BEV sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States by 2030.The ‚Ç¨5 million in upgrades for the Orbassano Safety Center give it the capability to test all types of electrified vehicles - mild hybrid  plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles. The facility currently runs at least two crash tests a day and is on track to test more than 275 electrified vehicles this year. Vehicles tested at Orbassano can be certified to meet more than 175 international safety and technological standards.The impact zone of the test tracks is fitted with a Messring movable block for front and side-impact tests  and Orbassano runs some of the industry's most-challenging tests including the passenger-side small overlap test being used by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.Orbassano's test tracks include a computer-driven camera positioning system with 13 moveable outboard camera locations over the impact point. In addition  the tracks include the capability for underbody high-speed video  while up to five cameras can be mounted on board the test vehicle.All these views  plus the instrumented data  provide Stellantis engineers with invaluable data for evaluating current and future vehicle designs. Additionally  the data is shared with Stellantis facilities around the world  including the additional safety testing centers in Belchamp  France; Chelsea  Michigan  U.S.; and Betim  Brazil  to refine digital vehicle development models.This state-of-the-art facility is fully integrated with Stellantis‚Äô safety digital engineering process  allowing the most efficient vehicle development and virtually covering all possible field crash scenarios.The new tracks are ready to accommodate future test modes related to the introduction of automated driving functions on all types of vehicles.Orbassano's arsenal includes static and dynamic test fixtures for factors such as pedestrian impact  roof crush and rollover  and test sleds to evaluate seating and vehicle interiors. Seat and interior testing become more critical as the adoption of future automated driving technologies hold the potential for new cabin seating configurations.A Better BreezeAerodynamic efficiency is a crucial difference-maker in the drive to optimize the distances electrified vehicles can travel on a single charge. That requires simulating the real driving world as accurately as possible.At the Stellantis wind tunnel complex in Auburn Hills  Michigan  construction is in progress to install moving ground plane technology (rolling road)  which simulates on-road travel while allowing test vehicles to remain static. Stellantis is investing $29.5 million in the project.Belts enable wheel movement at all four corners of the vehicle while a fifth belt runs beneath the vehicle as if it were rolling over a roadway. Moving ground plane technology also enables measurement of ventilation drag  which is the resistance associated exclusively with wheels and tires in motion. It accounts for up to 10 percent of total  real-world aerodynamic drag.The existing aerodynamic test facility in Auburn Hills generates wind speeds up to 140 mph. The moving ground plane installation  part of an estimated $85 million commitment included in the Company's 2019 contract with the United Auto Workers  is scheduled to become operational in 2024.The added capability will complement the world-class aero-acoustic wind tunnel in Auburn Hills as part of a global network of leading-edge centers also equipped with moving ground plane technology  including two facilities in Europe.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

Pfizer will pay Valneva tiered royalties ranging from 14% to 22%  compared to royalties starting at 19% in the initial agreement. In addition  the royalties will be complemented by up to $100 million in milestones payable to Valneva based on cumulative sales. Other development and early commercialization milestones are unchanged  of which $168 million remain  including a $25 million payment to Valneva upon Pfizer‚Äôs initiation of the Phase 3 study.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented ‚ÄúPfizer‚Äôs investment in Valneva highlights the quality of the work that we‚Äôve done together over the past two years and is a strong recognition of Valneva‚Äôs vaccine expertise. This subscription agreement will contribute to our investment in the Phase 3 study while limiting the impact on our cash position. Lyme disease is spreading and represents a high unmet medical need which impacts the lives of millions of people in the Northern Hemisphere. We are looking forward to further investigating our VLA15 candidate in Phase 3  which will take us a step closer to potentially help protect both adults and children from this devastating disease.‚Äù‚ÄúLyme disease continues to place a heavy burden on countries in North America and Europe  with an estimated 600 000 cases each year across both regions ‚Äù said Kathrin U. Jansen  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. ‚ÄúAs the geographic footprint of Lyme disease widens  the medical need for vaccination becomes even more imperative.We are excited to continue partnering with Valneva on the development of VLA15 and look forward to working together to progress the program with the goal of bringing forward a vaccine that could help prevent this debilitating disease.‚ÄùPending successful initiation and completion of the planned Phase 3 study for VLA15  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2025.DilutionThe 9 549 761 new ordinary shares to be issued to Pfizer pursuant to the Equity Subscription Agreement will represent a dilution of approximately 8.1% of the share capital of the Company. On an illustrative basis  a shareholder holding 1% of Valneva‚Äôs capital before this capital increase will now hold a stake of 0.919%.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium‚Äôs ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferisensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immunogenicity and safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 20172. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA151.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borreliaburgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes (aka deer or blacklegged) ticks3. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere and according to a study published on June 13  2022 in BMJ Global Health  Lyme disease has likely infected 14.5% of the world‚Äôs population4. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system. The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens5.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients‚Äô LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Demonstrating its strong performance via more than 600 independent and company-driven field and greenhouse trials across multiple regions  pathogens and crops  Evoca is expected to obtain approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) later this year. This is expected to pave the way for the regulatory assessment of Biotalys‚Äô pipeline of product candidates  which includes biofungicides  biobactericides and bio-insecticides based on the Biotalys AGROBODY Foundry technology platform.‚ÄúWe are excited to enter into this agreement with Novozymes  a global leader in biological solutions for the agricultural and other industries ‚Äù shared Patrice Sell√®s  the CEO of Biotalys. ‚ÄúWith its vast expertise in enzymes and protein fermentation technologies  Novozymes represents a strong partner to support the growth ambitions of Biotalys towards offering growers globally a cost efficient and effective future generation of Evoca.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are pleased that we are able to add significant value to Biotalys‚Äô technology through our world leading industrial fermentation expertise to help Biotalys deliver cost efficient products to provide growers new  sustainable solutions for controlling pests ‚Äù says Thomas Batchelor  Vice President  Agriculture Marketing and Strategy of Novozymes. ‚ÄúWe also see the Biotalys technology as potentially a good complement to our own pipeline of enzyme and microbial solutions as well as our existing commercial biocontrol portfolio.‚ÄùStory continuesFeasibility StudyUnder the agreement  Novozymes will explore during an initial term whether it can upscale and produce the bioactive protein of Evoca in production hosts additional to those currently used by Biotalys. Therefore  Novozymes will use its expertise  intellectual property and know-how and as such produce a future generation of Evoca that meets certain agreed success criteria. The outcome of this feasibility study can serve as a potential key milestone for Biotalys and Novozymes to enter into development  supply and commercialization agreements for this future generation of Evoca.* Evoca‚Ñ¢: Pending Registration.

It combines CellPoint's proprietary  fully integrated  and automated end-to-end real-time monitoring xCellit software system with Switzerland-based Lonza's Cocoon¬Æ system  a closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell and gene therapies. It could potentially reduce cost and importantly  allow for patients to receive treatment tailored to their own cells within a week of patient sampling.Story continuesClinical studies with the CellPoint decentralized supply model have been approved by regulatory authorities in Belgium  Spain  and The Netherlands and two Phase 1/2a studies in rrNHL and rrCLL with a CD-19 CAR-T candidate product have been initiated. Topline results  which are expected in the first half of 2023  provide the opportunity for a rapid clinical validation of the CellPoint CAR-T supply model in patients.Tol Trimborn  co-founder and CEO of CellPoint  said:""We could not have reached today's milestone without the commitment and management expertise of our sole investor  +ND Capital. Despite the progress with current CAR-T therapies  long lead times  highly manual central manufacturing  and complex logistics remain the limiting factors for large-scale capacity and broad patient access. We are excited to become part of Galapagos to realize the potential of our innovative CAR-T delivery model.""Dani Bach  Partner at +ND Capital and Board member of CellPoint said:""We saw the potential in CellPoint's decentralized manufacturing and supply model to address current limitations and deliver CAR-T cells at the point-of-care  in or near the hospital  thereby significantly shortening vein-to-vein time to six days as compared to the current industry standard of more than a month. As well as the better convenience and lower costs  we believe shorter vein-to-vein times will translate into a better safety profile  while keeping the same efficacy.""""This is our second exit in Europe  and both are good examples of +ND Capital's company creation efforts in Switzerland and Europe "" he added.Patrick Aebischer  Senior Partner at +ND Capital  previously President of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) Lausanne  and founder of the firm's European operations  said:""This deal is further validation of our strategy to invest in company creation in Europe. I'm convinced that plenty of European innovation remains untapped and ripe for our team's unique talent in identifying and building up successful companies. Above all  it provides cancer patients with new hope in the form of a disruptive technology that could lead to a promising  radical approach to cell therapy.""+ND Capital is currently investing out of its fourth venture investment fund (Fund IV) and its first Opportunity (Growth) Fund.1.

It combines CellPoint's proprietary  fully integrated  and automated end-to-end real-time monitoring xCellit software system with Switzerland-based Lonza's Cocoon¬Æ system  a closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell and gene therapies. It could potentially reduce cost and importantly  allow for patients to receive treatment tailored to their own cells within a week of patient sampling.Clinical studies with the CellPoint decentralized supply model have been approved by regulatory authorities in Belgium  Spain  and The Netherlands and two Phase 1/2a studies in rrNHL and rrCLL with a CD-19 CAR-T candidate product have been initiated. Topline results  which are expected in the first half of 2023  provide the opportunity for a rapid clinical validation of the CellPoint CAR-T supply model in patients.Tol Trimborn  co-founder and CEO of CellPoint  said:""We could not have reached today's milestone without the commitment and management expertise of our sole investor  +ND Capital. Despite the progress with current CAR-T therapies  long lead times  highly manual central manufacturing  and complex logistics remain the limiting factors for large-scale capacity and broad patient access. We are excited to become part of Galapagos to realize the potential of our innovative CAR-T delivery model.""Dani Bach  Partner at +ND Capital and Board member of CellPoint said:""We saw the potential in CellPoint's decentralized manufacturing and supply model to address current limitations and deliver CAR-T cells at the point-of-care  in or near the hospital  thereby significantly shortening vein-to-vein time to six days as compared to the current industry standard of more than a month. As well as the better convenience and lower costs  we believe shorter vein-to-vein times will translate into a better safety profile  while keeping the same efficacy.""""This is our second exit in Europe  and both are good examples of +ND Capital's company creation efforts in Switzerland and Europe "" he added.Patrick Aebischer  Senior Partner at +ND Capital  previously President of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) Lausanne  and founder of the firm's European operations  said:""This deal is further validation of our strategy to invest in company creation in Europe. I'm convinced that plenty of European innovation remains untapped and ripe for our team's unique talent in identifying and building up successful companies. Above all  it provides cancer patients with new hope in the form of a disruptive technology that could lead to a promising  radical approach to cell therapy.""+ND Capital is currently investing out of its fourth venture investment fund (Fund IV) and its first Opportunity (Growth) Fund.1.

Full topline results will be communicated at EASD 2022.""We are really pleased to confirm that M1Pram ensures weight loss of overweight type 1 patients as pramlintide is the only adjunct to insulin approved by FDA for people with type 1 diabetes."" said G√©rard Soula  President & CEO of Adocia  ""Our first objective now is to partner this product to pharmaceutical companies engaged in diabetes.""CT041 Topline ResultsThis parallel arm study  conducted by Profil in Germany  evaluated the efficacy  safety and patient satisfaction of M1Pram on body weight reduction and blood glucose control compared to insulin lispro (Humalog¬Æ  Eli Lilly) after 16 weeks of outpatient treatment in type 1 diabetes patients with BMI ranging between 25 and 35kg/m2. Both products were administered at meal-time and in combination with once daily basal insulin. 71 patients completed the study.Story continuesThe weight loss of M1Pram vs Humalog over 4 months is -2.13kg (p=0.0045) in total population and -3.1kg (p=0.0155) in a subpopulation of patients with BMI>28kg/m 2 . During the period  a continuous weight decrease was observed and was still ongoing at the end of the study.Both treatments maintained HbA1c and Time-in-Range in patient population with mean HbA1c of 7.4% at baseline.Hypoglycemic event numbers are similar between the two treatments and no difference in severe hypoglycemia.M1Pram demonstrates overall a good safety profile. Total number of adverse events (excluding hypoglycemia) M1Pram vs Humalog  76 vs. 38 were mainly driven by gastro-intestinal side effects as expected and documented in pramlintide literature.The reduction of daily prandial insulin dose for M1Pram treatment compared to baseline is more than 10% (no change in Humalog arm).The treatment satisfaction questionnaire clearly demonstrates a better control of appetite with M1Pram for 82.4% of patients (vs 43.2% with Humalog).""This phase 2 study of M1Pram shows that a single injection with each meal is as easy to use and as efficient as Humalog for glycemic control without increasing the rate of hypoglycemia."" declared Dr. Matthew Riddle  Professor of Medicine in the Division of Endocrinology  Diabetes  & Clinical Nutrition at Oregon Health & Science University  ""In addition  weight control is challenging for T1D patients  potentially limiting glycemic control and adding cardiovascular risk. While reducing insulin requirement  M1Pram improved appetite control and had a beneficial effect on weight  particularly in obese T1D patients. These features support a future role for this combination formulation for T1D.""""The results highlight that M1Pram could provide people with type 1 diabetes with the only insulin that improves control of appetite and lowers weight.""  declared Olivier Soula  Deputy-CEO and Director of R&D of Adocia  ""This is very encouraging and deserves a larger and longer study to reveal the full potential of M1Pram in weight loss  HbA1c and Time-in-Range.""Pramlintide is the only product with weight loss effect that the FDA has approved as adjunct to insulin for people with Type 1 Diabetes; GLP1-RA being only approved in Type 2 diabetes. Weight management and obesity is a major burden for people with T1D in the USA where 65% are overweight or obese.About M1Pram  an insulin/amylin combinationM1Pram is a fixed-ratio combination of insulin and amylin analogs  two hormones that are missing or misfunctioning in diabetes patients. In healthy people  insulin plays a hypoglycemic role and glucagon acts as a hyperglycemic agent while amylin has a central position controlling gastric emptying  well-being and glucagon secretion. In type 1 diabetic patients  insulin and amylin are absent due to the destruction of Œ≤-cells by the immune system. In type 2 diabetes  patients progressively lose the ability to produce endogenous insulin and amylin as the disease progresses.Pramlintide  an amylin analog  is marketed since 2005 and when administered with insulin  has demonstrated that restoring this missing hormone has tremendous effects improving glycemic control  weight loss in overweight patients and well-being.M1Pram as a fixed-ratio combination of pramlintide and insulin allows for fewer daily injections in comparison to marketed pramlintide treatment scheme which requires to be injected on top of insulin. Moreover M1Pram improves the safety profile of the use of pramlintide.It‚Äôs based on 15-years of experience in protein formulation and diabetes  Adocia has overcome the technical challenges to coformulate pramlintide with insulin in one single product; these two hormones normally being incompatible in one formulation.About AdociaAdocia is a biotechnology company specializing in the discovery and development of therapeutic solutions in the field of metabolic diseases  primarily diabetes and obesity. The company has a broad portfolio of drug candidates based on three proprietary technology platforms:1) The BioChaperone¬Æ technology for the development of new generation insulins and products combining insulins with other classes of hormones; 2) AdOral¬Æ  an oral peptide delivery technology; 3) AdoShell¬Æ Islets  an immunoprotective biomaterial for cell transplantation with a first application in pancreatic cells transplantation for patients with ""brittle"" diabetes.Adocia holds more than 25 patent families.Based in Lyon  the company has 115 employees.
