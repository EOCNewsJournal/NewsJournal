Demonstrating its strong performance via more than 600 independent and company-driven field and greenhouse trials across multiple regions  pathogens and crops  Evoca is expected to obtain approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) later this year. This is expected to pave the way for the regulatory assessment of Biotalys’ pipeline of product candidates  which includes biofungicides  biobactericides and bio-insecticides based on the Biotalys AGROBODY Foundry technology platform.“We are excited to enter into this agreement with Novozymes  a global leader in biological solutions for the agricultural and other industries ” shared Patrice Sellès  the CEO of Biotalys. “With its vast expertise in enzymes and protein fermentation technologies  Novozymes represents a strong partner to support the growth ambitions of Biotalys towards offering growers globally a cost efficient and effective future generation of Evoca.”“We are pleased that we are able to add significant value to Biotalys’ technology through our world leading industrial fermentation expertise to help Biotalys deliver cost efficient products to provide growers new  sustainable solutions for controlling pests ” says Thomas Batchelor  Vice President  Agriculture Marketing and Strategy of Novozymes. “We also see the Biotalys technology as potentially a good complement to our own pipeline of enzyme and microbial solutions as well as our existing commercial biocontrol portfolio.”Story continuesFeasibility StudyUnder the agreement  Novozymes will explore during an initial term whether it can upscale and produce the bioactive protein of Evoca in production hosts additional to those currently used by Biotalys. Therefore  Novozymes will use its expertise  intellectual property and know-how and as such produce a future generation of Evoca that meets certain agreed success criteria. The outcome of this feasibility study can serve as a potential key milestone for Biotalys and Novozymes to enter into development  supply and commercialization agreements for this future generation of Evoca.* Evoca™: Pending Registration.

It combines CellPoint's proprietary  fully integrated  and automated end-to-end real-time monitoring xCellit software system with Switzerland-based Lonza's Cocoon® system  a closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell and gene therapies. It could potentially reduce cost and importantly  allow for patients to receive treatment tailored to their own cells within a week of patient sampling.Story continuesClinical studies with the CellPoint decentralized supply model have been approved by regulatory authorities in Belgium  Spain  and The Netherlands and two Phase 1/2a studies in rrNHL and rrCLL with a CD-19 CAR-T candidate product have been initiated. Topline results  which are expected in the first half of 2023  provide the opportunity for a rapid clinical validation of the CellPoint CAR-T supply model in patients.Tol Trimborn  co-founder and CEO of CellPoint  said:""We could not have reached today's milestone without the commitment and management expertise of our sole investor  +ND Capital. Despite the progress with current CAR-T therapies  long lead times  highly manual central manufacturing  and complex logistics remain the limiting factors for large-scale capacity and broad patient access. We are excited to become part of Galapagos to realize the potential of our innovative CAR-T delivery model.""Dani Bach  Partner at +ND Capital and Board member of CellPoint said:""We saw the potential in CellPoint's decentralized manufacturing and supply model to address current limitations and deliver CAR-T cells at the point-of-care  in or near the hospital  thereby significantly shortening vein-to-vein time to six days as compared to the current industry standard of more than a month. As well as the better convenience and lower costs  we believe shorter vein-to-vein times will translate into a better safety profile  while keeping the same efficacy.""""This is our second exit in Europe  and both are good examples of +ND Capital's company creation efforts in Switzerland and Europe "" he added.Patrick Aebischer  Senior Partner at +ND Capital  previously President of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) Lausanne  and founder of the firm's European operations  said:""This deal is further validation of our strategy to invest in company creation in Europe. I'm convinced that plenty of European innovation remains untapped and ripe for our team's unique talent in identifying and building up successful companies. Above all  it provides cancer patients with new hope in the form of a disruptive technology that could lead to a promising  radical approach to cell therapy.""+ND Capital is currently investing out of its fourth venture investment fund (Fund IV) and its first Opportunity (Growth) Fund.1.

It combines CellPoint's proprietary  fully integrated  and automated end-to-end real-time monitoring xCellit software system with Switzerland-based Lonza's Cocoon® system  a closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell and gene therapies. It could potentially reduce cost and importantly  allow for patients to receive treatment tailored to their own cells within a week of patient sampling.Clinical studies with the CellPoint decentralized supply model have been approved by regulatory authorities in Belgium  Spain  and The Netherlands and two Phase 1/2a studies in rrNHL and rrCLL with a CD-19 CAR-T candidate product have been initiated. Topline results  which are expected in the first half of 2023  provide the opportunity for a rapid clinical validation of the CellPoint CAR-T supply model in patients.Tol Trimborn  co-founder and CEO of CellPoint  said:""We could not have reached today's milestone without the commitment and management expertise of our sole investor  +ND Capital. Despite the progress with current CAR-T therapies  long lead times  highly manual central manufacturing  and complex logistics remain the limiting factors for large-scale capacity and broad patient access. We are excited to become part of Galapagos to realize the potential of our innovative CAR-T delivery model.""Dani Bach  Partner at +ND Capital and Board member of CellPoint said:""We saw the potential in CellPoint's decentralized manufacturing and supply model to address current limitations and deliver CAR-T cells at the point-of-care  in or near the hospital  thereby significantly shortening vein-to-vein time to six days as compared to the current industry standard of more than a month. As well as the better convenience and lower costs  we believe shorter vein-to-vein times will translate into a better safety profile  while keeping the same efficacy.""""This is our second exit in Europe  and both are good examples of +ND Capital's company creation efforts in Switzerland and Europe "" he added.Patrick Aebischer  Senior Partner at +ND Capital  previously President of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) Lausanne  and founder of the firm's European operations  said:""This deal is further validation of our strategy to invest in company creation in Europe. I'm convinced that plenty of European innovation remains untapped and ripe for our team's unique talent in identifying and building up successful companies. Above all  it provides cancer patients with new hope in the form of a disruptive technology that could lead to a promising  radical approach to cell therapy.""+ND Capital is currently investing out of its fourth venture investment fund (Fund IV) and its first Opportunity (Growth) Fund.1.

The pr…,""" With $6.1 billion hammered at auction over the first five months of this year  versus $5.4 billion over the same period last year  2022 is already looking much stronger. That's a 12% increase! "" says Thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department.+50% turnover in the USAThe analyses conducted by Artprice reveal a superbly intense start to the year 2022  even if the organization of auction sales remains disrupted in several parts of the world (particularly in Asia) by the Covid-19 pandemic.The clear winner this year  the United States has posted a 50% increase in fine art auction turnover after the major spring sales. The last prestige sessions were marked by the spectacular result of close to $200 million for Andy Warhol's Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) at Christie's. Its new owner is none other than gallery owner Larry Gagosian whose business could suffer from international sanctions taken against the Russian oligarchs he counts among his clients.New York's spring sales were also electrified by the sale of Jean-Michel Basquiat's painting Untitled (1982). Having paid $57.3 million to acquire the painting in 2016  the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa re-sold it this year for $85 million  an additional 48% in just six years.Jean-Michel Basquiat Untitled (1982) therefore posted an average annual return of +6.8% during the six years it was in Maezawa's collection. This capital gain will partly serve to cover Christie's buyer's fees (more than $11 million on this lot)  but also to reassure the market which had seen Basquiat's prices climb at a dizzying pace with the purchases made by Yusaku Maezawa. In 2017  the Japanese collector acquired a painting by the same artist and from the same year for a record sum of $110 million.Europe forges ahead  Asia is on hold and the Metaverse is getting underwayThe UK has started 2022 with a 35% increase in fine art auction turnover (versus the year-earlier period) and France has posted a 25% increase. Europe  therefore  seems to have fully recovered from the health crisis. However  the situation is different in Asia where lots of sales have been postponed due to a new wave of Covid-19. So far this year  Hong Kong has hammered only $146 million in fine art auction turnover compared with over half a billion USD last year.Meanwhile  the world of crypto-currencies and Web3 has been very generous in supporting the Ukrainian cause. Kyiv started to accept donations in the form of NFTs as of April 2022. Several artists have also embarked on charity sales of NFTs  such as JR in collaboration with Ukraine DAO and Pussy Riot who sold a digital version of the Ukrainian flag for $6.7 million.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/06/image1-fine-art-auction-turnover-2021-vs-2022early.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/06/image2-image2-tweet-Mykhailo-fedorov-donations-NFT.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

They have had to manually review  compare  and translate different profiles of multiple triparty agents while keeping up with changing business requirements  market conditions and regulatory requirements  such as Uncleared Margin Requirements (UMR).Clearstream seeks to tackle these issues with OSCAR  supporting users in defining their own intelligent eligibility criteria whilst simultaneously checking automatically for inconsistencies. The tool also ensures interoperability with different counterparts  improving collaboration  negotiation and reconciliation. This increases flexibility  scalability and speed while maximising operational efficiency.OSCAR was developed with the technical expertise of fintech Intelli-Select and their academic partner  the KU Leuven.Samuel Riley  Head of Investor Services & Financing  said: “OSCAR reduces the time to set up and negotiate an individual fit-for-purpose collateral basket from weeks to hours. Like this  Clearstream provides an enormous relief for client operations who can create individual  yet machine-readable collateral baskets to maximise the value of their business’s collateral.

Trading in inverse ETFs -- vehicles that win when the market loses -- is eclipsing activity in bullish leveraged products by the widest margin since the financial crisis ,2/2 © Bloomberg. A bear statue stands outside the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  operated by Deutsche Boerse AG  in Frankfurt. Photographer: Peter Juelich/Bloomberg 2/2(Bloomberg) -- A booming corner of the $6.2 trillion ETF market is sending ominous signals about the path ahead for US stocks.Trading in inverse ETFs -- vehicles that win when the market loses -- is eclipsing activity in bullish leveraged products by the widest margin since the financial crisis  according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence.That looks like a fresh sign of disintegrating sentiment as the most aggressive Federal Reserve policy since 1994 fuels a bear market with few precedents. Leveraged long funds are almost always more popular than their bearish counterparts as traders seek to supercharge any market gains.Now that dip-buying urge is evaporating  being replaced by demand for hedges amid this year’s broad stock losses.“It makes sense to see inverse ETFs becoming more popular and receiving inflows ” said Peter Chatwell  head of global macro strategies trading at Mizuho International Plc. “For real money investors  downside protection of a portfolio is difficult to come by  particularly in a rising yield environment where government bonds don’t work well as a hedge.”Usually  fixed income would outperform in a slowing economy  acting to counterweight falling equities. But the prospect of ever-tighter policy  inflation that keeps rising in spite of it  and a looming recession are crushing both stocks and bonds.Read more: Wall Street Alarms Bell as 60/40 Set for Worse Quarter Than 2008The surge in inverse ETF activity looks especially bearish since far more of the products use leverage than during the financial crisis.

In addition to FFPE2 tissue  Biocartis will seek to validate the use of less invasive cytology samples such as fine needle aspirates3 for use with the Idylla™ EGFR CDx Assay  to expand patient access to testing.The new project expands the existing master collaboration agreement announced in January 2020 between Biocartis and AstraZeneca4  aimed at boosting access to faster molecular diagnostic biomarker results with the rapid and easy-to-use Idylla™ EGFR testing products. The collaboration was supported by the large prospective lung cancer FACILITATE study  co-sponsored by AstraZeneca. This study concluded that Idylla™ EGFR testing may add value in a clinical setting to generate actionable EGFR mutation results for NSCLC patients faster than routinely used methods. In this respect  the newly signed agreement includes the investigational use of the Idylla™ EGFR CDx Assay to enroll patients in clinical trials at AstraZeneca.Story continuesAstraZeneca is marketing Tagrisso®  a leading lung cancer therapy approved for patients with resectable and locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR mutations. EGFR activating mutations are important biomarkers in NSCLC  occurring in 10-15% of all NSCLC patients in the US and the EU  and in 30-40% of all NSCLC patients in Asia5.Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “We are excited to move our collaboration with AstraZeneca to a next level with the development of a companion diagnostic test on Idylla™ that may enable faster and broader patient access to AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso® treatment. Current EGFR molecular diagnostic testing remains a real challenge in the clinical practice. Obtaining high quality tissue samples is difficult and complex  especially in NSCLC where tumors are frequently very small  often leading up to several weeks of waiting time before results are available  as opposed to what we can offer with the Idylla™ technology.”--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

It’s been amazing to see how quickly Chinova has been able to add customers  making investing a no-brainer ” said Bernard Lupien  General Partner from Rhapsody Venture Partners. “Furthermore  Chinova’s planet-friendly process of upcycling the otherwise discarded stems of white button mushrooms to create Chiber™ is precisely what consumers are asking for.”Visit Chinova’s IFT First booth S2667 from July 10-13 at McCormick Place.

This will enable Trinseo to deliver superior product data on the carbon footprint of its products to its customers and accelerates Trinseo’s net-zero ambitions and carbon transparency commitments.From June 2022 until the end of this year  Trinseo works with Atos using this digital solution that calculates product carbon footprints (PCF) for the chemical industry to gather key insights for enterprise-wide deployment of the solution in line with its existing SAP ERP and data landscape. After scaling up the tool across business units  Trinseo is expected to ultimately achieve the capability of providing automated PCF information in-house to its customers for all its products.The PCF calculation tool (SCOTT) and methodology developed by BASF is based on Life Cycle Assessment methodology and calculates cradle-to-gate PCF. Atos was selected as a partner to develop and distribute a software platform to make this tool and methodology available to the industry. The methodology is based on ISO14067:2018 for the carbon footprint of products  which builds on the principles and requirements of the ISO standards 14040:2006 and 14044:2006.“While Trinseo has been reporting our corporate carbon footprint for many years  it is still a manual and extremely labor-intensive process to do the same on a per-product level ” said Dr. Julien Renvoise  Trinseo’s Sustainability Business Development Leader. “Starting with a couple of our flagship products  we will explore how to automate this with the help of Atos and their PCF platform.”Story continues“Our assessment has shown that Trinseo is already in a good position for PCF automation based on their available data and SAP processes ” said Stefan Unterhuber  Senior Director of Net Zero Transformation at Atos. “However  it has also shown areas where we expect gaps and room for improvements. Starting with this pilot project  our phased approach will allow us to gradually close gaps in their primary data  improve secondary data quality  and ultimately provide Trinseo with accurate and transparent PCF data per individual product that is fully automated.”Both companies see this project as an important contribution toward a net-zero economy and an excellent example of how digital technology can be leveraged to monitor and manage greenhouse gas emissions.***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with 111 000 employees and annual revenue of c. € 11 billion.

This will enable Trinseo to deliver superior product data on the carbon footprint of its products to its customers and accelerates Trinseo’s net-zero ambitions and carbon transparency commitments.From June 2022 until the end of this year  Trinseo works with Atos using this digital solution that calculates product carbon footprints (PCF) for the chemical industry to gather key insights for enterprise-wide deployment of the solution in line with its existing SAP ERP and data landscape. After scaling up the tool across business units  Trinseo is expected to ultimately achieve the capability of providing automated PCF information in-house to its customers for all its products.The PCF calculation tool (SCOTT) and methodology developed by BASF is based on Life Cycle Assessment methodology and calculates cradle-to-gate PCF. Atos was selected as a partner to develop and distribute a software platform to make this tool and methodology available to the industry. The methodology is based on ISO14067:2018 for the carbon footprint of products  which builds on the principles and requirements of the ISO standards 14040:2006 and 14044:2006.“ While Trinseo has been reporting our corporate carbon footprint for many years  it is still a manual and extremely labor-intensive process to do the same on a per-product level ” said Dr. Julien Renvoise  Trinseo’s Sustainability Business Development Leader. “ Starting with a couple of our flagship products  we will explore how to automate this with the help of Atos and their PCF platform.”“ Our assessment has shown that Trinseo is already in a good position for PCF automation based on their available data and SAP processes ” said Stefan Unterhuber  Senior Director of Net Zero Transformation at Atos. “ However  it has also shown areas where we expect gaps and room for improvements. Starting with this pilot project  our phased approach will allow us to gradually close gaps in their primary data  improve secondary data quality  and ultimately provide Trinseo with accurate and transparent PCF data per individual product that is fully automated.”Both companies see this project as an important contribution toward a net-zero economy and an excellent example of how digital technology can be leveraged to monitor and manage greenhouse gas emissions.About TrinseoTrinseo (NYSE: TSE)  a specialty material solutions provider  partners with companies to bring ideas to life in an imaginative  smart  and sustainability-focused manner by combining its premier expertise  forward-looking innovations and best-in-class materials to unlock value for companies and consumers.From design to manufacturing  Trinseo taps into decades of experience in diverse material solutions to address customers’ unique challenges in a wide range of industries  including consumer goods  mobility  building and construction  and medical.Trinseo’s approximately 3 400 employees bring endless creativity to reimagining the possibilities with clients all over the world from the company’s locations in North America  Europe  and Asia Pacific.

The pr…,""" With $6.1 billion hammered at auction over the first five months of this year  versus $5.4 billion over the same period last year  2022 is already looking much stronger. That's a 12% increase! "" says Thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department.+50% turnover in the USAThe analyses conducted by Artprice reveal a superbly intense start to the year 2022  even if the organization of auction sales remains disrupted in several parts of the world (particularly in Asia) by the Covid-19 pandemic.The clear winner this year  the United States has posted a 50% increase in fine art auction turnover after the major spring sales. The last prestige sessions were marked by the spectacular result of close to $200 million for Andy Warhol's Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) at Christie's. Its new owner is none other than gallery owner Larry Gagosian whose business could suffer from international sanctions taken against the Russian oligarchs he counts among his clients.New York's spring sales were also electrified by the sale of Jean-Michel Basquiat's painting Untitled (1982). Having paid $57.3 million to acquire the painting in 2016  the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa re-sold it this year for $85 million  an additional 48% in just six years.Jean-Michel Basquiat Untitled (1982) therefore posted an average annual return of +6.8% during the six years it was in Maezawa's collection. This capital gain will partly serve to cover Christie's buyer's fees (more than $11 million on this lot)  but also to reassure the market which had seen Basquiat's prices climb at a dizzying pace with the purchases made by Yusaku Maezawa. In 2017  the Japanese collector acquired a painting by the same artist and from the same year for a record sum of $110 million.Europe forges ahead  Asia is on hold and the Metaverse is getting underwayThe UK has started 2022 with a 35% increase in fine art auction turnover (versus the year-earlier period) and France has posted a 25% increase. Europe  therefore  seems to have fully recovered from the health crisis. However  the situation is different in Asia where lots of sales have been postponed due to a new wave of Covid-19. So far this year  Hong Kong has hammered only $146 million in fine art auction turnover compared with over half a billion USD last year.Meanwhile  the world of crypto-currencies and Web3 has been very generous in supporting the Ukrainian cause. Kyiv started to accept donations in the form of NFTs as of April 2022. Several artists have also embarked on charity sales of NFTs  such as JR in collaboration with Ukraine DAO and Pussy Riot who sold a digital version of the Ukrainian flag for $6.7 million.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/06/image1-fine-art-auction-turnover-2021-vs-2022early.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/06/image2-image2-tweet-Mykhailo-fedorov-donations-NFT.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The move comes as part of the ongoing evolution of Euronext Clearing Risk Management systems and will replace the MVP SPAN-like margin methodology which is currently applied to all bond instruments.“Euronext Clearing is committed to supporting the needs of its clients to ensure they continue to operate efficiently and safely across all markets ” said Anthony Attia  global head of post-trade and primary markets at Euronext.“The new VaR-based margin methodology  in line with the international best practices and market standards  is based on a re-evaluation of more than 4 000 risk factors’ scenarios at portfolio level.”,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,neutral,0.05,0.9,0.05,True,English,"['new VaR model', 'LCH RepoClear', 'Euronext Clearing', 'Euronext Clearing Risk Management systems', 'The VaR based framework', 'new VaR-based margin methodology', 'new VaR framework', 'new margin framework', 'three key pillars', 'Impact 2024” strategic plan', 'Italian, Portuguese, Spanish', 'international best practices', '4,000 risk factors’ scenarios', 'respective debt markets', '13 Euro debt markets', 'multiple debt markets', 'The VaR model', 'Irish government bonds', 'first line risk', 'VaR methodology', 'VaR) methodologies', 'margin requirement', 'margin efficiency', 'primary markets', 'anti-procyclical measures', 'direct resources', '€GC+ segment', 'fourth quarter', 'anti-procyclical features', 'Olivier Nin', 'theoretical events', 'MTS cash', 'repo platforms', 'Hi-MTF platforms', 'European expansion', 'ongoing evolution', 'MVP SPAN-like', 'bond instruments', 'Anthony Attia', 'portfolio level', 'LCH SA', 'market volatility', 'market dynamics', 'market standards', 'RepoClear SA', 'balanced portfolios', 'LCH RepoClear', 'global head', 'diversified portfolios', 'Value', 'recognition', 'stability', 'predictability', 'enhanced', 'capacity', 'Monday', 'aim', 'members', 'costs', 'year', 'periods', 'collateral', 'liquidity', 'historical', 'diversification', 'BrokerTec', 'MOT', 'EuroTLX', 'firm', 'Growth', 'move', 'part', 'needs', 'clients', 'post-trade', 'evaluation']",2022-06-22,2022-06-22,thetradenews.com
