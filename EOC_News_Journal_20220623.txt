The pr…,""" With $6.1 billion hammered at auction over the first five months of this year  versus $5.4 billion over the same period last year  2022 is already looking much stronger. That's a 12% increase! "" says Thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department.+50% turnover in the USAThe analyses conducted by Artprice reveal a superbly intense start to the year 2022  even if the organization of auction sales remains disrupted in several parts of the world (particularly in Asia) by the Covid-19 pandemic.The clear winner this year  the United States has posted a 50% increase in fine art auction turnover after the major spring sales. The last prestige sessions were marked by the spectacular result of close to $200 million for Andy Warhol's Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) at Christie's. Its new owner is none other than gallery owner Larry Gagosian whose business could suffer from international sanctions taken against the Russian oligarchs he counts among his clients.New York's spring sales were also electrified by the sale of Jean-Michel Basquiat's painting Untitled (1982). Having paid $57.3 million to acquire the painting in 2016  the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa re-sold it this year for $85 million  an additional 48% in just six years.Jean-Michel Basquiat Untitled (1982) therefore posted an average annual return of +6.8% during the six years it was in Maezawa's collection. This capital gain will partly serve to cover Christie's buyer's fees (more than $11 million on this lot)  but also to reassure the market which had seen Basquiat's prices climb at a dizzying pace with the purchases made by Yusaku Maezawa. In 2017  the Japanese collector acquired a painting by the same artist and from the same year for a record sum of $110 million.Europe forges ahead  Asia is on hold and the Metaverse is getting underwayThe UK has started 2022 with a 35% increase in fine art auction turnover (versus the year-earlier period) and France has posted a 25% increase. Europe  therefore  seems to have fully recovered from the health crisis. However  the situation is different in Asia where lots of sales have been postponed due to a new wave of Covid-19. So far this year  Hong Kong has hammered only $146 million in fine art auction turnover compared with over half a billion USD last year.Meanwhile  the world of crypto-currencies and Web3 has been very generous in supporting the Ukrainian cause. Kyiv started to accept donations in the form of NFTs as of April 2022. Several artists have also embarked on charity sales of NFTs  such as JR in collaboration with Ukraine DAO and Pussy Riot who sold a digital version of the Ukrainian flag for $6.7 million.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/06/image1-fine-art-auction-turnover-2021-vs-2022early.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/06/image2-image2-tweet-Mykhailo-fedorov-donations-NFT.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

In addition to FFPE2 tissue  Biocartis will seek to validate the use of less invasive cytology samples such as fine needle aspirates3 for use with the Idylla™ EGFR CDx Assay  to expand patient access to testing.The new project expands the existing master collaboration agreement announced in January 2020 between Biocartis and AstraZeneca4  aimed at boosting access to faster molecular diagnostic biomarker results with the rapid and easy-to-use Idylla™ EGFR testing products. The collaboration was supported by the large prospective lung cancer FACILITATE study  co-sponsored by AstraZeneca. This study concluded that Idylla™ EGFR testing may add value in a clinical setting to generate actionable EGFR mutation results for NSCLC patients faster than routinely used methods. In this respect  the newly signed agreement includes the investigational use of the Idylla™ EGFR CDx Assay to enroll patients in clinical trials at AstraZeneca.Story continuesAstraZeneca is marketing Tagrisso®  a leading lung cancer therapy approved for patients with resectable and locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR mutations. EGFR activating mutations are important biomarkers in NSCLC  occurring in 10-15% of all NSCLC patients in the US and the EU  and in 30-40% of all NSCLC patients in Asia5.Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “We are excited to move our collaboration with AstraZeneca to a next level with the development of a companion diagnostic test on Idylla™ that may enable faster and broader patient access to AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso® treatment. Current EGFR molecular diagnostic testing remains a real challenge in the clinical practice. Obtaining high quality tissue samples is difficult and complex  especially in NSCLC where tumors are frequently very small  often leading up to several weeks of waiting time before results are available  as opposed to what we can offer with the Idylla™ technology.”--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

It’s been amazing to see how quickly Chinova has been able to add customers  making investing a no-brainer ” said Bernard Lupien  General Partner from Rhapsody Venture Partners. “Furthermore  Chinova’s planet-friendly process of upcycling the otherwise discarded stems of white button mushrooms to create Chiber™ is precisely what consumers are asking for.”Visit Chinova’s IFT First booth S2667 from July 10-13 at McCormick Place.

This will enable Trinseo to deliver superior product data on the carbon footprint of its products to its customers and accelerates Trinseo’s net-zero ambitions and carbon transparency commitments.From June 2022 until the end of this year  Trinseo works with Atos using this digital solution that calculates product carbon footprints (PCF) for the chemical industry to gather key insights for enterprise-wide deployment of the solution in line with its existing SAP ERP and data landscape. After scaling up the tool across business units  Trinseo is expected to ultimately achieve the capability of providing automated PCF information in-house to its customers for all its products.The PCF calculation tool (SCOTT) and methodology developed by BASF is based on Life Cycle Assessment methodology and calculates cradle-to-gate PCF. Atos was selected as a partner to develop and distribute a software platform to make this tool and methodology available to the industry. The methodology is based on ISO14067:2018 for the carbon footprint of products  which builds on the principles and requirements of the ISO standards 14040:2006 and 14044:2006.“While Trinseo has been reporting our corporate carbon footprint for many years  it is still a manual and extremely labor-intensive process to do the same on a per-product level ” said Dr. Julien Renvoise  Trinseo’s Sustainability Business Development Leader. “Starting with a couple of our flagship products  we will explore how to automate this with the help of Atos and their PCF platform.”Story continues“Our assessment has shown that Trinseo is already in a good position for PCF automation based on their available data and SAP processes ” said Stefan Unterhuber  Senior Director of Net Zero Transformation at Atos. “However  it has also shown areas where we expect gaps and room for improvements. Starting with this pilot project  our phased approach will allow us to gradually close gaps in their primary data  improve secondary data quality  and ultimately provide Trinseo with accurate and transparent PCF data per individual product that is fully automated.”Both companies see this project as an important contribution toward a net-zero economy and an excellent example of how digital technology can be leveraged to monitor and manage greenhouse gas emissions.***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with 111 000 employees and annual revenue of c. € 11 billion.

It is the same principles we will apply when we are now helping to upgrade an offshore construction vessel ” said Egil Bremnes  sales manager at NES.The Volantis is a dynamically positioned multi-role subsea construction vessel  which incorporates a 150te active heave compensated subsea crane. The vessel is 350 feet long. In recent years the Volantis subsea construction vessel has operated in the US Gulf of Mexico.Volstad Maritime  which is headquartered in Aalesund  Norway  was one of the first offshore owners to achieve the ISO 50001 accreditation for Energy Management Standard. The installation of batteries on Volantis will take these efforts one step forward.NES will utilize competence across its three Norwegian facilities – Bergen  Egersund  and Alesund – to design  assemble  and test the battery package and control system  which will be delivered in the first quarter of 2023.NES  a subsidiary of HAV Group ASA which is listed on Euronext Growth Oslo  has not disclosed the value of the contract.To contact the author  email username.eldina@gmail.com,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,neutral,0.02,0.93,0.05,True,English,"['Subsea Construction Vessel', 'Volstad Orders', 'NES Batteries', 'M/S Volantis subsea construction vessel', '150te active heave compensated', 'multi-role subsea construction vessel', 'offshore construction vessel', 'Offshore vessel operator', 'forthcoming vessel upgrade', 'Norwegian Electric Systems', 'sustainable energy design', 'Energy Management Standard', 'three Norwegian facilities', 'HAV Group ASA', 'Euronext Growth Oslo', 'first offshore owners', 'battery power notation', 'similar battery upgrades', 'associated control system', 'new charter contract', 'subsea crane', 'The Volantis', 'smart control', 'first quarter', 'battery package', 'battery charging', 'Volstad Maritime', 'several PSVs', 'same principles', 'Egil Bremnes', 'sales manager', 'recent years', 'US Gulf', 'ISO 50001 accreditation', 'equipment', 'connection', 'early', 'experience', 'number', 'Mexico', 'Aalesund', 'Norway', 'installation', 'batteries', 'efforts', 'competence', 'Bergen', 'Egersund', 'subsidiary', 'value', 'author', 'eldina']",2022-06-22,2022-06-23,rigzone.com

The pr…,""" With $6.1 billion hammered at auction over the first five months of this year  versus $5.4 billion over the same period last year  2022 is already looking much stronger. That's a 12% increase! "" says Thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department.+50% turnover in the USAThe analyses conducted by Artprice reveal a superbly intense start to the year 2022  even if the organization of auction sales remains disrupted in several parts of the world (particularly in Asia) by the Covid-19 pandemic.The clear winner this year  the United States has posted a 50% increase in fine art auction turnover after the major spring sales. The last prestige sessions were marked by the spectacular result of close to $200 million for Andy Warhol's Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) at Christie's. Its new owner is none other than gallery owner Larry Gagosian whose business could suffer from international sanctions taken against the Russian oligarchs he counts among his clients.New York's spring sales were also electrified by the sale of Jean-Michel Basquiat's painting Untitled (1982). Having paid $57.3 million to acquire the painting in 2016  the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa re-sold it this year for $85 million  an additional 48% in just six years.Jean-Michel Basquiat Untitled (1982) therefore posted an average annual return of +6.8% during the six years it was in Maezawa's collection. This capital gain will partly serve to cover Christie's buyer's fees (more than $11 million on this lot)  but also to reassure the market which had seen Basquiat's prices climb at a dizzying pace with the purchases made by Yusaku Maezawa. In 2017  the Japanese collector acquired a painting by the same artist and from the same year for a record sum of $110 million.Europe forges ahead  Asia is on hold and the Metaverse is getting underwayThe UK has started 2022 with a 35% increase in fine art auction turnover (versus the year-earlier period) and France has posted a 25% increase. Europe  therefore  seems to have fully recovered from the health crisis. However  the situation is different in Asia where lots of sales have been postponed due to a new wave of Covid-19. So far this year  Hong Kong has hammered only $146 million in fine art auction turnover compared with over half a billion USD last year.Meanwhile  the world of crypto-currencies and Web3 has been very generous in supporting the Ukrainian cause. Kyiv started to accept donations in the form of NFTs as of April 2022. Several artists have also embarked on charity sales of NFTs  such as JR in collaboration with Ukraine DAO and Pussy Riot who sold a digital version of the Ukrainian flag for $6.7 million.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/06/image1-fine-art-auction-turnover-2021-vs-2022early.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/06/image2-image2-tweet-Mykhailo-fedorov-donations-NFT.png]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

6841,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/6/23/with-bond-deadline-looming-russia-days-away-from-default,With bond deadlines looming  Russia days away from default,Russia has failed to meet the deadlines because mounting sanctions are cutting off avenues to transfer the cash.,Russia has failed to meet the deadlines because mounting sanctions are cutting off avenues to transfer the cash.Russia faces yet another bond payment test this week  with just days remaining before it potentially slides into its first foreign default in a century.Three interest transfers totaling almost $400 million are due on Thursday and Friday  but more pressing is a Sunday-night deadline on previous missed payments from late May.Those funds — about $100 million of bond coupons — are stuck due to international sanctions  and the grace period to find a solution expires at the end of the day on June 26. At that point  Russia will effectively be in default  unless it somehow gets payments through to sufficient holders of the debt.It’s not that the government lacks the will or the money to pay. Billions of dollars of energy revenue pour into Kremlin coffers each week.Rather  it’s failed to meet the deadlines because mounting sanctions are cutting off avenues to transfer the cash.The goal in the White House is to punish the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine by sealing its pariah status in the market for decades to come with the country’s first foreign default since the Bolshevik revolution more than a century ago.Russia argues that it’s being forced into default  and tried to find workarounds. It said its obligations will be deemed to have been fulfilled once payment is made in rubles  according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin setting out a mechanism for servicing the bonds. Earlier  Finance Minister Anton Siluanov had said the government would transfer rubles that could then be converted into foreign currencies.“We’ve done everything we can to lead the horse to water  but it’s not up to us whether it wants to drink or not ” Siluanov said last week.For the rest of this week  attention will be on the latest coupons coming due  and the Finance Ministry’s attempts to pay.Three coupon payments are due on Thursday and Friday. A failure to pay will set the clock ticking on a grace period of 30 days for the first two and 15 business days for the last.Coupon Close-UpFirst  on June 23  are payments on notes maturing in 2027 and 2047.Neither has a clause allowing Russia to pay in rubles  but they do allow for alternative currencies  including euros  sterling and Swiss francs  bond documents show. If the Finance Ministry intends to switch to one of these currencies  it needs to notify bondholders at least five days in advance.But like the coupons that are stuck  these payments must start their journey to bondholders at Russia’s sanctioned National Settlement Depository as paying agent.

But there is no rationale to tax citizens and not tax overseas investors "" a senior source aware of the discussions said.Domestic investors have to pay short-term capital gains tax on debt investments as per their prevailing tax slabs and additional 4% cess.""The risks of such index inclusions have always been there and though India is in a much better shape now  globally things are fairly volatile and it may not necessarily be the best time to go for this "" he added.Index inclusion will aid sentiment in the near-term and incremental foreign investment inflows over the medium term would help policymakers to buy some time until the global market conditions become somewhat easier to navigate  Deutsche Bank said in a recent note.""Global bond index inclusion is not a panacea for all the challenges faced by India at this juncture  but at least it can help on the margin "" the bank said.",neutral,0.03,0.55,0.42,negative,0.02,0.15,0.83,True,English,"['global bond index inclusion', 'tax waivers', 'India', 'Sources', 'global bond index listing plan', 'incremental foreign investment inflows', 'capital gains tax waivers', 'short-term capital gains tax', 'India Governor Shaktikanta Das', 'Global bond index inclusion', 'prevailing tax slabs', 'global bond indexes', 'global market conditions', 'J.P.Morgan', 'major index providers', 'global indexes', 'listed bond', 'index operators', 'index inclusions', 'two sources', 'existing rules', 'overseas investor', 'finance ministry', 'advanced stage', 'taxation part', 'senior source', 'additional 4% cess', 'medium term', 'recent note', 'overseas debt', 'Reserve Bank', 'Domestic investors', 'debt investments', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Indian government', 'best time', 'MUMBAI', 'goal', 'bonds', 'matter', 'process', 'discussions', 'Bloomberg-Barclays', 'Euroclear', 'regards', 'clearing', 'settlement', '12 months', 'insistence', 'talks', 'officials', 'Reuters', 'mail', 'message', 'comments', 'October', 'next', 'thing', 'rationale', 'citizens', 'risks', 'shape', 'sentiment', 'near-term', 'policymakers', 'panacea', 'challenges', 'juncture', 'margin']",2022-06-22,2022-06-23,economictimes.indiatimes.com

They have had to manually review  compare  and translate different profiles of multiple triparty agents while keeping up with changing business requirements  market conditions and regulatory requirements  such as Uncleared Margin Requirements (UMR).Clearstream seeks to tackle these issues with OSCAR  supporting users in defining their own intelligent eligibility criteria whilst simultaneously checking automatically for inconsistencies. The tool also ensures interoperability with different counterparts  improving collaboration  negotiation and reconciliation. This increases flexibility  scalability and speed while maximising operational efficiency.OSCAR was developed with the technical expertise of fintech Intelli-Select and their academic partner  the KU Leuven.Samuel Riley  Head of Investor Services & Financing  said: “OSCAR reduces the time to set up and negotiate an individual fit-for-purpose collateral basket from weeks to hours. Like this  Clearstream provides an enormous relief for client operations who can create individual  yet machine-readable collateral baskets to maximise the value of their business’s collateral. With Intelli-Select  we found an excellent partner to build our collateral management vision for the industry thus supporting our clients in the best way possible.”Bart Coppens  Co-Founder & CEO of Intelli-Select  added: “Our solution is built on latest research in AI techniques enabling the creation of sophisticated insights with full explainability of the reasoning process yet based on intuitive natural language inputs. The partnership with Clearstream gives us the opportunity to put these advanced techniques to work  solving real-world issues.

These cases are especially unusual as they have not occurred among travelers returning from the tropical rainforest regions of Central and West Africa  the common circulation area for the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued an alert level 2 for the monkeypox virus.With the current uncertainty surrounding the clinical implications of the monkeypox virus  it is crucial to closely monitor its spread and provide reliable diagnostic solutions for its identification. This virus belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus  which encompasses pathogenic viruses like smallpox (Variola virus; eradicated)  cowpox or buffalopox  which exhibit similar symptoms in infected patients.The Mplex Monkeypox  Orthopox Real-time PCR assay uses a generic target for orthopox viruses and a specific target for monkeypox and will be available for research use only from the beginning of July. This product complements Gold Standard Diagnostics Europe’s suite of assays developed in response to infectious diseases  such as the GSD NovaPrime and NovaType assay families  developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection and variant identification.Reference[1] https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/world-map.htmlFor more information  please visit Eurofins Technologies website.About Eurofins Technologies – a fast growing provider of diagnostic technologies in the field of immunoassays and molecular detection methodsBuilding on the experience and scientific excellence of the Eurofins Group  Eurofins Technologies is a fast-growing global provider of diagnostic technologies and industry-leading ELISA-based instruments in the field of bioanalytical testing for the food  feed  environmental  animal health  and clinical diagnostics industries.About Eurofins – the global leader in bio-analysisEurofins is Testing for Life.

If granted  this will be the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe.The CHMP concluded by consensus after a thorough evaluation that  “the data on the vaccine were robust and met the EU criteria for efficacy  safety and quality.”Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  “We are pleased that the CHMP has recommended VLA2001  the only inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate in Europe  for full marketing authorization and are now looking forward to receiving marketing authorization from the EC. I would like to personally thank all those who have supported us in this endeavor  as well as everyone at Valneva for all their hard work. We hope that the EC and its member states will recognize the potential advantages of an inactivated vaccine and make a meaningful order  since we have clear evidence that Europeans are seeking a more traditional vaccine technology. Our aim is to further support public health in Europe by providing a new option for the 15% of Europeans over 18 who are not yet vaccinated[1].”Once granted by the EC  the marketing authorization would be valid in all European Union Member States as well as in Iceland  Liechtenstein  and Norway.The EMA’s CHMP opinion follows conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom  which was granted in April 2022[2]  and emergency use authorization granted in the United Arab Emirates in May 2022 and in Bahrain in March 2022.About VLA2001VLA2001 is currently the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted vaccine candidate in clinical trials against COVID-19 in Europe. It is intended for active immunization of at-risk populations to prevent carriage and symptomatic infection with COVID-19 during the pandemic and for routine vaccination including addressing new variants. VLA2001 may also be suited for boosting  as repeat booster vaccinations have been shown to work well with whole virus inactivated vaccines. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.com Joshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect topossible regulatory approval of VLA2001.
