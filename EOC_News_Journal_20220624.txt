6841,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/6/23/with-bond-deadline-looming-russia-days-away-from-default,With bond deadlines looming  Russia days away from default,Russia has failed to meet the deadlines because mounting sanctions are cutting off avenues to transfer the cash.,Russia has failed to meet the deadlines because mounting sanctions are cutting off avenues to transfer the cash.Russia faces yet another bond payment test this week  with just days remaining before it potentially slides into its first foreign default in a century.Three interest transfers totaling almost $400 million are due on Thursday and Friday  but more pressing is a Sunday-night deadline on previous missed payments from late May.Those funds ‚Äî about $100 million of bond coupons ‚Äî are stuck due to international sanctions  and the grace period to find a solution expires at the end of the day on June 26. At that point  Russia will effectively be in default  unless it somehow gets payments through to sufficient holders of the debt.It‚Äôs not that the government lacks the will or the money to pay. Billions of dollars of energy revenue pour into Kremlin coffers each week.Rather  it‚Äôs failed to meet the deadlines because mounting sanctions are cutting off avenues to transfer the cash.The goal in the White House is to punish the Kremlin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine by sealing its pariah status in the market for decades to come with the country‚Äôs first foreign default since the Bolshevik revolution more than a century ago.Russia argues that it‚Äôs being forced into default  and tried to find workarounds. It said its obligations will be deemed to have been fulfilled once payment is made in rubles  according to a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin setting out a mechanism for servicing the bonds. Earlier  Finance Minister Anton Siluanov had said the government would transfer rubles that could then be converted into foreign currencies.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done everything we can to lead the horse to water  but it‚Äôs not up to us whether it wants to drink or not ‚Äù Siluanov said last week.For the rest of this week  attention will be on the latest coupons coming due  and the Finance Ministry‚Äôs attempts to pay.Three coupon payments are due on Thursday and Friday. A failure to pay will set the clock ticking on a grace period of 30 days for the first two and 15 business days for the last.Coupon Close-UpFirst  on June 23  are payments on notes maturing in 2027 and 2047.Neither has a clause allowing Russia to pay in rubles  but they do allow for alternative currencies  including euros  sterling and Swiss francs  bond documents show. If the Finance Ministry intends to switch to one of these currencies  it needs to notify bondholders at least five days in advance.But like the coupons that are stuck  these payments must start their journey to bondholders at Russia‚Äôs sanctioned National Settlement Depository as paying agent. From the NSD  the money would normally go to international depositories like Euroclear and from there to custodian banks across the world where individual bondholders have their accounts.On June 24  a $159 million payment comes due on a note maturing in 2028 that has no alternative options to the dollar. The chances of it going through are remote since the US let a Treasury carve-out allowing Americans to receive Russia‚Äôs sovereign payments expire on May 25.What‚Äôs more  the designation on that bond indicates the payment process would take place via financial infrastructure outside Russia ‚Äî with JPMorgan Chase & Co. as paying agent.,negative,0.04,0.3,0.66,negative,0.01,0.07,0.92,True,English,"['bond deadlines', 'Russia', 'default', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Three interest transfers', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'National Settlement Depository', 'previous missed payments', 'first foreign default', 'bond payment test', 'Three coupon payments', 'Finance Ministry', 'first two', 'foreign currencies', 'mounting sanctions', 'Sunday-night deadline', 'international sanctions', 'grace period', 'sufficient holders', 'energy revenue', 'White House', 'pariah status', 'Bolshevik revolution', 'Swiss francs', 'bond documents', 'paying agent', 'international depositories', 'custodian banks', '$159 million payment', 'alternative options', 'payment process', 'financial infrastructure', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'sovereign payments', 'bond coupons', 'latest coupons', 'alternative currencies', 'late May', 'Kremlin coffers', '15 business days', 'individual bondholders', '30 days', 'Russia', 'deadlines', 'avenues', 'cash', 'century', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'funds', 'solution', 'end', 'June', 'point', 'debt', 'government', 'will', 'money', 'Billions', 'dollars', 'goal', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'market', 'decades', 'country', 'workarounds', 'obligations', 'rubles', 'decree', 'mechanism', 'bonds', 'everything', 'horse', 'water', 'week', 'attention', 'attempts', 'failure', 'clock', 'last', 'notes', 'clause', 'euros', 'sterling', 'advance', 'journey', 'NSD', 'Euroclear', 'world', 'accounts', 'chances', 'Treasury', 'Americans', 'designation', 'place', 'Co.']",2022-06-23,2022-06-24,aljazeera.com

These cases are especially unusual as they have not occurred among travelers returning from the tropical rainforest regions of Central and West Africa  the common circulation area for the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued an alert level 2 for the monkeypox virus.With the current uncertainty surrounding the clinical implications of the monkeypox virus  it is crucial to closely monitor its spread and provide reliable diagnostic solutions for its identification. This virus belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus  which encompasses pathogenic viruses like smallpox (Variola virus; eradicated)  cowpox or buffalopox  which exhibit similar symptoms in infected patients.The Mplex Monkeypox  Orthopox Real-time PCR assay uses a generic target for orthopox viruses and a specific target for monkeypox and will be available for research use only from the beginning of July. This product complements Gold Standard Diagnostics Europe‚Äôs suite of assays developed in response to infectious diseases  such as the GSD NovaPrime and NovaType assay families  developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection and variant identification.Reference[1] https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/world-map.htmlFor more information  please visit Eurofins Technologies website.About Eurofins Technologies ‚Äì a fast growing provider of diagnostic technologies in the field of immunoassays and molecular detection methodsBuilding on the experience and scientific excellence of the Eurofins Group  Eurofins Technologies is a fast-growing global provider of diagnostic technologies and industry-leading ELISA-based instruments in the field of bioanalytical testing for the food  feed  environmental  animal health  and clinical diagnostics industries.About Eurofins ‚Äì the global leader in bio-analysisEurofins is Testing for Life.

If granted  this will be the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe.The CHMP concluded by consensus after a thorough evaluation that  ‚Äúthe data on the vaccine were robust and met the EU criteria for efficacy  safety and quality.‚ÄùThomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  ‚ÄúWe are pleased that the CHMP has recommended VLA2001  the only inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate in Europe  for full marketing authorization and are now looking forward to receiving marketing authorization from the EC. I would like to personally thank all those who have supported us in this endeavor  as well as everyone at Valneva for all their hard work. We hope that the EC and its member states will recognize the potential advantages of an inactivated vaccine and make a meaningful order  since we have clear evidence that Europeans are seeking a more traditional vaccine technology. Our aim is to further support public health in Europe by providing a new option for the 15% of Europeans over 18 who are not yet vaccinated[1].‚ÄùOnce granted by the EC  the marketing authorization would be valid in all European Union Member States as well as in Iceland  Liechtenstein  and Norway.The EMA‚Äôs CHMP opinion follows conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom  which was granted in April 2022[2]  and emergency use authorization granted in the United Arab Emirates in May 2022 and in Bahrain in March 2022.About VLA2001VLA2001 is currently the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted vaccine candidate in clinical trials against COVID-19 in Europe. It is intended for active immunization of at-risk populations to prevent carriage and symptomatic infection with COVID-19 during the pandemic and for routine vaccination including addressing new variants. VLA2001 may also be suited for boosting  as repeat booster vaccinations have been shown to work well with whole virus inactivated vaccines. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva‚Äôs established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva‚Äôs licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO¬Æ. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B¬Æ vaccine. VLA2001‚Äôs manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

6899,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4520071-polymetal-poyyf-aucoy-suspended-poly-trades-london,Polymetal's ADR Quotes Suspended; POLY Ticker Still Trades In London (POYYF) (AUCOY),The options for trading Polymetal continue to shrink. Two ADRs  POYYF and AUCOY  are now suspended. Click here to read my thoughts and takeaways.,chonticha wat/iStock via Getty ImagesPolymetalPolymetal (OTCPK:POYYF) (OTCPK:AUCOY) is  as many will know  a UK listed company running gold mines in Russia and Kazakhstan. I've recently suggested that it's an excellent medium term speculation. The details of the company and why I think it's so are here. There's no point in repeating all of that  so read that there.There are - or perhaps were - five different ways of trading the stock. The main quote in London (LON:POLY) and similar quotes on the Kazakh and Moscow exchanges. All those three stocks are the same  entirely fungible one to the other. Moscow has problems these days of course and Almaty isn't seeing much volume.There were also two different US quotations  AUCOY and POYYF. The differences are explained here. At one point it was possible to sell the one to buy near twice as much of the other - despite the underlying being exactly the same. That arbitrage disappeared pretty quickly though  as detailed here.Now we've something of a sanctions effect on two of those securities. As the company explained this morning:Following the Executive Order 14066  14068  or 14071 and subsequent clarification of the scope of the legislation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control  trading in Polymetal's ADR program (tickers AUCOY/POYYF) has been halted since 15th of June  even though Polymetal's shares have not been issued by a Russian entity. After consulting with the depositary bank administering the program and our legal advisors regarding the situation the Company confirms that no shareholder rights are affected by this event  including right to receive dividends and voting rights. Shareholders holding ADRs can apply for conversion and receive underlying shares.While it's not directly said what is meant is that USG has got things wrong here but arguing with City Hall doesn't work. So  AUCOY and POYYF are suspended. It's possible for holders to just sit tight and wait. Or  apply to collect the underlying. That would be POLY listed in London.In comments on an earlier piece it appears that many to most American brokers aren't allowing trading in POLY - presumably under the same mistake about the law. This is not a recommendation for these specific brokers but from what I know both Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell in London are allowing trading. This is more an inference from the fact that Polymetal still appears on their lists of most traded stocks by their customers. Whether they'll trade for American citizens  sorry  just don't know  it will be necessary to try and find out.The futureAs I've been pointing out these past few months Polymetal isn't directly affected by sanctions. The major shareholders aren't sanctioned  their bank isn't  gold mining isn't - they seem to be threading through the restrictions. OK  there's those ADRs but that's not a huge and major problem.They did have a problem with auditors. But even that was not really them. As a London listed stock they need a UK auditor. Doing business in Russia they need someone to audit there of course. But their London auditor sliced off their Russian business given sanctions - meaning that there was no longer the one integrated company to do the full audit. Today Polymetal announced they'd solved that problem too.In the fuller announcement they also point out that there's rouble inflation  local bank loans are more expensive. Sanctions are limiting the import of the most up to date equipment  thereby raising costs. On the other hand they're still able to export gold  get paid. There's no local market for silver bullion which is a problem  but that's also only 5% of turnover. They're stockpiling production while they try to solve that.In effect the company has some problems  yes  but it's still a highly profitable gold miner even given current constraints. They say that production is still on target for this year. The next announcement is going to be H1 2022 production at the end of July. But the really big announcement is going to be the dividend.The dividendPolymetal has a significant dividend policy and the 2021 final was to be $0.52 per share. Given events that was put on hold. Not cancelled  just the decision whether to pay or not put to one side for a bit. The previous interim (i.e.  H1 2021) was $0.45. 45 cents that is.So  given the very generous assumption that the dividend policy will be maintained  that's roughly a $1 a year on a ¬£2 stock. Given the $/¬£ we're getting close to a 50% yield (no  it isn't  but back of envelope and all that).Now  one reaction to that is that given the dividend isn't being paid of course the yield is nothing. Which is fair  even if perhaps harsh. Another could be that if they do reinstate the dividend they're not going to at the old rate  no way. Because that would be ludicrous.But here are two things. Firstly  Polymetal has confirmed when they're going to make the decision about both the full year and also the H1 2022 dividend - 22 September. Or at least that's when they'll announce. That's possibly a significant valuation change there. Imagine if they did actually pay both dividends as per past profits shares?Now  normally  a dividend shouldn't make any difference to a share price. Profits retained and profits paid out  same thing. But in current circumstances I think that Polymetal returning to the dividend list would create a significant revaluation. And if they pay out on the past dividend schedules then at current share prices there's a 40% (which is more accurate than the 50% above) immediate cash return plus stock appreciation from that return to dividend paying.So  why won't they?OK  so the company could decide that such a payout would just be ridiculous. And to some extent it would be. They're not at any risk of a takeover so there's no real reason for them to be striving for a high share price in the short term. We're going to see some compression of the margins  from the high rouble  rouble inflation (and it's weird to have both of those at the same time) and the greater expenses of having to use less than optimal equipment and subcontractors. So they may well not. May not pay a dividend at all  or perhaps limit any they do pay.But there's also this:On the 3rd of June the European Union imposed sanctions on the Russian National Settlement Depositary (NSD) effectively blocking the operations between Euroclear and NSD. The Company is advised that this development makes it impossible for those shareholders who keep their shares in NSD (~22% of our share capital) to receive dividends and/or take part in any Company's corporate actions. Polymetal is consulting with its legal advisors and regulators to confirm the outcomes of these sanctions and measures that could be taken to secure shareholders' rights.If they do declare a dividend  then the 22% of the shareholder base who register through the Russian system cannot receive it. I don't see them screwing that much of their shareholder base to be honest.This gives us a decision tree.This is speculative  really  it is. There's just not enough information here to be certain about anything. But here's my read  for what little that read and opinion is worth. If Polymetal cannot solve that NSD problem  then they're likely to continue to hold the dividend. If Polymetal can work out a way to pay to those Russian holders  then I think they will. Maybe not the full dividend as we'd expect in the absence of the current troubles but at least the last full year plus a reasonable interim.Which becomes a speculation. Well  actually  it's a bet although we can gussie it up in polite language and call it a speculation. If Polymetal resumes dividends - that last year full year plus an interim - then I would expect a significant rise in the share price. Plus  obviously  significant income to shareholders. In the absence of this I don't particularly expect to see any great fall in the share price. The retained earnings would be  well  they'd be retained and reduce the debt burden or otherwise increase the corporate valuation.The thing to look for is whether there are any announcements about solving that NSD problem. That  to me  would be the trigger tipping the decision one way or the other.My viewI've said before that I think Polymetal is a good medium term speculation. I stick with that. What we're now looking at is more detail about exactly how it might - or may not - work.The investor viewThis all seems a bit too technical  I get that. It's if the dividend is paid  and the dividend might be paid if NSD and so on. And yet  well  that's how real world decisions do get made. If Polymetal can pay a dividend to all shareholders  then come 22 Sept I think they will. That's then an event to be long of the stock beforehand. If they can't  then they probably won't. So  the trigger for a significant position would be any announcement about solving that NSD problem.,neutral,0.02,0.77,0.22,mixed,0.07,0.13,0.8,True,English,"['ADR Quotes', 'POLY Ticker', 'Polymetal', 'Trades', 'London', 'POYYF', 'AUCOY', 'excellent medium term speculation', 'two different US quotations', 'five different ways', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'significant valuation change', 'most American brokers', 'profitable gold miner', 'local bank loans', 'significant dividend policy', 'one integrated company', 'London listed stock', 'specific brokers', 'American citizens', 'local market', 'two things', 'chonticha wat', 'Getty Images', 'main quote', 'similar quotes', 'Executive Order', 'subsequent clarification', 'Russian entity', 'depositary bank', 'legal advisors', 'shareholder rights', 'voting rights', 'City Hall', 'earlier piece', 'same mistake', 'Hargreaves Lansdown', 'AJ Bell', 'full audit', 'fuller announcement', 'rouble inflation', 'date equipment', 'other hand', 'silver bullion', 'current constraints', 'next announcement', 'big announcement', 'one side', 'previous interim', 'generous assumption', 'one reaction', 'old rate', 'gold mines', 'London auditor', 'Moscow exchanges', 'three stocks', 'one point', 'ADR program', 'major shareholders', 'UK auditor', 'Russian business', 'full year', 'major problem', 'H1 2022 dividend', 'underlying shares', 'H1 2022 production', 'sanctions effect', 'Polymetal Polymetal', '¬£2 stock', 'iStock', 'OTCPK', 'POYYF', 'AUCOY', 'Kazakhstan', 'details', 'problems', 'course', 'Almaty', 'volume', 'differences', 'arbitrage', 'something', 'securities', 'scope', 'legislation', 'Office', 'tickers', '15th', 'June', 'situation', 'event', 'dividends', 'ADRs', 'conversion', 'USG', 'comments', 'many', 'trading', 'law', 'recommendation', 'inference', 'fact', 'lists', 'customers', 'future', 'months', 'mining', 'restrictions', 'huge', 'auditors', 'someone', 'import', 'costs', 'turnover', 'target', 'July', '2021 final', 'decision', '45 cents', '50% yield', 'envelope', '22 September']",2022-06-24,2022-06-24,seekingalpha.com

Over 500 parcel lockers this year  and 5 000 in the coming years  will be made available to all UK carriers and retailers to offer convenient parcel pickup and drop-off locations and an exceptional shopping experience to their customers  with a flexible choice of pickup times and locations.Quadient teams have ensured technical integration with the systems of key carriers in the UK and have secured hundreds of prime locations for locker units to quickly scale. Quadient‚Äôs ambition is to establish a dense  large and scalable network to consolidate first and last mile deliveries  especially in urban areas where there is medium to high delivery density. Having readily available open access to a large parcel delivery network alleviates the mounting pressure experienced by carriers and retailers to scale to increasing demand and parcel volumes.Geoffrey Godet  chief executive officer at Quadient  said: ‚ÄúWe believe that building and growing a large  dense  and open intelligent locker network with an agnostic approach is the best way forward to address the challenges of large and growing e-commerce markets such as the UK  the third largest global e-commerce market. Our approach is to offer a common infrastructure available to any carrier or retailer for a volume-based fee  ensuring it is financially viable for all parties. Building upon our extensive experience managing large open networks  particularly in Japan  we are confident that customer adoption and usage will increase rapidly as we work with our partners to grow our footprint  enabling us to deliver the service in a profitable and sustainable manner.Story continues‚ÄúWe are creating the most compelling out-of-home delivery offer for the UK market  and we have already secured the commitment of one strategic partner  kicking-off the 500 first installations to be completed by the end of 2022.

Maintaining clear and transparent chain of custody is ensured thanks to a secure and centralized tracking and parcel management system. The lockers also offer the capacity to manage returns and Consumer to Consumer (C2C) parcels  helping retailers and carriers to address the increasing customer demand for simplicity and convenience when shipping  returning or picking up their online shopping.‚ÄúOur main focus is on convenience and cost-effectiveness  making sure that each unit in the field is in the right place for easy access and has the right capacity based on our partner carriers‚Äô data and experience ‚Äù said Duncan Groom  chief operating officer for DACH  Italy  UK & Ireland at Quadient. ‚ÄúQuadient‚Äôs Parcel Pending technology is modular and scalable  capable of adapting to customer requirements and evolving while volume grows. With limited space available in urban areas  not only it is important to preserve public space from multiple proprietary parcel locker networks  we also believe that consumers should be able to receive their parcels in their preferred location  regardless of the retailer or carrier they choose.

This expansion of its implants‚Äô ranges for spine surgery of complex pathologies is part of the group's strategy to become a key player of the market.After several months of marketing preparation  Spineway publicly presented its new products ranges and the consolidation of its team  with the aim of strengthening its sales in high profitable markets (EU  USA  Japan  Australia).Indeed  this congress was also the opportunity to present the 4 new members of the management team surrounding the CEO of the company  St√©phane Le Roux  all of them coming from the spine implants sector:- Fabrice Paccagnella  sales director France and French-speaking Africa  former founder of Distimp with more than 20 years of commercial experience - Fran√ßois Carlier  marketing and international sales director  former founder of Colorado with 30 years of experience in sales and marketing - Mourad Ben Mokhtar  R&D director  more than 20 years of experience in spine R&D - Pascale Davis  Scientific Director  former European Scientific and Marketing Director of a major player in the sector.Also  in the presence of the surgeons who have developed the group's new ranges of implants and instruments  some discussions on operating techniques in spinal surgery were held with most of the heads of departments and renowned surgeons of the French medical scenery.Story continuesSpineway is thus confirmed in its development strategy which seeks  through targeted external growth  to position itself as a European benchmark player in the spine sector  in particular  by extending its ‚Äúproduct‚Äù offer via Premium innovations.This action plan necessarily requires securing funding to ensure that the Group is permanently involved in this dynamic.With this in mind  the OCABSA contract signed with Negma on October 18th  2019  was extended by 3 months by amendment on June 13th  2022 and a new tranche of Convertible Bonds of ‚Ç¨2.5 million was issued on June 15th  2022 with an option for an additional tranche of an equivalent amount by the end of July 2022.The group is also working on its new financing plan in line with a desire for capital restructuring.

The EC is expected to make a decision within approximately 60 days following CHMP recommendation  which will be applicable to all 27 European Union Member States  in addition to Iceland  Norway and Liechtenstein.‚ÄúThe current treatment of generalized MG in Europe leaves many patients with insufficiently controlled symptoms that markedly decrease quality of life. Caregivers and medical teams are well aware of the need for new treatment options that are safe  effective and targeted to the disease biology‚Äù said Anthony B√©hin  MD neuromuscular physician at Institut de Myologie  La Piti√© Salp√©tri√®re  Paris. ‚ÄúAs a practicing neurologist regularly seeing people who live with this debilitating chronic disease  the CHMP‚Äôs positive opinion of efgartigimod represents an exciting advancement toward bringing a new treatment option to these patients in Europe.‚ÄùStory continuesThe MAA included results from the pivotal Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which were published in the July 2021 issue of The Lancet Neurology . The ADAPT trial met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that significantly more anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive gMG patients were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale following treatment with efgartigimod compared with placebo (68% vs. 30%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a two-point reduction on the MG-ADL scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle.There were additionally significantly more responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scale following treatment with efgartigimod compared with placebo (63% vs. 14%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a three-point reduction on the QMG scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle.Efgartigimod had a demonstrated safety profile in the ADAPT clinical trial. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infections (10.7% following treatment with efgartigimod vs. 4.8% of placebo) and urinary tract infections (9.5% vs. 4.8%).‚ÄúWe are thrilled by the CHMP‚Äôs recommendation in favor of efgartigimod  which brings us one step closer to delivering this therapy to people living with gMG in Europe and around the world ‚Äù said Anant Murthy  Ph.D.  General Manager  EU  argenx. ‚ÄúWe are confident in the European team we have built  and pending marketing authorization  look forward to close collaboration with regulatory bodies and government authorities across the region to ensure this treatment option will be available for as many patients as possible.‚ÄùEfgartigimod is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker in the U.S. as VYVGART (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for the treatment of adult gMG patients who are anti-AChR antibody positive and in Japan for those who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). argenx also plans to launch efgartigimod in Canada  China through its collaboration with Zai Lab  and select additional regions.About Phase 3 ADAPT TrialThe Phase 3 ADAPT trial was a 26-week randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multi-center  global trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod in adult patients with gMG. A total of 167 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod or placebo  in addition to stable doses of their current gMG treatment. ADAPT was designed to enable an individualized treatment approach with an initial treatment cycle followed by subsequent treatment cycles based on clinical evaluation. The primary endpoint was the comparison of percentage of MG-ADL responders in the first treatment cycle between efgartigimod and placebo treatment groups in the anti-AChR antibody positive population.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases. It is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positive  and Japan for adult patients with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first-and-only approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S. and Japan.For further information  please contact:Media:Kelsey Kirkkkirk@argenx.comInvestors:Beth DelGiaccobdelgiacco@argenx.comMichelle Greenblattmgreenblatt@argenx.comForward-looking StatementsThe contents of this announcement include statements that are  or may be deemed to be  ‚Äúforward-looking statements.‚Äù These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology  including the terms ‚Äúbelieves ‚Äù ‚Äúhope ‚Äù ‚Äúestimates ‚Äù ‚Äúanticipates ‚Äù ‚Äúexpects ‚Äù ‚Äúintends ‚Äù ‚Äúmay ‚Äù ‚Äúwill ‚Äù or ‚Äúshould‚Äù and include statements argenx makes concerning the timing of any approval or marketing authorization by the EC of efgartigimod as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who are AChR antibody positive.

Once again  we have shown that Valneva has the expertise to bring a vaccine all the way from bench to market. Since we began working on VLA2001  we have continued to receive messages from Europeans who are waiting for a more traditional vaccine technology. Now that we have received this full marketing authorization  we hope that the EC and its member states will place orders that reflect this demand. 15% of Europeans over 18 are not yet vaccinated[1]  and we believe that making our inactivated vaccine available could increase vaccination coverage and have a meaningful impact on public health.‚ÄùThe EC‚Äôs approval follows recommendations yesterday from the European Medicine Agency‚Äôs (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to grant marketing authorization.

VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B¬Æ vaccine. VLA2001‚Äôs manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein.

The positive CHMP opinion is a scientific recommendation for marketing authorization  serving as a basis for the EC‚Äôs final decision on argenx‚Äôs application for efgartigimod. The EC is expected to make a decision within approximately 60 days following CHMP recommendation  which will be applicable to all 27 European Union Member States  in addition to Iceland  Norway and Liechtenstein. ‚ÄúThe current treatment of generalized MG in Europe leaves many patients with insufficiently controlled symptoms that markedly decrease quality of life. Caregivers and medical teams are well aware of the need for new treatment options that are safe  effective and targeted to the disease biology‚Äù said Anthony B√©hin  MD neuromuscular physician at Institut de Myologie  La Piti√© Salp√©tri√®re  Paris. ‚ÄúAs a practicing neurologist regularly seeing people who live with this debilitating chronic disease  the CHMP‚Äôs positive opinion of efgartigimod represents an exciting advancement toward bringing a new treatment option to these patients in Europe.‚Äù The MAA included results from the pivotal Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which were published in the July 2021 issue of The Lancet Neurology . The ADAPT trial met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that significantly more anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive gMG patients were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale following treatment with efgartigimod compared with placebo (68% vs. 30%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a two-point reduction on the MG-ADL scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle. There were additionally significantly more responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scale following treatment with efgarigimod compared with placebo (63% vs. 14%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a three-point reduction on the QMG scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle.Efgartigimod had a demonstrated safety profile in the ADAPT clinical trial. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infections (10.7% following treatment with efgartigimod vs. 4.8% of placebo) and urinary tract infections (9.5% vs. 4.8%). ‚ÄúWe are thrilled by the CHMP‚Äôs recommendation in favor of efgartigimod  which brings us one step closer to delivering this therapy to people living with gMG in Europe and around the world ‚Äù said Anant Murthy  Ph.D.  General Manager  EU  argenx. ‚ÄúWe are confident in the European team we have built  and pending marketing authorization  look forward to close collaboration with regulatory bodies and government authorities across the region to ensure this treatment option will be available for as many patients as possible.‚ÄùEfgartigimod is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker in the U.S. as VYVGART (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for the treatment of adult gMG patients who are anti-AChR antibody positive and in Japan for those who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). argenx also plans to launch efgartigimod in Canada  China through its collaboration with Zai Lab  and select additional regions. About Phase 3 ADAPT Trial The Phase 3 ADAPT trial was a 26-week randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multi-center  global trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod in adult patients with gMG. A total of 167 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod or placebo  in addition to stable doses of their current gMG treatment. ADAPT was designed to enable an individualized treatment approach with an initial treatment cycle followed by subsequent treatment cycles based on clinical evaluation. The primary endpoint was the comparison of percentage of MG-ADL responders in the first treatment cycle between efgartigimod and placebo treatment groups in the anti-AChR antibody positive population. About Efgartigimod Efgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases. It is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positive  and Japan for adult patients with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies. About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1. About argenx argenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first-and-only approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S. and Japan.
