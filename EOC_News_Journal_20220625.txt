6899,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4520071-polymetal-poyyf-aucoy-suspended-poly-trades-london,Polymetal's ADR Quotes Suspended; POLY Ticker Still Trades In London (POYYF) (AUCOY),The options for trading Polymetal continue to shrink. Two ADRs  POYYF and AUCOY  are now suspended. Click here to read my thoughts and takeaways.,chonticha wat/iStock via Getty ImagesPolymetalPolymetal (OTCPK:POYYF) (OTCPK:AUCOY) is  as many will know  a UK listed company running gold mines in Russia and Kazakhstan. I've recently suggested that it's an excellent medium term speculation. The details of the company and why I think it's so are here. There's no point in repeating all of that  so read that there.There are - or perhaps were - five different ways of trading the stock. The main quote in London (LON:POLY) and similar quotes on the Kazakh and Moscow exchanges. All those three stocks are the same  entirely fungible one to the other. Moscow has problems these days of course and Almaty isn't seeing much volume.There were also two different US quotations  AUCOY and POYYF. The differences are explained here. At one point it was possible to sell the one to buy near twice as much of the other - despite the underlying being exactly the same. That arbitrage disappeared pretty quickly though  as detailed here.Now we've something of a sanctions effect on two of those securities. As the company explained this morning:Following the Executive Order 14066  14068  or 14071 and subsequent clarification of the scope of the legislation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control  trading in Polymetal's ADR program (tickers AUCOY/POYYF) has been halted since 15th of June  even though Polymetal's shares have not been issued by a Russian entity. After consulting with the depositary bank administering the program and our legal advisors regarding the situation the Company confirms that no shareholder rights are affected by this event  including right to receive dividends and voting rights. Shareholders holding ADRs can apply for conversion and receive underlying shares.While it's not directly said what is meant is that USG has got things wrong here but arguing with City Hall doesn't work. So  AUCOY and POYYF are suspended. It's possible for holders to just sit tight and wait. Or  apply to collect the underlying. That would be POLY listed in London.In comments on an earlier piece it appears that many to most American brokers aren't allowing trading in POLY - presumably under the same mistake about the law. This is not a recommendation for these specific brokers but from what I know both Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell in London are allowing trading. This is more an inference from the fact that Polymetal still appears on their lists of most traded stocks by their customers. Whether they'll trade for American citizens  sorry  just don't know  it will be necessary to try and find out.The futureAs I've been pointing out these past few months Polymetal isn't directly affected by sanctions. The major shareholders aren't sanctioned  their bank isn't  gold mining isn't - they seem to be threading through the restrictions. OK  there's those ADRs but that's not a huge and major problem.They did have a problem with auditors. But even that was not really them. As a London listed stock they need a UK auditor. Doing business in Russia they need someone to audit there of course. But their London auditor sliced off their Russian business given sanctions - meaning that there was no longer the one integrated company to do the full audit. Today Polymetal announced they'd solved that problem too.In the fuller announcement they also point out that there's rouble inflation  local bank loans are more expensive. Sanctions are limiting the import of the most up to date equipment  thereby raising costs. On the other hand they're still able to export gold  get paid. There's no local market for silver bullion which is a problem  but that's also only 5% of turnover. They're stockpiling production while they try to solve that.In effect the company has some problems  yes  but it's still a highly profitable gold miner even given current constraints. They say that production is still on target for this year. The next announcement is going to be H1 2022 production at the end of July. But the really big announcement is going to be the dividend.The dividendPolymetal has a significant dividend policy and the 2021 final was to be $0.52 per share. Given events that was put on hold. Not cancelled  just the decision whether to pay or not put to one side for a bit. The previous interim (i.e.  H1 2021) was $0.45. 45 cents that is.So  given the very generous assumption that the dividend policy will be maintained  that's roughly a $1 a year on a ¬£2 stock. Given the $/¬£ we're getting close to a 50% yield (no  it isn't  but back of envelope and all that).Now  one reaction to that is that given the dividend isn't being paid of course the yield is nothing. Which is fair  even if perhaps harsh. Another could be that if they do reinstate the dividend they're not going to at the old rate  no way. Because that would be ludicrous.But here are two things. Firstly  Polymetal has confirmed when they're going to make the decision about both the full year and also the H1 2022 dividend - 22 September. Or at least that's when they'll announce. That's possibly a significant valuation change there. Imagine if they did actually pay both dividends as per past profits shares?Now  normally  a dividend shouldn't make any difference to a share price. Profits retained and profits paid out  same thing. But in current circumstances I think that Polymetal returning to the dividend list would create a significant revaluation. And if they pay out on the past dividend schedules then at current share prices there's a 40% (which is more accurate than the 50% above) immediate cash return plus stock appreciation from that return to dividend paying.So  why won't they?OK  so the company could decide that such a payout would just be ridiculous. And to some extent it would be. They're not at any risk of a takeover so there's no real reason for them to be striving for a high share price in the short term. We're going to see some compression of the margins  from the high rouble  rouble inflation (and it's weird to have both of those at the same time) and the greater expenses of having to use less than optimal equipment and subcontractors. So they may well not. May not pay a dividend at all  or perhaps limit any they do pay.But there's also this:On the 3rd of June the European Union imposed sanctions on the Russian National Settlement Depositary (NSD) effectively blocking the operations between Euroclear and NSD. The Company is advised that this development makes it impossible for those shareholders who keep their shares in NSD (~22% of our share capital) to receive dividends and/or take part in any Company's corporate actions. Polymetal is consulting with its legal advisors and regulators to confirm the outcomes of these sanctions and measures that could be taken to secure shareholders' rights.If they do declare a dividend  then the 22% of the shareholder base who register through the Russian system cannot receive it. I don't see them screwing that much of their shareholder base to be honest.This gives us a decision tree.This is speculative  really  it is. There's just not enough information here to be certain about anything. But here's my read  for what little that read and opinion is worth. If Polymetal cannot solve that NSD problem  then they're likely to continue to hold the dividend. If Polymetal can work out a way to pay to those Russian holders  then I think they will. Maybe not the full dividend as we'd expect in the absence of the current troubles but at least the last full year plus a reasonable interim.Which becomes a speculation. Well  actually  it's a bet although we can gussie it up in polite language and call it a speculation. If Polymetal resumes dividends - that last year full year plus an interim - then I would expect a significant rise in the share price. Plus  obviously  significant income to shareholders. In the absence of this I don't particularly expect to see any great fall in the share price. The retained earnings would be  well  they'd be retained and reduce the debt burden or otherwise increase the corporate valuation.The thing to look for is whether there are any announcements about solving that NSD problem. That  to me  would be the trigger tipping the decision one way or the other.My viewI've said before that I think Polymetal is a good medium term speculation. I stick with that. What we're now looking at is more detail about exactly how it might - or may not - work.The investor viewThis all seems a bit too technical  I get that. It's if the dividend is paid  and the dividend might be paid if NSD and so on. And yet  well  that's how real world decisions do get made. If Polymetal can pay a dividend to all shareholders  then come 22 Sept I think they will. That's then an event to be long of the stock beforehand. If they can't  then they probably won't. So  the trigger for a significant position would be any announcement about solving that NSD problem.,neutral,0.02,0.77,0.22,mixed,0.07,0.13,0.8,True,English,"['ADR Quotes', 'POLY Ticker', 'Polymetal', 'Trades', 'London', 'POYYF', 'AUCOY', 'excellent medium term speculation', 'two different US quotations', 'five different ways', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'significant valuation change', 'most American brokers', 'profitable gold miner', 'local bank loans', 'significant dividend policy', 'one integrated company', 'London listed stock', 'specific brokers', 'American citizens', 'local market', 'two things', 'chonticha wat', 'Getty Images', 'main quote', 'similar quotes', 'Executive Order', 'subsequent clarification', 'Russian entity', 'depositary bank', 'legal advisors', 'shareholder rights', 'voting rights', 'City Hall', 'earlier piece', 'same mistake', 'Hargreaves Lansdown', 'AJ Bell', 'full audit', 'fuller announcement', 'rouble inflation', 'date equipment', 'other hand', 'silver bullion', 'current constraints', 'next announcement', 'big announcement', 'one side', 'previous interim', 'generous assumption', 'one reaction', 'old rate', 'gold mines', 'London auditor', 'Moscow exchanges', 'three stocks', 'one point', 'ADR program', 'major shareholders', 'UK auditor', 'Russian business', 'full year', 'major problem', 'H1 2022 dividend', 'underlying shares', 'H1 2022 production', 'sanctions effect', 'Polymetal Polymetal', '¬£2 stock', 'iStock', 'OTCPK', 'POYYF', 'AUCOY', 'Kazakhstan', 'details', 'problems', 'course', 'Almaty', 'volume', 'differences', 'arbitrage', 'something', 'securities', 'scope', 'legislation', 'Office', 'tickers', '15th', 'June', 'situation', 'event', 'dividends', 'ADRs', 'conversion', 'USG', 'comments', 'many', 'trading', 'law', 'recommendation', 'inference', 'fact', 'lists', 'customers', 'future', 'months', 'mining', 'restrictions', 'huge', 'auditors', 'someone', 'import', 'costs', 'turnover', 'target', 'July', '2021 final', 'decision', '45 cents', '50% yield', 'envelope', '22 September']",2022-06-24,2022-06-25,seekingalpha.com

Over 500 parcel lockers this year  and 5 000 in the coming years  will be made available to all UK carriers and retailers to offer convenient parcel pickup and drop-off locations and an exceptional shopping experience to their customers  with a flexible choice of pickup times and locations.Quadient teams have ensured technical integration with the systems of key carriers in the UK and have secured hundreds of prime locations for locker units to quickly scale. Quadient‚Äôs ambition is to establish a dense  large and scalable network to consolidate first and last mile deliveries  especially in urban areas where there is medium to high delivery density. Having readily available open access to a large parcel delivery network alleviates the mounting pressure experienced by carriers and retailers to scale to increasing demand and parcel volumes.Geoffrey Godet  chief executive officer at Quadient  said: ‚ÄúWe believe that building and growing a large  dense  and open intelligent locker network with an agnostic approach is the best way forward to address the challenges of large and growing e-commerce markets such as the UK  the third largest global e-commerce market. Our approach is to offer a common infrastructure available to any carrier or retailer for a volume-based fee  ensuring it is financially viable for all parties. Building upon our extensive experience managing large open networks  particularly in Japan  we are confident that customer adoption and usage will increase rapidly as we work with our partners to grow our footprint  enabling us to deliver the service in a profitable and sustainable manner.Story continues‚ÄúWe are creating the most compelling out-of-home delivery offer for the UK market  and we have already secured the commitment of one strategic partner  kicking-off the 500 first installations to be completed by the end of 2022. With our proven experience  our scale in the parcel locker business globally  and with the support of a strong team in the UK  we are ready to onboard other major market players in the coming months as our network grows.‚ÄùQuadient‚Äôs carrier-agnostic Parcel Pending by Quadient intelligent locker network will significantly contribute to reducing stops and missed deliveries  achieving cost savings  and consolidating drop-offs  returns and pickups to one stop via secure  24/7 accessible lockers. Maintaining clear and transparent chain of custody is ensured thanks to a secure and centralized tracking and parcel management system. The lockers also offer the capacity to manage returns and Consumer to Consumer (C2C) parcels  helping retailers and carriers to address the increasing customer demand for simplicity and convenience when shipping  returning or picking up their online shopping.‚ÄúOur main focus is on convenience and cost-effectiveness  making sure that each unit in the field is in the right place for easy access and has the right capacity based on our partner carriers‚Äô data and experience ‚Äù said Duncan Groom  chief operating officer for DACH  Italy  UK & Ireland at Quadient. ‚ÄúQuadient‚Äôs Parcel Pending technology is modular and scalable  capable of adapting to customer requirements and evolving while volume grows. With limited space available in urban areas  not only it is important to preserve public space from multiple proprietary parcel locker networks  we also believe that consumers should be able to receive their parcels in their preferred location  regardless of the retailer or carrier they choose. We absolutely trust that making our solution available to all retailers  carriers and users will accelerate parcel locker adoption and contribute to reducing environmental impact  while providing the peace of mind of 24/7 parcel pick-up and drop-off.‚ÄùAbout Quadient¬ÆQuadient is the driving force behind the world‚Äôs most meaningful customer experiences.

This expansion of its implants‚Äô ranges for spine surgery of complex pathologies is part of the group's strategy to become a key player of the market.After several months of marketing preparation  Spineway publicly presented its new products ranges and the consolidation of its team  with the aim of strengthening its sales in high profitable markets (EU  USA  Japan  Australia).Indeed  this congress was also the opportunity to present the 4 new members of the management team surrounding the CEO of the company  St√©phane Le Roux  all of them coming from the spine implants sector:- Fabrice Paccagnella  sales director France and French-speaking Africa  former founder of Distimp with more than 20 years of commercial experience - Fran√ßois Carlier  marketing and international sales director  former founder of Colorado with 30 years of experience in sales and marketing - Mourad Ben Mokhtar  R&D director  more than 20 years of experience in spine R&D - Pascale Davis  Scientific Director  former European Scientific and Marketing Director of a major player in the sector.Also  in the presence of the surgeons who have developed the group's new ranges of implants and instruments  some discussions on operating techniques in spinal surgery were held with most of the heads of departments and renowned surgeons of the French medical scenery.Story continuesSpineway is thus confirmed in its development strategy which seeks  through targeted external growth  to position itself as a European benchmark player in the spine sector  in particular  by extending its ‚Äúproduct‚Äù offer via Premium innovations.This action plan necessarily requires securing funding to ensure that the Group is permanently involved in this dynamic.With this in mind  the OCABSA contract signed with Negma on October 18th  2019  was extended by 3 months by amendment on June 13th  2022 and a new tranche of Convertible Bonds of ‚Ç¨2.5 million was issued on June 15th  2022 with an option for an additional tranche of an equivalent amount by the end of July 2022.The group is also working on its new financing plan in line with a desire for capital restructuring. As such  a share buyback program was renewed by the Combined General Meeting of April 11th  2022. The program launched allows to serve a free share allocation plan for management up to 6.94 % of shares currently outstanding.Finally  Spineway has initiated a share consolidation project according to the resolutions that will be submitted to the Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders convened for July 25th  2022.Upcoming: July 13th 2022  Turnover 1st semester 2022SPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PEA-PME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

Caregivers and medical teams are well aware of the need for new treatment options that are safe  effective and targeted to the disease biology‚Äù said Anthony B√©hin  MD neuromuscular physician at Institut de Myologie  La Piti√© Salp√©tri√®re  Paris. ‚ÄúAs a practicing neurologist regularly seeing people who live with this debilitating chronic disease  the CHMP‚Äôs positive opinion of efgartigimod represents an exciting advancement toward bringing a new treatment option to these patients in Europe.‚ÄùStory continuesThe MAA included results from the pivotal Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which were published in the July 2021 issue of The Lancet Neurology . The ADAPT trial met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that significantly more anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive gMG patients were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale following treatment with efgartigimod compared with placebo (68% vs. 30%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a two-point reduction on the MG-ADL scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle.There were additionally significantly more responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scale following treatment with efgartigimod compared with placebo (63% vs. 14%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a three-point reduction on the QMG scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle.Efgartigimod had a demonstrated safety profile in the ADAPT clinical trial. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infections (10.7% following treatment with efgartigimod vs. 4.8% of placebo) and urinary tract infections (9.5% vs. 4.8%).‚ÄúWe are thrilled by the CHMP‚Äôs recommendation in favor of efgartigimod  which brings us one step closer to delivering this therapy to people living with gMG in Europe and around the world ‚Äù said Anant Murthy  Ph.D.  General Manager  EU  argenx. ‚ÄúWe are confident in the European team we have built  and pending marketing authorization  look forward to close collaboration with regulatory bodies and government authorities across the region to ensure this treatment option will be available for as many patients as possible.‚ÄùEfgartigimod is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker in the U.S. as VYVGART (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for the treatment of adult gMG patients who are anti-AChR antibody positive and in Japan for those who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). argenx also plans to launch efgartigimod in Canada  China through its collaboration with Zai Lab  and select additional regions.About Phase 3 ADAPT TrialThe Phase 3 ADAPT trial was a 26-week randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multi-center  global trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod in adult patients with gMG. A total of 167 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod or placebo  in addition to stable doses of their current gMG treatment. ADAPT was designed to enable an individualized treatment approach with an initial treatment cycle followed by subsequent treatment cycles based on clinical evaluation. The primary endpoint was the comparison of percentage of MG-ADL responders in the first treatment cycle between efgartigimod and placebo treatment groups in the anti-AChR antibody positive population.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases. It is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positive  and Japan for adult patients with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first-and-only approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S. and Japan.For further information  please contact:Media:Kelsey Kirkkkirk@argenx.comInvestors:Beth DelGiaccobdelgiacco@argenx.comMichelle Greenblattmgreenblatt@argenx.comForward-looking StatementsThe contents of this announcement include statements that are  or may be deemed to be  ‚Äúforward-looking statements.‚Äù These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology  including the terms ‚Äúbelieves ‚Äù ‚Äúhope ‚Äù ‚Äúestimates ‚Äù ‚Äúanticipates ‚Äù ‚Äúexpects ‚Äù ‚Äúintends ‚Äù ‚Äúmay ‚Äù ‚Äúwill ‚Äù or ‚Äúshould‚Äù and include statements argenx makes concerning the timing of any approval or marketing authorization by the EC of efgartigimod as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who are AChR antibody positive.

The marketing authorization will cover all 28 European Union Member States as well as Iceland  Liechtenstein  and Norway.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  ‚ÄúWe are extremely pleased that the EC granted full marketing authorization for VLA2001  the only inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine available in Europe. Once again  we have shown that Valneva has the expertise to bring a vaccine all the way from bench to market. Since we began working on VLA2001  we have continued to receive messages from Europeans who are waiting for a more traditional vaccine technology. Now that we have received this full marketing authorization  we hope that the EC and its member states will place orders that reflect this demand. 15% of Europeans over 18 are not yet vaccinated[1]  and we believe that making our inactivated vaccine available could increase vaccination coverage and have a meaningful impact on public health.‚ÄùThe EC‚Äôs approval follows recommendations yesterday from the European Medicine Agency‚Äôs (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to grant marketing authorization. This new marketing authorization in Europe follows conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom  which was granted in April 2022[2]  and emergency use authorization granted in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in May 2022 and March 2022  respectively.About VLA2001VLA2001 is the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine which has received marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva‚Äôs established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva‚Äôs licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO¬Æ. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B¬Æ vaccine. VLA2001‚Äôs manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLa√´titia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.com Joshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to possible regulatory approval of VLA2001.

Reneging on its debt would be a blow to Russia‚Äôs prestige and could trigger legal action from some creditors.Why are stock markets so volatile right now? Your browser does not support the audio element.‚ÄúRussia is heading to default because of sanctions because it invaded Ukraine and is committing war crimes ... it‚Äôs entirely in its ability to determine what happens here ‚Äù said Timothy Ash  emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management.Russia has plenty of foreign currency because of its vast oil and gas revenues  but international sanctions have cut the country off from the global financial system and complicated its ability to pay foreign bondholders.The payments originally due on May 27 were sent to Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD). It would then typically pass them to international securities depositories such as Belgium-based Euroclear or Luxembourg‚Äôs Clearstream  which settle trades for clients. However  the EU sanctioned NSD in early June  shutting off western institutions‚Äô ability to receive payment.Russian officials  including finance minister Anton Siluanov  have repeatedly stated that western governments were trying to force the country into an ‚Äúartificial‚Äù default and have persistently sought ways to circumvent the sanctions  saying Moscow would pay in roubles if dollars cannot reach bondholders.‚ÄúThey can say whatever they want but a contract‚Äôs a contract and it clearly stipulates how and when it‚Äôs honoured ‚Äù said Ash. ‚ÄúAs a creditor  you just want your money back  the excuses are meaningless.‚ÄùRussian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree this week setting out a new mechanism to make upcoming payments in roubles  including a further $400 million due on Thursday and Friday  and then allow investors to convert them into foreign currencies. Unlike some of Russia‚Äôs debt  the terms of these bonds do not contain any provisions for making payments in roubles.Although sanctions had already left little prospect of Moscow returning to international bond markets for the foreseeable future  a formal default could further complicate any attempt to issue debt and increase borrowing costs once the curbs were lifted  said experts.For foreign holders of Russian debt  the damage has already largely been done through the collapse in bond prices that followed the invasion of Ukraine. Tatiana Orlova  lead emerging markets economist at Oxford Economics  said the fact that critical sanctions loopholes have been closed makes it incredibly difficult for foreign bondholders to recover their investments.Since Russia is likely to default because of sanctions rather than a lack of cash  there is expected to be little impact on its population.
