Russia says the money was sent to Euroclear  a bank which would then distribute the payment to investors.But that payment has been stuck there  according to Bloomberg News  and creditors have not received it.""They have not got it "" says Jay Auslander  a US lawyer who has worked on many government debt cases. ""And the overwhelming probability is they're not going to get it.""If this money has not arrived within 30 days of the due date  that is  Sunday evening  that will widely be considered a default.Euroclear wouldn't say if the payment had been blocked  but said it adheres to all sanctions.Default appears inevitableDefault seemed inevitable when the US Treasury decided not to renew the special exemption in sanctions rules allowing investors to receive interest payments from Russia  which expired on 25 May.Story continuesThe Kremlin now appears to have accepted this inevitability too  decreeing on 23 June stating that all future debt payments would be made in roubles through a Russian bank  the National Settlements Depository  even when contracts state they should be in dollars or other international currencies.Finance Minister Anton Siluanov admitted foreign investors would ""not be able to receive"" the payments according to the RIA Novosti news agency.This was for two reasons  he said. ""The first is that foreign infrastructure - correspondent banks  settlement and clearing systems  depositories - ares prohibited from conducting any operations related to Russia. The second is that foreign investors are expressly prohibited from receiving payments from us.""Because Russia wants to pay and has plenty of money to do it  he denied that this amounts to a genuine default  which usually occur when governments refuse to pay  or their economies are so weak that they cannot find the money.""Everyone in the know understands that this is not a default at all "" RIA Novosti quoted him. ""This whole situation looks like a farce.""Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov branded the situation ""a farce""It's not clear how a default would be officially declared.The credit ratings agencies  which assess the creditworthiness of borrowers  would normally play the role of officially declaring a default  but they are banned from covering Russia by EU sanctions.And the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee  which determines whether payments have been missed and investors can claim on insurance-like contracts called Credit Default Swaps  has already ruled that Russia failed to pay  after it didn't pay around $2m interest due on a late payment in May.Alternatively  the creditors themselves could declare a default  and request that Russia pays the entire value of the debts back right away. Other creditors to Russia could also claim immediate repayments on their debts  under so-called cross-default provisions  Mr Auslander says.If Russia fails to pay  they could go to court to try to get their money.Though default would be a symbolic blow  it would have few immediate practical consequences for Russia.Defaulting nations usually find it impossible to borrow any more money  but Russia is already effectively barred from borrowing in Western markets by sanctions.In any case  it is reportedly earning around a billion dollars a day from fossil fuel exports  and Siluanov said in April the country has no plans to borrow more.",negative,0.02,0.23,0.75,mixed,0.04,0.15,0.81,True,English,"['debt deadline', 'Russia', 'brink', 'default', 'Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov', 'Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee', 'many government debt cases', 'RIA Novosti news agency', 'credit ratings agencies', 'National Settlements Depository', 'fossil fuel exports', 'international banking networks', 'immediate practical consequences', 'other international currencies', 'future debt payments', '$100m interest payment', 'first debt default', 'Russian government', 'Bloomberg News', 'Russian bank', '$2m interest', 'immediate repayments', 'international creditors', 'Sunday deadline', 'The Kremlin', 'major blow', 'inevitable path', 'chaotic end', 'Boris Yeltsin', 'Jay Auslander', 'overwhelming probability', 'due date', 'Sunday evening', 'special exemption', 'two reasons', 'foreign infrastructure', 'correspondent banks', 'clearing systems', 'entire value', 'Other creditors', 'cross-default provisions', 'Mr Auslander', 'symbolic blow', 'Defaulting nations', 'Western markets', 'interest payments', 'late payment', 'first default', 'US lawyer', 'US Treasury', 'sanctions rules', 'foreign investors', 'billion dollars', 'genuine default', 'EU sanctions', 'ministry', 'brink', 'money', 'prestige', 'situation', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'country', 'access', 'world', 'time', 'debts', 'euros', 'half', 'regime', '27 May', 'Euroclear', '30 days', '25 May', 'Story', 'inevitability', '23 June', 'roubles', 'contracts', 'depositories', 'operations', 'plenty', 'governments', 'economies', 'Everyone', 'know', 'farce', 'creditworthiness', 'borrowers', 'role', 'court', 'April', 'plans']",2022-06-25,2022-06-26,news.yahoo.com
