REUTERS/Johanna Geron//File PhotoLONDON  June 27 (Reuters) - Russia's first major international debt default in over a century  which Washington said became a fact on Monday  follows months of co-ordinated Western sanctions that left Moscow with cash but no access to the international financial network.Below is a summary of the key moments that have led up to this point.THE ""BIG PACKAGE""At around 11.30 p.m. (2230 GMT) on Feb. 25  the day after Russian troops entered Ukraine  European Union's experts in Brussels said a set of sanctions they had worked on for days  or the ""Big Package"" as they called it  was ready.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterJust before midnight  the European Commission announced the measures.While emergency Group of Seven and EU meetings earlier made clear a response was coming  the package named Vladimir Putin and his top diplomat Sergei Lavrov personally  and  as it later became clear  froze some $300 billion of the Russian central bank's reserves.""That was really the moment when we said  okay  well we've done it "" one European source told Reuters. ""That was  I think  a very pivotal moment for a lot of people around a table.""SWIFT ACTIONDays later  on March 2  the EU struck again by banning seven Russian banks from SWIFT  an international financial messaging system crucial for cross-border transactions. read moreBooting Russian lenders from SWIFT had long been considered a 'nuclear option ' but the invasion put it on the table and when the EU decided to activate it  those at SWIFT headquarters just outside Brussels were ready.The only question was how long they had to implement the move  ""five days or five minutes?"" another source said. In the end is was 10-12 days.FIRST CUTS  BUT NOT THE DEEPESTCredit rating agency  S&P Global  already stripped Moscow of its coveted investment grade rating on Feb. 26 and Russian bonds were slumping  but a heavier blow followed on March 15  when the EU told top credit agencies to stop rating Russian dept or risk losing their licenses to operate in the bloc. read more""We were caught flat-footed  certainly we were not given any advanced warning "" one senior rating agency analyst said. ""Basically the question was  does this mean we can't rate Russia any more?"" It turned out the answer was yes.DEFAULT DEADLINE ONEWith so many hurdles being erected  expectations built that Russia would default on its first post-sanctions' bond payments either on March 16  or a month later at the end of a 30-day ""grace period."" read moreHowever  a special ""waiver"" in the U.S. sanctions granted by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control allowed payments to go through.UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCESOn April 8  a week before the EU ban on Russian ratings was due to come into force  S&P declared Russia in ""selective default"" after Moscow said it planned to make upcoming bond payments in roubles rather than dollars  their issue currency. read moreOn May 3 though  shortly before the payment was due  the Kremlin U-turned and paid in dollars.SHOCK TO THE SYSTEMDays later  Russia had stumbled  though.On May 11  sharp-eyed creditors spotted that Moscow had failed to add $1.9 million of extra interest that had built up on bonds that only got paid in their grace periods rather than on time. They contacted the clearing house Euroclear and then bond market equivalent of an insurance payment arbiter - the Credit Derivative Determinations Committee which ruled that a ""credit event"" had happened.The sum was too small to trigger default clauses in all of Russia's international bonds  but it did mean some investors expected to receive default insurance payments.But when the U.S. Treasury clarified on its website that buying Russian bonds on the open  or 'secondary' market  was banned  that credit default swap (CDS) insurance process had to be halted as it was no longer clear what to do with the bonds involved.""It is a bit like if your house burns down and the insurance company turns around and claims it was the wrong kind of fire "" said Joe Delvaux  emerging markets distressed debt portfolio manager at Europe's largest fund manager Amundi. ""The reality is that these sanctions are a shock to the system.""INTENDED CONSEQUENCESThe step that made Russia's default unavoidable though was Washington's May 24 decision to let the waiver that had allowed U.S. bondholders to receive Russia's payments  expire.A week later  the EU also sanctioned Russia's domestic paying agent  its National Settlement Depository (NSD)  which it had been using to make the payments.Moscow has blamed the West for forcing an ""artificial default"". read more   with its finance minister Anton Siluanov calling the situation a ""farce.""However  veteran global policymakers involved in the process say they sanctions are unprecedented but fully justified.""They were very significant actions that responded to the magnitude of the actions that Russia undertook "" Agustin Carstens  the head of the world's central bank umbrella body  the Bank for International Settlements  said.(This story refiles to fixe typo in 1st paragraph)Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterAdditional reporting by John O'Donnell in Frankfurt  Francesco Guarascio in Brussels  Andrew MacAskill  Karin Strohecker and Vincent Flasseur in London and Gavin Jones in Milan Editing by Tomasz JanowskiOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",negative,0.01,0.14,0.85,negative,0.02,0.08,0.9,True,English,"['Big Package', 'Reuters.com', 'Russia', 'default', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'one senior rating agency analyst', 'first major international debt default', 'finance minister Anton Siluanov', 'Credit Derivative Determinations Committee', 'international financial messaging system', ""first post-sanctions' bond payments"", 'European Union leaders summit', 'international financial network', 'Credit rating agency', 'debt portfolio manager', 'DEFAULT DEADLINE ONE', 'investment grade rating', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'largest fund manager', 'domestic paying agent', 'National Settlement Depository', 'veteran global policymakers', 'U.S. bondholders', 'credit default swap', 'top credit agencies', '30-day ""grace period', 'upcoming bond payments', 'Russian central bank', 'bond market equivalent', 'S&P Global', 'one European source', 'FREE unlimited access', 'U.S. Treasury', 'insurance payment arbiter', 'CDS) insurance process', 'U.S. sanctions', 'default insurance payments', 'Reuters.com Register', 'seven Russian banks', 'Russian oil sanctions', 'FIRST CUTS', 'international bonds', 'credit event', 'insurance company', 'selective default', 'default clauses', 'artificial default', 'European Commission', 'top diplomat', 'grace periods', 'Russian troops', 'Russian lenders', 'Russian dept', 'Russian ratings', 'Johanna Geron', 'File Photo', 'a century', 'key moments', 'emergency Group', 'Sergei Lavrov', 'cross-border transactions', 'heavier blow', 'advanced warning', 'many hurdles', 'UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES', 'issue currency', 'sharp-eyed creditors', 'extra interest', 'wrong kind', 'Joe Delvaux', 'emerging markets', 'Russian bonds', 'THE SYSTEM', 'Western sanctions', 'BIG PACKAGE', 'pivotal moment', 'SWIFT ACTION', 'SWIFT headquarters', 'five minutes', '10-12 days', 'special ""waiver', 'clearing house', 'May 24 decision', 'EU meetings', 'EU ban', 'response', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'Brussels', 'Belgium', 'LONDON', 'June', 'Washington', 'fact', 'Monday', 'months', 'Moscow', 'cash', 'summary', 'point', '2230 GMT', 'Feb.', 'experts', 'midnight', 'measures', 'Putin', 'reserves', 'lot', 'people', 'table', 'March', 'question', 'move', 'DEEPEST', 'licenses', 'bloc', 'answer', 'expectations', 'Office', 'April', 'force', 'roubles', 'dollars', 'Kremlin', 'SHOCK', 'time', 'Euroclear', 'investors', 'website', 'secondary', 'fire', 'Amundi', 'reality', 'step', 'NSD', 'situation', '11.30']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,reuters.com

6969,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/557931-russia-rejects-default-claims/,Russia rejects default claims,Russia has fulfilled its Eurobond obligations to foreign investors  and there is no reason to declare a default  Kremlin says Read Full Article at RT.com,All bond payments were made on time  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insistsRussia has fulfilled its Eurobond obligations to foreign investors  and the fact that the funds were not forwarded to recipients due to Ukraine-related sanctions is no reason to declare a default  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.“No  we don’t agree ” Peskov said when asked by a reporter to comment on a report by Bloomberg claiming that Russia had defaulted on its debt for the first time since 1918.Peskov said that such claims are “absolutely unjustified” since the payment on the Eurobonds was made well before the deadline in mid-May.“And the fact that Euroclear withheld this money  did not transfer it to the recipients  this is no longer our problem. That is  there is no reason to call this a default ” Peskov explained.Bloomberg’s report followed the end of the one-month grace period in which payments on Russia’s government bonds were supposed to be transferred to bondholders. Russia’s Ministry of Finance sent the funds to the National Settlement Depository on May 20  a week before the payments were due  so that the money could reach investors before the expiry of the US license that allowed Russia to service its external debt despite Ukraine-related sanctions. The license expired on May 25  after which Russia’s payments in dollars and euros were blocked in the international settlement and clearing system Euroclear. However  Euroclear failed to forward the funds to investors before the license expired.Echoing Peskov’s words  the Russian Finance Ministry on Monday also reiterated that it had fulfilled Russia’s debt obligations in full in accordance with the Eurobond issuance documentation.“However  international settlement and clearing systems  having received funds in full in advance  having the legal and financial ability to bring these funds to the final recipients  did not take the necessary steps to do this ” the ministry stated. It also noted that  according to the official documents for the Eurobond issue  a default is defined as a debtor’s failure to transfer funds  while there is no specific guidance on the further movement of these funds after they enter the clearing system.“In this case  the non-receipt of money by investors did not occur as a result of the absence of payment  but due to the actions of third parties  which is not expressly provided for in the issuance documentation as an event of default ” the statement said.The ministry added that Russia does not refuse to fulfill its debt obligations to investors and will continue to do so in the future and advised bondholders to contact the relevant financial institutions regarding the fate of their money directly  as “the actions of foreign financial intermediaries are beyond the control of the Russian Ministry of Finance.”Last week  Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree that allows Russia to pay off its foreign currency debt through a ruble account at the exchange rate on the domestic market. To receive their funds  foreign investors need to open ruble accounts to which the ruble payments are to be transferred. After that  Russia's foreign-currency debt obligations will be considered “properly fulfilled.”For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.05,0.54,0.41,negative,0.01,0.13,0.85,True,English,"['default claims', 'Russia', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov', 'one-month grace period', 'relevant financial institutions', 'National Settlement Depository', 'foreign financial intermediaries', 'foreign currency debt', 'foreign-currency debt obligations', 'Eurobond issuance documentation', 'Russian Finance Ministry', 'financial ability', 'Russian Ministry', 'Eurobond obligations', 'international settlement', 'Eurobond issue', 'external debt', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'government bonds', 'clearing system', 'necessary steps', 'official documents', 'specific guidance', 'third parties', 'ruble account', 'exchange rate', 'domestic market', 'business section', 'foreign investors', 'first time', 'bond payments', 'ruble payments', 'US license', 'final recipients', 'fact', 'funds', 'reason', 'default', 'reporters', 'Monday', 'Bloomberg', 'claims', 'Eurobonds', 'deadline', 'mid-May', 'Euroclear', 'money', 'problem', 'end', 'bondholders', 'expiry', 'dollars', 'euros', 'words', 'accordance', 'advance', 'legal', 'debtor', 'failure', 'movement', 'case', 'receipt', 'result', 'absence', 'actions', 'event', 'statement', 'future', 'fate', 'control', 'decree', 'stories', 'economy']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,rt.com

However the term expired without payment.It is Russia’s latest economic collapse on the debt-front following a default on its domestic debts in 1998 and and after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution where Moscow failed to pay off its international debts.Russia owes about $40 bn in foreign bonds. Russian officials denied the reports of a default  however. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov on Thursday said that “anyone can declare whatever they like. But anyone who understands what’s going on knows that this is in no way a default ” reported Bloomberg.The Kremlin also rejected the claims on Monday. In a call with reporters  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia made bond payments due in May but the fact they had been blocked by Euroclear because of Western sanctions on Russia was “not our problem”.Rating agencies monitoring the situation  like Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s  have already categorised the country’s debt into junk territory.The rumblings in the Russian market continued elsewehere as the Ruble  which plummeted to a historic low just hours after the invasion  was recorded down by about 40 per cent against the dollar on Monday.For more than 120 days now  Russia’s central bank’s foreign reserves have remained frozen and its top banks excluded from the global financial system.Sanctions imposed by Ukraine’s allies have damaged the Russian economy and pushed foreign companies to exit the Russian market.

But the stigma would probably raise its borrowing costs in future.The payments in question are $100 million in interest on two bonds  one denominated in U.S. dollars and another in euros  that Russia was due to pay on May 27. The payments had a grace period of 30 days  which expired on Sunday.Russia’s finance ministry said it made the payments to its onshore National Settlement Depository (NSD) in euros and dollars  adding it had fulfilled obligations.In a call with reporters  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the fact that payments had been blocked by Euroclear because of Western sanctions on Russia was “not our problem.”Clearing house Euroclear did not respond to a request for comment.Some Taiwanese holders of the bonds had not received payments on Monday  sources told Reuters.With no exact deadline specified in the prospectus  lawyers say Russia might have until the end of the following business day to pay these bondholders.Credit ratings agencies usually formally downgrade a country’s credit rating to reflect default  but this does not apply in case of Russia as most agencies no longer rate the country.LEGAL TANGLEThe legal situation surrounding the bonds looks complex.Russia’s bonds have been issued with an unusual variety of terms  and an increasing level of ambiguities for those sold more recently  when Moscow was already facing sanctions over its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and a poisoning incident in Britain in 2018.Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal  chair in banking and finance law at Queen Mary University in London  said clarity was needed on what constituted a discharge for Russia on its obligation  or the difference between receiving and recovering payments.“All these issues are subject to interpretation by a court of law ” Olivares-Caminal told Reuters.In some ways  Russia has been in default already.A committee on derivatives has ruled a “credit event” had occurred on some of Russia’s securities  which triggered a payout on some of Russia’s credit default swaps - instruments used by investors to insure against debt default.This was triggered by Russia failing to make a $1.9 million payment in accrued interest on a payment that had been due in early April.Until the Ukraine invasion  a sovereign default had seemed unthinkable  with Russia having an investment grade rating shortly before that point. A default would also be unusual as Moscow has the funds to service its debt.The U.S. Treasury’s OFAC had issued a temporary waiver  known as a general license 9A  in early March to allow Moscow to keep paying investors. The U.S. let the waiver expire on May 25 as Washington tightened sanctions on Russia  effectively cutting off payments to U.S. investors and entities.The lapsed OFAC license is not Russia’s only obstacle. In early June  the European Union imposed sanctions on the NSD  Russia’s appointed agent for its Eurobonds.Moscow has tried in the past few days to find ways of dealing with upcoming payments and avoid a default.President Vladimir Putin signed a decree last Wednesday to launch temporary procedures and give the government 10 days to choose banks to handle payments under a new scheme  suggesting Russia will consider its debt obligations fulfilled when it pays bondholders in roubles and onshore in Russia.“Russia saying it’s complying with obligations under the terms of the bond is not the whole story ” Zia Ullah  partner and head of corporate crime and investigations at law firm Eversheds Sutherland told Reuters.“If you as an investor are not satisfied  for instance  if you know the money is stuck in an escrow account  which effectively would be the practical impact of what Russia is saying  the answer would be  until you discharge the obligation  you have not satisfied the conditions of the bond.”Be smart with your money.

Following reports that Moscow had failed to pay about $100 million in interest on two bonds during a 30-day grace period that expired Sunday  the White House said the default showed the power of Western sanctions imposed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine. “This morning’s news around the finding of Russia’s default  for the first time in more than a century  situates just how strong the reactions are that the US  along with allies and partners  have taken  as well as how dramatic the impact has been on Russia’s economy ” a senior administration official said on the sidelines of a G7 summit in Germany.The article says analysts had expected the default sooner but rising energy prices cushioned the blow.

This whole situation looks like a farce.""Defaulting nations usually find it impossible to borrow any more money  but Russia is already in effect barred from borrowing in Western markets by sanctions.Also  Russia is reportedly earning about $1bn a day from fossil fuel exports  and its finance minister Anton Siluanov said in April the country had no plans to borrow more.Repayment triggerThe default will trigger repayments on a large chunk of Russia's debt  according to Mr Weafer.About $40bn of Russia's debts are denominated in dollars or euros  with around half held outside the country.""Some parts of that debt will now become automatically due because there will be early repayment clauses in all debt instruments so if you default on one it usually triggers the immediate demand for payment on the other debts  so Russia could certainly face immediate debt repayment of about $20bn at this stage "" he told the BBC's Today programme.Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov says the so-called default is a farce""Russia's last debt default of any kind was in 1998 as the country was rocked by the rouble crisis during the chaotic end of Boris Yeltsin's regime. At the time Moscow failed to keep up payments on its domestic bonds and defaulted on some overseas debt.Russia has seemed on an inevitable path to default since sanctions were first imposed by the US and European Union following the invasion of Ukraine.These restricted the country's access to the international banking networks which would process payments from Russia to investors around the world.The Russian government has said it wants to make all of its payments on time  and up until now it had succeeded.Default seemed inevitable when the US Treasury decided not to renew the special exemption in sanctions rules allowing investors to receive interest payments from Russia  which expired on 25 May.The Kremlin now appears to have accepted this inevitability too  decreeing on 23 June stating that all future debt payments would be made in roubles through a Russian bank  the National Settlements Depository  even when contracts state they should be in dollars or other international currencies.Meanwhile  Mr Weafer  who is based in Moscow  said that life was more or less operating as normal despite sanctions and Western companies withdrawing from Russia.""If you're in Moscow right now frankly  if you weren't reading the newspapers  you'd see there's been a price increase but otherwise life is as it was before February 24.""In March and April there was a lot of concern that products would disappear  that factories would not be able to get components or materials to continue operating and we could be looking therefore at a severe drop in employment or a rise in unemployment by the summer [or] early autumn. That situation has improved "" he added.""We've seen alternative import routes opening via Kazakhstan and Turkey  the government has promoted what they call a parallel import scheme so effectively a lot of products that were blocked in March and April are now starting to reappear  albeit at a higher price.""",negative,0.01,0.1,0.89,mixed,0.03,0.09,0.89,True,English,"['first time', 'Russia', 'debt', 'Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov', 'Russia finance minister Anton Siluanov', 'Moscow-based consultancy Macro Advisory', 'RIA Novosti news wire', 'global financial system', 'Reuters news agency', 'fossil fuel exports', 'National Settlements Depository', 'early repayment clauses', 'The White House', 'international banking networks', 'other international currencies', 'immediate debt repayment', 'future debt payments', '$100m interest payment', 'last debt default', 'Bloomberg News', 'Russian bonds', 'Russian government', 'Repayment trigger', 'immediate demand', 'The Kremlin', 'Russian bank', 'international bonds', 'Market trader', 'key deadline', '$100m payment', 'major blow', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'short-term impact', 'high-priced commodities', 'Chris Weafer', 'chief executive', 'Taiwanese holders', 'two sources', 'due date', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Defaulting nations', 'Western markets', 'large chunk', 'Mr Weafer', 'other debts', 'rouble crisis', 'chaotic end', 'Boris Yeltsin', 'domestic bonds', 'inevitable path', 'European Union', 'special exemption', 'Western companies', 'international creditors', 'debt instruments', 'overseas debt', 'interest payments', 'intermediary bank', 'international sanctions', 'legacy"" problem', 'Sunday evening', 'US Treasury', 'first time', 'genuine default', 'foreign investors', 'sanctions rules', 'customer', 'money', 'sum', 'country', 'prestige', 'statements', 'reserves', 'yields', 'situation', 'revenue', 'oil', 'Ukraine', 'sort', 'action', 'economy', 'recovery', 'stage', '27 May', 'Euroclear', 'euros', '30 days', 'invasion', 'Story', 'fact', 'plenty', 'governments', 'economies', 'Everyone', 'know', 'farce', 'effect', 'April', 'plans', 'repayments', 'dollars', 'half', 'parts', 'BBC', 'Today', 'programme', 'kind', 'regime', 'access', 'world', '25 May', 'inevitability', '23 June', 'roubles', 'contracts', 'life']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,ca.sports.yahoo.com

Then this plan is for you.The meeting in the Bavarian Alps is aimed at putting pressure on the Russian economy without fuelling further rises in inflation.The G7 leaders are planning further sanction targeting Moscow's military production  and Russia's revenues  including from gold  a US statement said.While Kyiv endured the heaviest bombing it has seen in weeks  leaders have discussed putting a price cap on Moscow's oil revenues and raising new tariffs on Russian goods.Oil embargoes  implemented by the US and Canada  and planned by the end of the year by most of the EU  have failed to cut Russia's revenues  and added to a surge in energy prices.US treasury secretary Janet Yellen has proposed to tackle it with a price cap  in exchange for sanctions relief for those trading Russian oil.The economic powerhouses also plan to ""restrict Russia's access to key industrial inputs  services  and technologies produced by our economies "" especially those supporting Russia's industrial base  according to the US statement.The sanctions would target major state-owned defence enterprises  defence research organisations  and dozens of other defence-related entities and individuals  the US statement said.However  EU countries would need unanimity among the 27-member bloc to impose a new round of sanctions.Hungary  which has held up for a month the latest  seventh  round of EU sanctions over its objections to banning oil imports  said it is open to discussing new sanctions  bar on energy  although Budapest considers the sanctions strategy a ""dead-end street"".Balázs Orbán  political director for the prime minister Viktor Orbán told EUobserver last Friday that it is time to consider whether the sanctions strategy is working  adding that ""we have concerns.""""If Europeans are thinking that except for the energy they still want to have sanctions against all the concerns raised by not the Hungarians  but the Americans  and Westerners or the expert  think tank people  we can sit down and discuss it "" Orbán said  underlining that energy is a red line for Hungary.DefaultMeanwhile  US president Joe Biden and EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen have accused Russia of continuing ""to use natural gas as a political and economic weapon"" in a joint statement.The two leaders said Moscow's ""politically-motivated disruption"" to gas supplies to several EU member states underlines the need to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian energy.The White House said on Monday that Russia had defaulted on its foreign sovereign bonds on Monday for the first time since 1917  a claim that later Moscow rejected.""There are no grounds to call this situation a default "" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Peskov argued that Russia made bond payments due in May  but the fact they had been blocked by Euroclear  a bank which then distributes the payment to international creditors  because of Western sanctions.Peskov said it was ""not our problem"".The G7 leaders also called on Moscow to ""cease  without condition  its attacks on agricultural and transport infrastructure and enable free passage of agricultural shipping from Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea.""The G7 gathering is set to be followed by a Nato leaders-level summit in Madrid  later in the week.Meanwhile  Russian missiles hit a shopping mall with reportedly some 1 000

Russia defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in a century  according to reports. For months following the country's invasion of Ukraine  Western sanctions have stymied its attempts to fulfill its obligations. On Sunday — when the grace period on around $100 million of interest payments due on May 27 expired — bondholders told The Wall Street Journal and Reuters they had not received their payments.But Russia's finance ministry said it made the payments on the bonds denominated in euros by sending the money to Euroclear  a bank that would then distribute the finances to investors. Labelling the situation ""a farce""  the Kremlin said any default is artificial  as it has the money to pay its debts  but sanctions are hampering institutions' ability to accept it.As the final grace period has passed  a deadline considered an event of default if missed  the focus is now on bondholders of 25% of the outstanding bonds  and whether they agree to declare that a default has occurred.In other news:Mohamed El-Erian.

There are absolutely no grounds to call such situation a default.”Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Monday  the finance ministry said that ‘actions of foreign financial intermediaries are beyond of the Russian finance ministry’s control ’ asking foreign bondholders to speak directly to those withholding the payments.“The non-receipt of money by investors did not occur because of lack of payment but due to the third party actions and which is not directly spelled out as a default situation by issue documentation ” the ministry added.As the U.S. waiver expired and the European Union sanctioned the National Settlement Depository (NSD)  the Russian version of Euroclear and Clearstream western clearing houses  last week Moscow paid its next coupons due in forex in roubles.President Vladimir Putin ordered last week that debt obligations would be considered fulfilled once a rouble payment equal to the forex amount due was made. Bondholders would need to open an account at a Russian bank to receive the payment.Moscow would not block the payment’s conversion into forex and its transfer abroad but investors would need to say in writing they don’t have claims against Russia  the ministry has said. The banks are yet to be announced.‘FINANCIAL NUCLEAR BOMB’The Group of Seven major Western powers banned transactions with Russia’s central bank and froze its assets held in their jurisdictions  worth around $300 billion  after Russia launched what it called special military operation in Ukraine in February.Some western politicians have called to seize the reserves frozen to rebuild Ukraine – the idea two high-ranked Russian financial sources said they believed was behind the announcement of default and which Moscow considers artificial.“By announcing a default  they can claim that sanctions work. Economically  financially assets could be confiscated legally ” one of the two sources said.Peskov reiterated on Monday that reserves were blocked ‘unlawfully’ and any attempts to use them would ‘amount to outright theft.’“I believe that a financial nuclear bomb was used against us  no country in the history of mankind has experienced such sanctions pressure as Russia is now ” Alexei Moiseev  Russian deputy finance minister  said last week.(Reporting by Reuters; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel),negative,0.02,0.21,0.76,negative,0.01,0.11,0.88,True,English,"['western financial agents', 'Russia', 'default', 'investors', 'two high-ranked Russian financial sources', 'Clearstream western clearing houses', 'Seven major Western powers', 'key U.S. waiver', 'Russian deputy finance minister', 'May forex coupon payment', 'euro coupon transfers', 'FINANCIAL NUCLEAR BOMB', 'National Settlement Depository', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'Frank Jack Daniel', 'foreign financial intermediaries', 'third party actions', 'Russian finance ministry', 'two sources', 'western politicians', 'Russian version', 'Russian bank', 'foreign currency', 'last week', 'issue conditions', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'issue documentation', 'European Union', 'next coupons', 'debt obligations', 'forex amount', 'The Group', 'central bank', 'outright theft', 'Alexei Moiseev', 'foreign bondholders', 'rouble payment', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'sanctions pressure', 'default situation', 'Eurobonds', 'dollar', 'transactions', 'investors', 'Statements', 'call', 'reporters', 'Monday', 'fact', 'Euroclear', 'money', 'recipients', 'problem', 'grounds', 'request', 'comment', 'control', 'payments', 'non', 'receipt', 'lack', 'NSD', 'Moscow', 'roubles', 'account', 'conversion', 'writing', 'claims', 'banks', 'assets', 'jurisdictions', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'reserves', 'idea', 'announcement', 'attempts', 'country', 'history', 'mankind', 'Reuters', 'Editing']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,fxempire.com

In the end is was 10-12 days.FIRST CUTS  BUT NOT THE DEEPESTCredit rating agency  S&P Global  already stripped Moscow of its coveted investment grade rating on Feb. 26 and Russian bonds were slumping  but a heavier blow followed on March 15  when the EU told top credit agencies to stop rating Russian dept or risk losing their licenses to operate in the bloc.“We were caught flat-footed  certainly we were not given any advanced warning ” one senior rating agency analyst said. “Basically the question was  does this mean we can’t rate Russia any more?” It turned out the answer was yes.Driven to default Driven to default https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/RUSSIA-BONDS/mopanryzgva/chart.pngDefault deadline oneWith so many hurdles being erected  expectations built that Russia would default on its first post-sanctions’ bond payments either on March 16  or a month later at the end of a 30-day “grace period.”However  a special “waiver” in the U.S. sanctions granted by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control allowed payments to go through.Unintended consequencesOn April 8  a week before EU ban on Russian ratings was due to come into force  S&P declared Russia in “selective default” after Moscow said it planned to make upcoming bond payments in roubles rather than dollars  their issue currency.On May 3 though  shortly before the payment was due  the Kremlin U-turned and paid in dollars.Shock to the systemDays later  Russia had stumbled  though.On May 11  sharp-eyed creditors spotted that Moscow had failed to add $1.9 million of extra interest that had built up on bonds that only got paid in their grace periods rather than on time. They contacted the clearing house Euroclear and then bond market equivalent of an insurance payment arbiter – the Credit Derivative Determinations Committee https://www.cdsdeterminationscommittees.org/cds/the-russian-federation which ruled that a “credit event” had happened.The sum was too small to trigger default clauses in all of Russia’s international bonds  but it did mean some investors expected to receive default insurance payments.But when the U.S. Treasury clarified on its website that buying Russian bonds on the open  or ‘secondary’ market  was banned  that CDS insurance process had to be halted as it was no longer clear what to do with the bonds involved.“It is a bit like if your house burns down and the insurance company turns around and claims it was the wrong kind of fire ” said Joe Delvaux  emerging markets distressed debt portfolio manager at Europe’s largest fund manager Amundi. “The reality is that these sanctions are a shock to the system.”Intended consequencesThe step that made Russia’s default unavoidable though was Washington’s May 24 decision to let the waiver that had allowed U.S. bondholders receive Russia’s payments  expire.A week later  the EU also sanctioned Russia’s domestic paying agent  its National Settlement Depository (NSD)  which it had been using to make the payments.Moscow has blamed the West for forcing an “artificial default”.  with its finance minister Anton Siluanov calling the situation a “farce.”However  veteran global policymakers involved in the process say they sanctions are unprecedented but fully justified.“They were very significant actions that responded to the magnitude of the actions that Russia undertook ” Agustin Carstens  the head of the world’s central bank umbrella body  the Bank for International Settlements  said.Biden stresses power of U.S. sanctions https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjvqkloyovx/Pasted%20image%201656321187075.png(Additional reporting by John O’Donnell in Frankfurt  Francesco Guarascio in Brussels  Andrew MacAskill  Karin Strohecker and Vincent Flasseur in London and Gavin Jones in Milan; Editing by Tomasz Janowski),negative,0.02,0.14,0.84,mixed,0.04,0.1,0.86,True,English,"['Big Package', 'The', 'Russia', 'one senior rating agency analyst', 'Credit Derivative Determinations Committee', 'central bank umbrella body', 'international financial messaging system', 'first post-sanctions’ bond payments', 'Credit rating agency', 'investment grade rating', 'top credit agencies', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'debt portfolio manager', 'largest fund manager', 'domestic paying agent', 'National Settlement Depository', 'veteran global policymakers', 'John O’Donnell', 'bond market equivalent', 'U.S. bondholders', '30-day “grace period', 'upcoming bond payments', 'S&P Global', 'seven Russian banks', 'U.S. sanctions', 'U.S. Treasury', 'insurance payment arbiter', 'default insurance payments', 'CDS insurance process', 'FIRST CUTS', 'credit event', 'insurance company', 'International Settlements', 'grace periods', 'secondary’ market', 'international bonds', 'Russian lenders', 'Russian dept', 'Russian ratings', 'consilium.europa', 'cross-border transactions', '10-12 days', 'heavier blow', 'advanced warning', 'Default deadline', 'many hurdles', 'Unintended consequences', 'selective default', 'issue currency', 'sharp-eyed creditors', 'extra interest', 'default clauses', 'wrong kind', 'Joe Delvaux', 'emerging markets', 'artificial default', 'finance minister', 'Anton Siluanov', 'Agustin Carstens', 'Pasted%20image', 'Additional reporting', 'Francesco Guarascio', 'Andrew MacAskill', 'Karin Strohecker', 'Vincent Flasseur', 'Gavin Jones', 'Tomasz Janowski', 'Russian bonds', 'Swift action', 'SWIFT headquarters', 'five minutes', 'special “waiver', 'clearing house', 'significant actions', 'May 24 decision', 'EU ban', 'March', 'press-releases', 'military-aggression', 'ukraine', 'swift-system', 'restrictions', 'invasion', 'table', 'Brussels', 'question', 'move', 'source', 'DEEPEST', 'Moscow', 'Feb.', 'licenses', 'bloc', 'answer', 'graphics', 'reuters', 'RUSSIA-BONDS', 'mopanryzgva', 'chart', 'expectations', 'Office', 'April', 'force', 'roubles', 'dollars', 'Kremlin', 'Shock', 'time', 'Euroclear', 'cdsdeterminationscommittees', 'org', 'russian-federation', 'sum', 'investors', 'website', 'fire', 'Europe', 'Amundi', 'reality', 'step', 'Washington', 'NSD', 'West', 'situation', 'magnitude', 'world', 'Biden', 'power', 'fingfx', 'zjvqkloyovx', 'Frankfurt', 'London', 'Milan', 'Editing']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,fxempire.com

But the stigma would probably raise its borrowing costs in future.The payments in question are $100 million in interest on two bonds  one denominated in U.S. dollars and another in euros  that Russia was due to pay on May 27. The payments had a grace period of 30 days  which expired on Sunday.Russia’s finance ministry said it made the payments to its onshore National Settlement Depository (NSD) in euros and dollars  adding it had fulfilled obligations.In a call with reporters  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the fact that payments had been blocked by Euroclear because of Western sanctions on Russia was “not our problem.”Clearing house Euroclear did not respond to a request for comment.Some Taiwanese holders of the bonds had not received payments on Monday  sources told Reuters.With no exact deadline specified in the prospectus  lawyers say Russia might have until the end of the following business day to pay these bondholders.Credit ratings agencies usually formally downgrade a country’s credit rating to reflect default  but this does not apply in case of Russia as most agencies no longer rate the country.Legal tangleThe legal situation surrounding the bonds looks complex.Russia’s bonds have been issued with an unusual variety of terms  and an increasing level of ambiguities for those sold more recently  when Moscow was already facing sanctions over its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and a poisoning incident in Britain in 2018.Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal  chair in banking and finance law at Queen Mary University in London  said clarity was needed on what constituted a discharge for Russia on its obligation  or the difference between receiving and recovering payments.“All these issues are subject to interpretation by a court of law ” Olivares-Caminal told Reuters.In some ways  Russia has been in default already.A committee on derivatives has ruled a “credit event” had occurred on some of Russia’s securities  which triggered a payout on some of Russia’s credit default swaps — instruments used by investors to insure against debt default.This was triggered by Russia failing to make a $1.9 million payment in accrued interest on a payment that had been due in early April.Until the Ukraine invasion  a sovereign default had seemed unthinkable  with Russia having an investment grade rating shortly before that point. A default would also be unusual as Moscow has the funds to service its debt.The U.S. Treasury’s OFAC had issued a temporary waiver  known as a general license 9A  in early March to allow Moscow to keep paying investors. The U.S. let the waiver expire on May 25 as Washington tightened sanctions on Russia  effectively cutting off payments to U.S. investors and entities.The lapsed OFAC license is not Russia’s only obstacle. In early June  the European Union imposed sanctions on the NSD  Russia’s appointed agent for its Eurobonds.Moscow has tried in the past few days to find ways of dealing with upcoming payments and avoid a default.President Vladimir Putin signed a decree last Wednesday to launch temporary procedures and give the government 10 days to choose banks to handle payments under a new scheme  suggesting Russia will consider its debt obligations fulfilled when it pays bondholders in rubles and onshore in Russia.“Russia saying it’s complying with obligations under the terms of the bond is not the whole story ” Zia Ullah  partner and head of corporate crime and investigations at law firm Eversheds Sutherland told Reuters.“If you as an investor are not satisfied  for instance  if you know the money is stuck in an escrow account  which effectively would be the practical impact of what Russia is saying  the answer would be  until you discharge the obligation  you have not satisfied the conditions of the bond.”Reporting by Karin Strohecker in London  Andrea Shalal in Elmau and Emily Chan in Taipei and Sujata Rao in London.,negative,0.02,0.16,0.82,negative,0.01,0.17,0.82,True,English,"['historic default', 'Russia', 'sanctions', 'U.S. Treasury Department', 'The U.S. Treasury', 'U.S. official', 'global financial system', 'National Settlement Depository', 'following business day', 'Queen Mary University', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'investment grade rating', 'general license 9A', 'U.S. dollars', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'gas export revenues', 'Credit ratings agencies', 'U.S. investors', 'Clearing house Euroclear', 'key payment deadline', 'credit default swaps', 'first major default', 'The Kremlin', 'gas revenues', 'White House', 'most agencies', 'credit event', 'first time', 'exact deadline', 'a century', 'G7 summit', 'Bolshevik revolution', 'Dennis Hranitzky', 'sovereign litigation', 'Quinn Emanuel', 'borrowing costs', 'grace period', 'finance ministry', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'Taiwanese holders', 'Legal tangle', 'legal situation', 'unusual variety', 'increasing level', 'poisoning incident', '$1.9 million payment', 'early April', 'early June', 'European Union', 'temporary procedures', 'new scheme', 'OFAC license', 'artificial default', 'Russian default', 'formal default', 'sovereign default', 'law firm', 'Sunday deadline', 'finance law', 'international bonds', 'outstanding bonds', 'two bonds', 'plentiful oil', 'Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal', 'temporary waiver', 'early March', 'sweeping sanctions', 'Western sanctions', 'debt default', 'overdue interest', 'late May', 'debt obligations', 'upcoming payments', 'Ukraine invasion', 'LONDON', 'country', 'money', 'claims', 'bondholders', 'Monday', 'expiry', 'Feb.', 'news', 'finding', 'actions', 'allies', 'partners', 'impact', 'economy', 'sidelines', 'Germany', 'efforts', 'roadblock', 'Office', 'Moscow', 'question', 'head', 'Reuters', 'moment', 'stigma', 'future', 'euros', '30 days', 'onshore', 'NSD', 'call', 'reporters', 'fact', 'problem', 'request', 'comment', 'Some', 'sources', 'prospectus', 'lawyers', 'end', 'case', 'terms', 'ambiguities', 'annexation', 'Crimea', 'Britain', 'chair', 'banking', 'clarity', 'discharge', 'difference', 'issues', 'interpretation', 'court', 'ways', 'committee', 'derivatives', 'securities', 'payout', 'instruments', 'point', 'funds', 'paying', 'Washington', 'entities', 'lapsed', 'obstacle', 'agent', 'Eurobonds', 'past', 'decree', 'government', '10 days', 'banks', 'rubles']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,stltoday.com

There are absolutely no grounds to call such a situation a default "" Peskov said.""There is money and there is also the readiness to pay "" Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said last month of the looming default  calling the situation ""artificially created"" by ""unfriendly"" powers.What happens now?The default status is also unlikely to affect the lives of ordinary Russians  already struggling with soaring inflation and steep economic recession.Despite this  the default status is likely to dissuade investors even further from bringing any money into Russia  which has become a political and financial outcast since its invasion of Ukraine in February. It will also raise Moscow's borrowing costs in the future.Under normal circumstances  investors and the defaulting government typically reach a settlement in which bondholders are given new bonds that are worth less but that at least provide partial compensation. But sanctions forbid negotiating with the Russian Finance Ministry  and with no end to the war in sight there is no way to say how much the defaulted bonds will end up being worth.Last Wednesday  Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to launch temporary protection procedures and give the government 10 days to choose banks to handle payments under a new scheme  suggesting Moscow plans to pay bondholders back in rubles regardless of what currency the debt is owed in.Default unlikely to have international effectInvestment analysts have said the default  while problematic for the Kremlin  is unlikely to wreak havoc on global markets. Kristalina Georgieva  managing director of the International Monetary Fund  has called the event ""not systemically relevant.""The turn of events will likely mean serious losses for any international businesses left engaging with the Russian economy  such as funds that invest in emerging markets. Russia  however  played only a small role in emerging market bond indexes before the war  limiting the losses to fund investors.Russia has not been in a state of default since the 1917 revolution that created the Soviet Union.

There are absolutely no grounds to call such a situation a default ” he said.Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Until last week  Russia kept on paying on its Eurobonds in foreign currency  yet its dollar and euro coupon transfers made in May did not reach investors. Moscow owes $100m in interest on one bond priced in dollars and one priced in euros  which was originally due for payment on May 27.On Monday  the Russian finance ministry said that “actions of foreign financial intermediaries are beyond the Russian finance ministry’s control”  and directed foreign bondholders to speak directly to those withholding the payments that Moscow claims to have made.“The non-receipt of money by investors did not occur because of lack of payment but due to the third-party actions and which is not directly spelled out as a default situation by issue documentation ” the ministry added.President Vladimir Putin ordered last week that debt obligations would be considered fulfilled once a rouble payment equal to the forex amount due was made. Bondholders would need to open an account at a Russian bank to receive such a payment.‘Financial nuclear bomb’The Group of Seven major Western powers banned transactions with Russia’s central bank and froze its assets held in their jurisdictions  worth about $300bn  after Russia invaded Ukraine in February.Some Western politicians have called to seize the frozen Russian reserves to rebuild Ukraine – and it was such an idea that two high-ranked Russian financial sources said they believed was behind the announcement of default on Monday  and which Moscow considers artificial.“By announcing a default  they can claim that sanctions work. Economically  financially  assets could be confiscated legally ” one of the two sources said.Kremlin spokesperson Peskov reiterated on Monday that Russia’s reserves were blocked “unlawfully” and that any attempts to use them would “amount to outright theft”.“I believe that a financial nuclear bomb was used against us  no country in the history of mankind has experienced such sanctions pressure as Russia is now ” Alexei Moiseev  Russian deputy finance minister  said last week.,negative,0.03,0.22,0.74,negative,0.01,0.09,0.89,True,English,"['Western financial agents', 'debt default', 'Russia', 'two high-ranked Russian financial sources', 'Seven major Western powers', 'Russian deputy finance minister', 'Western financial agents', 'global financial system', 'Financial nuclear bomb', 'euro coupon transfers', 'Russian finance ministry', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'foreign financial intermediaries', 'The White House', 'frozen Russian reserves', 'Kremlin spokesperson Peskov', 'forex coupon payment', 'two sources', 'Russian bank', 'Western politicians', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'forex amount', 'The Group', 'foreign currency', 'external debt', 'first time', 'a century', 'international bonds', 'Bolshevik revolution', 'last week', 'one bond', 'issue documentation', 'debt obligations', 'central bank', 'Alexei Moiseev', 'foreign bondholders', 'rouble payment', 'third-party actions', 'sweeping sanctions', 'default situation', 'claims', 'investors', 'cash', 'Moscow', 'Monday', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'country', 'Statements', 'call', 'reporters', 'May', 'fact', 'Euroclear', 'money', 'recipients', 'problem', 'grounds', 'request', 'comment', 'Eurobonds', 'dollar', 'interest', 'euros', 'control', 'payments', 'non', 'receipt', 'lack', 'account', 'transactions', 'assets', 'jurisdictions', 'February', 'idea', 'announcement', 'attempts', 'theft', 'history', 'mankind', 'pressure']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,aljazeera.com

But the payment is held up there  Bloomberg reported. Euroclear would not say whether the distribution had been blocked and said it followed all sanctions  the BBC report said.In May  the US Treasury ended a key sanctions exemption that allowed Russian sovereign-bond payments to pass through to US investors. In response  Russia said it would start using rubles to pay down dollar-bond payments.Moscow said it had sent the eurobond payments to the country's National Settlement Depository  Reuters reported last week. But the bonds' covenants do not allow for payments in rubles  which means the payments would still be considered a default.It's also unclear how bondholders can access the ruble payments  as Russia's National Settlement Depository has been sanctioned by the European Union.This marks Russia's first default on its foreign debt since 1918  when  during the Bolshevik Revolution  the communist leader Vladimir Lenin repudiated the debt of the czarist era.But Russia isn't defaulting this time around because it doesn't have the money to pay; its finances are holding up well  thanks to soaring energy prices. Instead  the default comes as sweeping US and European Union sanctions are blocking its bond interest payments from moving through the international payments system.Story continuesUp until Sunday  Russia had been making good on its bond payments even amid sweeping sanctions. But markets have been expecting the country to eventually default on its foreign bonds as international trade restrictions intensify.To counter the situation  President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Wednesday to handle payments on foreign bonds under a new program — which signals that Moscow considers the interest paid  even when payments are made in rubles  Reuters reported. Russia has about $40 billion in outstanding foreign-currency payments.Russia says it's not a defaultFormal default declarations are typically issued by credit-rating agencies  but the big three agencies — S&P  Moody's and Fitch — have all withdrawn ratings on Russian entities because of sanctions.Russia has hit back against what it calls a ""force-majeure situation "" with its finance minister  Anton Siluanov  calling the situation a ""farce "" Bloomberg reported Thursday.""Anyone can declare whatever they like "" Siluanov said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg last week.

Russia says the money was sent to Euroclear  a bank which would then distribute the payment to investors.But that payment has been stuck there  according to Bloomberg News  and creditors have not received it.Meanwhile  some Taiwanese holders of Russian bonds denominated in euros have not received interest payments  according to the Reuters news agency  which cited two sources.The money had not arrived within 30 days of the due date  that is  Sunday evening  and so is considered a default.Euroclear would not say if the payment had been blocked  but said it adhered to all sanctions  introduced following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Russia disputed that it had defaulted on the debt. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it had made the payments due in May  and the fact that it was blocked by Euroclear because of sanctions was “not our problem.”Russia’s economy in for a bumpy ride as sanctions biteWhat sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?Russia finance minister Anton Siluanov admitted foreign investors would “not be able to receive” the payments  according to the RIA Novosti news wire.Because Russia wants to pay and has plenty of money to do it  he denied that this amounts to a genuine default  which usually occur when governments refuse to pay  or their economies are so weak that they cannot find the money.“Everyone in the know understands that this is not a default at all. This whole situation looks like a farce.”Defaulting nations usually find it impossible to borrow any more money  but Russia is already in effect barred from borrowing in Western markets by sanctions.Also  Russia is reportedly earning about $1bn a day from fossil fuel exports  and its finance minister Anton Siluanov said in April the country had no plans to borrow more.,negative,0.01,0.11,0.88,negative,0.01,0.08,0.92,True,English,"['debt default', 'payment deadline', 'Russia', 'Russia finance minister Anton Siluanov', 'Moscow-based consultancy Macro Advisory', 'RIA Novosti news wire', 'The White House', 'global financial system', 'Reuters news agency', 'fossil fuel exports', '$100m interest payment', 'Bloomberg News', '$100m payment', 'first time', 'key deadline', 'major blow', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'international bonds', 'short-term impact', 'high-priced commodities', 'Chris Weafer', 'chief executive', 'Taiwanese holders', 'Russian bonds', 'two sources', 'due date', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'bumpy ride', 'Defaulting nations', 'Western markets', 'interest payments', 'international creditors', 'intermediary bank', 'legacy” problem', 'Sunday evening', 'foreign investors', 'genuine default', 'international sanctions', 'Ukraine invasion', 'BBC', 'debt', 'money', 'sum', 'country', 'prestige', 'Article', 'advertisement', 'statements', 'reserves', 'yields', 'situation', 'revenue', 'oil', 'sort', 'action', 'economy', 'recovery', 'stage', '27 May', 'Euroclear', 'euros', '30 days', 'fact', 'What', 'plenty', 'governments', 'economies', 'Everyone', 'know', 'farce', 'effect', 'April', 'plans']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,fbcnews.com.fj

The payments were originally due May 27.The White House and other Western officials have anticipated a Russian default for months after sanctions effectively severed the Kremlin’s access to the global economy. The US and other nations imposed sweeping penalties in response to the brutal invasion of Ukraine.The likelihood of a Russian debt default increased in late May  when the Treasury Department allowed a key payment waiver to expire — ensuring that US banks and individuals could no longer accept bond payments from the Russian government. Russia owes approximately $40 billion in internationally held sovereign debt.The Kremlin has decried the default as an “artificial situation” caused by the West. Getty ImagesThe Kremlin  which has continued to rake in huge profits from its oil and gas shipments during the Ukraine war  has decried the default as an “artificial situation” — asserting that it has the money to cover its debts and Western officials blocked payments from reaching bondholders.“Statements of a default are absolutely unjustified ” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday.“The fact that Euroclear withheld this money and did not bring it to the recipients is not our problem ” Peskov said  according to Reuters. “There are absolutely no grounds to call such situation a default.”The default is largely symbolic for a Russian economy that is already weathering double-digit inflation  major GDP losses and a plunge in the value of its ruble since the invasion began.The nonpayment spat was also not expected to have a major impact on the global economy  which had already largely priced in a potential Russian default. Russian bonds have traded for cents on the dollar since the invasion began as investors braced for the default  while credit ratings agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s have given Russia’s debt a junk rating.With Russia already disconnected from SWIFT and other elements of the global financial market  further international borrowing was already untenable. But holders of Russian bonds could face major hits – and a difficult road to recouping their losses in court.“This is the messiest and most legally uncertain case of sovereign default that I can think of ” Mark Weidemaier  a sovereign-debt specialist and law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  told the Wall Street Journal. “That’s got to be one of many things that makes investors nervous when they think about the prospect of suing the Russian government.”Western sanctions effectively disconnected Russia from the global economy. Getty Images/iStockphotoOf the roughly $40 billion in foreign debt that Russia owes  about half is held by overseas investors  according to Reuters. The default is expected to trigger credit default swaps  which function as a form of insurance against nonpayment of bonds.Despite its historic nature  the Russian default is unlikely to rattle European or global markets  according to Giles Coghlan  an analyst at broker HYCM.“As investors have been pricing in the default for months  at this stage the markets are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach — if the conflict in Ukraine fades over the medium term  then payments are likely resume at some point ” Coghlan said. “At least for now  this will not affect European stocks or the euro due to the nature of the default.”Experts told The Post in March that a Russian default would damage their economy and hurt investors. But since Russia was already largely isolated from the global economy  a default is unlikely to cause a international financial crisis.Earlier this year  the International Monetary Fund said global banks’ exposure to Russia was “definitely not systemically relevant.”,negative,0.01,0.15,0.83,negative,0.01,0.07,0.92,True,English,"['World War I', 'foreign debt', 'first time', 'Russia', '30-day grace period', 'key payment waiver', 'credit ratings agencies', 'Wall Street Journal', 'international financial crisis', 'International Monetary Fund', 'global financial market', 'The White House', 'global banks’ exposure', 'euro-denominated international bonds', 'foreign debt obligations', 'credit default swaps', 'major GDP losses', 'other Western officials', 'potential Russian default', 'Russian debt default', 'international borrowing', 'US banks', 'other nations', 'major impact', 'other elements', 'major hits', 'The US', 'Russian government', 'sovereign debt', 'Russian bonds', 'The Post', 'global economy', 'Russian economy', 'first time', 'sweeping penalties', 'late May', 'Treasury Department', 'Getty Images', 'huge profits', 'gas shipments', 'double-digit inflation', 'Standard & Poor', 'junk rating', 'difficult road', 'uncertain case', 'Mark Weidemaier', 'law professor', 'North Carolina', 'Chapel Hill', 'many things', 'medium term', 'Western sanctions', 'The Kremlin', 'global markets', 'artificial situation', 'historic default', 'sovereign default', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Ukraine war', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'historic nature', 'Giles Coghlan', 'European stocks', 'interest payments', 'bond payments', 'brutal invasion', 'nonpayment spat', 'overseas investors', 'Monday', 'months', 'speculation', 'response', 'access', 'likelihood', 'individuals', 'oil', 'money', 'debts', 'bondholders', 'Statements', 'fact', 'Euroclear', 'recipients', 'problem', 'Reuters', 'grounds', 'plunge', 'value', 'ruble', 'cents', 'dollar', 'Moody', 'SWIFT', 'court', 'messiest', 'legally', 'sovereign-debt', 'specialist', 'University', 'prospect', 'iStockphoto', 'half', 'form', 'insurance', 'analyst', 'broker', 'HYCM', 'stage', 'approach', 'conflict', 'point', 'Experts', 'March']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,nypost.com

The clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon is pictured next to Moscow’s Kremlin and Saint Basil’s Cathedral  March 31  2020.Russia rejected claims on Monday  June 27  that it had defaulted on its external debt for the first time in more than a century  telling investors to go to western financial agents for the cash which was sent but bondholders did not receive.The White House said on Monday that Russia has defaulted on its international bonds for the first time since the Bolshevik revolution  as sweeping sanctions have effectively cut the country off from the global financial system.Until last week  Russia kept on paying its Eurobonds in foreign currency as per issue conditions yet its dollar and euro coupon transfers made in May  ahead of a key US waiver allowing for such transactions expired  did not reach investors.“Statements of a default are absolutely unjustified ” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a call with reporters on Monday  pointing to the May forex coupon payment.“The fact that Euroclear withheld this money and did not bring it to the recipients is not our problem. There are absolutely no grounds to call such situation a default.”Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Monday  the finance ministry said that “actions of foreign financial intermediaries are beyond of the Russian finance ministry’s control ” asking foreign bondholders to speak directly to those withholding the payments.“The non-receipt of money by investors did not occur because of lack of payment but due to the third party actions and which is not directly spelled out as a default situation by issue documentation ” the ministry added.As the US waiver expired and the European Union sanctioned the National Settlement Depository (NSD)  the Russian version of Euroclear and Clearstream western clearing houses  last week Moscow paid its next coupons due in forex in roubles.President Vladimir Putin ordered last week that debt obligations would be considered fulfilled once a rouble payment equal to the forex amount due was made. Bondholders would need to open an account at a Russian bank to receive the payment.Moscow would not block the payment’s conversion into forex and its transfer abroad but investors would need to say in writing they don’t have claims against Russia  the ministry has said. The banks are yet to be announced.‘Financial nuclear bomb’The Group of Seven major Western powers banned transactions with Russia’s central bank and froze its assets held in their jurisdictions  worth around $300 billion  after Russia launched what it called a special military operation in Ukraine in February.Some western politicians have called to seize the reserves frozen to rebuild Ukraine – the idea two high-ranked Russian financial sources said they believed was behind the announcement of default and which Moscow considers artificial.“By announcing a default  they can claim that sanctions work. Economically  financially assets could be confiscated legally ” one of the two sources said.Peskov reiterated on Monday that reserves were blocked “unlawfully” and any attempts to use them would “amount to outright theft.”“I believe that a financial nuclear bomb was used against us  no country in the history of mankind has experienced such sanctions pressure as Russia is now ” Alexei Moiseev  Russian deputy finance minister  said last week. – Rappler.com,negative,0.02,0.21,0.76,negative,0.01,0.08,0.9,True,English,"['western financial agents', 'Russia', 'default', 'investors', 'two high-ranked Russian financial sources', 'Clearstream western clearing houses', 'Seven major Western powers', 'Russian deputy finance minister', 'May forex coupon payment', 'western financial agents', 'euro coupon transfers', 'global financial system', 'Financial nuclear bomb', 'National Settlement Depository', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'foreign financial intermediaries', 'The White House', 'key US waiver', 'third party actions', 'Russian finance ministry', 'two sources', 'western politicians', 'Russian version', 'Russian bank', 'The Group', 'foreign currency', 'Spasskaya tower', 'Saint Basil', 'external debt', 'a century', 'international bonds', 'Bolshevik revolution', 'last week', 'issue conditions', 'issue documentation', 'European Union', 'next coupons', 'debt obligations', 'forex amount', 'central bank', 'outright theft', 'Alexei Moiseev', 'rouble payment', 'first time', 'foreign bondholders', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'sweeping sanctions', 'default situation', 'MOSCOW', 'clock', 'noon', 'Cathedral', 'claims', 'Monday', 'June', 'investors', 'cash', 'country', 'Eurobonds', 'dollar', 'transactions', 'Statements', 'call', 'reporters', 'fact', 'Euroclear', 'money', 'recipients', 'problem', 'grounds', 'request', 'comment', 'control', 'payments', 'non', 'receipt', 'lack', 'NSD', 'roubles', 'account', 'conversion', 'writing', 'banks', 'assets', 'jurisdictions', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'reserves', 'idea', 'announcement', 'attempts', 'history', 'mankind', 'pressure', 'Rappler']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,rappler.com

According to the news agency  investors did not receive money due and the situation can be treated as a default.,"MOSCOW  June 27. /TASS/. Russia is said to have an event of default on sovereign debt commitments  the Bloomberg news agency reported. According to the news agency  investors did not receive money due and the situation can be treated as a default. This is the first case since 1918 when Russia failed to honor its sovereign debt commitments  the news outlet said.The Kremlin firmly rejected such default allegations. ""These allegations of a default are absolutely unjustified  because back in May  the obligatory payment in the currency was fulfilled  and the fact that Euroclear withheld this money  or did not deliver it to the recipients is no longer our problem "" he told reporters.DevelopmentsThe deadline for paying $100 mln in Russian Eurobond coupons expired at night on June 27  Bloomberg said. Reuters also reported that a development had occurred that could be viewed as a default. According to the news agency  some Taiwan-based holders of Russian bonds not assuming repayment in rubles did not receive payments after the grace period had lapsed.The Russian Finance Ministry reported on May 20 that it had made the payment under Eurobonds maturing in 2026 in the amount of $71.25 mln and in 2036 in the amount of 26.5 mln. The US license authorizing the currency debt servicing expired on May 25. Nevertheless  bondholders did not receive the money by May 27  Bloomberg reported. The 30-day countdown for the default announcement started from then.Russian Finance Ministry’s positionThe Russian Finance Ministry denies any default. ""In accordance with issuing documentation for mentioned issues  the event of default is the failure to pay on the part of the debtor  but the payment was made in advance - on May 20  2022. In this case  the failure of investors to receive funds occurred through third party action and not as a result of the failure to pay  which is not expressly provided in issuing documentation and should be considered within the framework of the general norms of law governing conditions of the issue  with consideration of all the circumstances and good faith in the actions of the parties "" the Ministry stated.Ruble paymentsThe West continues depriving Russia of the opportunity to normally service its external debt. The paying agent’s functions for sovereign Eurobonds maturing in 2023  2028  2042 and 2043 were transferred in early June to Russia’s National Settlement Depository. The European Union later included the Depository into the sixth package of anti-Russian sanctions.On June 22  Russian President Vladimir Putin issued an executive order  whereby Moscow views its Eurobond payment obligation as honored ""if they are made in rubles in the amount equivalent to the value of foreign currency commitments"" on the day the funds are transferred to the National Settlement Depository. The first such payment was made on June 23 for Eurobonds maturing in 2027 and 2047.No grounds to announce defaultThe transfer of payments to rubles is caused by the refusal of foreign counterparties to process payments in foreign currency but this does not translate to an international debt default announcement  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said.Documents of all Russian issues contain the Currency Indemnity clause allowing lawful payments in rubles if sanctions prevent payment in the original currency  in case of court judgment  court order or any other decision.Russia has all the opportunities to repay foreign debts using its financial resources  Governor of the Central Bank Elvira Nabiullina said earlier.Further developmentsThe default procedure can be implemented in two ways  either a global rating agency can announce it  or a court may do so upon a motion filed by investors or courts  says Kyle Shostak  CEO of US-based Navigator Principal Investors.If the West announces the default on Russian sovereign Eurobonds  Russia will go to court  Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said earlier in an interview with Izvestiya newspaper.",negative,0.02,0.16,0.82,negative,0.01,0.1,0.89,True,English,"['Moscow', 'commitments', 'West', 'ploys', 'Russia', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Central Bank Elvira Nabiullina', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'US-based Navigator Principal Investors', 'The Russian Finance Ministry', 'international debt default announcement', 'Russian Eurobond coupons', 'The US license', 'third party action', 'The European Union', 'sovereign debt commitments', 'global rating agency', 'currency debt servicing', 'National Settlement Depository', 'Currency Indemnity clause', 'Russian sovereign Eurobonds', 'foreign currency commitments', 'Eurobond payment obligation', 'Bloomberg news agency', 'Russian bonds', 'The Kremlin', 'external debt', 'Russian issues', 'The West', 'original currency', 'news outlet', 'foreign counterparties', 'foreign debts', 'Taiwan-based holders', 'grace period', '30-day countdown', 'general norms', 'good faith', 'paying agent', 'sixth package', 'executive order', 'other decision', 'financial resources', 'two ways', 'Kyle Shostak', 'Izvestiya newspaper', 'obligatory payment', 'anti-Russian sanctions', 'court judgment', 'court order', 'Further developments', 'default procedure', 'Ruble payments', 'lawful payments', 'first case', 'early June', 'default allegations', 'MOSCOW', 'TASS', 'event', 'money', 'situation', 'May', 'fact', 'Euroclear', 'recipients', 'problem', 'reporters', 'deadline', 'mln', 'night', 'Reuters', 'repayment', 'rubles', 'amount', 'bondholders', 'position', 'accordance', 'documentation', 'failure', 'debtor', 'advance', 'funds', 'result', 'framework', 'conditions', 'consideration', 'circumstances', 'actions', 'opportunity', 'functions', 'value', 'grounds', 'transfer', 'refusal', 'Documents', 'opportunities', 'Governor', 'motion', 'courts', 'CEO', 'interview']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,tass.com

But the stigma would probably raise its borrowing costs in future.Story continues below advertisementThe payments in question are US$100 million in interest on two bonds  one denominated in U.S. dollars and another in euros that Russia was due to pay on May 27. The payments had a grace period of 30 days  which expired on Sunday.Russia’s finance ministry said it made the payments to its onshore National Settlement Depository (NSD) in euros and dollars  adding it had fulfilled obligations.In a call with reporters  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the fact that payments had been blocked by Euroclear because of Western sanctions on Russia was “not our problem.”Clearing house Euroclear did not respond to a request for comment.Some Taiwanese holders of the bonds had not received payments on Monday  sources told Reuters.With no exact deadline specified in the prospectus  lawyers say Russia might have until the end of the following business day to pay these bondholders.Credit ratings agencies usually formally downgrade a country’s credit rating to reflect default  but this does not apply in case of Russia as most agencies no longer rate the country.LEGAL TANGLEThe legal situation surrounding the bonds looks complex.Story continues below advertisementRussia’s bonds have been issued with an unusual variety of terms  and an increasing level of ambiguities for those sold more recently  when Moscow was already facing sanctions over its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and a poisoning incident in Britain in 2018.Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal  chair in banking and finance law at Queen Mary University in London  said clarity was needed on what constituted a discharge for Russia on its obligation  or the difference between receiving and recovering payments.“All these issues are subject to interpretation by a court of law ” Olivares-Caminal told Reuters.1:29 Trudeau  U.K.’s Johnson send message of support to Ukraine during G7 summit Trudeau  U.K.’s Johnson send message of support to Ukraine during G7 summitIn some ways  Russia has been in default already.A committee on derivatives has ruled a “credit event” had occurred on some of Russia’s securities  which triggered a payout on some of Russia’s credit default swaps – instruments used by investors to insure against debt default.Story continues below advertisementThis was triggered by Russia failing to make a US$1.9 million payment in accrued interest on a payment that had been due in early April.Until the Ukraine invasion  a sovereign default had seemed unthinkable  with Russia having an investment grade rating shortly before that point. A default would also be unusual as Moscow has the funds to service its debt.The U.S. Treasury’s OFAC had issued a temporary waiver  known as a general license 9A  in early March to allow Moscow to keep paying investors. The U.S. let the waiver expire on May 25 as Washington tightened sanctions on Russia  effectively cutting off payments to U.S. investors and entities.The lapsed OFAC license is not Russia’s only obstacle. In early June  the European Union imposed sanctions on the NSD  Russia’s appointed agent for its Eurobonds.Moscow has tried in the past few days to find ways of dealing with upcoming payments and avoid a default.President Vladimir Putin signed a decree last Wednesday to launch temporary procedures and give the government 10 days to choose banks to handle payments under a new scheme  suggesting Russia will consider its debt obligations fulfilled when it pays bondholders in roubles and onshore in Russia.Story continues below advertisement“Russia saying it’s complying with obligations under the terms of the bond is not the whole story ” Zia Ullah  partner and head of corporate crime and investigations at law firm Eversheds Sutherland told Reuters.“If you as an investor are not satisfied  for instance  if you know the money is stuck in an escrow account  which effectively would be the practical impact of what Russia is saying  the answer would be  until you discharge the obligation  you have not satisfied the conditions of the bond.”,negative,0.01,0.44,0.54,negative,0.02,0.15,0.83,True,English,"['international bonds', '1st time', 'U.S.', 'Russia', 'century', 'U.S. Treasury Department', 'The U.S. Treasury', 'U.S. official', 'global financial system', 'high inflation rates', 'National Settlement Depository', 'following business day', 'Queen Mary University', 'investment grade rating', 'general license 9A', 'U.S. dollars', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'gas export revenues', 'Credit ratings agencies', 'U.S. investors', 'key payment deadline', 'Clearing house Euroclear', 'US$1.9 million payment', 'credit default swaps', 'first major default', 'G7 summit Trudeau', 'The Kremlin', 'gas revenues', 'U.K.', 'White House', 'most agencies', 'credit event', 'first time', 'exact deadline', 'a century', 'Bolshevik revolution', 'Dennis Hranitzky', 'sovereign litigation', 'Quinn Emanuel', '1:39 Biden blames', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'borrowing costs', 'grace period', 'finance ministry', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'Taiwanese holders', 'LEGAL TANGLE', 'legal situation', 'unusual variety', 'increasing level', 'poisoning incident', 'early April', 'early June', 'artificial default', 'Russian default', 'formal default', 'sovereign default', 'OFAC license', 'law firm', 'Sunday deadline', 'finance law', 'international bonds', 'outstanding bonds', 'two bonds', 'sweeping sanctions', 'plentiful oil', 'Western sanctions', 'Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal', 'temporary waiver', 'early March', 'overdue interest', 'late May', 'debt default', 'Ukraine invasion', 'page', 'someone', 'email', 'country', 'money', 'payments', 'claims', 'bondholders', 'Monday', 'expiry', 'Feb.', 'Story', 'advertisement', 'news', 'finding', 'actions', 'allies', 'partners', 'impact', 'economy', 'sidelines', 'Germany', 'efforts', 'roadblock', 'Office', 'Moscow', 'question', 'head', 'Reuters', 'Putin', 'moment', 'stigma', 'future', 'euros', '30 days', 'onshore', 'NSD', 'obligations', 'call', 'reporters', 'fact', 'problem', 'request', 'comment', 'sources', 'prospectus', 'lawyers', 'end', 'case', 'terms', 'ambiguities', 'annexation', 'Crimea', 'Britain', 'chair', 'banking', 'London', 'clarity', 'discharge', 'difference', 'issues', 'interpretation', 'court', 'Johnson', 'message', 'support', 'ways', 'committee', 'derivatives', 'securities', 'payout', 'instruments', 'point', 'funds', 'paying', 'Washington', 'entities', 'lapsed', 'obstacle', 'European']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,globalnews.ca

7002,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.rappler.com/business/russia-rejecting-default-tells-investors-go-western-financial-agents-june-27-2022/,Russia  rejecting default  tells investors to go to western financial agents,'Statements of a default are absolutely unjustified ' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov tells reporters,MOSCOW. The clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon is pictured next to Moscow’s Kremlin and Saint Basil’s Cathedral  March 31  2020.Russia rejected claims on Monday  June 27  that it had defaulted on its external debt for the first time in more than a century  telling investors to go to western financial agents for the cash which was sent but bondholders did not receive.The White House said on Monday that Russia has defaulted on its international bonds for the first time since the Bolshevik revolution  as sweeping sanctions have effectively cut the country off from the global financial system.Until last week  Russia kept on paying its Eurobonds in foreign currency as per issue conditions yet its dollar and euro coupon transfers made in May  ahead of a key US waiver allowing for such transactions expired  did not reach investors.“Statements of a default are absolutely unjustified ” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a call with reporters on Monday  pointing to the May forex coupon payment.“The fact that Euroclear withheld this money and did not bring it to the recipients is not our problem. There are absolutely no grounds to call such situation a default.”Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Monday  the finance ministry said that “actions of foreign financial intermediaries are beyond of the Russian finance ministry’s control ” asking foreign bondholders to speak directly to those withholding the payments.“The non-receipt of money by investors did not occur because of lack of payment but due to the third party actions and which is not directly spelled out as a default situation by issue documentation ” the ministry added.As the US waiver expired and the European Union sanctioned the National Settlement Depository (NSD)  the Russian version of Euroclear and Clearstream western clearing houses  last week Moscow paid its next coupons due in forex in roubles.President Vladimir Putin ordered last week that debt obligations would be considered fulfilled once a rouble payment equal to the forex amount due was made. Bondholders would need to open an account at a Russian bank to receive the payment.Moscow would not block the payment’s conversion into forex and its transfer abroad but investors would need to say in writing they don’t have claims against Russia  the ministry has said. The banks are yet to be announced.‘Financial nuclear bomb’The Group of Seven major Western powers banned transactions with Russia’s central bank and froze its assets held in their jurisdictions  worth around $300 billion  after Russia launched what it called a special military operation in Ukraine in February.Some western politicians have called to seize the reserves frozen to rebuild Ukraine – the idea two high-ranked Russian financial sources said they believed was behind the announcement of default and which Moscow considers artificial.“By announcing a default  they can claim that sanctions work. Economically  financially assets could be confiscated legally ” one of the two sources said.Peskov reiterated on Monday that reserves were blocked “unlawfully” and any attempts to use them would “amount to outright theft.”“I believe that a financial nuclear bomb was used against us  no country in the history of mankind has experienced such sanctions pressure as Russia is now ” Alexei Moiseev  Russian deputy finance minister  said last week. – Rappler.com,negative,0.02,0.21,0.76,negative,0.01,0.08,0.9,True,English,"['western financial agents', 'Russia', 'default', 'investors', 'two high-ranked Russian financial sources', 'Clearstream western clearing houses', 'Seven major Western powers', 'Russian deputy finance minister', 'May forex coupon payment', 'western financial agents', 'euro coupon transfers', 'global financial system', 'Financial nuclear bomb', 'National Settlement Depository', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'foreign financial intermediaries', 'The White House', 'key US waiver', 'third party actions', 'Russian finance ministry', 'two sources', 'western politicians', 'Russian version', 'Russian bank', 'The Group', 'foreign currency', 'Spasskaya tower', 'Saint Basil', 'external debt', 'a century', 'international bonds', 'Bolshevik revolution', 'last week', 'issue conditions', 'issue documentation', 'European Union', 'next coupons', 'debt obligations', 'forex amount', 'central bank', 'outright theft', 'Alexei Moiseev', 'rouble payment', 'first time', 'foreign bondholders', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'sweeping sanctions', 'default situation', 'MOSCOW', 'clock', 'noon', 'Cathedral', 'claims', 'Monday', 'June', 'investors', 'cash', 'country', 'Eurobonds', 'dollar', 'transactions', 'Statements', 'call', 'reporters', 'fact', 'Euroclear', 'money', 'recipients', 'problem', 'grounds', 'request', 'comment', 'control', 'payments', 'non', 'receipt', 'lack', 'NSD', 'roubles', 'account', 'conversion', 'writing', 'banks', 'assets', 'jurisdictions', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'reserves', 'idea', 'announcement', 'attempts', 'history', 'mankind', 'pressure', 'Rappler']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,rappler.com

7006,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/ipsen-epizyme-acquisition-cancer-sarcoma-lymphoma-drug/626115/,Ipsen adds to cancer business with bargain buyout of Epizyme - BioPharma Dive,Epizyme  which was once worth more than $2 billion  agreed to be bought for $247 million upfront. The biotech has continued to lose money despite winning FDA approval for a drug for rare cancers.,Dive Brief:French drugmaker Ipsen will buy Massachusetts-based biotech Epizyme  announcing on Monday that it will spend $247 million to acquire the cancer drug developer in a deal that could be worth another $170 million if certain goals are met.In 2020  Epizyme won Food and Drug Administration accelerated approval of Tazverik  a drug for a rare soft-tissue cancer that’s since been cleared in a type of blood cancer. The company earned only $31 million in sales last year  and recorded a net loss of $250 million.Per deal terms  Ipsen will pay $1.45 per share and potentially up to another $1 per share through what’s known as a contingent value right. The upfront payment represents a 53% premium to the closing price of Epizyme stock Friday  although it is far below the nearly $27 price that shares hit just before Tazverik won approval.Dive Insight:Epizyme met a goal that few biotechs achieve when it managed to secure approval of Tazverik. But converting that clinical and regulatory success into commercial performance has proved challenging.The first cancer type in which Tazverik won approval  epithelioid sarcoma  is diagnosed in only a few hundred U.S. patients per year. The second  follicular lymphoma  has several competing treatments available  like Gilead’s Zydelig as well as similarly acting drugs.Epizyme did manage to attract overseas partners  with Eisai holding rights in Japan as part of an earlier development deal  and Hutchmed in China paying $25 million upfront for rights in 2021. To raise money  Epizyme sold a 21% stake in the company to Royalty Pharma  a biotech financing company  for $100 million in 2019.The biotech still was forced to cut costs  laying off 11% of its workforce in August 2021 and then another 12% of the remaining employees in March 2022.As part of Ipsen  Tazverik will join a cancer drug business that includes primarily chemotherapy and hormone therapies. Only one  Somatuline  is a blockbuster  with 2021 sales of $1.2 billion euros  or $1.3 billion.Ipsen said the deal will “will immediately provide incremental sales” and will help it build its U.S. sales and marketing organization. However  Epizyme’s ongoing research and development expenses  which amounted to $131 million in 2021  will reduce Ipsen’s profits “until the end of 2024.”Epizyme has two major Phase 3 trials underway for Tazverik to confirm its use in both sarcoma and lymphoma. If successful  those trials would allow the company to convert accelerated FDA clearances into full approvals.Ipsen shares fell 3% Monday on the Euronext stock exchange.,neutral,0.04,0.91,0.04,mixed,0.06,0.23,0.72,True,English,"['cancer business', 'bargain buyout', 'BioPharma Dive', 'Ipsen', 'Epizyme', 'hundred U.S. patients', 'two major Phase 3 trials', 'contingent value right', 'several competing treatments', 'rare soft-tissue cancer', 'U.S. sales', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'cancer drug developer', 'cancer drug business', 'second, follicular lymphoma', 'first cancer type', 'French drugmaker Ipsen', 'earlier development deal', 'biotech financing company', 'Massachusetts-based biotech Epizyme', 'blood cancer', 'development expenses', 'Drug Administration', 'Dive Brief', 'net loss', 'upfront payment', 'Dive Insight', 'regulatory success', 'commercial performance', 'overseas partners', 'Royalty Pharma', 'remaining employees', 'hormone therapies', 'billion euros', 'marketing organization', 'ongoing research', 'FDA clearances', 'full approvals', 'Epizyme stock', 'deal terms', 'incremental sales', 'closing price', 'epithelioid sarcoma', 'Ipsen shares', '2021 sales', '$27 price', 'Monday', 'goals', 'Food', 'Tazverik', '53% premium', 'biotechs', 'clinical', 'year', 'Gilead', 'Zydelig', 'drugs', 'Eisai', 'rights', 'Japan', 'Hutchmed', 'China', 'money', '21% stake', 'costs', 'workforce', 'August', 'March', 'chemotherapy', 'Somatuline', 'blockbuster', 'profits', 'end']",2022-06-27,2022-06-27,biopharmadive.com

The initial findings are as follows:After administration  the virus was found in the tumors after several days. This suggests that BT‑001 is able to persist and replicates within tumors;This finding is consistent with the expression of the anti-CTLA-4 observed in the tumor with no detectable systemic exposure;with no detectable systemic exposure; No spreading in blood or biological fluids has been detected  suggesting high tumor specificity;Tumor shrinkage was observed in one patient in the first cohort.The part A of the Phase I trial aims to establish the tolerability of BT-001 and to determine the dose and administration schedule for further development. Repeated (every 3 weeks) and ascending doses of intratumoral administration of BT‑001  as a single agent  will be administered to up to 18 patients with metastatic/advanced tumors.The first two dose levels have been successfully completed  with 12 patients dosed to date. The Safety Review Committee (SRC) has stated that the safety profile supports escalation to the highest dose level of Phase I part A.The Phase I part B is planned to start in H2 2022. This part will assess the combination of intratumoral injections of BT-001 with intravenous administrations of the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab.BT-001 is based on Transgene’s patented oncolytic vector and is encoding BioInvent’s proprietary anti‑CTLA‑4 antibody; it is codeveloped by the two biotechnology companies.About the trialThe ongoing Phase I/IIa (NCT04725331) study is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation trial evaluating BT-001 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 treatment). Patient inclusions are ongoing in Europe (France  Belgium) and the trial has been authorized in the US.This Phase I is divided into two parts. In part A  patients with metastatic/advanced tumors receive single agent  intra-tumoral administrations of BT-001. Part B will explore the combination of intra-tumoral injections of BT-001 with pembrolizumab. The Phase IIa will evaluate the combination regimen in several patient cohorts with different tumor types. These expansion cohorts will offer the possibility of exploring the activity of this approach to treat other malignancies not traditionally addressed with this type of treatment.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene’s Invir.IO™ platform and its patented large-capacity VV cop TK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent’s proprietary n-CoDeR®/F.I.R.S.T™ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody may be greatly improved.BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration on oncolytic viruses between Transgene and BioInvent.

The transaction was unanimously approved …,"PARIS & CAMBRIDGE  Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) and Epizyme (Nasdaq: EPZM) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ipsen will acquire Epizyme. The transaction was unanimously approved by both Ipsen and Epizyme Boards of Directors and is anticipated to close by the end of the third quarter of 2022  subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions. Epizyme is a fully integrated  commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing and delivering transformative therapies against novel epigenetic targets for cancer patients.The primary focus of the acquisition is on the lead medicine  Tazverik® (tazemetostat)  a first-in-class  chemotherapy-free EZH21 inhibitor  which was granted Accelerated Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020. It is currently indicated for adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  and for adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  as well as for adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for complete resection.1 Tazverik is currently in the Phase III stage of a registrational confirmatory study (SYMPHONY-1) in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide (R2) in patients with relapsed/refractory FL who have received at least one prior therapy. Initial results from the Phase III randomized portion of this study are planned to read out in 2026.As part of the transaction  Ipsen will also acquire Epizyme’s first-in-class  oral SETD2 inhibitor development candidate  EZM0414  which was granted FDA Fast Track status and is currently under evaluation in a recently initiated Phase I/Ib trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  as well as a portfolio of preclinical programs focusing on epigenetic targets.“ Through this agreement  we will expand our assets in oncology. Ipsen’s capabilities and resources in oncology combined with Epizyme’s will accelerate the growth of Tazverik to achieve its full potential in follicular lymphoma patients. The strength of data support Tazverik’s positioning in patients with both EZH2 mutation positive and wild-type follicular lymphoma. We are compelled by the potential of its efficacy and tolerability profile  especially for elderly and/or frail patients who are treated in the community-based setting. Furthermore  we are excited to bring on board epigenetic expertise and the SETD2 inhibitor  as well as several pre-clinical compounds into our portfolio ” said David Loew  Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen.“ Epizyme was founded in 2007 with a commitment to rigorous scientific research and a vision of developing novel epigenetic therapies. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished over the past 15 years  from the approval of Tazverik to advancing our next novel investigational agent  EZM0414  to the clinic  as well as the progress made on our preclinical compounds focused on both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors ” said Grant Bogle  President and Chief Executive Officer of Epizyme. “ We expect that this acquisition and Ipsen’s commitment to invest in the oncology space will ensure our epigenetic pipeline continues to advance in a way we could not have done on our own to bring transformative cancer therapies to patients in need.”Financial highlightsThe acquisition of Epizyme will immediately provide incremental sales and will leverage the U.S. commercial infrastructure. Given the level of ongoing R&D expenses  the transaction is expected to be moderately dilutive on Ipsen’s core operating income until the end of 2024. This is in line with Ipsen’s medium-term outlook regarding its strategic focus on building a high-value and sustainable pipeline through external innovation. The dilutive impact on 2022 core operating margin will be limited  given the expected timing of the transaction.Transaction detailsThe Board of Directors of Epizyme has unanimously approved the transaction and recommended that the stockholders of Epizyme tender their shares in the tender offer. Royalty Pharma  Epizyme’s largest stockholder with approximately 20.5% of Epizyme’s total shares of common stock outstanding (on a non‑diluted basis) as of the date hereof  has entered into a support agreement with Ipsen pursuant to which it has agreed to tender its shares in the tender offer.Under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  Ipsen  through a subsidiary  will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Epizyme at a price of $1.45 per share in cash at the closing of the transaction  for an initial estimated aggregate consideration of $247 millionb plus one contingent value right (CVR) per share. Each CVR will entitle its holder to deferred cash payments of $0.30 per CVR payable upon the first achievement of $250 million in aggregate net sales of Tazverik (excluding sales in Japan and Greater Chinac) in any period of four consecutive quarters  by 31 December 2026 and $0.70 per CVR payable upon receipt of U.S. regulatory approval necessary for the commercial marketing and sale of the combination of Tazverik and R² (rituximab and lenalidomide) in second-line follicular lymphoma by 1 January 2028. The $1.45 per share cash consideration represents a premium of approximately 144% compared to Epizyme’s average closing price of $0.60 over the 30 trading days preceding announcement of the transaction. The transaction will be fully financed by Ipsen’s existing cash and lines of credit.The closing of the tender offer will be subject to customary conditions  including the tender of shares representing at least a majority of the total number of Epizyme’s outstanding shares  the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer  Ipsen would acquire all shares not acquired in the tender through a second-step merger for the same consideration as the tendering shareholders.AdvisorsBarclays is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Ipsen and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP as legal counsel to Ipsen. Epizyme is advised by both Jefferies and MTS Health Partners  L.P.  joint lead financial advisors in connection with the transaction  with WilmerHale serving as legal counsel. In addition  MTS Securities  LLC (an affiliate of MTS Health Partners  L.P.) provided an opinion to the Board of Directors of Epizyme regarding the fairness of the offer consideration to be received by the holders of Epizyme common stock in the transaction  subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth therein.Conference callA conference call and webcast for investors and analysts will begin today at 2pm Paris time. Participants can join the call by dialling +1 785 424 1876 or  for U.S. participants  +1 877 888 4312 toll-free; the passcode is 63710.

Post marketing studies are required to confirm the anticipated clinical benefit and retain the labeled Accelerated Approval indications.The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions in patients with epithelioid sarcoma are pain  fatigue  nausea  decreased appetite  vomiting and constipation. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions in patients with follicular lymphoma are fatigue  upper respiratory tract infection  musculoskeletal pain  nausea and abdominal pain.View the U.S. Full Prescribing Information here: https://www.epizyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TAZVERIK.pdfAbout SYMPHONY-12SYMPHONY-1 is a global  multicenter Phase Ib/III study designed to determine the recommended Phase III dose (RP3D) and the efficacy and safety of Tazverik plus R² (rituximab and lenalidomide) versus placebo plus R²  in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma after at least one prior therapy. Updated safety and activity data from the Phase Ib safety run-in portion of the study were presented at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting. Thirty-eight of the 44 patients were evaluable for tumor assessments as of the data cutoff  with 36 patients responding to treatment. The activity findings showed an objective response rate of 95 percent (50% complete response rate and 45% partial response rate). Two patients achieved stable disease  and two patients had progressive disease (one from the 400-mg cohort and one from the 600-mg cohort). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response were not yet reached as the study is ongoing. The safety profile of the Tazverik and R² combination was consistent with the prescribing information for both Tazverik and R²  respectively.About EZM0414EZM0414 is a potent selective  oral  small molecule  investigational drug agent that inhibits the histone methyltransferase  SETD2  which plays a role in oncogenesis. SETD2 methylates histone as well as non-histone proteins  and this activity is involved in several key biological processes including transcriptional regulation  RNA splicing  and DNA damage repair. Based on the preclinical data on SETD2 inhibition by EZM0414 in multiple settings  including high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma (MM) and in other B-cell malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  the Company is conducting SET-101  a Phase 1/1b study of EZM0414  for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM and DLBCL.About follicular lymphoma3 4Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) which is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Follicular lymphoma develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally helps fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in the lymph nodes or other body organs. Follicular lymphoma is generally slow growing. Each year  15-20 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Most affected individuals are diagnosed with advanced disease.About epithelioid sarcoma5Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare  slow-growing type of soft tissue cancer. Most cases begin in the soft tissue under the skin of a finger  hand  forearm  lower leg or foot  though it can start in other areas of the body. Typically  epithelioid sarcoma starts as a small firm growth or lump that is painless. It usually starts out as a single growth  but multiple growths may occur by the time a person seeks medical help. Sometimes this sarcoma appears as ulcers that don't heal  looking like open wounds over the growths. It is estimated that 13 040 individuals received a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas in the U.S. in 2018 with a corresponding 5 150 deaths.6About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma7Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of NHL. NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally help to fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes or other body organs. DLBCL grows quickly and treatment starts soon after diagnosis. DLBCL is the most common type of NHL in the U.S. and worldwide  accounting for about 22 percent of newly diagnosed cases of B-cell NHL in the U.S. More than 18 000 people are diagnosed with DLBCL each year.8About multiple myeloma9Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer characterized by excessive production (proliferation) and improper function of certain cells (plasma cells) found in the bone marrow. Excessive plasma cells may eventually mass together to form a tumor or tumors in various sites of the body  especially the bone marrow. When multiple tumors are present or the bone marrow has greater than 10% plasma cells  the term multiple myeloma is used. In 2019  over 32 000 individuals in the U.S. were diagnosed with this disease. It is believed that approximately 100 000 Americans currently have the disease.About EpizymeEpizyme is a fully integrated  commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to its mission of rewriting treatment for cancer through novel epigenetic medicines.

Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.Epizyme Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking StatementsAny statements in this press release about future expectations  plans and prospects for Epizyme and other statements containing the words “anticipate "" “believe ” “estimate ” “expect ” “intend ” “may ” “plan ” “predict ” “project ” “target ” “potential ” “will ” “would ” “could ” “should ” “continue ” and similar expressions  constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors  including: uncertainties as to the timing of the tender offer; the risk that the proposed transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all; the possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals for Epizyme will be made; uncertainty surrounding how many of Epizyme’s stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; the possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the tender offer may not be satisfied or waived  including the failure to receive any required regulatory approvals from any applicable governmental entities; the possibility of business disruptions due to transaction-related uncertainty; the occurrence of any event  change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the proposed transaction may result in significant costs of defense  indemnification and liability; and other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of the company’s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and in the company's other filings from time to time with the SEC.

The transaction was unanimously approved by both Ipsen and Epizyme Boards of Directors and is anticipated to close by the end of the third quarter of 2022  subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions. Epizyme is a fully integrated  commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing and delivering transformative therapies against novel epigenetic targets for cancer patients.The primary focus of the acquisition is on the lead medicine  Tazverik® (tazemetostat)  a first-in-class  chemotherapy-free EZH2a inhibitor  which was granted Accelerated Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020. It is currently indicated for adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  and for adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  as well as for adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for complete resection.1 Tazverik is currently in the Phase III stage of a registrational confirmatory study (SYMPHONY-1) in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide (R2) in patients with relapsed/refractory FL who have received at least one prior therapy. Initial results from the Phase III randomized portion of this study are planned to read out in 2026.As part of the transaction  Ipsen will also acquire Epizyme’s first-in-class  oral SETD2 inhibitor development candidate  EZM0414  which was granted FDA Fast Track status and is currently under evaluation in a recently initiated Phase I/Ib trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  as well as a portfolio of preclinical programs focusing on epigenetic targets.“ Through this agreement  we will expand our assets in oncology. Ipsen’s capabilities and resources in oncology combined with Epizyme’s will accelerate the growth of Tazverik to achieve its full potential in follicular lymphoma patients. The strength of data support Tazverik’s positioning in patients with both EZH2 mutation positive and wild-type follicular lymphoma. We are compelled by the potential of its efficacy and tolerability profile  especially for elderly and/or frail patients who are treated in the community-based setting. Furthermore  we are excited to bring on board epigenetic expertise and the SETD2 inhibitor  as well as several pre-clinical compounds into our portfolio ” said David Loew  Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen.“ Epizyme was founded in 2007 with a commitment to rigorous scientific research and a vision of developing novel epigenetic therapies. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished over the past 15 years  from the approval of Tazverik to advancing our next novel investigational agent  EZM0414  to the clinic  as well as the progress made on our preclinical compounds focused on both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors ” said Grant Bogle  President and Chief Executive Officer of Epizyme. “ We expect that this acquisition and Ipsen’s commitment to invest in the oncology space will ensure our epigenetic pipeline continues to advance in a way we could not have done on our own to bring transformative cancer therapies to patients in need.”Financial highlightsThe acquisition of Epizyme will immediately provide incremental sales and will leverage the U.S. commercial infrastructure. Given the level of ongoing R&D expenses  the transaction is expected to be moderately dilutive on Ipsen’s core operating income until the end of 2024. This is in line with Ipsen’s medium-term outlook regarding its strategic focus on building a high-value and sustainable pipeline through external innovation. The dilutive impact on 2022 core operating margin will be limited  given the expected timing of the transaction.Transaction detailsThe Board of Directors of Epizyme has unanimously approved the transaction and recommended that the stockholders of Epizyme tender their shares in the tender offer. Royalty Pharma  Epizyme’s largest stockholder with approximately 20.5% of Epizyme’s total shares of common stock outstanding (on a non‑diluted basis) as of the date hereof  has entered into a support agreement with Ipsen pursuant to which it has agreed to tender its shares in the tender offer.Under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  Ipsen  through a subsidiary  will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Epizyme at a price of $1.45 per share in cash at the closing of the transaction  for an initial estimated aggregate consideration of $247 millionb plus one contingent value right (CVR) per share. Each CVR will entitle its holder to deferred cash payments of $0.30 per CVR payable upon the first achievement of $250 million in aggregate net sales of Tazverik (excluding sales in Japan and Greater Chinac) in any period of four consecutive quarters  by 31 December 2026 and $0.70 per CVR payable upon receipt of U.S. regulatory approval necessary for the commercial marketing and sale of the combination of Tazverik and R² (rituximab and lenalidomide) in second-line follicular lymphoma by 1 January 2028. The $1.45 per share cash consideration represents a premium of approximately 144% compared to Epizyme’s average closing price of $0.60 over the 30 trading days preceding announcement of the transaction. The transaction will be fully financed by Ipsen’s existing cash and lines of credit.The closing of the tender offer will be subject to customary conditions  including the tender of shares representing at least a majority of the total number of Epizyme’s outstanding shares  the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer  Ipsen would acquire all shares not acquired in the tender through a second-step merger for the same consideration as the tendering shareholders.AdvisorsBarclays is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Ipsen and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP as legal counsel to Ipsen. Epizyme is advised by both Jefferies and MTS Health Partners  L.P.  joint lead financial advisors in connection with the transaction  with WilmerHale serving as legal counsel. In addition  MTS Securities  LLC (an affiliate of MTS Health Partners  L.P.) provided an opinion to the Board of Directors of Epizyme regarding the fairness of the offer consideration to be received by the holders of Epizyme common stock in the transaction  subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth therein.Conference callA conference call and webcast for investors and analysts will begin today at 2pm Paris time.

Post marketing studies are required to confirm the anticipated clinical benefit and retain the labeled Accelerated Approval indications.The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions in patients with epithelioid sarcoma are pain  fatigue  nausea  decreased appetite  vomiting and constipation. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions in patients with follicular lymphoma are fatigue  upper respiratory tract infection  musculoskeletal pain  nausea and abdominal pain.View the U.S. Full Prescribing Information here: https://www.epizyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TAZVERIK.pdfAbout SYMPHONY-12SYMPHONY-1 is a global  multicenter Phase Ib/III study designed to determine the recommended Phase III dose (RP3D) and the efficacy and safety of Tazverik plus R² (rituximab and lenalidomide) versus placebo plus R²  in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma after at least one prior therapy. Updated safety and activity data from the Phase Ib safety run-in portion of the study were presented at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting. Thirty-eight of the 44 patients were evaluable for tumor assessments as of the data cutoff  with 36 patients responding to treatment. The activity findings showed an objective response rate of 95 percent (50% complete response rate and 45% partial response rate). Two patients achieved stable disease  and two patients had progressive disease (one from the 400-mg cohort and one from the 600-mg cohort). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response were not yet reached as the study is ongoing. The safety profile of the Tazverik and R² combination was consistent with the prescribing information for both Tazverik and R²  respectively.About EZM0414EZM0414 is a potent selective  oral  small molecule  investigational drug agent that inhibits the histone methyltransferase  SETD2  which plays a role in oncogenesis. SETD2 methylates histone as well as non-histone proteins  and this activity is involved in several key biological processes including transcriptional regulation  RNA splicing  and DNA damage repair. Based on the preclinical data on SETD2 inhibition by EZM0414 in multiple settings  including high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma (MM) and in other B-cell malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  the Company is conducting SET-101  a Phase 1/1b study of EZM0414  for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM and DLBCL.About follicular lymphoma3 4Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) which is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Follicular lymphoma develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally helps fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in the lymph nodes or other body organs. Follicular lymphoma is generally slow growing. Each year  15-20 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Most affected individuals are diagnosed with advanced disease.About epithelioid sarcoma5Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare  slow-growing type of soft tissue cancer. Most cases begin in the soft tissue under the skin of a finger  hand  forearm  lower leg or foot  though it can start in other areas of the body. Typically  epithelioid sarcoma starts as a small firm growth or lump that is painless. It usually starts out as a single growth  but multiple growths may occur by the time a person seeks medical help. Sometimes this sarcoma appears as ulcers that don't heal  looking like open wounds over the growths. It is estimated that 13 040 individuals received a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas in the U.S. in 2018 with a corresponding 5 150 deaths.6About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma7Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of NHL. NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally help to fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes or other body organs. DLBCL grows quickly and treatment starts soon after diagnosis. DLBCL is the most common type of NHL in the U.S. and worldwide  accounting for about 22 percent of newly diagnosed cases of B-cell NHL in the U.S. More than 18 000 people are diagnosed with DLBCL each year.8About multiple myeloma9Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer characterized by excessive production (proliferation) and improper function of certain cells (plasma cells) found in the bone marrow. Excessive plasma cells may eventually mass together to form a tumor or tumors in various sites of the body  especially the bone marrow. When multiple tumors are present or the bone marrow has greater than 10% plasma cells  the term multiple myeloma is used. In 2019  over 32 000 individuals in the U.S. were diagnosed with this disease. It is believed that approximately 100 000 Americans currently have the disease.About EpizymeEpizyme is a fully integrated  commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to its mission of rewriting treatment for cancer through novel epigenetic medicines.

The initial findings are as follows:After administration  the virus was found in the tumors after several days. This suggests that BT-001 is able to persist and replicates within tumors.This finding is consistent with the expression of the anti-CTLA-4 observed in the tumor with no detectable systemic exposure.No spreading in blood or biological fluids has been detected  suggesting high tumor specificity.Tumor shrinkage was observed in one patient in the first cohort.The part A of the Phase 1 trial aims to establish the tolerability of BT-001 and to determine the dose and administration schedule for further development. Repeated (every 3 weeks) and ascending doses of intratumoral administration of BT 001  as a single agent  will be administered to up to 18 patients with metastatic/advanced tumors.The first two dose levels have been successfully completed  with 12 patients dosed to date. The Safety Review Committee (SRC) has stated that the safety profile supports escalation to the highest dose level of Phase 1 part A.Story continuesThe Phase 1 part B is planned to start in H2 2022. This part will assess the combination of intratumoral injections of BT-001 with intravenous administrations of the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab.BT-001 is based on Transgene's patented oncolytic vector and is encoding BioInvent's proprietary anti-CTLA-4 antibody; it is codeveloped by the two biotechnology companies.***About the trialThe ongoing Phase 1/2a (NCT04725331) study is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation trial evaluating BT-001 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 treatment). Patient inclusions are ongoing in Europe (France  Belgium) and the trial has been authorized in the US.This Phase 1 is divided into two parts. In part A  patients with metastatic/advanced tumors receive single agent  intratumoral administrations of BT-001. Part B will explore the combination of intratumoral injections of BT-001 with pembrolizumab. The Phase 2a will evaluate the combination regimen in several patient cohorts with different tumor types. These expansion cohorts will offer the possibility of exploring the activity of this approach to treat other malignancies not traditionally addressed with this type of treatment.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene's Invir.IO™ platform and its patented large-capacity VVcopTK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent's proprietary n-CoDeR®/F.I.R.S.T™ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody may be greatly improved.BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration on oncolytic viruses between Transgene and BioInvent.

All of this requires a seismic shift in how clinical operations teams can - and should - monitor and report on those data to derive actionable insight ” said Lisa Moneymaker  senior vice president  R&D  Clinical Operations Technologies  Medidata. “ Enhancements to Medidata Detect  combined with the launch of Visual Analytics for Rave CTMS  streamline role-based workflows for data monitoring and significantly enhance clinical data visualization  providing clinical operations and data management teams with faster access to actionable insights.”Medidata Detect provides end-to-end data and risk surveillance  giving cross-functional operational teams the ability to monitor and mitigate risks to patient safety and data integrity. This release has created an entirely new role-based user experience  with four unique modules for data review  data analyses  site performance monitoring and protocol risk monitoring.Visual Analytics for Rave CTMS is a powerful new data visualization tool that allows users to quickly and easily navigate  explore  and combine data through intuitive visuals  charts and tables. With this launch  study teams have enormous flexibility to visualize all available data within Rave CTMS  and interrogate them in ways that make the most sense for them and for their organization.Both offerings are part of Medidata’s award-winning Digital Oversight Solution  which has been shown to reduce on-site monitoring days by 33% per site/year (a total of four monitoring days)  with no impact to study quality. Medidata’s Digital Oversight Solution unifies risk management  centralized monitoring  remote monitoring and a robust CTMS on one platform.

The macro-economic and severe geopolitical challenges in the second half of the year have presented significant headwinds. But our operations remain strong  and with improved profitability at the core  we are investing to scale into adjacent opportunities across our segments. We believe that growth from the autos transaction businesses in Classifieds  broader on-demand delivery ecosystem in Food Delivery  credit and digital banking in Payments & Fintech  and new investments in Edtech will create significant value for the Group over time.”“As part of our strategy to optimise our capital allocation  we purchased US$6.2bn of our own shares  which generated a meaningful enhancement to our NAV per share. We have also been active in the bond markets  raising US$9.3bn at attractive interest rates. The Group has a strong and liquid balance sheet  bolstered by the recent sale of our JD.com stake and we remain intent on maintaining our investment grade rating. Our solid financial footing positions us well for the challenging operating environment and the execution of our strategy.”Strong and consistent performance in ecommerceEcommerce revenues grew 51% to US$9.8bn  with robust growth across all key segments.

Earnout mechanisms have been put in place accordingly  with a timeframe of the end of the 2024 calendar year.Onlinecars has been valued on multiples consistent with the target's profile and the current environment. The transaction is fully financed through an increase in Aramis Group’s credit lines with Stellantis  which will continue to be a powerful support to Aramis Group's development  accompanying its strategic international expansion and contributing to the financing of its operations.Considering the acquisition’s provisional timeline  Onlinecars is expected to be consolidated by Aramis Group from the start of its 2022-23 fiscal year2. Based on the business guidance for the current fiscal year (i.e. organic revenues of over €1.7 billion)  pro forma for Onlinecars’ revenues  Aramis Group’s future scope will move towards the milestone of €2 billion of revenues per year  generated in five European countries.Rothschild was Aramis Group's financial advisor on this operation  with Hoche Avocats providing legal advice.***About Aramis GroupAramis Group is the leading European B2C platform for online used car sales  operating the Aramisauto  Cardoen  Clicars and CarSupermarket brands  in France  Belgium  Spain and the UK respectively.

One of our top-selling.,Ipsen to acquire Epizyme  expanding its portfolio in oncologyDetails Category: More News Published on Monday  27 June 2022 10:28 Hits: 230Transaction focused on lead asset Tazverik ® (tazemetostat)  a first-in-class EZH2 a inhibitor approved in the U.S.(tazemetostat)  a first-in-class EZH2 inhibitor approved in the U.S. Acquisition to bolster Ipsen’s growing oncology presence and leverage its infrastructureIpsen to commence all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Epizyme for $1.45 per share plus a contingent value right (CVR) of $1.00 per sharePARIS  France & CAMBRIDGE  MA  USA I June 27  2022 I Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) and Epizyme (Nasdaq: EPZM) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ipsen will acquire Epizyme. The transaction was unanimously approved by both Ipsen and Epizyme Boards of Directors and is anticipated to close by the end of the third quarter of 2022  subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions. Epizyme is a fully integrated  commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing and delivering transformative therapies against novel epigenetic targets for cancer patients.The primary focus of the acquisition is on the lead medicine  Tazverik® (tazemetostat)  a first-in-class  chemotherapy-free EZH21 inhibitor  which was granted Accelerated Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020. It is currently indicated for adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  and for adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  as well as for adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for complete resection.1 Tazverik is currently in the Phase III stage of a registrational confirmatory study (SYMPHONY-1) in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide (R2) in patients with relapsed/refractory FL who have received at least one prior therapy. Initial results from the Phase III randomized portion of this study are planned to read out in 2026.As part of the transaction  Ipsen will also acquire Epizyme’s first-in-class  oral SETD2 inhibitor development candidate  EZM0414  which was granted FDA Fast Track status and is currently under evaluation in a recently initiated Phase I/Ib trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  as well as a portfolio of preclinical programs focusing on epigenetic targets.“Through this agreement  we will expand our assets in oncology. Ipsen’s capabilities and resources in oncology combined with Epizyme’s will accelerate the growth of Tazverik to achieve its full potential in follicular lymphoma patients. The strength of data support Tazverik’s positioning in patients with both EZH2 mutation positive and wild-type follicular lymphoma. We are compelled by the potential of its efficacy and tolerability profile  especially for elderly and/or frail patients who are treated in the community-based setting. Furthermore  we are excited to bring on board epigenetic expertise and the SETD2 inhibitor  as well as several pre-clinical compounds into our portfolio ” said David Loew  Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen.“Epizyme was founded in 2007 with a commitment to rigorous scientific research and a vision of developing novel epigenetic therapies. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished over the past 15 years  from the approval of Tazverik to advancing our next novel investigational agent  EZM0414  to the clinic  as well as the progress made on our preclinical compounds focused on both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors ” said Grant Bogle  President and Chief Executive Officer of Epizyme. “We expect that this acquisition and Ipsen’s commitment to invest in the oncology space will ensure our epigenetic pipeline continues to advance in a way we could not have done on our own to bring transformative cancer therapies to patients in need.”Financial highlightsThe acquisition of Epizyme will immediately provide incremental sales and will leverage the U.S. commercial infrastructure. Given the level of ongoing R&D expenses  the transaction is expected to be moderately dilutive on Ipsen’s core operating income until the end of 2024. This is in line with Ipsen’s medium-term outlook regarding its strategic focus on building a high-value and sustainable pipeline through external innovation. The dilutive impact on 2022 core operating margin will be limited  given the expected timing of the transaction.Transaction detailsThe Board of Directors of Epizyme has unanimously approved the transaction and recommended that the stockholders of Epizyme tender their shares in the tender offer. Royalty Pharma  Epizyme’s largest stockholder with approximately 20.5% of Epizyme’s total shares of common stock outstanding (on a non‑diluted basis) as of the date hereof  has entered into a support agreement with Ipsen pursuant to which it has agreed to tender its shares in the tender offer.Under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  Ipsen  through a subsidiary  will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Epizyme at a price of $1.45 per share in cash at the closing of the transaction  for an initial estimated aggregate consideration of $247 millionb plus one contingent value right (CVR) per share. Each CVR will entitle its holder to deferred cash payments of $0.30 per CVR payable upon the first achievement of $250 million in aggregate net sales of Tazverik (excluding sales in Japan and Greater Chinac) in any period of four consecutive quarters  by 31 December 2026 and $0.70 per CVR payable upon receipt of U.S. regulatory approval necessary for the commercial marketing and sale of the combination of Tazverik and R² (rituximab and lenalidomide) in second-line follicular lymphoma by 1 January 2028. The $1.45 per share cash consideration represents a premium of approximately 144% compared to Epizyme’s average closing price of $0.60 over the 30 trading days preceding announcement of the transaction. The transaction will be fully financed by Ipsen’s existing cash and lines of credit.The closing of the tender offer will be subject to customary conditions  including the tender of shares representing at least a majority of the total number of Epizyme’s outstanding shares  the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer  Ipsen would acquire all shares not acquired in the tender through a second-step merger for the same consideration as the tendering shareholders.AdvisorsBarclays is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Ipsen and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP as legal counsel to Ipsen. Epizyme is advised by both Jefferies and MTS Health Partners  L.P.  joint lead financial advisors in connection with the transaction  with WilmerHale serving as legal counsel. In addition  MTS Securities  LLC (an affiliate of MTS Health Partners  L.P.) provided an opinion to the Board of Directors of Epizyme regarding the fairness of the offer consideration to be received by the holders of Epizyme common stock in the transaction  subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth therein.Conference callA conference call and webcast for investors and analysts will begin today at 2pm Paris time.

Updated safety and activity data from the Phase Ib safety run-in portion of the study were presented at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting. Thirty-eight of the 44 patients were evaluable for tumor assessments as of the data cutoff  with 36 patients responding to treatment. The activity findings showed an objective response rate of 95 percent (50% complete response rate and 45% partial response rate). Two patients achieved stable disease  and two patients had progressive disease (one from the 400-mg cohort and one from the 600-mg cohort). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response were not yet reached as the study is ongoing. The safety profile of the Tazverik and R² combination was consistent with the prescribing information for both Tazverik and R²  respectively.About EZM0414EZM0414 is a potent selective  oral  small molecule  investigational drug agent that inhibits the histone methyltransferase  SETD2  which plays a role in oncogenesis. SETD2 methylates histone as well as non-histone proteins  and this activity is involved in several key biological processes including transcriptional regulation  RNA splicing  and DNA damage repair. Based on the preclinical data on SETD2 inhibition by EZM0414 in multiple settings  including high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma (MM) and in other B-cell malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  the Company is conducting SET-101  a Phase 1/1b study of EZM0414  for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM and DLBCL.About follicular lymphoma3 4Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) which is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Follicular lymphoma develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally helps fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in the lymph nodes or other body organs. Follicular lymphoma is generally slow growing. Each year  15-20 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Most affected individuals are diagnosed with advanced disease.About epithelioid sarcoma5Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare  slow-growing type of soft tissue cancer. Most cases begin in the soft tissue under the skin of a finger  hand  forearm  lower leg or foot  though it can start in other areas of the body. Typically  epithelioid sarcoma starts as a small firm growth or lump that is painless. It usually starts out as a single growth  but multiple growths may occur by the time a person seeks medical help. Sometimes this sarcoma appears as ulcers that don't heal  looking like open wounds over the growths. It is estimated that 13 040 individuals received a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas in the U.S. in 2018 with a corresponding 5 150 deaths.6About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma7Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of NHL. NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally help to fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes or other body organs. DLBCL grows quickly and treatment starts soon after diagnosis. DLBCL is the most common type of NHL in the U.S. and worldwide  accounting for about 22 percent of newly diagnosed cases of B-cell NHL in the U.S. More than 18 000 people are diagnosed with DLBCL each year.8About multiple myeloma9Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer characterized by excessive production (proliferation) and improper function of certain cells (plasma cells) found in the bone marrow. Excessive plasma cells may eventually mass together to form a tumor or tumors in various sites of the body  especially the bone marrow. When multiple tumors are present or the bone marrow has greater than 10% plasma cells  the term multiple myeloma is used. In 2019  over 32 000 individuals in the U.S. were diagnosed with this disease. It is believed that approximately 100 000 Americans currently have the disease.About EpizymeEpizyme is a fully integrated  commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to its mission of rewriting treatment for cancer through novel epigenetic medicines.

(""Prosus"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PRX; JSE: PRX) are pleased to announce the beginning of an open-ended ","The board of directors of Naspers Limited (""Naspers Board"") (JSE: NPN; LSE: NPSN) and board of directors (""Prosus Board"") of Prosus N.V. (""Prosus"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PRX; JSE: PRX) are pleased to announce the beginning of an open-ended  repurchase programme in respect of the ordinary shares N in the capital of Prosus (""Prosus Shares"") and N ordinary shares (""Naspers Shares"") in the share capital of Naspers  from the respective Prosus and Naspers (together the ""Group"") free-float shareholders (together the ""Repurchase Programme"").The Repurchase Programme is expected to efficiently unlock immediate value for the shareholders of Prosus (""Prosus Shareholders"") and Naspers (""Naspers Shareholders"").Prosus will begin selling small numbers of ordinary shares in Tencent Holdings Limited (“Tencent”) held by the Group (“Tencent Shares”) regularly and in an orderly manner  while concurrently purchasing Prosus Shares and Naspers Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Programme  as long as the Group’s trading discount to net asset value is at elevated levels. Tencent is supportive of the withdrawal by Prosus of its voluntary restriction on the sale of its Tencent Shares.The Naspers Board and Prosus Board have great confidence in Tencent's long term prospects and the execution of the Repurchase Programme will result in the Group increasing its exposure to Tencent on a per share basis. At elevated levels of trading discount  however  the Naspers Board and Prosus Board believe that repurchasing Prosus Shares and Naspers Shares and monetising part of the Group's Tencent holding in order to implement the Repurchase Programme  is in the best interests of Prosus  Naspers and their respective shareholders.The Repurchase Programme has been designed to manage the number of Prosus Shares and Naspers Shares that will be repurchased and Tencent Shares that will be sold on a daily basis. Furthermore  the Group intends to repurchase Prosus Shares and Naspers Shares within regulatory limits  specifically the Market Abuse Regulation (as defined below)  and intends to do so in a balanced way over time.The Group anticipates that the number of Tencent Shares that will be sold per day will represent a small percentage of average daily traded volume of Tencent Shares. For example  had the Group executed the Repurchase Programme over the last three months within European regulatory limits  the resulting Tencent Shares that would have been sold on a daily basis would have been  on average  not more than approximately 3 - 5% of average daily traded volume. In the future Naspers might  subject to the requisite regulatory approvals being obtained  dispose of certain of the Prosus Shares that it holds in order to provide further funding for the repurchase of Naspers Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Programme.As the Group takes this action intended to unlock value for shareholders  it will also work towards maintaining an Investment Grade rating. In this regard  shareholders are referred to the announcement released by the Group today outlining that it has realised approximately US$3.67 billion through the disposal of its shares in JD.com  Inc. and that such proceeds are to be retained by the Group for general corporate and liquidity purposes.The Repurchase Programme  funded by the orderly  on-market sale of Tencent Shares  is an important step towards creating additional value for shareholders by increasing net asset value per share. The Naspers Board and Prosus Board also remain committed to better evidencing  and crystalising  the value of the Group's ecommerce portfolio.Bob van Dijk  CEO of Prosus and Naspers commented:“Today  we are announcing a open-ended share repurchase programme that is designed to unlock significant value for our shareholders over time. We expect the programme to significantly increase the net asset values per share for Prosus and Naspers. It will also rebalance our asset base towards our fast-growing non-Tencent assets  whose value we expect to increase over time  while retaining exposure to Tencent’s significant value creation potential. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy to build valuable consumer internet businesses to deliver sustainable returns over the long term.”Naspers and Prosus have appointed intermediaries to execute the Repurchase Programme and sale of Tencent Shares  within parameters set by the Group during open periods and subject to applicable law and regulation. The intermediaries will execute the Repurchase Programme and sale of Tencent Shares independently from  and uninfluenced by  Naspers and Prosus.The Repurchase Programme will commence immediately and is open-ended. Prosus intends to cancel the Prosus Shares repurchased by it under the Repurchase Programme in due course  so as to reduce its issued share capital.The Repurchase Programme will be implemented in accordance with  and subject to  applicable law and regulations  as well as the authority granted by Naspers Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 25 August 2021 and Prosus Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 24 August 2021 (""Prosus Shareholder Authorisation"") respectively  as renewed from time to time  including as to the maximum number of shares that can be repurchased under the Repurchase Programme.In respect of the Prosus Shareholder Authorisation  which was granted for a maximum period of 18 months from the Prosus Annual General Meeting held on 24 August 2021  having regard to the Prosus Shares already repurchased  a maximum of 264 914 808 Prosus Shares may be repurchased at a price  excluding expenses  not lower than the nominal value of the shares and not higher than the opening price on Euronext Amsterdam on the trading day of the repurchase or when the agreement to acquire the shares is entered into  plus 10%. At the 2022 Prosus Annual General Meeting authorisation will be sought  for a similar maximum duration of 18 months from the date of the 2022 Prosus Annual General Meeting  from Prosus Shareholders to increase the level of the Prosus Shareholder Authorisation to a maximum of 50% of the total issued share capital of Prosus as per the date of the annual general meeting  and the same pricing parameters outlined in the Prosus Shareholder Authorisation will apply.The Group will provide weekly updates on the Repurchase Programme in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation (as defined below) by means of press releases and announcements on the JSE’s Stock Exchange News Service (SENS)  and  together with details on a daily basis  on the Prosus website (www.prosus.com).Shareholders are advised that the Group will host a call at 16:00 CET on Monday  27 June 2022 with Bob van Dijk  the Prosus and Naspers CEO  and Basil Sgourdos  the Prosus and Naspers CFO  during which the full year results for the year ending 31 March 2022 and the Repurchase Programme will be discussed.
