They contacted the clearing house Euroclear and then bond market equivalent of an insurance payment arbiter - the Credit Derivative Determinations Committee which ruled that a ""credit event"" had happened.The sum was too small to trigger default clauses in all of Russia's international bonds  but it did mean some investors expected to receive default insurance payments.But when the U.S. Treasury clarified on its website that buying Russian bonds on the open  or 'secondary' market  was banned  that credit default swap (CDS) insurance process had to be halted as it was no longer clear what to do with the bonds involved.""It is a bit like if your house burns down and the insurance company turns around and claims it was the wrong kind of fire "" said Joe Delvaux  emerging markets distressed debt portfolio manager at Europe's largest fund manager Amundi. ""The reality is that these sanctions are a shock to the system.""INTENDED CONSEQUENCESThe step that made Russia's default unavoidable though was Washington's May 24 decision to let the waiver that had allowed U.S. bondholders to receive Russia's payments  expire.A week later  the EU also sanctioned Russia's domestic paying agent  its National Settlement Depository (NSD)  which it had been using to make the payments.Moscow has blamed the West for forcing an ""artificial default"". read more   with its finance minister Anton Siluanov calling the situation a ""farce.""However  veteran global policymakers involved in the process say they sanctions are unprecedented but fully justified.""They were very significant actions that responded to the magnitude of the actions that Russia undertook "" Agustin Carstens  the head of the world's central bank umbrella body  the Bank for International Settlements  said.(This story refiles to fixe typo in 1st paragraph)Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterAdditional reporting by John O'Donnell in Frankfurt  Francesco Guarascio in Brussels  Andrew MacAskill  Karin Strohecker and Vincent Flasseur in London and Gavin Jones in Milan Editing by Tomasz JanowskiOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",negative,0.01,0.14,0.85,negative,0.02,0.09,0.9,True,English,"['Big Package', 'Reuters.com', 'Russia', 'default', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'one senior rating agency analyst', 'first major international debt default', 'Credit Derivative Determinations Committee', 'international financial messaging system', ""first post-sanctions' bond payments"", 'European Union leaders summit', 'international financial network', 'Credit rating agency', 'debt portfolio manager', 'DEFAULT DEADLINE ONE', 'investment grade rating', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'largest fund manager', 'domestic paying agent', 'National Settlement Depository', 'veteran global policymakers', 'U.S. bondholders', 'credit default swap', 'top credit agencies', '30-day ""grace period', 'upcoming bond payments', 'Russian central bank', 'bond market equivalent', 'S&P Global', 'one European source', 'FREE unlimited access', 'U.S. Treasury', 'insurance payment arbiter', 'CDS) insurance process', 'U.S. sanctions', 'default insurance payments', 'Reuters.com Register', 'seven Russian banks', 'Russian oil sanctions', 'FIRST CUTS', 'international bonds', 'credit event', 'insurance company', 'selective default', 'default clauses', 'artificial default', 'European Commission', 'top diplomat', 'grace periods', 'Russian troops', 'Russian lenders', 'Russian dept', 'Russian ratings', 'Johanna Geron', 'File Photo', 'a century', 'key moments', 'emergency Group', 'Sergei Lavrov', 'cross-border transactions', 'heavier blow', 'advanced warning', 'many hurdles', 'UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES', 'issue currency', 'sharp-eyed creditors', 'extra interest', 'wrong kind', 'Joe Delvaux', 'emerging markets', 'finance minister', 'Anton Siluanov', 'Russian bonds', 'THE SYSTEM', 'Western sanctions', 'BIG PACKAGE', 'pivotal moment', 'SWIFT ACTION', 'SWIFT headquarters', 'five minutes', '10-12 days', 'special ""waiver', 'clearing house', 'May 24 decision', 'EU meetings', 'EU ban', 'response', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'Brussels', 'Belgium', 'LONDON', 'June', 'Washington', 'fact', 'Monday', 'months', 'Moscow', 'cash', 'summary', 'point', '2230 GMT', 'Feb.', 'experts', 'midnight', 'measures', 'Putin', 'reserves', 'lot', 'people', 'table', 'March', 'question', 'move', 'DEEPEST', 'licenses', 'bloc', 'answer', 'expectations', 'Office', 'April', 'force', 'roubles', 'dollars', 'Kremlin', 'SHOCK', 'time', 'Euroclear', 'investors', 'website', 'secondary', 'fire', 'Amundi', 'reality', 'step', 'NSD', 'situation', '11.30']",2022-06-27,2022-06-28,reuters.com

6969,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/557931-russia-rejects-default-claims/,Russia rejects default claims,Russia has fulfilled its Eurobond obligations to foreign investors  and there is no reason to declare a default  Kremlin says Read Full Article at RT.com,All bond payments were made on time  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insistsRussia has fulfilled its Eurobond obligations to foreign investors  and the fact that the funds were not forwarded to recipients due to Ukraine-related sanctions is no reason to declare a default  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.“No  we don’t agree ” Peskov said when asked by a reporter to comment on a report by Bloomberg claiming that Russia had defaulted on its debt for the first time since 1918.Peskov said that such claims are “absolutely unjustified” since the payment on the Eurobonds was made well before the deadline in mid-May.“And the fact that Euroclear withheld this money  did not transfer it to the recipients  this is no longer our problem. That is  there is no reason to call this a default ” Peskov explained.Bloomberg’s report followed the end of the one-month grace period in which payments on Russia’s government bonds were supposed to be transferred to bondholders. Russia’s Ministry of Finance sent the funds to the National Settlement Depository on May 20  a week before the payments were due  so that the money could reach investors before the expiry of the US license that allowed Russia to service its external debt despite Ukraine-related sanctions. The license expired on May 25  after which Russia’s payments in dollars and euros were blocked in the international settlement and clearing system Euroclear. However  Euroclear failed to forward the funds to investors before the license expired.Echoing Peskov’s words  the Russian Finance Ministry on Monday also reiterated that it had fulfilled Russia’s debt obligations in full in accordance with the Eurobond issuance documentation.“However  international settlement and clearing systems  having received funds in full in advance  having the legal and financial ability to bring these funds to the final recipients  did not take the necessary steps to do this ” the ministry stated. It also noted that  according to the official documents for the Eurobond issue  a default is defined as a debtor’s failure to transfer funds  while there is no specific guidance on the further movement of these funds after they enter the clearing system.“In this case  the non-receipt of money by investors did not occur as a result of the absence of payment  but due to the actions of third parties  which is not expressly provided for in the issuance documentation as an event of default ” the statement said.The ministry added that Russia does not refuse to fulfill its debt obligations to investors and will continue to do so in the future and advised bondholders to contact the relevant financial institutions regarding the fate of their money directly  as “the actions of foreign financial intermediaries are beyond the control of the Russian Ministry of Finance.”Last week  Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree that allows Russia to pay off its foreign currency debt through a ruble account at the exchange rate on the domestic market. To receive their funds  foreign investors need to open ruble accounts to which the ruble payments are to be transferred. After that  Russia's foreign-currency debt obligations will be considered “properly fulfilled.”For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.05,0.54,0.41,negative,0.01,0.13,0.85,True,English,"['default claims', 'Russia', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov', 'one-month grace period', 'relevant financial institutions', 'National Settlement Depository', 'foreign financial intermediaries', 'foreign currency debt', 'foreign-currency debt obligations', 'Eurobond issuance documentation', 'Russian Finance Ministry', 'financial ability', 'Russian Ministry', 'Eurobond obligations', 'international settlement', 'Eurobond issue', 'external debt', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'government bonds', 'clearing system', 'necessary steps', 'official documents', 'specific guidance', 'third parties', 'ruble account', 'exchange rate', 'domestic market', 'business section', 'foreign investors', 'first time', 'bond payments', 'ruble payments', 'US license', 'final recipients', 'fact', 'funds', 'reason', 'default', 'reporters', 'Monday', 'Bloomberg', 'claims', 'Eurobonds', 'deadline', 'mid-May', 'Euroclear', 'money', 'problem', 'end', 'bondholders', 'expiry', 'dollars', 'euros', 'words', 'accordance', 'advance', 'legal', 'debtor', 'failure', 'movement', 'case', 'receipt', 'result', 'absence', 'actions', 'event', 'statement', 'future', 'fate', 'control', 'decree', 'stories', 'economy']",2022-06-27,2022-06-28,rt.com

However the term expired without payment.It is Russia’s latest economic collapse on the debt-front following a default on its domestic debts in 1998 and and after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution where Moscow failed to pay off its international debts.Russia owes about $40 bn in foreign bonds. Russian officials denied the reports of a default  however. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov on Thursday said that “anyone can declare whatever they like. But anyone who understands what’s going on knows that this is in no way a default ” reported Bloomberg.The Kremlin also rejected the claims on Monday. In a call with reporters  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia made bond payments due in May but the fact they had been blocked by Euroclear because of Western sanctions on Russia was “not our problem”.Rating agencies monitoring the situation  like Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s  have already categorised the country’s debt into junk territory.The rumblings in the Russian market continued elsewehere as the Ruble  which plummeted to a historic low just hours after the invasion  was recorded down by about 40 per cent against the dollar on Monday.For more than 120 days now  Russia’s central bank’s foreign reserves have remained frozen and its top banks excluded from the global financial system.Sanctions imposed by Ukraine’s allies have damaged the Russian economy and pushed foreign companies to exit the Russian market.

But the stigma would probably raise its borrowing costs in future.The payments in question are $100 million in interest on two bonds  one denominated in U.S. dollars and another in euros  that Russia was due to pay on May 27. The payments had a grace period of 30 days  which expired on Sunday.Russia’s finance ministry said it made the payments to its onshore National Settlement Depository (NSD) in euros and dollars  adding it had fulfilled obligations.In a call with reporters  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the fact that payments had been blocked by Euroclear because of Western sanctions on Russia was “not our problem.”Clearing house Euroclear did not respond to a request for comment.Some Taiwanese holders of the bonds had not received payments on Monday  sources told Reuters.With no exact deadline specified in the prospectus  lawyers say Russia might have until the end of the following business day to pay these bondholders.Credit ratings agencies usually formally downgrade a country’s credit rating to reflect default  but this does not apply in case of Russia as most agencies no longer rate the country.LEGAL TANGLEThe legal situation surrounding the bonds looks complex.Russia’s bonds have been issued with an unusual variety of terms  and an increasing level of ambiguities for those sold more recently  when Moscow was already facing sanctions over its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and a poisoning incident in Britain in 2018.Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal  chair in banking and finance law at Queen Mary University in London  said clarity was needed on what constituted a discharge for Russia on its obligation  or the difference between receiving and recovering payments.“All these issues are subject to interpretation by a court of law ” Olivares-Caminal told Reuters.In some ways  Russia has been in default already.A committee on derivatives has ruled a “credit event” had occurred on some of Russia’s securities  which triggered a payout on some of Russia’s credit default swaps - instruments used by investors to insure against debt default.This was triggered by Russia failing to make a $1.9 million payment in accrued interest on a payment that had been due in early April.Until the Ukraine invasion  a sovereign default had seemed unthinkable  with Russia having an investment grade rating shortly before that point. A default would also be unusual as Moscow has the funds to service its debt.The U.S. Treasury’s OFAC had issued a temporary waiver  known as a general license 9A  in early March to allow Moscow to keep paying investors. The U.S. let the waiver expire on May 25 as Washington tightened sanctions on Russia  effectively cutting off payments to U.S. investors and entities.The lapsed OFAC license is not Russia’s only obstacle. In early June  the European Union imposed sanctions on the NSD  Russia’s appointed agent for its Eurobonds.Moscow has tried in the past few days to find ways of dealing with upcoming payments and avoid a default.President Vladimir Putin signed a decree last Wednesday to launch temporary procedures and give the government 10 days to choose banks to handle payments under a new scheme  suggesting Russia will consider its debt obligations fulfilled when it pays bondholders in roubles and onshore in Russia.“Russia saying it’s complying with obligations under the terms of the bond is not the whole story ” Zia Ullah  partner and head of corporate crime and investigations at law firm Eversheds Sutherland told Reuters.“If you as an investor are not satisfied  for instance  if you know the money is stuck in an escrow account  which effectively would be the practical impact of what Russia is saying  the answer would be  until you discharge the obligation  you have not satisfied the conditions of the bond.”Be smart with your money.

Following reports that Moscow had failed to pay about $100 million in interest on two bonds during a 30-day grace period that expired Sunday  the White House said the default showed the power of Western sanctions imposed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine. “This morning’s news around the finding of Russia’s default  for the first time in more than a century  situates just how strong the reactions are that the US  along with allies and partners  have taken  as well as how dramatic the impact has been on Russia’s economy ” a senior administration official said on the sidelines of a G7 summit in Germany.The article says analysts had expected the default sooner but rising energy prices cushioned the blow.

Russia says the money was sent to Euroclear  a bank which would then distribute the payment to investors.But that payment has been stuck there  according to Bloomberg News  and creditors have not received it.Meanwhile  some Taiwanese holders of Russian bonds denominated in euros have not received interest payments  according to the Reuters news agency  which cited two sources.The money had not arrived within 30 days of the due date  that is  Sunday evening  and so is considered a default.Euroclear would not say if the payment had been blocked  but said it adhered to all sanctions  introduced following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Story continuesRussia disputed that it had defaulted on the debt. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it had made the payments due in May  and the fact that it was blocked by Euroclear because of sanctions was ""not our problem.""Russia finance minister Anton Siluanov admitted foreign investors would ""not be able to receive"" the payments  according to the RIA Novosti news wire.Because Russia wants to pay and has plenty of money to do it  he denied that this amounts to a genuine default  which usually occur when governments refuse to pay  or their economies are so weak that they cannot find the money.""Everyone in the know understands that this is not a default at all. This whole situation looks like a farce.""Defaulting nations usually find it impossible to borrow any more money  but Russia is already in effect barred from borrowing in Western markets by sanctions.Also  Russia is reportedly earning about $1bn a day from fossil fuel exports  and its finance minister Anton Siluanov said in April the country had no plans to borrow more.Repayment triggerThe default will trigger repayments on a large chunk of Russia's debt  according to Mr Weafer.About $40bn of Russia's debts are denominated in dollars or euros  with around half held outside the country.""Some parts of that debt will now become automatically due because there will be early repayment clauses in all debt instruments so if you default on one it usually triggers the immediate demand for payment on the other debts  so Russia could certainly face immediate debt repayment of about $20bn at this stage "" he told the BBC's Today programme.Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov says the so-called default is a farce""Russia's last debt default of any kind was in 1998 as the country was rocked by the rouble crisis during the chaotic end of Boris Yeltsin's regime. At the time Moscow failed to keep up payments on its domestic bonds and defaulted on some overseas debt.Russia has seemed on an inevitable path to default since sanctions were first imposed by the US and European Union following the invasion of Ukraine.These restricted the country's access to the international banking networks which would process payments from Russia to investors around the world.The Russian government has said it wants to make all of its payments on time  and up until now it had succeeded.Default seemed inevitable when the US Treasury decided not to renew the special exemption in sanctions rules allowing investors to receive interest payments from Russia  which expired on 25 May.The Kremlin now appears to have accepted this inevitability too  decreeing on 23 June stating that all future debt payments would be made in roubles through a Russian bank  the National Settlements Depository  even when contracts state they should be in dollars or other international currencies.Meanwhile  Mr Weafer  who is based in Moscow  said that life was more or less operating as normal despite sanctions and Western companies withdrawing from Russia.""If you're in Moscow right now frankly  if you weren't reading the newspapers  you'd see there's been a price increase but otherwise life is as it was before February 24.""In March and April there was a lot of concern that products would disappear  that factories would not be able to get components or materials to continue operating and we could be looking therefore at a severe drop in employment or a rise in unemployment by the summer [or] early autumn. That situation has improved "" he added.""We've seen alternative import routes opening via Kazakhstan and Turkey  the government has promoted what they call a parallel import scheme so effectively a lot of products that were blocked in March and April are now starting to reappear  albeit at a higher price.""",negative,0.01,0.1,0.89,mixed,0.03,0.09,0.89,True,English,"['first time', 'Russia', 'debt', 'Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov', 'Russia finance minister Anton Siluanov', 'Moscow-based consultancy Macro Advisory', 'RIA Novosti news wire', 'global financial system', 'Reuters news agency', 'fossil fuel exports', 'National Settlements Depository', 'early repayment clauses', 'The White House', 'international banking networks', 'other international currencies', 'immediate debt repayment', 'future debt payments', '$100m interest payment', 'last debt default', 'Bloomberg News', 'Russian bonds', 'Russian government', 'Repayment trigger', 'immediate demand', 'The Kremlin', 'Russian bank', 'international bonds', 'Market trader', 'key deadline', '$100m payment', 'major blow', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'short-term impact', 'high-priced commodities', 'Chris Weafer', 'chief executive', 'Taiwanese holders', 'two sources', 'due date', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Defaulting nations', 'Western markets', 'large chunk', 'Mr Weafer', 'other debts', 'rouble crisis', 'chaotic end', 'Boris Yeltsin', 'domestic bonds', 'inevitable path', 'European Union', 'special exemption', 'Western companies', 'international creditors', 'debt instruments', 'overseas debt', 'interest payments', 'intermediary bank', 'international sanctions', 'legacy"" problem', 'Sunday evening', 'US Treasury', 'first time', 'genuine default', 'foreign investors', 'sanctions rules', 'customer', 'money', 'sum', 'country', 'prestige', 'statements', 'reserves', 'yields', 'situation', 'revenue', 'oil', 'Ukraine', 'sort', 'action', 'economy', 'recovery', 'stage', '27 May', 'Euroclear', 'euros', '30 days', 'invasion', 'Story', 'fact', 'plenty', 'governments', 'economies', 'Everyone', 'know', 'farce', 'effect', 'April', 'plans', 'repayments', 'dollars', 'half', 'parts', 'BBC', 'Today', 'programme', 'kind', 'regime', 'access', 'world', '25 May', 'inevitability', '23 June', 'roubles', 'contracts', 'life']",2022-06-27,2022-06-28,ca.sports.yahoo.com

price cap on Moscow's oil revenues and raising new tariffs on Russian goods.Oil embargoes  implemented by the US and Canada  and planned by the end of the year by most of the EU  have failed to cut Russia's revenues  and added to a surge in energy prices.US treasury secretary Janet Yellen has proposed to tackle it with a price cap  in exchange for sanctions relief for those trading Russian oil.The economic powerhouses also plan to ""restrict Russia's access to key industrial inputs  services  and technologies produced by our economies "" especially those supporting Russia's industrial base  according to the US statement.The sanctions would target major state-owned defence enterprises  defence research organisations  and dozens of other defence-related entities and individuals  the US statement said.However  EU countries would need unanimity among the 27-member bloc to impose a new round of sanctions.Hungary  which has held up for a month the latest  seventh  round of EU sanctions over its objections to banning oil imports  said it is open to discussing new sanctions  bar on energy  although Budapest considers the sanctions strategy a ""dead-end street"".Balázs Orbán  political director for the prime minister Viktor Orbán told EUobserver last Friday that it is time to consider whether the sanctions strategy is working  adding that ""we have concerns.""""If Europeans are thinking that except for the energy they still want to have sanctions against all the concerns raised by not the Hungarians  but the Americans  and Westerners or the expert  think tank people  we can sit down and discuss it "" Orbán said  underlining that energy is a red line for Hungary.DefaultMeanwhile  US president Joe Biden and EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen have accused Russia of continuing ""to use natural gas as a political and economic weapon"" in a joint statement.The two leaders said Moscow's ""politically-motivated disruption"" to gas supplies to several EU member states underlines the need to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian energy.The White House said on Monday that Russia had defaulted on its foreign sovereign bonds on Monday for the first time since 1917  a claim that later Moscow rejected.""There are no grounds to call this situation a default "" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Peskov argued that Russia made bond payments due in May  but the fact they had been blocked by Euroclear  a bank which then distributes the payment to international creditors  because of Western sanctions.Peskov said it was ""not our problem"".The G7 leaders also called on Moscow to ""cease  without condition  its attacks on agricultural and transport infrastructure and enable free passage of agricultural shipping from Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea.""The G7 gathering is set to be followed by a Nato leaders-level summit in Madrid  later in the week.Meanwhile  Russian missiles hit a shopping mall with reportedly some 1 000

Russia defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in a century  according to reports. For months following the country's invasion of Ukraine  Western sanctions have stymied its attempts to fulfill its obligations. On Sunday — when the grace period on around $100 million of interest payments due on May 27 expired — bondholders told The Wall Street Journal and Reuters they had not received their payments.But Russia's finance ministry said it made the payments on the bonds denominated in euros by sending the money to Euroclear  a bank that would then distribute the finances to investors. Labelling the situation ""a farce""  the Kremlin said any default is artificial  as it has the money to pay its debts  but sanctions are hampering institutions' ability to accept it.As the final grace period has passed  a deadline considered an event of default if missed  the focus is now on bondholders of 25% of the outstanding bonds  and whether they agree to declare that a default has occurred.In other news:Mohamed El-Erian.

There are absolutely no grounds to call such situation a default.”Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Monday  the finance ministry said that ‘actions of foreign financial intermediaries are beyond of the Russian finance ministry’s control ’ asking foreign bondholders to speak directly to those withholding the payments.“The non-receipt of money by investors did not occur because of lack of payment but due to the third party actions and which is not directly spelled out as a default situation by issue documentation ” the ministry added.As the U.S. waiver expired and the European Union sanctioned the National Settlement Depository (NSD)  the Russian version of Euroclear and Clearstream western clearing houses  last week Moscow paid its next coupons due in forex in roubles.President Vladimir Putin ordered last week that debt obligations would be considered fulfilled once a rouble payment equal to the forex amount due was made. Bondholders would need to open an account at a Russian bank to receive the payment.Moscow would not block the payment’s conversion into forex and its transfer abroad but investors would need to say in writing they don’t have claims against Russia  the ministry has said. The banks are yet to be announced.‘FINANCIAL NUCLEAR BOMB’The Group of Seven major Western powers banned transactions with Russia’s central bank and froze its assets held in their jurisdictions  worth around $300 billion  after Russia launched what it called special military operation in Ukraine in February.Some western politicians have called to seize the reserves frozen to rebuild Ukraine – the idea two high-ranked Russian financial sources said they believed was behind the announcement of default and which Moscow considers artificial.“By announcing a default  they can claim that sanctions work. Economically  financially assets could be confiscated legally ” one of the two sources said.Peskov reiterated on Monday that reserves were blocked ‘unlawfully’ and any attempts to use them would ‘amount to outright theft.’“I believe that a financial nuclear bomb was used against us  no country in the history of mankind has experienced such sanctions pressure as Russia is now ” Alexei Moiseev  Russian deputy finance minister  said last week.(Reporting by Reuters; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel),negative,0.02,0.21,0.76,negative,0.01,0.11,0.88,True,English,"['western financial agents', 'Russia', 'default', 'investors', 'two high-ranked Russian financial sources', 'Clearstream western clearing houses', 'Seven major Western powers', 'key U.S. waiver', 'Russian deputy finance minister', 'May forex coupon payment', 'euro coupon transfers', 'FINANCIAL NUCLEAR BOMB', 'National Settlement Depository', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'Frank Jack Daniel', 'foreign financial intermediaries', 'third party actions', 'Russian finance ministry', 'two sources', 'western politicians', 'Russian version', 'Russian bank', 'foreign currency', 'last week', 'issue conditions', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'issue documentation', 'European Union', 'next coupons', 'debt obligations', 'forex amount', 'The Group', 'central bank', 'outright theft', 'Alexei Moiseev', 'foreign bondholders', 'rouble payment', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'sanctions pressure', 'default situation', 'Eurobonds', 'dollar', 'transactions', 'investors', 'Statements', 'call', 'reporters', 'Monday', 'fact', 'Euroclear', 'money', 'recipients', 'problem', 'grounds', 'request', 'comment', 'control', 'payments', 'non', 'receipt', 'lack', 'NSD', 'Moscow', 'roubles', 'account', 'conversion', 'writing', 'claims', 'banks', 'assets', 'jurisdictions', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'reserves', 'idea', 'announcement', 'attempts', 'country', 'history', 'mankind', 'Reuters', 'Editing']",2022-06-27,2022-06-28,fxempire.com
6979,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/the-big-package-how-russia-was-driven-to-default-1046301,The “Big Package”: How Russia was driven to default,By Marc Jones LONDON (Reuters) -   Russia&#039;s first major international debt default in over a century  which Washington said became a fact on Monday  follows months of co-ordinated Western sanctions that left Moscow with cash but o access to the internati…,Swift actionDays later  on March 2  the EU struck again by banning seven Russian banks from SWIFT  an international financial messaging system crucial for cross-border transactions.Booting Russian lenders from SWIFT had long been considered a ‘nuclear option ’ but the invasion put it on the table and when the EU decided to activate it  those at SWIFT headquarters just outside Brussels were ready.The only question was how long they had to implement the move  “five days or five minutes?” another source said. In the end is was 10-12 days.FIRST CUTS  BUT NOT THE DEEPESTCredit rating agency  S&P Global  already stripped Moscow of its coveted investment grade rating on Feb. 26 and Russian bonds were slumping  but a heavier blow followed on March 15  when the EU told top credit agencies to stop rating Russian dept or risk losing their licenses to operate in the bloc.“We were caught flat-footed  certainly we were not given any advanced warning ” one senior rating agency analyst said. “Basically the question was  does this mean we can’t rate Russia any more?” It turned out the answer was yes.Default deadline oneWith so many hurdles being erected  expectations built that Russia would default on its first post-sanctions’ bond payments either on March 16  or a month later at the end of a 30-day “grace period.”However  a special “waiver” in the U.S. sanctions granted by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control allowed payments to go through.Unintended consequencesOn April 8  a week before the EU ban on Russian ratings was due to come into force  S&P declared Russia in “selective default” after Moscow said it planned to make upcoming bond payments in roubles rather than dollars  their issue currency.On May 3 though  shortly before the payment was due  the Kremlin U-turned and paid in dollars.Shock to the systemDays later  Russia had stumbled  though.On May 11  sharp-eyed creditors spotted that Moscow had failed to add $1.9 million of extra interest that had built up on bonds that only got paid in their grace periods rather than on time. They contacted the clearing house Euroclear and then bond market equivalent of an insurance payment arbiter – the Credit Derivative Determinations Committee https://www.cdsdeterminationscommittees.org/cds/the-russian-federation which ruled that a “credit event” had happened.The sum was too small to trigger default clauses in all of Russia’s international bonds  but it did mean some investors expected to receive default insurance payments.But when the U.S. Treasury clarified on its website that buying Russian bonds on the open  or ‘secondary’ market  was banned  that credit default swap (CDS) insurance process had to be halted as it was no longer clear what to do with the bonds involved.“It is a bit like if your house burns down and the insurance company turns around and claims it was the wrong kind of fire ” said Joe Delvaux  emerging markets distressed debt portfolio manager at Europe’s largest fund manager Amundi. “The reality is that these sanctions are a shock to the system.”Intended consequencesThe step that made Russia’s default unavoidable though was Washington’s May 24 decision to let the waiver that had allowed U.S. bondholders to receive Russia’s payments  expire.A week later  the EU also sanctioned Russia’s domestic paying agent  its National Settlement Depository (NSD)  which it had been using to make the payments.Moscow has blamed the West for forcing an “artificial default”.  with its finance minister Anton Siluanov calling the situation a “farce.”However  veteran global policymakers involved in the process say they sanctions are unprecedented but fully justified.“They were very significant actions that responded to the magnitude of the actions that Russia undertook ” Agustin Carstens  the head of the world’s central bank umbrella body  the Bank for International Settlements  said.(This story refiles to fixe typo in 1st paragraph).(Additional reporting by John O’Donnell in Frankfurt  Francesco Guarascio in Brussels  Andrew MacAskill  Karin Strohecker and Vincent Flasseur in London and Gavin Jones in Milan; Editing by Tomasz Janowski),negative,0.02,0.14,0.84,mixed,0.04,0.1,0.87,True,English,"['Big Package', 'The', 'Russia', 'one senior rating agency analyst', 'Credit Derivative Determinations Committee', 'central bank umbrella body', 'international financial messaging system', 'first post-sanctions’ bond payments', 'Credit rating agency', 'investment grade rating', 'top credit agencies', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'debt portfolio manager', 'largest fund manager', 'domestic paying agent', 'National Settlement Depository', 'veteran global policymakers', 'John O’Donnell', 'bond market equivalent', 'U.S. bondholders', '30-day “grace period', 'upcoming bond payments', 'credit default swap', 'S&P Global', 'seven Russian banks', 'U.S. Treasury', 'insurance payment arbiter', 'U.S. sanctions', 'default insurance payments', 'CDS) insurance process', 'FIRST CUTS', 'credit event', 'insurance company', 'International Settlements', 'grace periods', 'secondary’ market', 'Default deadline', 'selective default', 'default clauses', 'artificial default', 'international bonds', 'Russian lenders', 'Russian dept', 'Russian ratings', 'cross-border transactions', '10-12 days', 'heavier blow', 'advanced warning', 'many hurdles', 'Unintended consequences', 'issue currency', 'sharp-eyed creditors', 'extra interest', 'wrong kind', 'Joe Delvaux', 'emerging markets', 'finance minister', 'Anton Siluanov', 'Agustin Carstens', '1st paragraph', 'Additional reporting', 'Francesco Guarascio', 'Andrew MacAskill', 'Karin Strohecker', 'Vincent Flasseur', 'Gavin Jones', 'Tomasz Janowski', 'Russian bonds', 'Swift action', 'SWIFT headquarters', 'five minutes', 'special “waiver', 'clearing house', 'significant actions', 'May 24 decision', 'EU ban', 'March', 'invasion', 'table', 'Brussels', 'question', 'move', 'source', 'DEEPEST', 'Moscow', 'Feb.', 'licenses', 'bloc', 'answer', 'expectations', 'Office', 'April', 'force', 'roubles', 'dollars', 'Kremlin', 'Shock', 'time', 'Euroclear', 'cdsdeterminationscommittees', 'org', 'russian-federation', 'sum', 'investors', 'website', 'fire', 'Europe', 'Amundi', 'reality', 'step', 'Washington', 'NSD', 'West', 'situation', 'magnitude', 'world', 'story', 'typo', 'Frankfurt', 'London', 'Milan', 'Editing']",2022-06-27,2022-06-28,fxempire.com

But the stigma would probably raise its borrowing costs in future.The payments in question are $100 million in interest on two bonds  one denominated in U.S. dollars and another in euros  that Russia was due to pay on May 27. The payments had a grace period of 30 days  which expired on Sunday.Russia’s finance ministry said it made the payments to its onshore National Settlement Depository (NSD) in euros and dollars  adding it had fulfilled obligations.In a call with reporters  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the fact that payments had been blocked by Euroclear because of Western sanctions on Russia was “not our problem.”Clearing house Euroclear did not respond to a request for comment.Some Taiwanese holders of the bonds had not received payments on Monday  sources told Reuters.With no exact deadline specified in the prospectus  lawyers say Russia might have until the end of the following business day to pay these bondholders.Credit ratings agencies usually formally downgrade a country’s credit rating to reflect default  but this does not apply in case of Russia as most agencies no longer rate the country.Legal tangleThe legal situation surrounding the bonds looks complex.Russia’s bonds have been issued with an unusual variety of terms  and an increasing level of ambiguities for those sold more recently  when Moscow was already facing sanctions over its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and a poisoning incident in Britain in 2018.Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal  chair in banking and finance law at Queen Mary University in London  said clarity was needed on what constituted a discharge for Russia on its obligation  or the difference between receiving and recovering payments.“All these issues are subject to interpretation by a court of law ” Olivares-Caminal told Reuters.In some ways  Russia has been in default already.A committee on derivatives has ruled a “credit event” had occurred on some of Russia’s securities  which triggered a payout on some of Russia’s credit default swaps — instruments used by investors to insure against debt default.This was triggered by Russia failing to make a $1.9 million payment in accrued interest on a payment that had been due in early April.Until the Ukraine invasion  a sovereign default had seemed unthinkable  with Russia having an investment grade rating shortly before that point. A default would also be unusual as Moscow has the funds to service its debt.The U.S. Treasury’s OFAC had issued a temporary waiver  known as a general license 9A  in early March to allow Moscow to keep paying investors. The U.S. let the waiver expire on May 25 as Washington tightened sanctions on Russia  effectively cutting off payments to U.S. investors and entities.The lapsed OFAC license is not Russia’s only obstacle. In early June  the European Union imposed sanctions on the NSD  Russia’s appointed agent for its Eurobonds.Moscow has tried in the past few days to find ways of dealing with upcoming payments and avoid a default.President Vladimir Putin signed a decree last Wednesday to launch temporary procedures and give the government 10 days to choose banks to handle payments under a new scheme  suggesting Russia will consider its debt obligations fulfilled when it pays bondholders in rubles and onshore in Russia.“Russia saying it’s complying with obligations under the terms of the bond is not the whole story ” Zia Ullah  partner and head of corporate crime and investigations at law firm Eversheds Sutherland told Reuters.“If you as an investor are not satisfied  for instance  if you know the money is stuck in an escrow account  which effectively would be the practical impact of what Russia is saying  the answer would be  until you discharge the obligation  you have not satisfied the conditions of the bond.”Reporting by Karin Strohecker in London  Andrea Shalal in Elmau and Emily Chan in Taipei and Sujata Rao in London.,negative,0.02,0.16,0.82,negative,0.01,0.17,0.82,True,English,"['historic default', 'Russia', 'sanctions', 'U.S. Treasury Department', 'The U.S. Treasury', 'U.S. official', 'global financial system', 'National Settlement Depository', 'following business day', 'Queen Mary University', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'investment grade rating', 'general license 9A', 'U.S. dollars', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'gas export revenues', 'Credit ratings agencies', 'U.S. investors', 'Clearing house Euroclear', 'key payment deadline', 'credit default swaps', 'first major default', 'The Kremlin', 'gas revenues', 'White House', 'most agencies', 'credit event', 'first time', 'exact deadline', 'a century', 'G7 summit', 'Bolshevik revolution', 'Dennis Hranitzky', 'sovereign litigation', 'Quinn Emanuel', 'borrowing costs', 'grace period', 'finance ministry', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'Taiwanese holders', 'Legal tangle', 'legal situation', 'unusual variety', 'increasing level', 'poisoning incident', '$1.9 million payment', 'early April', 'early June', 'European Union', 'temporary procedures', 'new scheme', 'OFAC license', 'artificial default', 'Russian default', 'formal default', 'sovereign default', 'law firm', 'Sunday deadline', 'finance law', 'international bonds', 'outstanding bonds', 'two bonds', 'plentiful oil', 'Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal', 'temporary waiver', 'early March', 'sweeping sanctions', 'Western sanctions', 'debt default', 'overdue interest', 'late May', 'debt obligations', 'upcoming payments', 'Ukraine invasion', 'LONDON', 'country', 'money', 'claims', 'bondholders', 'Monday', 'expiry', 'Feb.', 'news', 'finding', 'actions', 'allies', 'partners', 'impact', 'economy', 'sidelines', 'Germany', 'efforts', 'roadblock', 'Office', 'Moscow', 'question', 'head', 'Reuters', 'moment', 'stigma', 'future', 'euros', '30 days', 'onshore', 'NSD', 'call', 'reporters', 'fact', 'problem', 'request', 'comment', 'Some', 'sources', 'prospectus', 'lawyers', 'end', 'case', 'terms', 'ambiguities', 'annexation', 'Crimea', 'Britain', 'chair', 'banking', 'clarity', 'discharge', 'difference', 'issues', 'interpretation', 'court', 'ways', 'committee', 'derivatives', 'securities', 'payout', 'instruments', 'point', 'funds', 'paying', 'Washington', 'entities', 'lapsed', 'obstacle', 'agent', 'Eurobonds', 'past', 'decree', 'government', '10 days', 'banks', 'rubles']",2022-06-27,2022-06-28,stltoday.com

There are absolutely no grounds to call such a situation a default "" Peskov said.""There is money and there is also the readiness to pay "" Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said last month of the looming default  calling the situation ""artificially created"" by ""unfriendly"" powers.What happens now?The default status is also unlikely to affect the lives of ordinary Russians  already struggling with soaring inflation and steep economic recession.Despite this  the default status is likely to dissuade investors even further from bringing any money into Russia  which has become a political and financial outcast since its invasion of Ukraine in February. It will also raise Moscow's borrowing costs in the future.Under normal circumstances  investors and the defaulting government typically reach a settlement in which bondholders are given new bonds that are worth less but that at least provide partial compensation. But sanctions forbid negotiating with the Russian Finance Ministry  and with no end to the war in sight there is no way to say how much the defaulted bonds will end up being worth.Last Wednesday  Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to launch temporary protection procedures and give the government 10 days to choose banks to handle payments under a new scheme  suggesting Moscow plans to pay bondholders back in rubles regardless of what currency the debt is owed in.Default unlikely to have international effectInvestment analysts have said the default  while problematic for the Kremlin  is unlikely to wreak havoc on global markets. Kristalina Georgieva  managing director of the International Monetary Fund  has called the event ""not systemically relevant.""The turn of events will likely mean serious losses for any international businesses left engaging with the Russian economy  such as funds that invest in emerging markets. Russia  however  played only a small role in emerging market bond indexes before the war  limiting the losses to fund investors.Russia has not been in a state of default since the 1917 revolution that created the Soviet Union.

7006,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/ipsen-epizyme-acquisition-cancer-sarcoma-lymphoma-drug/626115/,Ipsen adds to cancer business with bargain buyout of Epizyme - BioPharma Dive,Epizyme  which was once worth more than $2 billion  agreed to be bought for $247 million upfront. The biotech has continued to lose money despite winning FDA approval for a drug for rare cancers.,Dive Brief:French drugmaker Ipsen will buy Massachusetts-based biotech Epizyme  announcing on Monday that it will spend $247 million to acquire the cancer drug developer in a deal that could be worth another $170 million if certain goals are met.In 2020  Epizyme won Food and Drug Administration accelerated approval of Tazverik  a drug for a rare soft-tissue cancer that’s since been cleared in a type of blood cancer. The company earned only $31 million in sales last year  and recorded a net loss of $250 million.Per deal terms  Ipsen will pay $1.45 per share and potentially up to another $1 per share through what’s known as a contingent value right. The upfront payment represents a 53% premium to the closing price of Epizyme stock Friday  although it is far below the nearly $27 price that shares hit just before Tazverik won approval.Dive Insight:Epizyme met a goal that few biotechs achieve when it managed to secure approval of Tazverik. But converting that clinical and regulatory success into commercial performance has proved challenging.The first cancer type in which Tazverik won approval  epithelioid sarcoma  is diagnosed in only a few hundred U.S. patients per year. The second  follicular lymphoma  has several competing treatments available  like Gilead’s Zydelig as well as similarly acting drugs.Epizyme did manage to attract overseas partners  with Eisai holding rights in Japan as part of an earlier development deal  and Hutchmed in China paying $25 million upfront for rights in 2021. To raise money  Epizyme sold a 21% stake in the company to Royalty Pharma  a biotech financing company  for $100 million in 2019.The biotech still was forced to cut costs  laying off 11% of its workforce in August 2021 and then another 12% of the remaining employees in March 2022.As part of Ipsen  Tazverik will join a cancer drug business that includes primarily chemotherapy and hormone therapies. Only one  Somatuline  is a blockbuster  with 2021 sales of $1.2 billion euros  or $1.3 billion.Ipsen said the deal will “will immediately provide incremental sales” and will help it build its U.S. sales and marketing organization. However  Epizyme’s ongoing research and development expenses  which amounted to $131 million in 2021  will reduce Ipsen’s profits “until the end of 2024.”Epizyme has two major Phase 3 trials underway for Tazverik to confirm its use in both sarcoma and lymphoma. If successful  those trials would allow the company to convert accelerated FDA clearances into full approvals.Ipsen shares fell 3% Monday on the Euronext stock exchange.,neutral,0.04,0.91,0.04,mixed,0.06,0.23,0.72,True,English,"['cancer business', 'bargain buyout', 'BioPharma Dive', 'Ipsen', 'Epizyme', 'hundred U.S. patients', 'two major Phase 3 trials', 'contingent value right', 'several competing treatments', 'rare soft-tissue cancer', 'U.S. sales', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'cancer drug developer', 'cancer drug business', 'second, follicular lymphoma', 'first cancer type', 'French drugmaker Ipsen', 'earlier development deal', 'biotech financing company', 'Massachusetts-based biotech Epizyme', 'blood cancer', 'development expenses', 'Drug Administration', 'Dive Brief', 'net loss', 'upfront payment', 'Dive Insight', 'regulatory success', 'commercial performance', 'overseas partners', 'Royalty Pharma', 'remaining employees', 'hormone therapies', 'billion euros', 'marketing organization', 'ongoing research', 'FDA clearances', 'full approvals', 'Epizyme stock', 'deal terms', 'incremental sales', 'closing price', 'epithelioid sarcoma', 'Ipsen shares', '2021 sales', '$27 price', 'Monday', 'goals', 'Food', 'Tazverik', '53% premium', 'biotechs', 'clinical', 'year', 'Gilead', 'Zydelig', 'drugs', 'Eisai', 'rights', 'Japan', 'Hutchmed', 'China', 'money', '21% stake', 'costs', 'workforce', 'August', 'March', 'chemotherapy', 'Somatuline', 'blockbuster', 'profits', 'end']",2022-06-27,2022-06-28,biopharmadive.com

7010,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220626005028/en/Transgene-and-BioInvent-Announce-Positive-Progress-for-BT-001,Transgene and BioInvent Announce Positive Progress for BT-001,STRASBOURG  France & LUND  Sweden--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News: Transgene (Euronext Paris: TNG) (Paris:TNG)  a biotech company that designs and develops virus-based immunotherapeutics against cancer  and BioInvent International AB (“BioInvent”) (Nasdaq S…,STRASBOURG  France & LUND  Sweden--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Transgene (Euronext Paris: TNG) (Paris:TNG)  a biotech company that designs and develops virus-based immunotherapeutics against cancer  and BioInvent International AB (“BioInvent”) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BINV)  a biotech company focused on the discovery and development of novel and first-in-class immune-modulatory antibodies for cancer immunotherapy  today jointly announced positive progress and safety data of the ongoing Phase I/IIa trial evaluating BT-001 in patients with solid tumors  including melanoma.The initial data generated in Phase I part A demonstrated that BT-001 alone is well tolerated  with first signs of anti-tumor activity in a hard-to-treat population and confirmed the mechanism of action of BT‑001 as a single agent. The initial findings are as follows:After administration  the virus was found in the tumors after several days. This suggests that BT‑001 is able to persist and replicates within tumors;This finding is consistent with the expression of the anti-CTLA-4 observed in the tumor with no detectable systemic exposure;with no detectable systemic exposure; No spreading in blood or biological fluids has been detected  suggesting high tumor specificity;Tumor shrinkage was observed in one patient in the first cohort.The part A of the Phase I trial aims to establish the tolerability of BT-001 and to determine the dose and administration schedule for further development. Repeated (every 3 weeks) and ascending doses of intratumoral administration of BT‑001  as a single agent  will be administered to up to 18 patients with metastatic/advanced tumors.The first two dose levels have been successfully completed  with 12 patients dosed to date. The Safety Review Committee (SRC) has stated that the safety profile supports escalation to the highest dose level of Phase I part A.The Phase I part B is planned to start in H2 2022. This part will assess the combination of intratumoral injections of BT-001 with intravenous administrations of the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab.BT-001 is based on Transgene’s patented oncolytic vector and is encoding BioInvent’s proprietary anti‑CTLA‑4 antibody; it is codeveloped by the two biotechnology companies.About the trialThe ongoing Phase I/IIa (NCT04725331) study is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation trial evaluating BT-001 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 treatment). Patient inclusions are ongoing in Europe (France  Belgium) and the trial has been authorized in the US.This Phase I is divided into two parts. In part A  patients with metastatic/advanced tumors receive single agent  intra-tumoral administrations of BT-001. Part B will explore the combination of intra-tumoral injections of BT-001 with pembrolizumab. The Phase IIa will evaluate the combination regimen in several patient cohorts with different tumor types. These expansion cohorts will offer the possibility of exploring the activity of this approach to treat other malignancies not traditionally addressed with this type of treatment.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene’s Invir.IO™ platform and its patented large-capacity VV cop TK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent’s proprietary n-CoDeR®/F.I.R.S.T™ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody may be greatly improved.BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration on oncolytic viruses between Transgene and BioInvent. To know more on BT-001  watch our video here.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

The transaction was unanimously approved …,"PARIS & CAMBRIDGE  Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) and Epizyme (Nasdaq: EPZM) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ipsen will acquire Epizyme. The transaction was unanimously approved by both Ipsen and Epizyme Boards of Directors and is anticipated to close by the end of the third quarter of 2022  subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions. Epizyme is a fully integrated  commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing and delivering transformative therapies against novel epigenetic targets for cancer patients.The primary focus of the acquisition is on the lead medicine  Tazverik® (tazemetostat)  a first-in-class  chemotherapy-free EZH21 inhibitor  which was granted Accelerated Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020. It is currently indicated for adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  and for adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  as well as for adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for complete resection.1 Tazverik is currently in the Phase III stage of a registrational confirmatory study (SYMPHONY-1) in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide (R2) in patients with relapsed/refractory FL who have received at least one prior therapy. Initial results from the Phase III randomized portion of this study are planned to read out in 2026.As part of the transaction  Ipsen will also acquire Epizyme’s first-in-class  oral SETD2 inhibitor development candidate  EZM0414  which was granted FDA Fast Track status and is currently under evaluation in a recently initiated Phase I/Ib trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  as well as a portfolio of preclinical programs focusing on epigenetic targets.“ Through this agreement  we will expand our assets in oncology. Ipsen’s capabilities and resources in oncology combined with Epizyme’s will accelerate the growth of Tazverik to achieve its full potential in follicular lymphoma patients. The strength of data support Tazverik’s positioning in patients with both EZH2 mutation positive and wild-type follicular lymphoma. We are compelled by the potential of its efficacy and tolerability profile  especially for elderly and/or frail patients who are treated in the community-based setting. Furthermore  we are excited to bring on board epigenetic expertise and the SETD2 inhibitor  as well as several pre-clinical compounds into our portfolio ” said David Loew  Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen.“ Epizyme was founded in 2007 with a commitment to rigorous scientific research and a vision of developing novel epigenetic therapies. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished over the past 15 years  from the approval of Tazverik to advancing our next novel investigational agent  EZM0414  to the clinic  as well as the progress made on our preclinical compounds focused on both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors ” said Grant Bogle  President and Chief Executive Officer of Epizyme. “ We expect that this acquisition and Ipsen’s commitment to invest in the oncology space will ensure our epigenetic pipeline continues to advance in a way we could not have done on our own to bring transformative cancer therapies to patients in need.”Financial highlightsThe acquisition of Epizyme will immediately provide incremental sales and will leverage the U.S. commercial infrastructure. Given the level of ongoing R&D expenses  the transaction is expected to be moderately dilutive on Ipsen’s core operating income until the end of 2024. This is in line with Ipsen’s medium-term outlook regarding its strategic focus on building a high-value and sustainable pipeline through external innovation. The dilutive impact on 2022 core operating margin will be limited  given the expected timing of the transaction.Transaction detailsThe Board of Directors of Epizyme has unanimously approved the transaction and recommended that the stockholders of Epizyme tender their shares in the tender offer.

Updated safety and activity data from the Phase Ib safety run-in portion of the study were presented at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting. Thirty-eight of the 44 patients were evaluable for tumor assessments as of the data cutoff  with 36 patients responding to treatment. The activity findings showed an objective response rate of 95 percent (50% complete response rate and 45% partial response rate). Two patients achieved stable disease  and two patients had progressive disease (one from the 400-mg cohort and one from the 600-mg cohort). Median progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response were not yet reached as the study is ongoing. The safety profile of the Tazverik and R² combination was consistent with the prescribing information for both Tazverik and R²  respectively.About EZM0414EZM0414 is a potent selective  oral  small molecule  investigational drug agent that inhibits the histone methyltransferase  SETD2  which plays a role in oncogenesis. SETD2 methylates histone as well as non-histone proteins  and this activity is involved in several key biological processes including transcriptional regulation  RNA splicing  and DNA damage repair. Based on the preclinical data on SETD2 inhibition by EZM0414 in multiple settings  including high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma (MM) and in other B-cell malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  the Company is conducting SET-101  a Phase 1/1b study of EZM0414  for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM and DLBCL.About follicular lymphoma3 4Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) which is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Follicular lymphoma develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally helps fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in the lymph nodes or other body organs. Follicular lymphoma is generally slow growing. Each year  15-20 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Most affected individuals are diagnosed with advanced disease.About epithelioid sarcoma5Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare  slow-growing type of soft tissue cancer. Most cases begin in the soft tissue under the skin of a finger  hand  forearm  lower leg or foot  though it can start in other areas of the body. Typically  epithelioid sarcoma starts as a small firm growth or lump that is painless. It usually starts out as a single growth  but multiple growths may occur by the time a person seeks medical help. Sometimes this sarcoma appears as ulcers that don't heal  looking like open wounds over the growths. It is estimated that 13 040 individuals received a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas in the U.S. in 2018 with a corresponding 5 150 deaths.6About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma7Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of NHL. NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally help to fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes or other body organs. DLBCL grows quickly and treatment starts soon after diagnosis. DLBCL is the most common type of NHL in the U.S. and worldwide  accounting for about 22 percent of newly diagnosed cases of B-cell NHL in the U.S. More than 18 000 people are diagnosed with DLBCL each year.8About multiple myeloma9Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer characterized by excessive production (proliferation) and improper function of certain cells (plasma cells) found in the bone marrow. Excessive plasma cells may eventually mass together to form a tumor or tumors in various sites of the body  especially the bone marrow. When multiple tumors are present or the bone marrow has greater than 10% plasma cells  the term multiple myeloma is used. In 2019  over 32 000 individuals in the U.S. were diagnosed with this disease. It is believed that approximately 100 000 Americans currently have the disease.About EpizymeEpizyme is a fully integrated  commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to its mission of rewriting treatment for cancer through novel epigenetic medicines.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.Epizyme Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking StatementsAny statements in this press release about future expectations  plans and prospects for Epizyme and other statements containing the words “anticipate "" “believe ” “estimate ” “expect ” “intend ” “may ” “plan ” “predict ” “project ” “target ” “potential ” “will ” “would ” “could ” “should ” “continue ” and similar expressions  constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors  including: uncertainties as to the timing of the tender offer; the risk that the proposed transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all; the possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals for Epizyme will be made; uncertainty surrounding how many of Epizyme’s stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; the possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the tender offer may not be satisfied or waived  including the failure to receive any required regulatory approvals from any applicable governmental entities; the possibility of business disruptions due to transaction-related uncertainty; the occurrence of any event  change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the proposed transaction may result in significant costs of defense  indemnification and liability; and other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of the company’s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and in the company's other filings from time to time with the SEC.

The transaction was unanimously approved by both Ipsen and Epizyme Boards of Directors and is anticipated to close by the end of the third quarter of 2022  subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions. Epizyme is a fully integrated  commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing and delivering transformative therapies against novel epigenetic targets for cancer patients.The primary focus of the acquisition is on the lead medicine  Tazverik® (tazemetostat)  a first-in-class  chemotherapy-free EZH2a inhibitor  which was granted Accelerated Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020. It is currently indicated for adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  and for adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  as well as for adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for complete resection.1 Tazverik is currently in the Phase III stage of a registrational confirmatory study (SYMPHONY-1) in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide (R2) in patients with relapsed/refractory FL who have received at least one prior therapy. Initial results from the Phase III randomized portion of this study are planned to read out in 2026.As part of the transaction  Ipsen will also acquire Epizyme’s first-in-class  oral SETD2 inhibitor development candidate  EZM0414  which was granted FDA Fast Track status and is currently under evaluation in a recently initiated Phase I/Ib trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  as well as a portfolio of preclinical programs focusing on epigenetic targets.“ Through this agreement  we will expand our assets in oncology. Ipsen’s capabilities and resources in oncology combined with Epizyme’s will accelerate the growth of Tazverik to achieve its full potential in follicular lymphoma patients. The strength of data support Tazverik’s positioning in patients with both EZH2 mutation positive and wild-type follicular lymphoma. We are compelled by the potential of its efficacy and tolerability profile  especially for elderly and/or frail patients who are treated in the community-based setting. Furthermore  we are excited to bring on board epigenetic expertise and the SETD2 inhibitor  as well as several pre-clinical compounds into our portfolio ” said David Loew  Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen.“ Epizyme was founded in 2007 with a commitment to rigorous scientific research and a vision of developing novel epigenetic therapies. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished over the past 15 years  from the approval of Tazverik to advancing our next novel investigational agent  EZM0414  to the clinic  as well as the progress made on our preclinical compounds focused on both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors ” said Grant Bogle  President and Chief Executive Officer of Epizyme. “ We expect that this acquisition and Ipsen’s commitment to invest in the oncology space will ensure our epigenetic pipeline continues to advance in a way we could not have done on our own to bring transformative cancer therapies to patients in need.”Financial highlightsThe acquisition of Epizyme will immediately provide incremental sales and will leverage the U.S. commercial infrastructure. Given the level of ongoing R&D expenses  the transaction is expected to be moderately dilutive on Ipsen’s core operating income until the end of 2024. This is in line with Ipsen’s medium-term outlook regarding its strategic focus on building a high-value and sustainable pipeline through external innovation. The dilutive impact on 2022 core operating margin will be limited  given the expected timing of the transaction.Transaction detailsThe Board of Directors of Epizyme has unanimously approved the transaction and recommended that the stockholders of Epizyme tender their shares in the tender offer. Royalty Pharma  Epizyme’s largest stockholder with approximately 20.5% of Epizyme’s total shares of common stock outstanding (on a non‑diluted basis) as of the date hereof  has entered into a support agreement with Ipsen pursuant to which it has agreed to tender its shares in the tender offer.Under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  Ipsen  through a subsidiary  will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Epizyme at a price of $1.45 per share in cash at the closing of the transaction  for an initial estimated aggregate consideration of $247 millionb plus one contingent value right (CVR) per share. Each CVR will entitle its holder to deferred cash payments of $0.30 per CVR payable upon the first achievement of $250 million in aggregate net sales of Tazverik (excluding sales in Japan and Greater Chinac) in any period of four consecutive quarters  by 31 December 2026 and $0.70 per CVR payable upon receipt of U.S. regulatory approval necessary for the commercial marketing and sale of the combination of Tazverik and R² (rituximab and lenalidomide) in second-line follicular lymphoma by 1 January 2028. The $1.45 per share cash consideration represents a premium of approximately 144% compared to Epizyme’s average closing price of $0.60 over the 30 trading days preceding announcement of the transaction. The transaction will be fully financed by Ipsen’s existing cash and lines of credit.The closing of the tender offer will be subject to customary conditions  including the tender of shares representing at least a majority of the total number of Epizyme’s outstanding shares  the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions.

When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in the lymph nodes or other body organs. Follicular lymphoma is generally slow growing. Each year  15-20 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Most affected individuals are diagnosed with advanced disease.About epithelioid sarcoma5Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare  slow-growing type of soft tissue cancer. Most cases begin in the soft tissue under the skin of a finger  hand  forearm  lower leg or foot  though it can start in other areas of the body. Typically  epithelioid sarcoma starts as a small firm growth or lump that is painless. It usually starts out as a single growth  but multiple growths may occur by the time a person seeks medical help. Sometimes this sarcoma appears as ulcers that don't heal  looking like open wounds over the growths. It is estimated that 13 040 individuals received a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas in the U.S. in 2018 with a corresponding 5 150 deaths.6About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma7Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of NHL. NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally help to fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes or other body organs. DLBCL grows quickly and treatment starts soon after diagnosis. DLBCL is the most common type of NHL in the U.S. and worldwide  accounting for about 22 percent of newly diagnosed cases of B-cell NHL in the U.S. More than 18 000 people are diagnosed with DLBCL each year.8About multiple myeloma9Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer characterized by excessive production (proliferation) and improper function of certain cells (plasma cells) found in the bone marrow. Excessive plasma cells may eventually mass together to form a tumor or tumors in various sites of the body  especially the bone marrow. When multiple tumors are present or the bone marrow has greater than 10% plasma cells  the term multiple myeloma is used. In 2019  over 32 000 individuals in the U.S. were diagnosed with this disease. It is believed that approximately 100 000 Americans currently have the disease.About EpizymeEpizyme is a fully integrated  commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to its mission of rewriting treatment for cancer through novel epigenetic medicines.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.comEpizyme Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking StatementsAny statements in this press release about future expectations  plans and prospects for Epizyme and other statements containing the words “anticipate "" “believe ” “estimate ” “expect ” “intend ” “may ” “plan ” “predict ” “project ” “target ” “potential ” “will ” “would ” “could ” “should ” “continue ” and similar expressions  constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors  including: uncertainties as to the timing of the tender offer; the risk that the proposed transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all; the possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals for Epizyme will be made; uncertainty surrounding how many of Epizyme’s stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer; the possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the tender offer may not be satisfied or waived  including the failure to receive any required regulatory approvals from any applicable governmental entities; the possibility of business disruptions due to transaction-related uncertainty; the occurrence of any event  change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the proposed transaction may result in significant costs of defense  indemnification and liability; and other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of the company’s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and in the company's other filings from time to time with the SEC. In addition  the forward-looking statements included in this press release represent the company’s views as of the date hereof and should not be relied upon as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date hereof.

The initial findings are as follows:After administration  the virus was found in the tumors after several days. This suggests that BT-001 is able to persist and replicates within tumors.This finding is consistent with the expression of the anti-CTLA-4 observed in the tumor with no detectable systemic exposure.No spreading in blood or biological fluids has been detected  suggesting high tumor specificity.Tumor shrinkage was observed in one patient in the first cohort.The part A of the Phase 1 trial aims to establish the tolerability of BT-001 and to determine the dose and administration schedule for further development. Repeated (every 3 weeks) and ascending doses of intratumoral administration of BT 001  as a single agent  will be administered to up to 18 patients with metastatic/advanced tumors.The first two dose levels have been successfully completed  with 12 patients dosed to date. The Safety Review Committee (SRC) has stated that the safety profile supports escalation to the highest dose level of Phase 1 part A.Story continuesThe Phase 1 part B is planned to start in H2 2022. This part will assess the combination of intratumoral injections of BT-001 with intravenous administrations of the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab.BT-001 is based on Transgene's patented oncolytic vector and is encoding BioInvent's proprietary anti-CTLA-4 antibody; it is codeveloped by the two biotechnology companies.***About the trialThe ongoing Phase 1/2a (NCT04725331) study is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation trial evaluating BT-001 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 treatment). Patient inclusions are ongoing in Europe (France  Belgium) and the trial has been authorized in the US.This Phase 1 is divided into two parts. In part A  patients with metastatic/advanced tumors receive single agent  intratumoral administrations of BT-001. Part B will explore the combination of intratumoral injections of BT-001 with pembrolizumab. The Phase 2a will evaluate the combination regimen in several patient cohorts with different tumor types. These expansion cohorts will offer the possibility of exploring the activity of this approach to treat other malignancies not traditionally addressed with this type of treatment.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene's Invir.IO™ platform and its patented large-capacity VVcopTK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent's proprietary n-CoDeR®/F.I.R.S.T™ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody may be greatly improved.BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration on oncolytic viruses between Transgene and BioInvent. To know more on BT-001  watch our video here.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

The macro-economic and severe geopolitical challenges in the second half of the year have presented significant headwinds. But our operations remain strong  and with improved profitability at the core  we are investing to scale into adjacent opportunities across our segments. We believe that growth from the autos transaction businesses in Classifieds  broader on-demand delivery ecosystem in Food Delivery  credit and digital banking in Payments & Fintech  and new investments in Edtech will create significant value for the Group over time.”“As part of our strategy to optimise our capital allocation  we purchased US$6.2bn of our own shares  which generated a meaningful enhancement to our NAV per share. We have also been active in the bond markets  raising US$9.3bn at attractive interest rates. The Group has a strong and liquid balance sheet  bolstered by the recent sale of our JD.com stake and we remain intent on maintaining our investment grade rating. Our solid financial footing positions us well for the challenging operating environment and the execution of our strategy.”Strong and consistent performance in ecommerceEcommerce revenues grew 51% to US$9.8bn  with robust growth across all key segments.

The transaction is fully financed through an increase in Aramis Group’s credit lines with Stellantis  which will continue to be a powerful support to Aramis Group's development  accompanying its strategic international expansion and contributing to the financing of its operations.Considering the acquisition’s provisional timeline  Onlinecars is expected to be consolidated by Aramis Group from the start of its 2022-23 fiscal year2. Based on the business guidance for the current fiscal year (i.e. organic revenues of over €1.7 billion)  pro forma for Onlinecars’ revenues  Aramis Group’s future scope will move towards the milestone of €2 billion of revenues per year  generated in five European countries.Rothschild was Aramis Group's financial advisor on this operation  with Hoche Avocats providing legal advice.***About Aramis GroupAramis Group is the leading European B2C platform for online used car sales  operating the Aramisauto  Cardoen  Clicars and CarSupermarket brands  in France  Belgium  Spain and the UK respectively.

7040,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/27/business/economy-news-inflation-stocks-russia,Inflation  Stock Market and Business News for June 27  2022 - The New York Times,Economic sanctions that blocked bond payments have strengthened efforts to seal off Moscow from global markets.,The Russian Central Bank headquarters in Moscow. The head of the bank  Elvira Nabiullina  has said there won’t be any immediate consequences of a default.Russia missed a deadline for making bond payments on Sunday  a move signaling its first default on international debt in more than a century  after Western sanctions thwarted the government’s efforts to pay foreign investors. The lapse adds to efforts to seal Moscow off from global capital markets for years.About $100 million in dollar- and euro-denominated interest payments failed to reach investors within a 30-day grace period after a missed May 27 deadline. The grace period expired Sunday night.A formal declaration of default would need to come from bondholders because ratings agencies  which normally declare when borrowers have defaulted  have been barred by sanctions from reporting on Russia. The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee  a panel of investors that rules on whether to pay out securities linked to defaults  hasn’t been asked to make a decision on these bond payments yet.But it appeared that the payments had not reached bondholders’ accounts as of Sunday night  as required by the bonds’ contracts. On Monday  Russia’s finance ministry said that it had made the payments in May and that they had been transferred to Euroclear  a Brussels-based clearinghouse  but subsequently blocked from reaching bondholders.Russia is rejecting the default declaration  on the grounds that it has made efforts to pay. Dmitri S. Peskov  the Kremlin’s spokesman  told reporters on Monday that the statements about default were “absolutely illegal.”“The fact that Euroclear withheld this money  did not transfer it to the recipients  it is not our problem ” Mr. Peskov said. “In other words  there are no grounds to call this situation a default.”The finance ministry added that the actions of foreign financial institutions were beyond its control and that “it seems advisable for investors to contact the relevant financial institutions directly” over the payments.Euroclear declined to comment.“We can expect Russia to stick to its alternative narrative: The default isn’t a default  we tried and it isn’t our fault ” said Tim Samples  a legal studies professor at the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business and an expert on sovereign debt  adding that Russia also hasn’t submitted to jurisdiction in foreign courts. Still  “that has to be a bit humiliating  even for a country that can survive and maintain a war on its hydrocarbon revenues ” he said.The risk of default emerged in late February after Russia invaded Ukraine and sanctions were imposed to sever the country from international financial markets. In late May  Russia tried to navigate tightening sanctions that cut off its access to American banks and bondholders by sending the payments to a Moscow-based institution. But ultimately  the funds didn’t make it all the way to bondholders’ accounts because of far-reaching American and European sanctions.News of Monday’s apparent default showed “just how strong” international sanctions against Russia have been  a senior U.S. administration official said in a background briefing for reporters at the Group of 7 summit in Germany  highlighting the “dramatic” effect on Russia’s economy.This default is unusual because it’s a result of economic sanctions blocking transactions  not because the Russian government has run out of money. Moscow’s finances remain resilient after months of war  with nearly $600 billion in foreign currency and gold reserves  though about half of that is frozen overseas. And Russia continues to receive a steady influx of cash from sales of oil and gas. Still  a default would be a stain on the country’s reputation that will linger in investors’ memories and probably push up its borrowing costs if it is able to tap international capital markets.Unlike other major defaults in recent history  such as in Greece and Argentina  this default is expected to have a relatively small impact on international markets and Russia’s budget. For one thing  Russia has already lost access to international investors  traditionally the worst consequence of default.“The only clear negative outcome of the default is that the external market will be effectively closed for the ministry of finance ” said Sofya Donets  an economist at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. “But it’s already closed.”The head of Russia’s central bank  Elvira Nabiullina  said this month that there wouldn’t be any immediate consequences of a default because there had already been an outflow of investors and a drop in the value of Russia’s assets. The central bank is more concerned about inflation  most recently at about 17 percent  and supporting the economy through a “large-scale structural transformation” after an exodus of foreign companies and imports.The Western sanctions alone are expected to block Russia from large parts of international capital markets for a long time. Regardless  Russia has been reluctant to give up its reputation as a reliable borrower  which was hard won after its economic collapse in 1998  when the government defaulted on ruble-denominated bonds amid a currency crisis.Last month  Russia insisted that it had fulfilled its debt obligations by sending funds to its payment agent in Moscow  the National Settlement Depository. Since then  the depository has fallen under European sanctions  further restricting Russia’s ability to pay bondholders. The finance minister  Anton Siluanov  has accused the West of artificially manufacturing a default and has threatened legal action against U.S. authorities.This is Russia’s first major default on foreign debt since 1918  soon after the Bolshevik Revolution.On Wednesday  President Vladimir V. Putin signed a decree saying that future payments to holders of debt denominated in dollars or euros would be made through Russian financial institutions and that the obligations would be considered met if paid in rubles and converted. Most of the bond contracts don’t allow for payment in rubles.Over the following two days  nearly $400 million in dollar-denominated debt payments were due from bonds that had 30-day and 15-day grace periods. The finance ministry said it had sent the payments  in rubles  using the new procedure laid out by the presidential decree. But it remains unclear how foreign investors will gain access to the funds.Overseas investors held about half of Russia’s $40 billion in outstanding foreign-currency debt at the end of last year. As the risk of default grew this year  PIMCO  the investment management firm  saw the value of its Russian bond holdings decline by more than $1 billion  and pension funds and mutual funds with exposure to emerging market debt have also experienced declines.But exposure to Russian assets is limited in the United States and Europe because sanctions imposed since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 have discouraged investors who didn’t want the geopolitical risk.By international standards  Russia doesn’t have that much debt. Its public debt was only about 17 percent of gross domestic product last year  according to the International Monetary Fund  one of just a handful of countries with debt ratios under 25 percent. The United States  whose assets are in demand among global investors and deemed low risk  has a debt ratio of 125 percent of G.D.P.Russia’s low debt levels are partly a result of “this new geopolitical era” since the annexation of Crimea  Ms. Donets said. “But it’s also a product of the default of 1998 ” she added  when “the ministry of finance was burned badly.” Since then  the ministry has not been that active in issuing new foreign-currency debt  she said.Russia hasn’t relied on borrowing from international investors for its budget. The finance ministry hasn’t issued dollar-denominated debt since 2019  when U.S. sanctions barred American banks from buying the debt directly. It last issued euro-denominated debt in May 2021.Instead  Russia has depended on its oil and gas exports  and those dollar revenues that went into reserves and grew the national wealth fund.“Why would you borrow and pay additional rates when you are a country that is accumulating oil funds  accumulating in hard currency  a country which has $600 billion in reserves?” Ms. Donets said.The war hasn’t changed that calculation. Russia’s current account surplus  a broad measure of trade and investment  has soared as revenues from energy exports jumped  capital controls stopped investments fleeing and sanctions slashed imports. It has helped push the ruble to its highest level in seven years.If Russia does issue more debt  it will lean on local banks and residents in the short term to buy ruble-denominated bonds.Russia “will have no access to the capital markets until the war stops and the sanctions are lifted ” said Richard Portes  an economics professor at the London School of Business.The long-term consequences of a default are unclear because of the unusual nature of the financial breach. But it’s possible to envision a future where Russia is able to sell debt on international markets again  analysts say  if the war ends and Russia’s geopolitical ambitions change. Without Mr. Putin and with hundreds of billions of dollars in international reserves unfrozen  it could return to markets.“Capital market access can be restored very quickly ” Mr. Portes said. “Once Russia is back in good political graces and sanctions are lifted.”“If it’s not a political pariah  it won’t be an economic pariah ” he added.Reporting was contributed by Ivan Nechepurenko   Andrés R.

Russia defaulted on its international bonds for the first time …,Taiwan’s financial regulator said on Tuesday that seven Taiwanese insurance companies have not received interest due on May 27 on Russian Eurobonds after a grace period ended on Sunday evening.Russia defaulted on its international bonds for the first time in more than a century  the White House and Moody’s credit agency said on Monday  as sanctions have effectively cut the country off from the global financial system.The payments in question are $100 million in interest on two bonds  one denominated in U.S. dollars RU000A0JWHA4= and another in euros RU234748670=  that Russia was due to pay on May 27. The payments had a grace period of 30 days  which expired on Sunday.Russian debt makes up only a fraction of overall Taiwanese bond holdings.The Kremlin and the finance ministry have repeatedly said Russia was honoring its obligations  saying that the currency payments were made but not processed by Euroclear to reach non-Russian bondholders.Russia Defaults on Foreign-Currency Debt for 1st Time in More Than a CenturyAsked on Tuesday whether Russia would sue Euroclear or other Western financial intermediaries involved in the transaction  Dmitry Peskov  Kremlin spokesman  said: “This question should be analyzed by our lawyers  our financial institutions.”According to Alexander Afonin  head of debt market analysis at Moscow-based Sinara investment bank  bondholders may call a default on Russia themselves under certain conditions.“In order to do so  a certain quorum must be called and is very unlikely to be presented given that the bulk of those bondholders are Russian investors ” Afonin said. He estimated that foreign investors own 15-20% of Russian sovereign Eurobonds.Unlike foreign bondholders  Russian investors are receiving their payments on sovereign Eurobonds via the National Settlement Depository which is sanctioned by the European Union.(Reporting by Emily Chan; writing by Ben Blanchard; editing by Angus MacSwan and Tomasz Janowski)Topics Carriers Russia Numbers,negative,0.01,0.25,0.74,negative,0.01,0.22,0.77,True,English,"['Seven Taiwanese Insurers', 'Russian Eurobond Payments', 'Regulator', 'seven Taiwanese insurance companies', 'overall Taiwanese bond holdings', 'Moscow-based Sinara investment bank', 'other Western financial intermediaries', 'Topics Carriers Russia Numbers', 'U.S. dollars', 'National Settlement Depository', 'global financial system', 'debt market analysis', 'Russian sovereign Eurobonds', 'financial regulator', 'financial institutions', 'Russian Eurobonds', 'Russian debt', 'Foreign-Currency Debt', 'Russian investors', 'grace period', 'international bonds', 'first time', 'a century', 'White House', 'credit agency', 'two bonds', 'The Kremlin', 'finance ministry', '1st Time', 'More Than', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'foreign investors', 'European Union', 'Emily Chan', 'Ben Blanchard', 'Angus MacSwan', 'Tomasz Janowski', 'Sunday evening', 'non-Russian bondholders', 'Alexander Afonin', 'foreign bondholders', 'currency payments', 'Tuesday', 'interest', 'May', 'Moody', 'Monday', 'sanctions', 'country', 'question', 'euros', '30 days', 'fraction', 'obligations', 'Euroclear', 'transaction', 'lawyers', 'head', 'default', 'conditions', 'order', 'quorum', 'bulk', 'editing']",2022-06-28,2022-06-28,insurancejournal.com

NATO has already announced plans to expand the number of forces it has on high alert from 40 000 to 300 000—a more than sevenfold increase—and is also set to unveil a new “strategic concept” that now tackles China.“This constitutes the biggest overhaul of our collective deterrence and defense since the Cold War ” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Monday.The conference comes on the heels of another high-profile diplomatic meeting  the G-7 summit in Germany’s Bavarian Alps  which resulted in a series of new measures that target Russia’s arms industry and gold reserves.In Madrid  leaders from South Korea  Japan  Australia  and New Zealand will join the NATO summit as observers. Ahead of the meeting  Seoul also announced plans to create a diplomatic mission to the alliance in Brussels.Their participation reflects how NATO leaders have “an eye on the Indo-Pacific” and Beijing  as FP’s Michael Hirsh writes. With the inclusion of these nations  he writes  “new battle lines are being drawn that could last for generations.”A major point of contention will be the membership applications of Finland and Sweden  both of which have made bids to join the alliance but have been stymied by Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appears intent on using the accession process to secure key concessions  such as loosening Western defense export controls and curtailing the activities of Kurdish groups based in Scandinavia.Challenges surrounding their potential membership will likely come to a head in Madrid  with Erdogan expected to attempt to push through a number of his demands. At the summit  Western officials believe Ankara’s efforts could force negotiations to go down to the wire  FP’s Jack Detsch reports.“Turkey saw great leverage in the Finland and Sweden request ” one European official told Detsch  while speaking on condition of anonymity. “They are trying to maximize this in the way that they always do.”What We’re Following TodayRussia bombs shopping mall. A Russian airstrike on a Ukrainian shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk late Monday has killed at least 16 people and seriously injured dozens of others  according to Ukrainian officials. Before the strike  as many as 1 000 civilians had been inside the building  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. “This is one of the most brazen terrorist acts in the history of Europe ” he declared. “Russia became the biggest terrorist organization in the world.”The mall attack comes as Russia has reportedly defaulted on its foreign debt after missing a payment deadline on Sunday  its first such default since 1918. But since Western sanctions have essentially frozen Moscow out of the global financial system  inhibiting these types of transactions  Russian officials said they did not consider it to be a default.“The fact that Euroclear withheld this money  did not transfer it to the recipients  it is not our problem ” the Kremlin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “In other words  there are no grounds to call this situation a default.”Japan’s heat wave. Japanese authorities are urging the public to conserve electricity to avoid potential blackouts as the country faces its highest June temperatures on record. Temperatures spiked to 104.4 degrees Fahrenheit this past weekend  surpassing a previous high of 103.6 degrees Fahrenheit from June 2011 and forcing several cities to set heat stroke warnings.“We ask the public to reduce energy consumption during the early evening hours when the reserve ratio falls ” Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.Keep an Eye OnPossible Ecuador talks.

South African officials have launched an investigation after 21 teenagers were found dead in a nightclub on Sunday morning. The teenagers  whose ages ranged from 13 to 17  had reportedly just finished their school exams.

7044,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/the-big-package-how-russia-was-driven-to-default/,The ‘Big Package’: How Russia was driven to default,Russia's first major international debt default in over a century  which Washington said became a fact on Monday (27 June)  follows months of co-ordinated Western sanctions that left Moscow with cash but no access to the international financial network.,Russia’s first major international debt default in over a century  which Washington said became a fact on Monday (27 June)  follows months of co-ordinated Western sanctions that left Moscow with cash but no access to the international financial network.Below is a summary of the key moments that have led up to this point.The ‘big package’At around 11.30 p.m. (2230 GMT) on 25 February  the day after Russian troops entered Ukraine  European Union’s experts in Brussels said a set of sanctions they had worked on for days  or the “Big Package” as they called it  was ready.Just before midnight  the European Commission announced the measures.While emergency Group of Seven and EU meetings earlier made clear a response was coming  the package named Vladimir Putin and his top diplomat Sergei Lavrov personally  and  as it later became clear  froze some $300 billion of the Russian central bank’s reserves.“That was really the moment when we said  okay  well we’ve done it ” one European source told Reuters. “That was  I think  a very pivotal moment for a lot of people around a table.”Swift actionDays later  on 2 March  the EU struck again by banning seven Russian banks from SWIFT  an international financial messaging system crucial for cross-border transactions.Booting Russian lenders from SWIFT had long been considered a ‘nuclear option ’ but the invasion put it on the table and when the EU decided to activate it  those at SWIFT headquarters just outside Brussels were ready.The only question was how long they had to implement the move  “five days or five minutes?” another source said. In the end it was 10-12 days.First cuts  but not the deepestCredit rating agency  S&P Global  already stripped Moscow of its coveted investment grade rating on 26 February and Russian bonds were slumping  but a heavier blow followed on 15 March  when the EU told top credit agencies to stop rating Russian dept or risk losing their licenses to operate in the bloc.“We were caught flat-footed  certainly we were not given any advanced warning ” one senior rating agency analyst said. “Basically the question was  does this mean we can’t rate Russia any more?” It turned out the answer was yes.Default deadline oneWith so many hurdles being erected  expectations built that Russia would default on its first post-sanctions’ bond payments either on 16 March  or a month later at the end of a 30-day “grace period.”However  a special “waiver” in the US sanctions granted by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control allowed payments to go through.Unintended consequencesOn 8 April  a week before the EU ban on Russian ratings was due to come into force  S&P declared Russia in “selective default” after Moscow said it planned to make upcoming bond payments in rubles rather than dollars  their issue currency.On 3 May though  shortly before the payment was due  the Kremlin U-turned and paid in dollars.Shock to the systemDays later  Russia had stumbled  though.On 11 May  sharp-eyed creditors spotted that Moscow had failed to add $1.9 million of extra interest that had built up on bonds that only got paid in their grace periods rather than on time. They contacted the clearing house Euroclear and then bond market equivalent of an insurance payment arbiter – the Credit Derivative Determinations Committee which ruled that a “credit event” had happened.The sum was too small to trigger default clauses in all of Russia’s international bonds  but it did mean some investors expected to receive default insurance payments.But when the US Treasury clarified on its website that buying Russian bonds on the open  or ‘secondary’ market  was banned  that credit default swap (CDS) insurance process had to be halted as it was no longer clear what to do with the bonds involved.“It is a bit like if your house burns down and the insurance company turns around and claims it was the wrong kind of fire ” said Joe Delvaux  emerging markets distressed debt portfolio manager at Europe’s largest fund manager Amundi. “The reality is that these sanctions are a shock to the system.”Intended consequencesThe step that made Russia’s default unavoidable though was Washington’s 24 May decision to let the waiver that had allowed US bondholders to receive Russia’s payments  expire.A week later  the EU also sanctioned Russia’s domestic paying agent  its National Settlement Depository (NSD)  which it had been using to make the payments.Moscow has blamed the West for forcing an “artificial default”  with its finance minister Anton Siluanov calling the situation a “farce.”However  veteran global policymakers involved in the process say the sanctions are unprecedented but fully justified.“They were very significant actions that responded to the magnitude of the actions that Russia undertook ” Agustin Carstens  the head of the world’s central bank umbrella body  the Bank for International Settlements  said.,negative,0.02,0.22,0.76,mixed,0.03,0.11,0.86,True,English,"['Big Package', 'The', 'Russia', 'one senior rating agency analyst', 'first major international debt default', 'Credit Derivative Determinations Committee', 'central bank umbrella body', 'first post-sanctions’ bond payments', 'international financial messaging system', 'Credit rating agency', 'debt portfolio manager', 'international financial network', 'Default deadline one', 'bond market equivalent', 'investment grade rating', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'largest fund manager', 'domestic paying agent', 'National Settlement Depository', 'veteran global policymakers', 'credit default swap', 'top credit agencies', '30-day “grace period', 'upcoming bond payments', 'Russian central bank', 'one European source', 'S&P Global', 'default insurance payments', 'insurance payment arbiter', 'CDS) insurance process', 'seven Russian banks', 'First cuts', 'International Settlements', 'credit event', 'selective default', 'default clauses', 'artificial default', 'international bonds', 'insurance company', 'top diplomat', 'grace periods', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'Russian troops', 'Russian lenders', 'Russian dept', 'Russian ratings', 'key moments', 'emergency Group', 'Sergei Lavrov', 'cross-border transactions', 'heavier blow', 'advanced warning', 'many hurdles', 'Unintended consequences', 'issue currency', 'sharp-eyed creditors', 'extra interest', 'wrong kind', 'Joe Delvaux', 'emerging markets', 'US bondholders', 'finance minister', 'Anton Siluanov', 'Agustin Carstens', 'Russian bonds', 'big package', 'pivotal moment', 'Swift action', 'SWIFT headquarters', 'five minutes', '10-12 days', 'special “waiver', 'clearing house', 'US Treasury', 'significant actions', 'Western sanctions', 'US sanctions', 'EU meetings', 'EU ban', '24 May decision', '3 May', '11 May', 'century', 'Washington', 'fact', 'Monday', 'June', 'months', 'Moscow', 'cash', 'access', 'summary', 'point', 'The', '2230 GMT', '25 February', 'Ukraine', 'experts', 'Brussels', 'midnight', 'measures', 'response', 'reserves', 'Reuters', 'lot', 'people', 'table', '2 March', 'invasion', 'question', 'move', '26 February', '15 March', 'licenses', 'bloc', 'answer', 'expectations', '16 March', 'Office', '8 April', 'force', 'rubles', 'dollars', 'Kremlin', 'Shock', 'time', 'Euroclear', 'investors', 'website', 'fire', 'Amundi', 'reality', 'step', 'NSD', 'situation', 'magnitude', 'world', '11.30']",2022-06-28,2022-06-28,euractiv.com
7045,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://nypost.com/2022/06/27/russia-defaults-on-foreign-debt-for-first-time-since-world-war-i/,Russia defaults on foreign debt for first time since World War I,Russia defaulted on its foreign debt obligations for the first time since 1918 on Monday following months of crippling Western sanctions.,Russia defaulted on its foreign debt obligations for the first time since 1918 on Monday following months of speculation that crippling Western sanctions in response to the Ukraine war would force the Kremlin into nonpayment.The historic default occurred after Russia failed to make approximately $100 million in interest payments on two dollar- and euro-denominated international bonds within a 30-day grace period. The payments were originally due May 27.The White House and other Western officials have anticipated a Russian default for months after sanctions effectively severed the Kremlin’s access to the global economy. The US and other nations imposed sweeping penalties in response to the brutal invasion of Ukraine.The likelihood of a Russian debt default increased in late May  when the Treasury Department allowed a key payment waiver to expire — ensuring that US banks and individuals could no longer accept bond payments from the Russian government. Russia owes approximately $40 billion in internationally held sovereign debt.The Kremlin has decried the default as an “artificial situation” caused by the West. Getty ImagesThe Kremlin  which has continued to rake in huge profits from its oil and gas shipments during the Ukraine war  has decried the default as an “artificial situation” — asserting that it has the money to cover its debts and Western officials blocked payments from reaching bondholders.“Statements of a default are absolutely unjustified ” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday.“The fact that Euroclear withheld this money and did not bring it to the recipients is not our problem ” Peskov said  according to Reuters. “There are absolutely no grounds to call such situation a default.”The default is largely symbolic for a Russian economy that is already weathering double-digit inflation  major GDP losses and a plunge in the value of its ruble since the invasion began.The nonpayment spat was also not expected to have a major impact on the global economy  which had already largely priced in a potential Russian default. Russian bonds have traded for cents on the dollar since the invasion began as investors braced for the default  while credit ratings agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s have given Russia’s debt a junk rating.With Russia already disconnected from SWIFT and other elements of the global financial market  further international borrowing was already untenable. But holders of Russian bonds could face major hits – and a difficult road to recouping their losses in court.“This is the messiest and most legally uncertain case of sovereign default that I can think of ” Mark Weidemaier  a sovereign-debt specialist and law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  told the Wall Street Journal. “That’s got to be one of many things that makes investors nervous when they think about the prospect of suing the Russian government.”Western sanctions effectively disconnected Russia from the global economy. Getty Images/iStockphotoOf the roughly $40 billion in foreign debt that Russia owes  about half is held by overseas investors  according to Reuters. The default is expected to trigger credit default swaps  which function as a form of insurance against nonpayment of bonds.Despite its historic nature  the Russian default is unlikely to rattle European or global markets  according to Giles Coghlan  an analyst at broker HYCM.“As investors have been pricing in the default for months  at this stage the markets are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach — if the conflict in Ukraine fades over the medium term  then payments are likely resume at some point ” Coghlan said. “At least for now  this will not affect European stocks or the euro due to the nature of the default.”Experts told The Post in March that a Russian default would damage their economy and hurt investors. But since Russia was already largely isolated from the global economy  a default is unlikely to cause a international financial crisis.Earlier this year  the International Monetary Fund said global banks’ exposure to Russia was “definitely not systemically relevant.”,negative,0.01,0.15,0.83,negative,0.01,0.07,0.92,True,English,"['World War I', 'foreign debt', 'first time', 'Russia', '30-day grace period', 'key payment waiver', 'credit ratings agencies', 'Wall Street Journal', 'international financial crisis', 'International Monetary Fund', 'global financial market', 'The White House', 'global banks’ exposure', 'euro-denominated international bonds', 'foreign debt obligations', 'credit default swaps', 'major GDP losses', 'other Western officials', 'potential Russian default', 'Russian debt default', 'international borrowing', 'US banks', 'other nations', 'major impact', 'other elements', 'major hits', 'The US', 'Russian government', 'sovereign debt', 'Russian bonds', 'The Post', 'global economy', 'Russian economy', 'first time', 'sweeping penalties', 'late May', 'Treasury Department', 'Getty Images', 'huge profits', 'gas shipments', 'double-digit inflation', 'Standard & Poor', 'junk rating', 'difficult road', 'uncertain case', 'Mark Weidemaier', 'law professor', 'North Carolina', 'Chapel Hill', 'many things', 'medium term', 'Western sanctions', 'The Kremlin', 'global markets', 'artificial situation', 'historic default', 'sovereign default', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Ukraine war', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'historic nature', 'Giles Coghlan', 'European stocks', 'interest payments', 'bond payments', 'brutal invasion', 'nonpayment spat', 'overseas investors', 'Monday', 'months', 'speculation', 'response', 'access', 'likelihood', 'individuals', 'oil', 'money', 'debts', 'bondholders', 'Statements', 'fact', 'Euroclear', 'recipients', 'problem', 'Reuters', 'grounds', 'plunge', 'value', 'ruble', 'cents', 'dollar', 'Moody', 'SWIFT', 'court', 'messiest', 'legally', 'sovereign-debt', 'specialist', 'University', 'prospect', 'iStockphoto', 'half', 'form', 'insurance', 'analyst', 'broker', 'HYCM', 'stage', 'approach', 'conflict', 'point', 'Experts', 'March']",2022-06-27,2022-06-28,nypost.com

7047,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rappler.com/business/russia-rejecting-default-tells-investors-go-western-financial-agents-june-27-2022/,Russia  rejecting default  tells investors to go to western financial agents,'Statements of a default are absolutely unjustified ' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov tells reporters,MOSCOW. The clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon is pictured next to Moscow’s Kremlin and Saint Basil’s Cathedral  March 31  2020.Russia rejected claims on Monday  June 27  that it had defaulted on its external debt for the first time in more than a century  telling investors to go to western financial agents for the cash which was sent but bondholders did not receive.The White House said on Monday that Russia has defaulted on its international bonds for the first time since the Bolshevik revolution  as sweeping sanctions have effectively cut the country off from the global financial system.Until last week  Russia kept on paying its Eurobonds in foreign currency as per issue conditions yet its dollar and euro coupon transfers made in May  ahead of a key US waiver allowing for such transactions expired  did not reach investors.“Statements of a default are absolutely unjustified ” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a call with reporters on Monday  pointing to the May forex coupon payment.“The fact that Euroclear withheld this money and did not bring it to the recipients is not our problem. There are absolutely no grounds to call such situation a default.”Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Monday  the finance ministry said that “actions of foreign financial intermediaries are beyond of the Russian finance ministry’s control ” asking foreign bondholders to speak directly to those withholding the payments.“The non-receipt of money by investors did not occur because of lack of payment but due to the third party actions and which is not directly spelled out as a default situation by issue documentation ” the ministry added.As the US waiver expired and the European Union sanctioned the National Settlement Depository (NSD)  the Russian version of Euroclear and Clearstream western clearing houses  last week Moscow paid its next coupons due in forex in roubles.President Vladimir Putin ordered last week that debt obligations would be considered fulfilled once a rouble payment equal to the forex amount due was made. Bondholders would need to open an account at a Russian bank to receive the payment.Moscow would not block the payment’s conversion into forex and its transfer abroad but investors would need to say in writing they don’t have claims against Russia  the ministry has said. The banks are yet to be announced.‘Financial nuclear bomb’The Group of Seven major Western powers banned transactions with Russia’s central bank and froze its assets held in their jurisdictions  worth around $300 billion  after Russia launched what it called a special military operation in Ukraine in February.Some western politicians have called to seize the reserves frozen to rebuild Ukraine – the idea two high-ranked Russian financial sources said they believed was behind the announcement of default and which Moscow considers artificial.“By announcing a default  they can claim that sanctions work. Economically  financially assets could be confiscated legally ” one of the two sources said.Peskov reiterated on Monday that reserves were blocked “unlawfully” and any attempts to use them would “amount to outright theft.”“I believe that a financial nuclear bomb was used against us  no country in the history of mankind has experienced such sanctions pressure as Russia is now ” Alexei Moiseev  Russian deputy finance minister  said last week. – Rappler.com,negative,0.02,0.21,0.76,negative,0.01,0.08,0.9,True,English,"['western financial agents', 'Russia', 'default', 'investors', 'two high-ranked Russian financial sources', 'Clearstream western clearing houses', 'Seven major Western powers', 'Russian deputy finance minister', 'May forex coupon payment', 'western financial agents', 'euro coupon transfers', 'global financial system', 'Financial nuclear bomb', 'National Settlement Depository', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'foreign financial intermediaries', 'The White House', 'key US waiver', 'third party actions', 'Russian finance ministry', 'two sources', 'western politicians', 'Russian version', 'Russian bank', 'The Group', 'foreign currency', 'Spasskaya tower', 'Saint Basil', 'external debt', 'a century', 'international bonds', 'Bolshevik revolution', 'last week', 'issue conditions', 'issue documentation', 'European Union', 'next coupons', 'debt obligations', 'forex amount', 'central bank', 'outright theft', 'Alexei Moiseev', 'rouble payment', 'first time', 'foreign bondholders', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'sweeping sanctions', 'default situation', 'MOSCOW', 'clock', 'noon', 'Cathedral', 'claims', 'Monday', 'June', 'investors', 'cash', 'country', 'Eurobonds', 'dollar', 'transactions', 'Statements', 'call', 'reporters', 'fact', 'Euroclear', 'money', 'recipients', 'problem', 'grounds', 'request', 'comment', 'control', 'payments', 'non', 'receipt', 'lack', 'NSD', 'roubles', 'account', 'conversion', 'writing', 'banks', 'assets', 'jurisdictions', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'reserves', 'idea', 'announcement', 'attempts', 'history', 'mankind', 'pressure', 'Rappler']",2022-06-27,2022-06-28,rappler.com
7048,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rappler.com/business/big-package-how-russia-driven-default/,The ‘Big Package’: How Russia was driven to default,Here is a summary of the key moments that have led to Russia's first foreign debt default since 1918,Here is a summary of the key moments that have led to Russia's first foreign debt default since 1918LONDON  United Kingdom – Russia’s first major international debt default in over a century  which Washington said became a fact on Monday  June 27  follows months of coordinated Western sanctions that left Moscow with cash but no access to the international financial network.Below is a summary of the key moments that have led up to this point.The ‘Big Package’At around 11:30 pm (2230 GMT) on February 25  the day after Russian troops entered Ukraine  European Union experts in Brussels said a set of sanctions they had worked on for days  or the “Big Package” as they called it  was ready.Just before midnight  the European Commission announced the measures.While emergency Group of Seven and EU meetings earlier made clear a response was coming  the package named Vladimir Putin and his top diplomat Sergei Lavrov personally  and  as it later became clear  froze some $300 billion of the Russian central bank’s reserves.“That was really the moment when we said  okay  well we’ve done it ” one European source told Reuters. “That was  I think  a very pivotal moment for a lot of people around a table.”SWIFT actionDays later  on March 2  the EU struck again by banning seven Russian banks from SWIFT  an international financial messaging system crucial for cross-border transactions.Booting Russian lenders from SWIFT had long been considered a “nuclear option ” but the invasion put it on the table and when the EU decided to activate it  those at SWIFT headquarters just outside Brussels were ready.The only question was how long they had to implement the move  “five days or five minutes?” another source said. In the end it was 10 to 12 days.First cuts  but not the deepestCredit rating agency S&P Global already stripped Moscow of its coveted investment grade rating on February 26 and Russian bonds were slumping  but a heavier blow followed on March 15  when the EU told top credit agencies to stop rating Russian debt or risk losing their licenses to operate in the bloc.“We were caught flat-footed  certainly we were not given any advanced warning ” one senior rating agency analyst said. “Basically the question was  does this mean we can’t rate Russia any more?” It turned out the answer was yes.Default deadline oneWith so many hurdles being erected  expectations built that Russia would default on its first post-sanctions bond payments either on March 16  or a month later at the end of a 30-day “grace period.”However  a special “waiver” in the US sanctions granted by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control allowed payments to go through.Unintended consequencesOn April 8  a week before the EU ban on Russian ratings was due to come into force  S&P declared Russia in “selective default” after Moscow said it planned to make upcoming bond payments in roubles rather than dollars  their issue currency.On May 3 though  shortly before the payment was due  the Kremlin U-turned and paid in dollars.Shock to the systemDays later  Russia had stumbled  though.On May 11  sharp-eyed creditors spotted that Moscow had failed to add $1.9 million of extra interest that had built up on bonds that only got paid in their grace periods rather than on time. They contacted the clearing house Euroclear and the bond market equivalent of an insurance payment arbiter – the Credit Derivative Determinations Committee  which ruled that a “credit event” had happened.The sum was too small to trigger default clauses in all of Russia’s international bonds  but it did mean some investors expected to receive default insurance payments.But when the US Treasury clarified on its website that buying Russian bonds on the open  or “secondary” market  was banned  that credit default swap (CDS) insurance process had to be halted as it was no longer clear what to do with the bonds involved.“It is a bit like if your house burns down and the insurance company turns around and claims it was the wrong kind of fire ” said Joe Delvaux  emerging markets distressed debt portfolio manager at Europe’s largest fund manager Amundi. “The reality is that these sanctions are a shock to the system.”Intended consequencesThe step that made Russia’s default unavoidable though was Washington’s May 24 decision to let the waiver that had allowed US bondholders to receive Russia’s payments  expire.A week later  the EU also sanctioned Russia’s domestic paying agent  its National Settlement Depository (NSD)  which it had been using to make the payments.Moscow has blamed the West for forcing an “artificial default ” with its finance minister Anton Siluanov calling the situation a “farce.”However  veteran global policymakers involved in the process say the sanctions are unprecedented but fully justified.“They were very significant actions that responded to the magnitude of the actions that Russia undertook ” Agustin Carstens  the head of the world’s central bank umbrella body  the Bank for International Settlements  said. – Rappler.com,negative,0.02,0.22,0.76,negative,0.01,0.09,0.9,True,English,"['Big Package', 'The', 'Russia', 'one senior rating agency analyst', 'first major international debt default', 'Credit Derivative Determinations Committee', 'central bank umbrella body', 'first foreign debt default', 'first post-sanctions bond payments', 'international financial messaging system', 'Credit rating agency', 'international financial network', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'debt portfolio manager', 'Default deadline one', 'investment grade rating', 'largest fund manager', 'domestic paying agent', 'National Settlement Depository', 'veteran global policymakers', 'bond market equivalent', 'credit default swap', 'European Union experts', 'top credit agencies', '30-day “grace period', 'upcoming bond payments', 'Russian central bank', 'one European source', 'S&P Global', 'insurance payment arbiter', 'CDS) insurance process', 'default insurance payments', 'seven Russian banks', 'First cuts', 'Russian debt', 'International Settlements', 'credit event', 'international bonds', 'selective default', 'default clauses', 'artificial default', 'insurance company', 'European Commission', 'top diplomat', 'grace periods', 'secondary” market', 'Russian troops', 'Russian lenders', 'Russian ratings', 'key moments', 'United Kingdom', 'emergency Group', 'Sergei Lavrov', 'cross-border transactions', 'heavier blow', 'advanced warning', 'many hurdles', 'Unintended consequences', 'issue currency', 'sharp-eyed creditors', 'extra interest', 'wrong kind', 'Joe Delvaux', 'emerging markets', 'US bondholders', 'finance minister', 'Anton Siluanov', 'Agustin Carstens', 'Russian bonds', 'Big Package', 'pivotal moment', 'SWIFT action', 'SWIFT headquarters', 'five minutes', '10 to 12 days', 'special “waiver', 'clearing house', 'US Treasury', 'significant actions', 'Western sanctions', 'US sanctions', 'EU meetings', 'EU ban', 'May 24 decision', 'summary', 'LONDON', 'century', 'Washington', 'fact', 'Monday', 'June', 'months', 'coordinated', 'Moscow', 'cash', 'access', 'point', '2230 GMT', 'February', 'Ukraine', 'Brussels', 'midnight', 'measures', 'response', 'reserves', 'Reuters', 'lot', 'people', 'table', 'March', 'invasion', 'question', 'move', 'licenses', 'bloc', 'answer', 'expectations', 'Office', 'April', 'force', 'roubles', 'dollars', 'Kremlin', 'Shock', 'time', 'Euroclear', 'investors', 'website', 'fire', 'Amundi', 'reality', 'step', 'NSD', 'situation', 'magnitude', 'world', 'Rappler', '11:30']",2022-06-28,2022-06-28,rappler.com

Yet  four months into the crisis  Washington is still masterminding behind the scenes  bullets and artillery shells are still flying  and people are still bleeding—nothing appears to have changed  except for skyrocketing oil prices  looming food and energy shortages  and a Russia--together with other world financial institutions--now trapped in ""defaults"" and unpaid debts.A statement from the White House on June 27 has offered fresh clues on the Pyrrhic victory that the US-led sanctions have clinched. According to Reuters  the Biden administration announced Monday that Russia had ""defaulted"" on its international bonds for the first time since the Bolshevik Revolution a century ago.The Kremlin  on the other hand  has clarified that the payments due Sunday had been made  in US dollars and euros  on May 27 and yet the money remained stuck with Euroclear  a clearing house based in Belgium  according to CNN. Despite that  some view such defaults as a win for the US-led ""sanctions bloc "" a victory secured by the effective severance of Russia from the global payments system. Well  think again.A host of experts on global finance have sounded their alarms upon the announcement. ""It's a very  very rare thing  where a government that otherwise has the means is forced by an external government into default "" said Hassan Malik  senior sovereign analyst and expert on emerging market hedge funds.Russia owes $100 million in interest payments on one bond priced in US dollars and another priced in euros  which was originally due for payment on May 27  according to Al Jazeera. With Russia being forcibly decoupled from the global payment systems  it has also been reduced into a state of non-payment  ""an artificial crisis manufactured by the West "" as one analysis put it.For international lenders who lent out the money to Russia  it also presents an unprecedented ""debt trap "" with their money withheld not by the borrower itself but by the ""force majeure"" of the situation  in which their unpaid loans are regarded as ""collateral damage.""The ""Made in the US default"" indicates the destructive consequences that the current US dollar hegemony may bring to others. For the global financial market as a whole  the event offers a chilling lesson: that is  the international financial web  on which global trade and investment have been built  isn't immune to manipulation and weaponization. With the dominance of its currency and the capricious demeanor of a certain superpower  it is no guarantee that similar acts of manipulation or weaponization won't happen in other contexts. In fact  such malpractice is not without precedence. Washington's freezing of nearly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to Afghanistan's central bank last year is reminiscent of just such economic hegemony at work.In any event  the US may argue that its end justifies the means  but that all depends on what end the US is actually harboring. If its end is to see global lenders getting unpaid  the global financial system undermined  and the formation of ""debt traps "" then the US apparently has succeeded.Likewise  Washington may also feel a strong sense of contentment with the roles it has played in ""mediating"" the Ukraine crisis over the years. After four years of isolationism and a disgraceful pullout from Afghanistan  the US finally has seized its chance to rally together its allies and deploy its ""weaponry of strength."" At least that is the standpoint of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken  who said in April that the conflict has only strengthened NATO's ""collective resolve and unity."" But with the passage of time  Washington has increasingly proved its Ukraine solution is nothing but a fig leaf  one that is just for show.As Christopher Caldwell  an American journalist and researcher  wittily and accurately put it in his New York Times guest essay back in May entitled The War in Ukraine May Be Impossible to Stop; And the U.S. Deserves Much of the Blame: ""The United States is making no concessions. That would be to lose face."" And given the high-stakes game now being played  ""the administration is closing off avenues of negotiation and working to intensify the war.""(Web editor: Meng Bin  Bianji)",negative,0.03,0.31,0.66,negative,0.01,0.08,0.91,True,English,"['US-led sanctions', 'debt traps', 'Opinion', 'Russia', 'New York Times guest essay', 'emerging market hedge funds', 'other world financial institutions', 'current US dollar hegemony', 'global financial market', 'Daily Online Illustration', 'skyrocketing oil prices', 'senior sovereign analyst', 'global financial system', 'unprecedented ""debt trap', 'The United States', 'international financial web', 'global payments system', 'global payment systems', 'US-led ""sanctions bloc', 'Global Times', 'economic hegemony', 'other hand', 'other contexts', 'global finance', 'global trade', 'global lenders', 'Web editor', 'US-led sanctions', 'debt traps', 'international bonds', 'The Kremlin', 'international lenders', 'Qing Ming', 'Liu Rui', 'leading role', 'Western nations', 'artillery shells', 'energy shortages', 'unpaid debts', 'White House', 'fresh clues', 'Bolshevik Revolution', 'clearing house', 'effective severance', 'rare thing', 'Hassan Malik', 'interest payments', 'one bond', 'Al Jazeera', 'one analysis', 'force majeure', 'unpaid loans', 'collateral damage', 'destructive consequences', 'chilling lesson', 'capricious demeanor', 'similar acts', 'central bank', 'strong sense', 'disgraceful pullout', 'Antony Blinken', 'collective resolve', 'fig leaf', 'Christopher Caldwell', 'American journalist', 'U.S.', 'high-stakes game', 'Meng Bin', 'The War', 'Ukraine tour', 'Ukraine solution', 'US dollars', 'US Secretary', 'artificial crisis', 'Pyrrhic victory', 'Biden administration', 'first time', 'external government', 'four years', 'Ukraine crisis', 'Ukraine conflict', 'US default', 'Opinion', 'Russia', 'June', 'People', 'February', 'weapons', 'batches', 'politicians', 'Washington', 'scenes', 'bullets', 'nothing', 'food', 'defaults', 'statement', 'Reuters', 'euros', 'May', 'money', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'CNN', 'win', 'host', 'experts', 'alarms', 'announcement', 'means', 'non', 'borrower', 'situation', 'Made', 'others', 'event', 'investment', 'manipulation', 'weaponization', 'dominance', 'currency', 'superpower', 'guarantee', 'fact', 'malpractice', 'precedence', 'freezing', 'assets', 'Afghanistan', 'work', 'formation', 'contentment', 'roles', 'isolationism', 'chance', 'allies', 'weaponry', 'strength', 'standpoint', 'April', 'NATO', 'unity', 'passage', 'show', 'researcher', 'Blame', 'concessions', 'face', 'avenues', 'negotiation', 'Bianji']",2022-06-28,2022-06-28,en.people.cn

In doing so  the greenback’s gauge versus the six major currencies remains indecisive after a two-day downtrend  keeping the fortnight-old downward trajectory after refreshing the yearly top.The DXY began the week on a back foot as market sentiment improved after Friday’s downbeat US data joined economic fears and softer inflation expectations to favor hopes of no major hawkish surprise from the Fed. However  mixed US data and risk-aversion recalled the greenback buyers during the late North American session on Monday.US Durable Goods Orders rose to 0.7% in May  versus 0.1% expected and 0.4% prior. That said  the widely tracked Nondefense Capital Goods Orders ex Aircraft also cross 0.3% market forecasts and previous readings to increase by 0.5% during the stated month. Further  the US Pending Home Sales also surprised the USD bulls with 0.7% MoM figures for May versus -3.7% expected and -4.0% prior. The YoY figures  however  came in negative to -13.6% versus -9.8% prior. Further  Dallas Fed Manufacturing Business Index for June dropped to the lowest level since May 2020  to -17.7 versus -3.1 forecasts and -7.3 prior.On a different page  Russia rejects default on paying external debt by saying Euroclear not accepting Russia’s euro bond transaction 'is not our problem'. “Russian gold and forex reserves are blocked unlawfully. Russia made a payment on euro bond coupons in May ” adds Kremlin in a statement.Recently  global rating agency Moody’s mentioned that Russia's failure to make its coupon payment resulted in a default. Additionally  former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev also crossed wires  via Reuters  while saying  “Any attempt by a NATO nation to encroach upon Crimea constitutes a declaration of war against Russia and may trigger the outbreak of world war III.”Against this backdrop  Wall Street closed in the red  after an upbeat start  whereas the US 10-year Treasury yields gained nearly seven basis points (bps) to end Monday at around 3.20%.

Ukraine will negotiate when it is in a position to do so  that is  when it has basically re-established a position of strength ' the French presidency said.The G7 leaders will commit on Tuesday to a new package of coordinated actions meant to raise pressure on Russia over its war in Ukraine  and will finalize plans for a price cap on Russian oil  a senior U.S. official said on Monday.The US is also planning to send Ukraine sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles to defend against Russian attacks  a source familiar with the process said on Monday.President Joe Biden 'has made the procurement of advanced air defence systems for Ukraine a priority'  the source said  asking not to be identified.An announcement is 'likely this week' on the purchase of an 'advanced medium- to long-range surface-to-air missile defence system'  as well as other weaponry to help Ukraine fight Russia's invasion.This will include 'additional artillery ammunition and counter-battery radars'  which are used to pinpoint the source of enemy artillery firing.Mr Biden is also announcing a $7.5 billion (£6.1 billion) commitment to help Ukraine's government meet its expenses  as part of a drawdown of the $40 billion (£32 billion) military and economic aid package he signed last month.Zelensky has pleaded for more powerful defences against Russian air attacks since the start of the invasion in February.With Russian aircraft and cruise missiles bombing Ukrainian troops and residential areas daily  Zelensky initially focused on his rallying cry of 'close the skies' with a request for Western countries to send war planes to Ukraine.After the United States and European allies made clear that sending planes was too risky  potentially drawing them directly into the conflict against Russia  focus pivoted to surface-to-air missiles.Ukraine has a variety of these weapons  including the powerful Soviet-designed S-300 system.The NASAMS  built by Raytheon in the United States in partnership with Norway's Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace  has been sold in 12 countries  according to the company website.Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz  U.S. President Joe Biden  Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson  Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen  European Council President Charles Michel  Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi  Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and France's President Emmanuel Macron sit at a round table as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses G7 leaders via video link during their working session at Elmau Castle  Germany on MondayIndonesia's President Fumio Kishida  French President Emmanuel Macron  U.S. President Joe Biden laugh together during the G7 leaders meeting on Monday  as Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi stands on the rightG7 leaders' partners were guided by former World Cup alpine ski racer Christian Neureuther (left).

'We will continue to provide financial  humanitarian  military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes ' the G7 said.After speaking with Zelensky for nearly two hours by video-link from Kyiv  G7 leaders issued a forceful message of solidarity with the embattled nation.'As G7 we stand united on Ukraine's side and will continue our support. For this  we all have to take tough but necessary decisions ' the summit's host  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz tweeted  thanking Zelensky for taking part.'We will continue to increase pressure on Putin. This war has to come to an end.'Addressing Russia  the G7 said Moscow must allow grain shipments to leave Ukraine to avoid exacerbating a global food crisis.'We urgently call on Russia to cease  without condition  its attacks on agricultural and transport infrastructure and enable free passage of agricultural shipping from Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea ' it said.The leaders also called for Moscow to allow Ukrainians taken to Russia against their will to return home at once.'We demand that Russia immediately allow the safe return of Ukrainian nationals taken often with force to Russia without their consent ' they said.Leaders are finalising the deal to seek a price cap on Russian oil during the three-day G7 summit in the German Alps.The details of how a price cap would work  as well as its impact on the Russian economy  are to be resolved by G7 finance ministers in the coming months  according to a senior official.The largest democratic economies will also commit to raising tariffs on Russian imports to their countries  with the US announcing new tariffs on 570 categories of goods  as well as use of sanctions to target Moscow's defence supply chains.The new efforts come as Mr Zelensky has openly worried that the West has become fatigued by the cost of a war that is contributing to soaring energy costs and price hikes on essential goods around the globe.Indonesia's President Joko Widodo jokes with US President Joe Biden at the G7 Summit on MondayLeaders from the G7 and partner countries (left to right) Indonesia's President Joko Widodo  European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen  US President Joe Biden  head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Fatih Birol   Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez  World Bank President David Malpass  Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi posing for an extended family photo  during the G7 summit in Schloss Elmau  in the Bavarian Alps  Germany on MondayGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz (back C-R) hosts the plenary sessions Outreach on the on the second day of the three-day G7 summitAll six opted for casual wear with Carrie choosing black leisure wear trousers with walking boots and a striped French Connection Women's Cotton Non Stretch Oversized Tee.

The official was speaking to reporters as the White House released a fact sheet detailing potential G7 actions to support Ukraine and further stem Moscow's oil revenues.'The dual objectives of G7 leaders have been to take direct aim at (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's revenues  particularly through energy  but also to minimize the spillovers and the impact on the G7 economies and the rest of the world ' the U.S. official said on the sidelines of the annual G7 summit.But the Kremlin on Monday rejected claims that it has defaulted on its external debt.The Kremlin has repeatedly said there are no grounds for Russia to default but it is unable to send money to bondholders because of sanctions  accusing the West of trying to drive it into an artificial default.In a call with reporters  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia made bond payments due in May but the fact they had been blocked by Euroclear because of Western sanctions on Russia was 'not our problem'.The country has struggled to keep up payments on $40 billion (£32billion) of outstanding bonds since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24  as sweeping sanctions have effectively cut the country off from the global financial system and rendered its assets untouchable to many investors.Russia's efforts to avoid what would be its first major default on international bonds since the Bolshevik revolution more than a century ago hit a insurmountable roadblock in late May when the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) effectively blocked Moscow from making payments.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz greets India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Bavarian resort of Schloss Elmau castle on Monday(Left to right) British Prime Minister's wife Carrie Johnson  German Chancellor's wife Britta Ernst  EU Council President's wife Amelie Derbaudrenghien and French President's wife Brigitte Macron listen to explanations about an instect trap by Veronika Hierlmeier (C  foreground) of the Bavarian species conservation centre on climate change  environmental pollution and insect deathsMoscow missed the deadline to pay $100 million (£81.4m) in interest on two Eurobonds  one denominated in U.S. dollars and another euros  which had originally been due on May 27. The payments had a grace period of 30 days  which expired on Sunday. Pictured: Russia's Eurobonds have traded at low levels since the start of March'Our position is well known. Our reserves are blocked unlawfully and all attempts to use these reserves will also be unlawful and would amount to outright theft ' Peskov said.In response to the war in Ukraine  G7 nations  which account for nearly half the world's economic output  are determined to crank up the pressure on Russia without stoking already soaring inflation that is particularly hurting the global south.The price cap could hit the Kremlin's war chest while actually lowering energy prices.G7 leaders will also make an 'unprecedented  long-term security commitment to providing Ukraine with financial  humanitarian  military and diplomatic support as long as it takes'  including the timely provision of advanced weapons  the White House said in a fact sheet.Western sanctions have hit Russia's economy hard and the new measures are aimed at further depriving the Kremlin of oil revenues.

Inc.  Rahway  NJ.  USA  to evaluate the oncolytic virus BT-001 in combination with MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for the treatment of patients with solid tumors.Under the terms of the supply agreement  MSD will provide pembrolizumab to be used in combination with BT-001 in the ongoing Phase I/IIa clinical trial.“By combining BT-001 with the anti-PD-1 drug KEYTRUDA® we expect to optimize the patient’s immune response to induce a strong and effective anti-tumor response. This agreement will allow us to move further on the clinical development of our promising co-developed oncolytic candidate BT-001” said Hedi Ben Brahim  CEO of Transgene.“We are very pleased to be signing another collaboration with MSD  supporting the expansion of the clinical trial program of BT-001  the oncolytic virus expressing our proprietary anti-CTLA-4 antibody  jointly developed by Transgene and BioInvent. It marks a further validation of our expanding and promising clinical pipeline of anti-cancer treatments  which currently encompasses three compounds in four ongoing clinical trials” added Martin Welschof  CEO of BioInvent.Recruitment in the clinical study (NCT04725331) is ongoing. The trial is a Phase I/IIa of BT-001  which is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration between Transgene and BioInvent  as a single agent and in combination with KEYTRUDA® for the treatment of solid tumors.KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.  a subsidiary of Merck & Co.  Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA.***About the trialThe ongoing Phase I/IIa (NCT04725331) study is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation trial evaluating BT-001 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 treatment). Patient inclusions are ongoing in Europe (France  Belgium) and the trial has been authorized in the US.This Phase I is divided into two parts. In part A  patients with metastatic/advanced tumors receive single agent  intra-tumoral administrations of BT-001. Part B will explore the combination of intra-tumoral injections of BT-001 with pembrolizumab. The Phase IIa will evaluate the combination regimen in several patient cohorts with different tumor types. These expansion cohorts will offer the possibility of exploring the activity of this approach to treat other malignancies not traditionally addressed with this type of treatment.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene’s Invir.IO™ platform and its patented large-capacity VV cop TK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent’s proprietary n-CoDeR®/F.I.R.S.T™ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody will be greatly improved.BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration on oncolytic viruses between Transgene and BioInvent.

Waly Dioh and Cendrine Tourette and entitled: ""BIO101 in development for the treatment of Sarcopenia"" summarises the...","PARIS  FRANCE and CAMBRIDGE  MASSACHUSETTS / ACCESSWIRE / June 27  2022 / Biophytis SA (NASDAQ:BPTS)(Euronext Growth Paris:ALBPS)  (""Biophytis"" or the ""Company"")  a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of therapeutics that slow the degenerative processes associated with aging and improve functional outcomes in patients suffering from age-related diseases  announced today that it is giving an oral presentation on the development of Sarconeos (BIO101) for the treatment of sarcopenia at the 15th International SCWD Congress (Society on Sarcopenia  Cachexia & Wasting disorders).This oral presentation given by Drs. Waly Dioh and Cendrine Tourette and entitled: ""BIO101 in development for the treatment of Sarcopenia"" summarises the major milestones in the development of Sarconeos (BIO101) that have already been achieved  mainly the results of the SARA-INT Phase 2 study as well as the outline of SARA Phase 3 study that the Company intends to initiate before the end of 2022.Building on the results of SARA-INT Phase 2 study  the company has asked for scientific advice from the European (EMA) and American (FDA) regulatory authorities in order to define the design and conditions to start the SARA Phase 3 program. Sarconeos (BIO101) has the potential to be the first drug candidate ever moving into Phase 3 in Sarcopenia.The recent publication of the first results of European SPRINTT study  a pan-European clinical study in elderly patients with sarcopenia  has provided new data that support the design of a phase 3 in this indication. SPRINTT study showed  confirming prior LIFE study in the USA  that the risk of mobility disability can be estimated in patients with severe sarcopenia by measuring over a period of 1 to 3 years the loss of the ability to walk 400 mThe Phase 3 study of Sarconeos (BIO101) will target 600 to 900 patients over 65 years old with severe sarcopenia (3 ≤ SPPB ≤ 7)  low gait speed (4m) ≤ 0.8 m/s and low Hand Grip Strength (HGS < 20kg for females and < 35.5 kg for males).Story continuesPatients will be treated for a minimum of 12 months receiving either placebo or 350mg Sarconeos (BIO101) b.i.d.The primary endpoint will be the ability to complete the 400m walk test in less than 15 minutes  and the following secondary endpoints will be used: Gait speed 4-m from SPPB  Hand Grip Strength (HGS) and Patient Reported Outcome (PRO).The duration of this study is estimated at 36 months from the inclusion of the first patient expected at the end of 2022.The design of this study may however evolve depending on the discussions currently underway with the European and American health authorities. The company intends to file for Clinical Trial Application (CTA) in Q4 2022  depending on final discussions with FDA and EMA.Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  states: ""Sarcopenia has only been very recently recognized as a disease that can be diagnosed with no efficient treatment option despites the huge medical need. The recent publication of the first results of the European SPRINTT study  together with the results of the LIFE study in the United States  now provide enough supportive data to initiate for the first time a phase 3 program in patients with sarcopenia. We are currently discussing with the European and American health authorities to finalize the design of the SARA Phase 3 program and hope we could move forward with clinical trial application before the end of the year. No drug is currently approved for sarcopenia in the world  we are pioneers in this field and intend to continue to establish our leadership position by being the first company to initiate a Phase 3 program.""About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the development of therapeutics that are aimed at slowing the degenerative processes associated with aging  including severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19.

Inc.  Rahway  NJ.  USA  to evaluate the oncolytic virus BT-001 in combination with MSD's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for the treatment of patients with solid tumors.Under the terms of the supply agreement  MSD will provide pembrolizumab to be used in combination with BT-001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial.""We are very pleased to be signing another collaboration with MSD  supporting the expansion of the clinical trial program of BT-001  the oncolytic virus expressing our proprietary anti-CTLA-4 antibody  jointly developed by Transgene and BioInvent. It marks a further validation of our expanding and promising clinical pipeline of anti-cancer treatments  which currently encompasses three compounds in four ongoing clinical trials "" said Martin Welschof  CEO of BioInvent.""By combining BT-001 with the anti-PD-1 drug KEYTRUDA® we expect to optimize the patient's immune response to induce a strong and effective anti-tumor response. This agreement will allow us to move further on the clinical development of our promising co-developed oncolytic candidate BT-001 "" added Hedi Ben Brahim  CEO of Transgene.Recruitment in the clinical study (NCT04725331) is ongoing. The trial is a phase 1/2a of BT-001  which is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration between BioInvent and Transgene  as a single agent and in combination with KEYTRUDA® for the treatment of solid tumors. KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC  a subsidiary of Merck & Co.  Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA.Story continues***About the trialThe ongoing Phase 1/2a (NCT04725331) study is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation trial evaluating BT-001 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 treatment). Patient inclusions are ongoing in Europe (France  Belgium) and the trial has been authorized in the US.This Phase 1 is divided into two parts. In part A  patients with metastatic/advanced tumors receive single agent  intra-tumoral administrations of BT-001. Part B will explore the combination of intratumoral injections of BT-001 with pembrolizumab. The Phase 2a will evaluate the combination regimen in several patient cohorts with different tumor types. These expansion cohorts will offer the possibility of exploring the activity of this approach to treat other malignancies not traditionally addressed with this type of treatment.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene's Invir.IO™ platform and its patented large-capacity VVcopTK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent's proprietary n-CoDeR®/F.I.R.S.T™ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody may be greatly improved.BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration between Transgene and BioInvent.

The initial public offering was priced at 13.50 euros per share on Tuesday  valuing the Italian company at 2.723 billion euros  or $2.88 billion. ""It was the right time for us  we have a great equity story  so for us … it is the beginning of a new journey  and we are not scared about the current market turbulences "" CEO Paolo Dellacha told CNBC's Julianna Tatelbaum. ""We have an industrial plan to execute.""It comes at a volatile time for markets  with the pan-European Eurostoxx 600 down over 14% over the year to date.

(NASDAQ: VEON) (EuronextAmsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides mobile connectivity and services  today discloses the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for its 1Q22 Group results.Following the release of our 1Q22 trading update on 28 April 2022  and given the unprecedented challenges and market volatility that VEON has been facing  we have now completed our 1Q22 financial statements  which further support the resilient performance we reported with our trading update.VEON ended 1Q22 with revenue of USD 1 823 million  +9.8% YoY in local currency (-0.4% YoY in reported currency) and EBITDA of USD 771 million  +5.3% YoY in local currency (-4.5% YoY in reported currency). VEON posted a 1Q22 net loss of USD 97 million  while the Group's net profit before impairments rose 168% YoY to USD 375 million  versus USD 140 million in 1Q21. In 1Q22 Group capex was USD 377 million (-3.8% YoY)  with capex intensity of 23.3%  -2.1 p.p. YoY. Group net debt/EBITDA was 2.4x as of 31 March 2022.Commenting on results  Kaan Terzioğlu said:""The 1Q22 financial statements published today further reinforce VEON Group's strong underlying performance driven by the successful implementation of our digital operator strategy across all our geographies  where we continue to deliver vital connectivity and digital services. Net profit before impairments rose by 168% YoY  while cash from operating activities of USD 565 million demonstrates the high resilience of our business even in difficult times. Our 1Q22 results  together with our strong performance in April and May  show VEON's ongoing and effective operational and financial discipline  as well as the progress we continue to make delivering on our strategy.""1Q22 Financial StatementsFollowing the 1Q22 trading update on 28 April 2022  VEON today reports the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for 1Q22. VEON posted a 1Q22 net loss of USD 97 million  while the Group's net profit before impairments rose 168% YoY to USD 375 million. Cash from operating activities in 1Q22 was USD 565 million  versus USD 596 million in 1Q21  highlighting continued strong cashflow generation across the operations.Story continuesIn 1Q22 we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment of USD 449 million against Beeline in Russia. This is primarily caused by a higher discount factor to be used for future cashflows related to our Russian operations  in accordance with IFRS. In 1Q22  Ukraine showed resilient strong operational performance  which was also previously disclosed in our 1Q22 trading update. We did  however  record a fixed asset impairment of USD 20 million in 1Q22 related to property  plant and equipment of Kyivstar as a result of the physical damage to sites caused by the ongoing conflict. Including the impact of the impairments  VEON reported a 1Q22 net loss of USD 97 million with shareholder equity of USD 227 million as of 31 March 2022.Since reporting the strong 1Q22 results  operational momentum has continued across the Group  driven by successful implementation of our digital operator strategy  as noted in our CEO letter published on 10 June 2022. Our double and multiplay 4G subscribers have reached 35% of the Group's monthly active customer base. This supported continued high single-digit local currency year-on-year growth in the Group's service revenues  both in April and May. We continue to make market share gains across a number of markets including Ukraine  Pakistan  Kazakhstan  Bangladesh and Uzbekistan.The 1Q22 trading update  the CEO Letter and the 1Q22 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are available on the VEON Group website at https://www.veon.com/investors/reports-results/reports-results/ and https://www.veon.com/media/media-releases/2022/from-veon-ceo-key-developments-update-for-investors-and-partners/.About VEONVEON is a NASDAQ and Euronext Amsterdam-listed global provider of connectivity and digital services  headquartered in Amsterdam.

The European Commission (EC) has...,"Sanofi - Aventis GroupeXenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) approved by European Commission as first and only treatment for ASMDParis  June 28  2022. The European Commission (EC) has approved Xenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) as the first and only enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non-Central Nervous System (CNS) manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD) in pediatric and adult patients with ASMD type A/B or ASMD type B. The approval is based on positive data from the ASCEND and ASCEND-Peds clinical trials  in which Xenpozyme showed substantial and clinically relevant improvement in lung function (as measured by diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide  or DLco) and reduction of spleen and liver volumes  with a well-tolerated safety profile. Given the urgent unmet medical needs of the ASMD community  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted Xenpozyme PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation. Xenpozyme has also received special breakthrough designations from several other regulatory agencies around the world.John Reed  M.D.  Ph.DExecutive Vice President  Global Head of Research and Development  Sanofi“The ASMD community has waited many years for a treatment for this rare and debilitating genetic disease. The approval of Xenpozyme by the European Commission represents a transformational shift in what we can offer to patients  demonstrated by the clinically important improvements across major manifestations of ASMD and the sustained effects noted over longer term treatment.”ASMD is an extremely rare  progressive genetic disease with significant morbidity and mortality  especially among infants and children  as many pediatric patients will not survive to adulthood. Signs and symptoms of ASMD may include enlarged spleen or liver  difficulty breathing  lung infections  and unusual bruising or bleeding  among other disease manifestations. Current management of the disease includes palliative and supportive care to manage the symptoms.Story continuesXenpozyme is an enzyme replacement therapy designed to replace deficient or defective acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)  an enzyme that allows for the breakdown of the lipid sphingomyelin. In individuals with ASMD  the insufficient amount of the ASM enzyme means sphingomyelin is poorly metabolized  potentially leading to lifelong accumulation inand damage to multiple organs.Maurizio Scarpa  M.D.  Ph.DUniversity Hospital of Udine  Italy“We welcome the European Union approval of Xenpozyme as the first and only disease-specific therapy for ASMD with a potential to oppose disease progression. This is a significant milestone for individuals living with ASMD  a disease associated with substantial morbidity and risk of premature death.”Approval based on positive results from two clinical trials in children and adultsASCENDThe ASCEND trial randomized 36 adult patients with ASMD type A/B or type B to receive Xenpozyme or placebo for 52 weeks (primary analysis)  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug. The study demonstrated that Xenpozyme improved lung function  assessed as the percent change from baseline to week 52 in predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco)  and reduced spleen size  evaluated as percent change from baseline in multiples of normal (MN) spleen volume.Patients treated with Xenpozyme had improvement in DLco from baseline to week 52 of 22% compared to 3% for the patients in the placebo group. The difference between the two treatment arms (19%) was statistically significant (p=0.0004).Patients treated with Xenpozyme had reduction in spleen size by 39.5% at week 52 compared to increase by 0.5% for the patients in the placebo group. The difference between the two treatment arms (40%) was statistically significant (p<0.0001).All ASCEND patients treated with Xenpozyme showed improvement in one or both primary endpoints (DLco and spleen size reduction).The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar in patients receiving Xenpozyme to that in patients receiving placebo. There were five serious AEs in the Xenpozyme arm and 11 in the placebo arm  none of which was treatment-related. There were no AEs that led to treatment discontinuation or study withdrawal. The most common AEs in the ASCEND trial were headache  nasopharyngitis  upper respiratory tract infection  cough  and arthralgia.ASCEND-PedsThe single-arm ASCEND-Peds trial studied 20 pediatric patients with ASMD type A/B or type B who all received Xenpozyme  with a primary objective of evaluating the safety and tolerability of Xenpozyme for 64 weeks. All patients completed the study and continued in an extension trial. The ASCEND-Peds study also explored efficacy endpoints of progressive lung disease and of spleen and liver enlargement. After one year of treatment (52 weeks)  the percent predicted DLco mean increase from baseline was 33% in nine patients who were able to perform the test at baseline (children over the age of five were assessed if they were able to perform the test). Additionally  the spleen volume mean decrease was 49% compared to baseline.Over the 64-week treatment period  all ASCEND-Peds patients experienced at least one AE  which were mostly mild and moderate. Five treatment-related serious AEs were observed in three patients: two cases of transient  asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase in one patient  one case each of urticaria and rash in one patient  and one anaphylactic reaction in one patient. No patients had to permanently discontinue treatment due to an AE. The most common AEs in the ASCEND-Peds trial were pyrexia  cough  vomiting  nasopharyngitis  diarrhea  headache  upper respiratory tract infection  contusion  abdominal pain  nasal congestion  rash  urticaria  scratch  and epistaxis.About XenpozymeXenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) is an enzyme replacement therapy designed to replace deficient or defective acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)  an enzyme that allows for the breakdown of sphingomyelin. Accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells can cause harm to the lungs  spleen  and liver  as well as other organs  potentially leading to early death. Xenpozyme has been evaluated in pediatric and adult patients to treat non-CNS manifestations of ASMD type A/B and ASMD type B. Xenpozyme has not been studied in patients with ASMD type A.In March 2022  Xenpozyme was approved in Japan under the SAKIGAKE (or “pioneer”) designation  marking the first approval for olipudase alfa anywhere in the world. In the United States  where olipudase alfa received Breakthrough Therapy designation  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently reviewing olipudase alfa’s Biologics License Application (BLA)  with a target action date for the FDA decision (PDUFA date) anticipated for October 2022.About ASMDHistorically known as Niemann-Pick disease types A  A/B  and B  ASMD is a rare  progressive  and potentially life-threatening genetic disease. ASMD represents a spectrum of disease  with two types that may represent opposite ends of a continuum referred to as ASMD type A and ASMD type B. ASMD type A/B is an intermediate form that includes varying degrees of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Nexviadyme is the first and only newly approved medicine for Pompe disease in Europe since 2006  when the European Commission authorized the marketingof alglucosidase alfa  branded Myozyme®.Benedikt Schoser  MD.Senior Consultant and Professor  Friedrich-Baur-Institute  Department of Neurology  Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich“The approval of Nexviadyme in Europe to treat Pompe disease is backed by a robust body of evidence showing clinically meaningful improvements that can impact quality of life. The totality and rigor of the data is particularly noteworthy given the complexities of research and development for such a rare and progressive condition. Nexviadyme’s demonstrated clinical benefit and molecular innovation bring a new treatment option to people living with Pompe disease who continue to face unmet needs.”Addressing an unmet need for people living with Pompe diseasePompe disease can present as infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD)  the most severe form of the disease with rapid onset in infancy  or late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD)  which progressively damages muscles over time. If left untreated  IOPD can lead to heart failure and death within the first year of life  while people with LOPD may require mechanical ventilation to help with breathing or a wheelchair to assist with mobility as the disease progresses.Story continuesNexviadyme now approved in many countries around the worldNexviadyme is approved in multiple markets around the world for the treatment of certain people living with Pompe disease  including the European Union  the United States  Japan  Canada  Switzerland  Australia  Brazil  Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates. Outside of Europe  the treatment is marketed under the brand name Nexviazyme. In the U.S. and Japan  the majority of the Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa)-treated population has started  or is in the process of starting  treatment with Nexviazyme (avalglucosidase alfa).In November 2021  Sanofi announced that as part of the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) review of Nexviadyme  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued an opinion that the therapy does not qualify as a New Active Substance (NAS). In April 2022  the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Product (COMP) also recommended Nexviadyme be removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products (OMP).Sanofi strongly disagrees with both opinions and believes these conclusions were the result of an erroneous and very narrow interpretation of the NAS and OMP principles that demonstrate molecular innovation and clinical benefit. Sanofi stands by the totality of data in support of Nexviadyme as a potential new standard of care and is concerned that such narrow interpretation will undermine rare disease incentive mechanisms in Europe. We believe withholding these distinct designations could negatively impact patient health in Europe by restricting access to innovative advancements in care.Bill SiboldExecutive Vice President  Specialty Care  Sanofi“For more than two decades  we’ve been working with the community and leveraging our scientific expertise to improve care for people living with Pompe disease. We strongly believe in the meaningful clinical benefits of this medicine as a new standard of care and will work hard to ensure the broadest possible access in Europe despite the European Commission’s failure to recognize Nexviadyme’s NAS and OMP designations. We call on patient advocacy groups  policymakers  clinicians and patients to join us in our efforts to ensure innovative treatments are appropriately recognized and made available to patients in Europe and beyond.”Nexviadyme  a new ERT for late-onset Pompe disease and infantile-onset Pompe DiseasePositive outcomes in key disease burden measuresIn a robust clinical development program  Nexviadyme demonstrated clinically meaningful differences in key areas of disease burden for people living with late-onset Pompe disease and infantile-onset Pompe disease.Results from the COMET study comparing Nexviadyme to alglucosidase alfa in LOPD at 49 weeks included:Patients treated with Nexviadyme showed a 2.9% improvement from baseline (SE=0.9) in forced vital capacity (FVC) percent-predicted  a key measure of respiratory function and the study’s primary endpoint  which was 2.4% points greater as compared to the change with alglucosidase alfa. This difference exceeded the non-inferiority margin (p=0.0074; 95% CI  -0.13  4.99). Statistical superiority was narrowly missed (p=0.06).Patients treated with Nexviadyme walked 32.2 meters farther (SE=9.9) compared to baseline in the 6-minute walk test (6MWT)  a key secondary endpoint  which was 30 meters farther (p=0.040; 95% CI  1.33  58.69) than the change with alglucosidase alfa. Formal statistical testing for all secondary endpoints was not conducted.Results from the Mini-COMET study evaluating Nexviadyme in IOPD patients showed improvement or stabilization at six months in efficacy outcomes  the trial’s secondary objective  of gross motor function measure (GMFM-88)  quick motor function test (QMFT)  pediatric evaluation of disability index (Pompe-PEDI)  left ventricular mass z-score (LVMZ)  and eyelid position measurements in patients previously declining or insufficiently controlled with alglucosidase alfa.A pooled safety analysis from four clinical studies found serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with Nexviadyme included chills (1.4%)  headache  dyspnoea  respiratory distress  nausea  skin discoloration  chest discomfort  pyrexia  blood pressure increased  body temperature increased  heart rate increased  and oxygen saturation decreased (0.7% each). Additionally  hypersensitivity reactions (43.5%)  anaphylaxis (1.4%) and infusion-associated reactions (26.1%) were reported.

VEON posted a 1Q22 net loss of USD 97 million  while the Group's net profit before impairments rose 168% YoY to USD 375 million. Cash from operating activities in 1Q22 was USD 565 million  versus USD 596 million in 1Q21  highlighting continued strong cashflow generation across the operations.In 1Q22 we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment of USD 449 million against Beeline in Russia. This is primarily caused by a higher discount factor to be used for future cashflows related to our Russian operations  in accordance with IFRS. In 1Q22  Ukraine showed resilient strong operational performance  which was also previously disclosed in our 1Q22 trading update. We did  however  record a fixed asset impairment of USD 20 million in 1Q22 related to property  plant and equipment of Kyivstar as a result of the physical damage to sites caused by the ongoing conflict. Including the impact of the impairments  VEON reported a 1Q22 net loss of USD 97 million with shareholder equity of USD 227 million as of 31 March 2022.Since reporting the strong 1Q22 results  operational momentum has continued across the Group  driven by successful implementation of our digital operator strategy  as noted in our CEO letter published on 10 June 2022. Our double and multiplay 4G subscribers have reached 35% of the Group's monthly active customer base.

Its founders’ past investments have focused on start-ups that tackle climate change  aim to improve health care  foster equal opportunities and modernise governance.Tamkivi was an early executive at Skype before he co-founded the digital nomad tool Teleport  which was sold to the talent mobility platform Topia in 2017.“We’ve already seen the real impact a well-funded start-up scene can have on economies in small countries like Estonia – now it is time to scale this GDP level impact across the whole of Europe "" he said.Among the other founders is Hogarth  who co-founded SongKick which was sold to Warner Music in 2017. Heloui is a former chief executive of German games developer Bigpoint  which was sold to Youzu in 2016.Between them  Hogarth  Heloui  Tamkivi and Hinrikus have founded four start-ups - Wise  Songkick  Teleport and Certific - and helped build three companies  including Skype  Bigpoint and Topia.All four founders have also been investing for years as business angels in the tech sector. Companies in their portfolio include Deliveroo  Hopin  Pipedrive  Chorus  Uber  Zego and Bolt.As Plural  they have already invested in 14 companies including rental furniture start-up Feather  NFTport (an NFT infrastructure company)  energy storage company Field  metaverse company Ready Player Me and student banking challenger MOS.",neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,mixed,0.32,0.07,0.61,True,English,"['new €250 million start-up fund Plural', 'European tech scene', 'Entrepreneurs', 'French president Emmanuel Macron', 'pan-European stock exchange Euronext', 'traditional venture capital model', 'energy storage company Field', 'rental furniture start-up Feather', 'money transfer company Wise', 'venture capital funds', 'early-stage financing rounds', 'financial market turbulences', 'innovative semi-conductor plants', 'digital nomad tool', 'talent mobility platform', 'German games developer', 'Ready Player Me', 'student banking challenger', 'NFT infrastructure company', 'technology chip industry', 'new technology segment', 'GDP level impact', 'former chief executive', '€250 million funding platform', 'former start-up founders', 'next five years', 'Four European entrepreneurs', 'leading tech companies', 'metaverse company', 'start-up ecosystems', 'start-up scene', 'technology sector', 'European Union', 'early executive', 'real impact', 'next generation', 'four founders', 'tech entrepreneurs', 'tech sector', 'tech scene', '10 tech giants', 'scar tissue', 'best way', 'United States', 'successful generation', 'active role', 'scalable network', 'important missions', 'past investments', 'climate change', 'health care', 'equal opportunities', 'small countries', 'Warner Music', 'four start-ups', 'business angels', 'other founders', 'tech start-ups', 'Taavet Hinrikus', 'world-leading companies', 'three companies', 'asset managers', 'other investors', 'Ian Hogarth', 'Khaled Heloui', 'Sten Tamkivi', '14 companies', 'continent', 'decades', 'experience', 'scratch', 'Plural', 'launch', 'midst', 'statement', 'craft', 'move', 'February', 'rules', 'visibility', 'ASML', 'DeepMind', 'Arm', 'potential', 'builders', 'website', 'peers', 'governance', 'Skype', 'Teleport', 'Topia', 'economies', 'Estonia', 'time', 'SongKick', 'Bigpoint', 'Youzu', 'Certific', 'portfolio', 'Deliveroo', 'Hopin', 'Pipedrive', 'Chorus', 'Uber', 'Zego', 'Bolt', 'NFTport', 'MOS']",2022-06-28,2022-06-28,euronews.com

Our 1Q22 results  together with our strong performance in April and May  show VEON's ongoing and effective operational and financial discipline  as well as the progress we continue to make delivering on our strategy.""1Q22 Financial StatementsFollowing the 1Q22 trading update on 28 April 2022  VEON today reports the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for 1Q22. VEON posted a 1Q22 net loss of USD 97 million  while the Group's net profit before impairments rose 168% YoY to USD 375 million. Cash from operating activities in 1Q22 was USD 565 million  versus USD 596 million in 1Q21  highlighting continued strong cashflow generation across the operations.In 1Q22 we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment of USD 449 million against Beeline in Russia. This is primarily caused by a higher discount factor to be used for future cashflows related to our Russian operations  in accordance with IFRS. In 1Q22  Ukraine showed resilient strong operational performance  which was also previously disclosed in our 1Q22 trading update. We did  however  record a fixed asset impairment of USD 20 million in 1Q22 related to property  plant and equipment of Kyivstar as a result of the physical damage to sites caused by the ongoing conflict. Including the impact of the impairments  VEON reported a 1Q22 net loss of USD 97 million with shareholder equity of USD 227 million as of 31 March 2022.Since reporting the strong 1Q22 results  operational momentum has continued across the Group  driven by successful implementation of our digital operator strategy  as noted in our CEO letter published on 10 June 2022. Our double and multiplay 4G subscribers have reached 35% of the Group's monthly active customer base. This supported continued high single-digit local currency year-on-year growth in the Group's service revenues  both in April and May. We continue to make market share gains across a number of markets including Ukraine  Pakistan  Kazakhstan  Bangladesh and Uzbekistan.The 1Q22 trading update  the CEO Letter and the 1Q22 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are available on the VEON Group website at https://www.veon.com/investors/reports-results/reports-results/ and https://www.veon.com/media/media-releases/2022/from-veon-ceo-key-developments-update-for-investors-and-partners/.About VEONVEON is a NASDAQ and Euronext Amsterdam-listed global provider of connectivity and digital services  headquartered in Amsterdam.

Inc.  Rahway  NJ.  USA  to evaluate the oncolytic virus BT-001 in combination with MSD's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for the treatment of patients with solid tumors.Under the terms of the supply agreement  MSD will provide pembrolizumab to be used in combination with BT-001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial.""We are very pleased to be signing another collaboration with MSD  supporting the expansion of the clinical trial program of BT-001  the oncolytic virus expressing our proprietary anti-CTLA-4 antibody  jointly developed by Transgene and BioInvent. It marks a further validation of our expanding and promising clinical pipeline of anti-cancer treatments  which currently encompasses three compounds in four ongoing clinical trials "" said Martin Welschof  CEO of BioInvent.""By combining BT-001 with the anti-PD-1 drug KEYTRUDA® we expect to optimize the patient's immune response to induce a strong and effective anti-tumor response. This agreement will allow us to move further on the clinical development of our promising co-developed oncolytic candidate BT-001 "" added Hedi Ben Brahim  CEO of Transgene.Recruitment in the clinical study (NCT04725331) is ongoing. The trial is a phase 1/2a of BT-001  which is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration between BioInvent and Transgene  as a single agent and in combination with KEYTRUDA® for the treatment of solid tumors. KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC  a subsidiary of Merck & Co.  Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA.***About the trialThe ongoing Phase 1/2a (NCT04725331) study is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation trial evaluating BT-001 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 treatment). Patient inclusions are ongoing in Europe (France  Belgium) and the trial has been authorized in the US.This Phase 1 is divided into two parts. In part A  patients with metastatic/advanced tumors receive single agent  intra-tumoral administrations of BT-001. Part B will explore the combination of intratumoral injections of BT-001 with pembrolizumab. The Phase 2a will evaluate the combination regimen in several patient cohorts with different tumor types. These expansion cohorts will offer the possibility of exploring the activity of this approach to treat other malignancies not traditionally addressed with this type of treatment.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene's Invir.IO™ platform and its patented large-capacity VVcopTK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent's proprietary n-CoDeR®/F.I.R.S.T™ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody may be greatly improved.BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration between Transgene and BioInvent.
