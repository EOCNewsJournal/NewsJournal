Russia defaulted on its international bonds for the first time ‚Ä¶,Taiwan‚Äôs financial regulator said on Tuesday that seven Taiwanese insurance companies have not received interest due on May 27 on Russian Eurobonds after a grace period ended on Sunday evening.Russia defaulted on its international bonds for the first time in more than a century  the White House and Moody‚Äôs credit agency said on Monday  as sanctions have effectively cut the country off from the global financial system.The payments in question are $100 million in interest on two bonds  one denominated in U.S. dollars RU000A0JWHA4= and another in euros RU234748670=  that Russia was due to pay on May 27. The payments had a grace period of 30 days  which expired on Sunday.Russian debt makes up only a fraction of overall Taiwanese bond holdings.The Kremlin and the finance ministry have repeatedly said Russia was honoring its obligations  saying that the currency payments were made but not processed by Euroclear to reach non-Russian bondholders.Russia Defaults on Foreign-Currency Debt for 1st Time in More Than a CenturyAsked on Tuesday whether Russia would sue Euroclear or other Western financial intermediaries involved in the transaction  Dmitry Peskov  Kremlin spokesman  said: ‚ÄúThis question should be analyzed by our lawyers  our financial institutions.‚ÄùAccording to Alexander Afonin  head of debt market analysis at Moscow-based Sinara investment bank  bondholders may call a default on Russia themselves under certain conditions.‚ÄúIn order to do so  a certain quorum must be called and is very unlikely to be presented given that the bulk of those bondholders are Russian investors ‚Äù Afonin said.

NATO has already announced plans to expand the number of forces it has on high alert from 40 000 to 300 000‚Äîa more than sevenfold increase‚Äîand is also set to unveil a new ‚Äústrategic concept‚Äù that now tackles China.‚ÄúThis constitutes the biggest overhaul of our collective deterrence and defense since the Cold War ‚Äù NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Monday.The conference comes on the heels of another high-profile diplomatic meeting  the G-7 summit in Germany‚Äôs Bavarian Alps  which resulted in a series of new measures that target Russia‚Äôs arms industry and gold reserves.In Madrid  leaders from South Korea  Japan  Australia  and New Zealand will join the NATO summit as observers. Ahead of the meeting  Seoul also announced plans to create a diplomatic mission to the alliance in Brussels.Their participation reflects how NATO leaders have ‚Äúan eye on the Indo-Pacific‚Äù and Beijing  as FP‚Äôs Michael Hirsh writes. With the inclusion of these nations  he writes  ‚Äúnew battle lines are being drawn that could last for generations.‚ÄùA major point of contention will be the membership applications of Finland and Sweden  both of which have made bids to join the alliance but have been stymied by Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appears intent on using the accession process to secure key concessions  such as loosening Western defense export controls and curtailing the activities of Kurdish groups based in Scandinavia.Challenges surrounding their potential membership will likely come to a head in Madrid  with Erdogan expected to attempt to push through a number of his demands. At the summit  Western officials believe Ankara‚Äôs efforts could force negotiations to go down to the wire  FP‚Äôs Jack Detsch reports.‚ÄúTurkey saw great leverage in the Finland and Sweden request ‚Äù one European official told Detsch  while speaking on condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúThey are trying to maximize this in the way that they always do.‚ÄùWhat We‚Äôre Following TodayRussia bombs shopping mall. A Russian airstrike on a Ukrainian shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk late Monday has killed at least 16 people and seriously injured dozens of others  according to Ukrainian officials. Before the strike  as many as 1 000 civilians had been inside the building  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. ‚ÄúThis is one of the most brazen terrorist acts in the history of Europe ‚Äù he declared. ‚ÄúRussia became the biggest terrorist organization in the world.‚ÄùThe mall attack comes as Russia has reportedly defaulted on its foreign debt after missing a payment deadline on Sunday  its first such default since 1918. But since Western sanctions have essentially frozen Moscow out of the global financial system  inhibiting these types of transactions  Russian officials said they did not consider it to be a default.‚ÄúThe fact that Euroclear withheld this money  did not transfer it to the recipients  it is not our problem ‚Äù the Kremlin‚Äôs spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ‚ÄúIn other words  there are no grounds to call this situation a default.‚ÄùJapan‚Äôs heat wave. Japanese authorities are urging the public to conserve electricity to avoid potential blackouts as the country faces its highest June temperatures on record. Temperatures spiked to 104.4 degrees Fahrenheit this past weekend  surpassing a previous high of 103.6 degrees Fahrenheit from June 2011 and forcing several cities to set heat stroke warnings.‚ÄúWe ask the public to reduce energy consumption during the early evening hours when the reserve ratio falls ‚Äù Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said.Keep an Eye OnPossible Ecuador talks.

7044,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/the-big-package-how-russia-was-driven-to-default/,The ‚ÄòBig Package‚Äô: How Russia was driven to default,Russia's first major international debt default in over a century  which Washington said became a fact on Monday (27 June)  follows months of co-ordinated Western sanctions that left Moscow with cash but no access to the international financial network.,Russia‚Äôs first major international debt default in over a century  which Washington said became a fact on Monday (27 June)  follows months of co-ordinated Western sanctions that left Moscow with cash but no access to the international financial network.Below is a summary of the key moments that have led up to this point.The ‚Äòbig package‚ÄôAt around 11.30 p.m. (2230 GMT) on 25 February  the day after Russian troops entered Ukraine  European Union‚Äôs experts in Brussels said a set of sanctions they had worked on for days  or the ‚ÄúBig Package‚Äù as they called it  was ready.Just before midnight  the European Commission announced the measures.While emergency Group of Seven and EU meetings earlier made clear a response was coming  the package named Vladimir Putin and his top diplomat Sergei Lavrov personally  and  as it later became clear  froze some $300 billion of the Russian central bank‚Äôs reserves.‚ÄúThat was really the moment when we said  okay  well we‚Äôve done it ‚Äù one European source told Reuters. ‚ÄúThat was  I think  a very pivotal moment for a lot of people around a table.‚ÄùSwift actionDays later  on 2 March  the EU struck again by banning seven Russian banks from SWIFT  an international financial messaging system crucial for cross-border transactions.Booting Russian lenders from SWIFT had long been considered a ‚Äònuclear option ‚Äô but the invasion put it on the table and when the EU decided to activate it  those at SWIFT headquarters just outside Brussels were ready.The only question was how long they had to implement the move  ‚Äúfive days or five minutes?‚Äù another source said. In the end it was 10-12 days.First cuts  but not the deepestCredit rating agency  S&P Global  already stripped Moscow of its coveted investment grade rating on 26 February and Russian bonds were slumping  but a heavier blow followed on 15 March  when the EU told top credit agencies to stop rating Russian dept or risk losing their licenses to operate in the bloc.‚ÄúWe were caught flat-footed  certainly we were not given any advanced warning ‚Äù one senior rating agency analyst said. ‚ÄúBasically the question was  does this mean we can‚Äôt rate Russia any more?‚Äù It turned out the answer was yes.Default deadline oneWith so many hurdles being erected  expectations built that Russia would default on its first post-sanctions‚Äô bond payments either on 16 March  or a month later at the end of a 30-day ‚Äúgrace period.‚ÄùHowever  a special ‚Äúwaiver‚Äù in the US sanctions granted by the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control allowed payments to go through.Unintended consequencesOn 8 April  a week before the EU ban on Russian ratings was due to come into force  S&P declared Russia in ‚Äúselective default‚Äù after Moscow said it planned to make upcoming bond payments in rubles rather than dollars  their issue currency.On 3 May though  shortly before the payment was due  the Kremlin U-turned and paid in dollars.Shock to the systemDays later  Russia had stumbled  though.On 11 May  sharp-eyed creditors spotted that Moscow had failed to add $1.9 million of extra interest that had built up on bonds that only got paid in their grace periods rather than on time. They contacted the clearing house Euroclear and then bond market equivalent of an insurance payment arbiter ‚Äì the Credit Derivative Determinations Committee which ruled that a ‚Äúcredit event‚Äù had happened.The sum was too small to trigger default clauses in all of Russia‚Äôs international bonds  but it did mean some investors expected to receive default insurance payments.But when the US Treasury clarified on its website that buying Russian bonds on the open  or ‚Äòsecondary‚Äô market  was banned  that credit default swap (CDS) insurance process had to be halted as it was no longer clear what to do with the bonds involved.‚ÄúIt is a bit like if your house burns down and the insurance company turns around and claims it was the wrong kind of fire ‚Äù said Joe Delvaux  emerging markets distressed debt portfolio manager at Europe‚Äôs largest fund manager Amundi. ‚ÄúThe reality is that these sanctions are a shock to the system.‚ÄùIntended consequencesThe step that made Russia‚Äôs default unavoidable though was Washington‚Äôs 24 May decision to let the waiver that had allowed US bondholders to receive Russia‚Äôs payments  expire.A week later  the EU also sanctioned Russia‚Äôs domestic paying agent  its National Settlement Depository (NSD)  which it had been using to make the payments.Moscow has blamed the West for forcing an ‚Äúartificial default‚Äù  with its finance minister Anton Siluanov calling the situation a ‚Äúfarce.‚ÄùHowever  veteran global policymakers involved in the process say the sanctions are unprecedented but fully justified.‚ÄúThey were very significant actions that responded to the magnitude of the actions that Russia undertook ‚Äù Agustin Carstens  the head of the world‚Äôs central bank umbrella body  the Bank for International Settlements  said.,negative,0.02,0.22,0.76,mixed,0.03,0.11,0.86,True,English,"['Big Package', 'The', 'Russia', 'one senior rating agency analyst', 'first major international debt default', 'Credit Derivative Determinations Committee', 'central bank umbrella body', 'first post-sanctions‚Äô bond payments', 'international financial messaging system', 'Credit rating agency', 'debt portfolio manager', 'international financial network', 'Default deadline one', 'bond market equivalent', 'investment grade rating', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'largest fund manager', 'domestic paying agent', 'National Settlement Depository', 'veteran global policymakers', 'credit default swap', 'top credit agencies', '30-day ‚Äúgrace period', 'upcoming bond payments', 'Russian central bank', 'one European source', 'S&P Global', 'default insurance payments', 'insurance payment arbiter', 'CDS) insurance process', 'seven Russian banks', 'First cuts', 'International Settlements', 'credit event', 'selective default', 'default clauses', 'artificial default', 'international bonds', 'insurance company', 'top diplomat', 'grace periods', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'Russian troops', 'Russian lenders', 'Russian dept', 'Russian ratings', 'key moments', 'emergency Group', 'Sergei Lavrov', 'cross-border transactions', 'heavier blow', 'advanced warning', 'many hurdles', 'Unintended consequences', 'issue currency', 'sharp-eyed creditors', 'extra interest', 'wrong kind', 'Joe Delvaux', 'emerging markets', 'US bondholders', 'finance minister', 'Anton Siluanov', 'Agustin Carstens', 'Russian bonds', 'big package', 'pivotal moment', 'Swift action', 'SWIFT headquarters', 'five minutes', '10-12 days', 'special ‚Äúwaiver', 'clearing house', 'US Treasury', 'significant actions', 'Western sanctions', 'US sanctions', 'EU meetings', 'EU ban', '24 May decision', '3 May', '11 May', 'century', 'Washington', 'fact', 'Monday', 'June', 'months', 'Moscow', 'cash', 'access', 'summary', 'point', 'The', '2230 GMT', '25 February', 'Ukraine', 'experts', 'Brussels', 'midnight', 'measures', 'response', 'reserves', 'Reuters', 'lot', 'people', 'table', '2 March', 'invasion', 'question', 'move', '26 February', '15 March', 'licenses', 'bloc', 'answer', 'expectations', '16 March', 'Office', '8 April', 'force', 'rubles', 'dollars', 'Kremlin', 'Shock', 'time', 'Euroclear', 'investors', 'website', 'fire', 'Amundi', 'reality', 'step', 'NSD', 'situation', 'magnitude', 'world', '11.30']",2022-06-28,2022-06-29,euractiv.com

7048,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rappler.com/business/big-package-how-russia-driven-default/,The ‚ÄòBig Package‚Äô: How Russia was driven to default,Here is a summary of the key moments that have led to Russia's first foreign debt default since 1918,Here is a summary of the key moments that have led to Russia's first foreign debt default since 1918LONDON  United Kingdom ‚Äì Russia‚Äôs first major international debt default in over a century  which Washington said became a fact on Monday  June 27  follows months of coordinated Western sanctions that left Moscow with cash but no access to the international financial network.Below is a summary of the key moments that have led up to this point.The ‚ÄòBig Package‚ÄôAt around 11:30 pm (2230 GMT) on February 25  the day after Russian troops entered Ukraine  European Union experts in Brussels said a set of sanctions they had worked on for days  or the ‚ÄúBig Package‚Äù as they called it  was ready.Just before midnight  the European Commission announced the measures.While emergency Group of Seven and EU meetings earlier made clear a response was coming  the package named Vladimir Putin and his top diplomat Sergei Lavrov personally  and  as it later became clear  froze some $300 billion of the Russian central bank‚Äôs reserves.‚ÄúThat was really the moment when we said  okay  well we‚Äôve done it ‚Äù one European source told Reuters. ‚ÄúThat was  I think  a very pivotal moment for a lot of people around a table.‚ÄùSWIFT actionDays later  on March 2  the EU struck again by banning seven Russian banks from SWIFT  an international financial messaging system crucial for cross-border transactions.Booting Russian lenders from SWIFT had long been considered a ‚Äúnuclear option ‚Äù but the invasion put it on the table and when the EU decided to activate it  those at SWIFT headquarters just outside Brussels were ready.The only question was how long they had to implement the move  ‚Äúfive days or five minutes?‚Äù another source said. In the end it was 10 to 12 days.First cuts  but not the deepestCredit rating agency S&P Global already stripped Moscow of its coveted investment grade rating on February 26 and Russian bonds were slumping  but a heavier blow followed on March 15  when the EU told top credit agencies to stop rating Russian debt or risk losing their licenses to operate in the bloc.‚ÄúWe were caught flat-footed  certainly we were not given any advanced warning ‚Äù one senior rating agency analyst said. ‚ÄúBasically the question was  does this mean we can‚Äôt rate Russia any more?‚Äù It turned out the answer was yes.Default deadline oneWith so many hurdles being erected  expectations built that Russia would default on its first post-sanctions bond payments either on March 16  or a month later at the end of a 30-day ‚Äúgrace period.‚ÄùHowever  a special ‚Äúwaiver‚Äù in the US sanctions granted by the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control allowed payments to go through.Unintended consequencesOn April 8  a week before the EU ban on Russian ratings was due to come into force  S&P declared Russia in ‚Äúselective default‚Äù after Moscow said it planned to make upcoming bond payments in roubles rather than dollars  their issue currency.On May 3 though  shortly before the payment was due  the Kremlin U-turned and paid in dollars.Shock to the systemDays later  Russia had stumbled  though.On May 11  sharp-eyed creditors spotted that Moscow had failed to add $1.9 million of extra interest that had built up on bonds that only got paid in their grace periods rather than on time. They contacted the clearing house Euroclear and the bond market equivalent of an insurance payment arbiter ‚Äì the Credit Derivative Determinations Committee  which ruled that a ‚Äúcredit event‚Äù had happened.The sum was too small to trigger default clauses in all of Russia‚Äôs international bonds  but it did mean some investors expected to receive default insurance payments.But when the US Treasury clarified on its website that buying Russian bonds on the open  or ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù market  was banned  that credit default swap (CDS) insurance process had to be halted as it was no longer clear what to do with the bonds involved.‚ÄúIt is a bit like if your house burns down and the insurance company turns around and claims it was the wrong kind of fire ‚Äù said Joe Delvaux  emerging markets distressed debt portfolio manager at Europe‚Äôs largest fund manager Amundi. ‚ÄúThe reality is that these sanctions are a shock to the system.‚ÄùIntended consequencesThe step that made Russia‚Äôs default unavoidable though was Washington‚Äôs May 24 decision to let the waiver that had allowed US bondholders to receive Russia‚Äôs payments  expire.A week later  the EU also sanctioned Russia‚Äôs domestic paying agent  its National Settlement Depository (NSD)  which it had been using to make the payments.Moscow has blamed the West for forcing an ‚Äúartificial default ‚Äù with its finance minister Anton Siluanov calling the situation a ‚Äúfarce.‚ÄùHowever  veteran global policymakers involved in the process say the sanctions are unprecedented but fully justified.‚ÄúThey were very significant actions that responded to the magnitude of the actions that Russia undertook ‚Äù Agustin Carstens  the head of the world‚Äôs central bank umbrella body  the Bank for International Settlements  said. ‚Äì Rappler.com,negative,0.02,0.22,0.76,negative,0.01,0.09,0.9,True,English,"['Big Package', 'The', 'Russia', 'one senior rating agency analyst', 'first major international debt default', 'Credit Derivative Determinations Committee', 'central bank umbrella body', 'first foreign debt default', 'first post-sanctions bond payments', 'international financial messaging system', 'Credit rating agency', 'international financial network', 'Foreign Assets Control', 'debt portfolio manager', 'Default deadline one', 'investment grade rating', 'largest fund manager', 'domestic paying agent', 'National Settlement Depository', 'veteran global policymakers', 'bond market equivalent', 'credit default swap', 'European Union experts', 'top credit agencies', '30-day ‚Äúgrace period', 'upcoming bond payments', 'Russian central bank', 'one European source', 'S&P Global', 'insurance payment arbiter', 'CDS) insurance process', 'default insurance payments', 'seven Russian banks', 'First cuts', 'Russian debt', 'International Settlements', 'credit event', 'international bonds', 'selective default', 'default clauses', 'artificial default', 'insurance company', 'European Commission', 'top diplomat', 'grace periods', 'secondary‚Äù market', 'Russian troops', 'Russian lenders', 'Russian ratings', 'key moments', 'United Kingdom', 'emergency Group', 'Sergei Lavrov', 'cross-border transactions', 'heavier blow', 'advanced warning', 'many hurdles', 'Unintended consequences', 'issue currency', 'sharp-eyed creditors', 'extra interest', 'wrong kind', 'Joe Delvaux', 'emerging markets', 'US bondholders', 'finance minister', 'Anton Siluanov', 'Agustin Carstens', 'Russian bonds', 'Big Package', 'pivotal moment', 'SWIFT action', 'SWIFT headquarters', 'five minutes', '10 to 12 days', 'special ‚Äúwaiver', 'clearing house', 'US Treasury', 'significant actions', 'Western sanctions', 'US sanctions', 'EU meetings', 'EU ban', 'May 24 decision', 'summary', 'LONDON', 'century', 'Washington', 'fact', 'Monday', 'June', 'months', 'coordinated', 'Moscow', 'cash', 'access', 'point', '2230 GMT', 'February', 'Ukraine', 'Brussels', 'midnight', 'measures', 'response', 'reserves', 'Reuters', 'lot', 'people', 'table', 'March', 'invasion', 'question', 'move', 'licenses', 'bloc', 'answer', 'expectations', 'Office', 'April', 'force', 'roubles', 'dollars', 'Kremlin', 'Shock', 'time', 'Euroclear', 'investors', 'website', 'fire', 'Amundi', 'reality', 'step', 'NSD', 'situation', 'magnitude', 'world', 'Rappler', '11:30']",2022-06-28,2022-06-29,rappler.com
7049,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,http://en.people.cn/n3/2022/0628/c90000-10116125.html,Opinion: US-led sanctions against Russia spawning 'debt traps',Illustration: Liu Rui/Global Times	Since the Ukraine conflict erupted on February 24  the US,"Opinion: US-led sanctions against Russia spawning 'debt traps'17:46  June 28  2022 By Qing Ming ( People's Daily OnlineIllustration: Liu Rui/Global TimesSince the Ukraine conflict erupted on February 24  the US has taken on a leading role among the bloc of Western nations in imposing sanctions  sending weapons  and dispatching batches of its politicians for a Ukraine tour. Yet  four months into the crisis  Washington is still masterminding behind the scenes  bullets and artillery shells are still flying  and people are still bleeding‚Äînothing appears to have changed  except for skyrocketing oil prices  looming food and energy shortages  and a Russia--together with other world financial institutions--now trapped in ""defaults"" and unpaid debts.A statement from the White House on June 27 has offered fresh clues on the Pyrrhic victory that the US-led sanctions have clinched. According to Reuters  the Biden administration announced Monday that Russia had ""defaulted"" on its international bonds for the first time since the Bolshevik Revolution a century ago.The Kremlin  on the other hand  has clarified that the payments due Sunday had been made  in US dollars and euros  on May 27 and yet the money remained stuck with Euroclear  a clearing house based in Belgium  according to CNN. Despite that  some view such defaults as a win for the US-led ""sanctions bloc "" a victory secured by the effective severance of Russia from the global payments system. Well  think again.A host of experts on global finance have sounded their alarms upon the announcement. ""It's a very  very rare thing  where a government that otherwise has the means is forced by an external government into default "" said Hassan Malik  senior sovereign analyst and expert on emerging market hedge funds.Russia owes $100 million in interest payments on one bond priced in US dollars and another priced in euros  which was originally due for payment on May 27  according to Al Jazeera. With Russia being forcibly decoupled from the global payment systems  it has also been reduced into a state of non-payment  ""an artificial crisis manufactured by the West "" as one analysis put it.For international lenders who lent out the money to Russia  it also presents an unprecedented ""debt trap "" with their money withheld not by the borrower itself but by the ""force majeure"" of the situation  in which their unpaid loans are regarded as ""collateral damage.""The ""Made in the US default"" indicates the destructive consequences that the current US dollar hegemony may bring to others. For the global financial market as a whole  the event offers a chilling lesson: that is  the international financial web  on which global trade and investment have been built  isn't immune to manipulation and weaponization. With the dominance of its currency and the capricious demeanor of a certain superpower  it is no guarantee that similar acts of manipulation or weaponization won't happen in other contexts. In fact  such malpractice is not without precedent. Washington's freezing of nearly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to Afghanistan's central bank last year is reminiscent of just such economic hegemony at work.In any event  the US may argue that its end justifies the means  but that all depends on what end the US is actually harboring. If its end is to see global lenders getting unpaid  the global financial system undermined  and the formation of ""debt traps "" then the US apparently has succeeded.Likewise  Washington may also feel a strong sense of contentment with the roles it has played in ""mediating"" the Ukraine crisis over the years. After four years of isolationism and a disgraceful pullout from Afghanistan  the US finally has seized its chance to rally together its allies and deploy its ""weaponry of strength."" At least that is the standpoint of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken  who said in April that the conflict has only strengthened NATO's ""collective resolve and unity."" But with the passage of time  Washington has increasingly proved its Ukraine solution is nothing but a fig leaf  one that is just for show.As Christopher Caldwell  an American journalist and researcher  wittily and accurately put it in his New York Times guest essay back in May entitled The War in Ukraine May Be Impossible to Stop; And the U.S. Deserves Much of the Blame: ""The United States is making no concessions. That would be to lose face."" And given the high-stakes game now being played  ""the administration is closing off avenues of negotiation and working to intensify the war.""(Web editor: Meng Bin  Bianji)",negative,0.03,0.31,0.66,negative,0.01,0.08,0.91,True,English,"['US-led sanctions', 'debt traps', 'Opinion', 'Russia', 'New York Times guest essay', 'emerging market hedge funds', 'other world financial institutions', 'current US dollar hegemony', 'global financial market', 'Daily Online Illustration', 'skyrocketing oil prices', 'senior sovereign analyst', 'global financial system', 'unprecedented ""debt trap', 'The United States', 'international financial web', 'global payments system', 'global payment systems', 'US-led ""sanctions bloc', 'Global Times', 'economic hegemony', 'other hand', 'other contexts', 'global finance', 'global trade', 'global lenders', 'Web editor', 'US-led sanctions', 'debt traps', 'international bonds', 'The Kremlin', 'international lenders', 'Qing Ming', 'Liu Rui', 'leading role', 'Western nations', 'artillery shells', 'energy shortages', 'unpaid debts', 'White House', 'fresh clues', 'Bolshevik Revolution', 'clearing house', 'effective severance', 'rare thing', 'Hassan Malik', 'interest payments', 'one bond', 'Al Jazeera', 'one analysis', 'force majeure', 'unpaid loans', 'collateral damage', 'destructive consequences', 'chilling lesson', 'capricious demeanor', 'similar acts', 'central bank', 'strong sense', 'disgraceful pullout', 'Antony Blinken', 'collective resolve', 'fig leaf', 'Christopher Caldwell', 'American journalist', 'U.S.', 'high-stakes game', 'Meng Bin', 'The War', 'Ukraine tour', 'Ukraine solution', 'US dollars', 'US Secretary', 'artificial crisis', 'Pyrrhic victory', 'Biden administration', 'first time', 'external government', 'four years', 'Ukraine crisis', 'Ukraine conflict', 'US default', 'Opinion', 'Russia', 'June', 'People', 'February', 'weapons', 'batches', 'politicians', 'Washington', 'scenes', 'bullets', 'nothing', 'food', 'defaults', 'statement', 'Reuters', 'euros', 'May', 'money', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'CNN', 'win', 'host', 'experts', 'alarms', 'announcement', 'means', 'non', 'borrower', 'situation', 'Made', 'others', 'event', 'investment', 'manipulation', 'weaponization', 'dominance', 'currency', 'superpower', 'guarantee', 'fact', 'malpractice', 'freezing', 'assets', 'Afghanistan', 'work', 'formation', 'contentment', 'roles', 'isolationism', 'chance', 'allies', 'weaponry', 'strength', 'standpoint', 'April', 'NATO', 'unity', 'passage', 'show', 'researcher', 'Blame', 'concessions', 'face', 'avenues', 'negotiation', 'Bianji']",2022-06-28,2022-06-29,en.people.cn

Inc.  Rahway  NJ.  USA  to evaluate the oncolytic virus BT-001 in combination with MSD‚Äôs anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA¬Æ (pembrolizumab) in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for the treatment of patients with solid tumors.Under the terms of the supply agreement  MSD will provide pembrolizumab to be used in combination with BT-001 in the ongoing Phase I/IIa clinical trial.‚ÄúBy combining BT-001 with the anti-PD-1 drug KEYTRUDA¬Æ we expect to optimize the patient‚Äôs immune response to induce a strong and effective anti-tumor response. This agreement will allow us to move further on the clinical development of our promising co-developed oncolytic candidate BT-001‚Äù said Hedi Ben Brahim  CEO of Transgene.‚ÄúWe are very pleased to be signing another collaboration with MSD  supporting the expansion of the clinical trial program of BT-001  the oncolytic virus expressing our proprietary anti-CTLA-4 antibody  jointly developed by Transgene and BioInvent. It marks a further validation of our expanding and promising clinical pipeline of anti-cancer treatments  which currently encompasses three compounds in four ongoing clinical trials‚Äù added Martin Welschof  CEO of BioInvent.Recruitment in the clinical study (NCT04725331) is ongoing. The trial is a Phase I/IIa of BT-001  which is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration between Transgene and BioInvent  as a single agent and in combination with KEYTRUDA¬Æ for the treatment of solid tumors.KEYTRUDA¬Æ is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.  a subsidiary of Merck & Co.  Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA.***About the trialThe ongoing Phase I/IIa (NCT04725331) study is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation trial evaluating BT-001 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 treatment). Patient inclusions are ongoing in Europe (France  Belgium) and the trial has been authorized in the US.This Phase I is divided into two parts. In part A  patients with metastatic/advanced tumors receive single agent  intra-tumoral administrations of BT-001. Part B will explore the combination of intra-tumoral injections of BT-001 with pembrolizumab. The Phase IIa will evaluate the combination regimen in several patient cohorts with different tumor types. These expansion cohorts will offer the possibility of exploring the activity of this approach to treat other malignancies not traditionally addressed with this type of treatment.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene‚Äôs Invir.IO‚Ñ¢ platform and its patented large-capacity VV cop TK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent‚Äôs proprietary n-CoDeR¬Æ/F.I.R.S.T‚Ñ¢ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody will be greatly improved.BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration on oncolytic viruses between Transgene and BioInvent. To know more on BT-001  watch our video here.About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

USA  to evaluate the oncolytic virus BT-001 in combination with MSD's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA¬Æ (pembrolizumab) in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for the treatment of patients with solid tumors.Under the terms of the supply agreement  MSD will provide pembrolizumab to be used in combination with BT-001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial.""We are very pleased to be signing another collaboration with MSD  supporting the expansion of the clinical trial program of BT-001  the oncolytic virus expressing our proprietary anti-CTLA-4 antibody  jointly developed by Transgene and BioInvent. It marks a further validation of our expanding and promising clinical pipeline of anti-cancer treatments  which currently encompasses three compounds in four ongoing clinical trials "" said Martin Welschof  CEO of BioInvent.""By combining BT-001 with the anti-PD-1 drug KEYTRUDA¬Æ we expect to optimize the patient's immune response to induce a strong and effective anti-tumor response. This agreement will allow us to move further on the clinical development of our promising co-developed oncolytic candidate BT-001 "" added Hedi Ben Brahim  CEO of Transgene.Recruitment in the clinical study (NCT04725331) is ongoing. The trial is a phase 1/2a of BT-001  which is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration between BioInvent and Transgene  as a single agent and in combination with KEYTRUDA¬Æ for the treatment of solid tumors. KEYTRUDA¬Æ is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC  a subsidiary of Merck & Co.  Inc.  Rahway  NJ  USA.Story continues***About the trialThe ongoing Phase 1/2a (NCT04725331) study is a multicenter  open label  dose-escalation trial evaluating BT-001 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 treatment). Patient inclusions are ongoing in Europe (France  Belgium) and the trial has been authorized in the US.This Phase 1 is divided into two parts. In part A  patients with metastatic/advanced tumors receive single agent  intra-tumoral administrations of BT-001. Part B will explore the combination of intratumoral injections of BT-001 with pembrolizumab. The Phase 2a will evaluate the combination regimen in several patient cohorts with different tumor types. These expansion cohorts will offer the possibility of exploring the activity of this approach to treat other malignancies not traditionally addressed with this type of treatment.About BT-001BT-001 is an oncolytic virus generated using Transgene's Invir.IO‚Ñ¢ platform and its patented large-capacity VVcopTK-RR- oncolytic virus  which has been engineered to encode both a Treg-depleting human recombinant anti-CTLA-4 antibody generated by BioInvent's proprietary n-CoDeR¬Æ/F.I.R.S.T‚Ñ¢ platforms  and the human GM-CSF cytokine. By selectively targeting the tumor microenvironment  BT-001 is expected to elicit a much stronger and more effective antitumoral response. As a consequence  by reducing systemic exposure  the safety and tolerability profile of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody may be greatly improved.BT-001 is being co-developed as part of a 50/50 collaboration between Transgene and BioInvent.

(NASDAQ: VEON) (EuronextAmsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides mobile connectivity and services  today discloses the unaudited...,"Strong YoY growth in underlying Group net profit and resilient cash flow generationAMSTERDAM  June 28  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON) (EuronextAmsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides mobile connectivity and services  today discloses the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for its 1Q22 Group results.Following the release of our 1Q22 trading update on 28 April 2022  and given the unprecedented challenges and market volatility that VEON has been facing  we have now completed our 1Q22 financial statements  which further support the resilient performance we reported with our trading update.VEON ended 1Q22 with revenue of USD 1 823 million  +9.8% YoY in local currency (-0.4% YoY in reported currency) and EBITDA of USD 771 million  +5.3% YoY in local currency (-4.5% YoY in reported currency). VEON posted a 1Q22 net loss of USD 97 million  while the Group's net profit before impairments rose 168% YoY to USD 375 million  versus USD 140 million in 1Q21. In 1Q22 Group capex was USD 377 million (-3.8% YoY)  with capex intensity of 23.3%  -2.1 p.p. YoY. Group net debt/EBITDA was 2.4x as of 31 March 2022.Commenting on results  Kaan Terzioƒülu said:""The 1Q22 financial statements published today further reinforce VEON Group's strong underlying performance driven by the successful implementation of our digital operator strategy across all our geographies  where we continue to deliver vital connectivity and digital services. Net profit before impairments rose by 168% YoY  while cash from operating activities of USD 565 million demonstrates the high resilience of our business even in difficult times. Our 1Q22 results  together with our strong performance in April and May  show VEON's ongoing and effective operational and financial discipline  as well as the progress we continue to make delivering on our strategy.""1Q22 Financial StatementsFollowing the 1Q22 trading update on 28 April 2022  VEON today reports the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for 1Q22. VEON posted a 1Q22 net loss of USD 97 million  while the Group's net profit before impairments rose 168% YoY to USD 375 million. Cash from operating activities in 1Q22 was USD 565 million  versus USD 596 million in 1Q21  highlighting continued strong cashflow generation across the operations.Story continuesIn 1Q22 we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment of USD 449 million against Beeline in Russia. This is primarily caused by a higher discount factor to be used for future cashflows related to our Russian operations  in accordance with IFRS. In 1Q22  Ukraine showed resilient strong operational performance  which was also previously disclosed in our 1Q22 trading update. We did  however  record a fixed asset impairment of USD 20 million in 1Q22 related to property  plant and equipment of Kyivstar as a result of the physical damage to sites caused by the ongoing conflict. Including the impact of the impairments  VEON reported a 1Q22 net loss of USD 97 million with shareholder equity of USD 227 million as of 31 March 2022.Since reporting the strong 1Q22 results  operational momentum has continued across the Group  driven by successful implementation of our digital operator strategy  as noted in our CEO letter published on 10 June 2022. Our double and multiplay 4G subscribers have reached 35% of the Group's monthly active customer base. This supported continued high single-digit local currency year-on-year growth in the Group's service revenues  both in April and May. We continue to make market share gains across a number of markets including Ukraine  Pakistan  Kazakhstan  Bangladesh and Uzbekistan.The 1Q22 trading update  the CEO Letter and the 1Q22 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are available on the VEON Group website at https://www.veon.com/investors/reports-results/reports-results/ and https://www.veon.com/media/media-releases/2022/from-veon-ceo-key-developments-update-for-investors-and-partners/.About VEONVEON is a NASDAQ and Euronext Amsterdam-listed global provider of connectivity and digital services  headquartered in Amsterdam.

The European Commission (EC) has...,"Sanofi - Aventis GroupeXenpozyme¬Æ (olipudase alfa) approved by European Commission as first and only treatment for ASMDParis  June 28  2022. The European Commission (EC) has approved Xenpozyme¬Æ (olipudase alfa) as the first and only enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non-Central Nervous System (CNS) manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD) in pediatric and adult patients with ASMD type A/B or ASMD type B. The approval is based on positive data from the ASCEND and ASCEND-Peds clinical trials  in which Xenpozyme showed substantial and clinically relevant improvement in lung function (as measured by diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide  or DLco) and reduction of spleen and liver volumes  with a well-tolerated safety profile. Given the urgent unmet medical needs of the ASMD community  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted Xenpozyme PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation. Xenpozyme has also received special breakthrough designations from several other regulatory agencies around the world.John Reed  M.D.  Ph.DExecutive Vice President  Global Head of Research and Development  Sanofi‚ÄúThe ASMD community has waited many years for a treatment for this rare and debilitating genetic disease. The approval of Xenpozyme by the European Commission represents a transformational shift in what we can offer to patients  demonstrated by the clinically important improvements across major manifestations of ASMD and the sustained effects noted over longer term treatment.‚ÄùASMD is an extremely rare  progressive genetic disease with significant morbidity and mortality  especially among infants and children  as many pediatric patients will not survive to adulthood. Signs and symptoms of ASMD may include enlarged spleen or liver  difficulty breathing  lung infections  and unusual bruising or bleeding  among other disease manifestations. Current management of the disease includes palliative and supportive care to manage the symptoms.Story continuesXenpozyme is an enzyme replacement therapy designed to replace deficient or defective acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)  an enzyme that allows for the breakdown of the lipid sphingomyelin. In individuals with ASMD  the insufficient amount of the ASM enzyme means sphingomyelin is poorly metabolized  potentially leading to lifelong accumulation inand damage to multiple organs.Maurizio Scarpa  M.D.  Ph.DUniversity Hospital of Udine  Italy‚ÄúWe welcome the European Union approval of Xenpozyme as the first and only disease-specific therapy for ASMD with a potential to oppose disease progression. This is a significant milestone for individuals living with ASMD  a disease associated with substantial morbidity and risk of premature death.‚ÄùApproval based on positive results from two clinical trials in children and adultsASCENDThe ASCEND trial randomized 36 adult patients with ASMD type A/B or type B to receive Xenpozyme or placebo for 52 weeks (primary analysis)  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug. The study demonstrated that Xenpozyme improved lung function  assessed as the percent change from baseline to week 52 in predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco)  and reduced spleen size  evaluated as percent change from baseline in multiples of normal (MN) spleen volume.Patients treated with Xenpozyme had improvement in DLco from baseline to week 52 of 22% compared to 3% for the patients in the placebo group. The difference between the two treatment arms (19%) was statistically significant (p=0.0004).Patients treated with Xenpozyme had reduction in spleen size by 39.5% at week 52 compared to increase by 0.5% for the patients in the placebo group. The difference between the two treatment arms (40%) was statistically significant (p<0.0001).All ASCEND patients treated with Xenpozyme showed improvement in one or both primary endpoints (DLco and spleen size reduction).The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar in patients receiving Xenpozyme to that in patients receiving placebo. There were five serious AEs in the Xenpozyme arm and 11 in the placebo arm  none of which was treatment-related. There were no AEs that led to treatment discontinuation or study withdrawal. The most common AEs in the ASCEND trial were headache  nasopharyngitis  upper respiratory tract infection  cough  and arthralgia.ASCEND-PedsThe single-arm ASCEND-Peds trial studied 20 pediatric patients with ASMD type A/B or type B who all received Xenpozyme  with a primary objective of evaluating the safety and tolerability of Xenpozyme for 64 weeks. All patients completed the study and continued in an extension trial. The ASCEND-Peds study also explored efficacy endpoints of progressive lung disease and of spleen and liver enlargement. After one year of treatment (52 weeks)  the percent predicted DLco mean increase from baseline was 33% in nine patients who were able to perform the test at baseline (children over the age of five were assessed if they were able to perform the test). Additionally  the spleen volume mean decrease was 49% compared to baseline.Over the 64-week treatment period  all ASCEND-Peds patients experienced at least one AE  which were mostly mild and moderate. Five treatment-related serious AEs were observed in three patients: two cases of transient  asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase in one patient  one case each of urticaria and rash in one patient  and one anaphylactic reaction in one patient. No patients had to permanently discontinue treatment due to an AE. The most common AEs in the ASCEND-Peds trial were pyrexia  cough  vomiting  nasopharyngitis  diarrhea  headache  upper respiratory tract infection  contusion  abdominal pain  nasal congestion  rash  urticaria  scratch  and epistaxis.About XenpozymeXenpozyme¬Æ (olipudase alfa) is an enzyme replacement therapy designed to replace deficient or defective acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)  an enzyme that allows for the breakdown of sphingomyelin. Accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells can cause harm to the lungs  spleen  and liver  as well as other organs  potentially leading to early death. Xenpozyme has been evaluated in pediatric and adult patients to treat non-CNS manifestations of ASMD type A/B and ASMD type B. Xenpozyme has not been studied in patients with ASMD type A.In March 2022  Xenpozyme was approved in Japan under the SAKIGAKE (or ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù) designation  marking the first approval for olipudase alfa anywhere in the world. In the United States  where olipudase alfa received Breakthrough Therapy designation  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently reviewing olipudase alfa‚Äôs Biologics License Application (BLA)  with a target action date for the FDA decision (PDUFA date) anticipated for October 2022.About ASMDHistorically known as Niemann-Pick disease types A  A/B  and B  ASMD is a rare  progressive  and potentially life-threatening genetic disease. ASMD represents a spectrum of disease  with two types that may represent opposite ends of a continuum referred to as ASMD type A and ASMD type B. ASMD type A/B is an intermediate form that includes varying degrees of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people‚Äôs lives.

Nexviadyme is the first and only newly approved medicine for Pompe disease in Europe since 2006  when the European Commission authorized the marketingof alglucosidase alfa  branded Myozyme¬Æ.Benedikt Schoser  MD.Senior Consultant and Professor  Friedrich-Baur-Institute  Department of Neurology  Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich‚ÄúThe approval of Nexviadyme in Europe to treat Pompe disease is backed by a robust body of evidence showing clinically meaningful improvements that can impact quality of life. The totality and rigor of the data is particularly noteworthy given the complexities of research and development for such a rare and progressive condition. Nexviadyme‚Äôs demonstrated clinical benefit and molecular innovation bring a new treatment option to people living with Pompe disease who continue to face unmet needs.‚ÄùAddressing an unmet need for people living with Pompe diseasePompe disease can present as infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD)  the most severe form of the disease with rapid onset in infancy  or late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD)  which progressively damages muscles over time. If left untreated  IOPD can lead to heart failure and death within the first year of life  while people with LOPD may require mechanical ventilation to help with breathing or a wheelchair to assist with mobility as the disease progresses.Story continuesNexviadyme now approved in many countries around the worldNexviadyme is approved in multiple markets around the world for the treatment of certain people living with Pompe disease  including the European Union  the United States  Japan  Canada  Switzerland  Australia  Brazil  Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates. Outside of Europe  the treatment is marketed under the brand name Nexviazyme. In the U.S. and Japan  the majority of the Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa)-treated population has started  or is in the process of starting  treatment with Nexviazyme (avalglucosidase alfa).In November 2021  Sanofi announced that as part of the European Medicines Agency‚Äôs (EMA) review of Nexviadyme  the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued an opinion that the therapy does not qualify as a New Active Substance (NAS). In April 2022  the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Product (COMP) also recommended Nexviadyme be removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products (OMP).Sanofi strongly disagrees with both opinions and believes these conclusions were the result of an erroneous and very narrow interpretation of the NAS and OMP principles that demonstrate molecular innovation and clinical benefit. Sanofi stands by the totality of data in support of Nexviadyme as a potential new standard of care and is concerned that such narrow interpretation will undermine rare disease incentive mechanisms in Europe. We believe withholding these distinct designations could negatively impact patient health in Europe by restricting access to innovative advancements in care.Bill SiboldExecutive Vice President  Specialty Care  Sanofi‚ÄúFor more than two decades  we‚Äôve been working with the community and leveraging our scientific expertise to improve care for people living with Pompe disease. We strongly believe in the meaningful clinical benefits of this medicine as a new standard of care and will work hard to ensure the broadest possible access in Europe despite the European Commission‚Äôs failure to recognize Nexviadyme‚Äôs NAS and OMP designations. We call on patient advocacy groups  policymakers  clinicians and patients to join us in our efforts to ensure innovative treatments are appropriately recognized and made available to patients in Europe and beyond.‚ÄùNexviadyme  a new ERT for late-onset Pompe disease and infantile-onset Pompe DiseasePositive outcomes in key disease burden measuresIn a robust clinical development program  Nexviadyme demonstrated clinically meaningful differences in key areas of disease burden for people living with late-onset Pompe disease and infantile-onset Pompe disease.Results from the COMET study comparing Nexviadyme to alglucosidase alfa in LOPD at 49 weeks included:Patients treated with Nexviadyme showed a 2.9% improvement from baseline (SE=0.9) in forced vital capacity (FVC) percent-predicted  a key measure of respiratory function and the study‚Äôs primary endpoint  which was 2.4% points greater as compared to the change with alglucosidase alfa. This difference exceeded the non-inferiority margin (p=0.0074; 95% CI  -0.13  4.99). Statistical superiority was narrowly missed (p=0.06).Patients treated with Nexviadyme walked 32.2 meters farther (SE=9.9) compared to baseline in the 6-minute walk test (6MWT)  a key secondary endpoint  which was 30 meters farther (p=0.040; 95% CI  1.33  58.69) than the change with alglucosidase alfa. Formal statistical testing for all secondary endpoints was not conducted.Results from the Mini-COMET study evaluating Nexviadyme in IOPD patients showed improvement or stabilization at six months in efficacy outcomes  the trial‚Äôs secondary objective  of gross motor function measure (GMFM-88)  quick motor function test (QMFT)  pediatric evaluation of disability index (Pompe-PEDI)  left ventricular mass z-score (LVMZ)  and eyelid position measurements in patients previously declining or insufficiently controlled with alglucosidase alfa.A pooled safety analysis from four clinical studies found serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with Nexviadyme included chills (1.4%)  headache  dyspnoea  respiratory distress  nausea  skin discoloration  chest discomfort  pyrexia  blood pressure increased  body temperature increased  heart rate increased  and oxygen saturation decreased (0.7% each). Additionally  hypersensitivity reactions (43.5%)  anaphylaxis (1.4%) and infusion-associated reactions (26.1%) were reported. The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (>5%) were pruritus (9.4%)  rash (8%)  headache (7.2%)  urticaria (6.5%)  fatigue (6.5%)  nausea (5.8%)  and chills (5.1%).Mechanism of action designed for increased uptakePeople living with Pompe disease have low levels of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)  which results in build-up of glycogen  leading to irreversible damage to skeletal and cardiac muscles. Nexviadyme is specifically designed to target the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor  the key pathway for cellular uptake of ERT and transport to the lysosome  and has an average 15-fold higher level of M6P moieties as compared to alglucosidase alfa. Nexviadyme aims to help improve uptake and enhance glycogen clearance in target tissues as compared to alglucosidase alfa  which was used as the comparator arm in the pivotal Phase 3 COMET study.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people‚Äôs lives.

Its founders‚Äô past investments have focused on start-ups that tackle climate change  aim to improve health care  foster equal opportunities and modernise governance.Tamkivi was an early executive at Skype before he co-founded the digital nomad tool Teleport  which was sold to the talent mobility platform Topia in 2017.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already seen the real impact a well-funded start-up scene can have on economies in small countries like Estonia ‚Äì now it is time to scale this GDP level impact across the whole of Europe "" he said.Among the other founders is Hogarth  who co-founded SongKick which was sold to Warner Music in 2017. Heloui is a former chief executive of German games developer Bigpoint  which was sold to Youzu in 2016.Between them  Hogarth  Heloui  Tamkivi and Hinrikus have founded four start-ups - Wise  Songkick  Teleport and Certific - and helped build three companies  including Skype  Bigpoint and Topia.All four founders have also been investing for years as business angels in the tech sector. Companies in their portfolio include Deliveroo  Hopin  Pipedrive  Chorus  Uber  Zego and Bolt.As Plural  they have already invested in 14 companies including rental furniture start-up Feather  NFTport (an NFT infrastructure company)  energy storage company Field  metaverse company Ready Player Me and student banking challenger MOS.",neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,mixed,0.32,0.07,0.61,True,English,"['new ‚Ç¨250 million start-up fund Plural', 'European tech scene', 'Entrepreneurs', 'French president Emmanuel Macron', 'pan-European stock exchange Euronext', 'traditional venture capital model', 'energy storage company Field', 'rental furniture start-up Feather', 'money transfer company Wise', 'venture capital funds', 'early-stage financing rounds', 'financial market turbulences', 'innovative semi-conductor plants', 'digital nomad tool', 'talent mobility platform', 'German games developer', 'Ready Player Me', 'student banking challenger', 'NFT infrastructure company', 'technology chip industry', 'new technology segment', 'GDP level impact', 'former chief executive', '‚Ç¨250 million funding platform', 'former start-up founders', 'next five years', 'Four European entrepreneurs', 'leading tech companies', 'metaverse company', 'start-up ecosystems', 'start-up scene', 'technology sector', 'European Union', 'early executive', 'real impact', 'next generation', 'four founders', 'tech entrepreneurs', 'tech sector', 'tech scene', '10 tech giants', 'scar tissue', 'best way', 'United States', 'successful generation', 'active role', 'scalable network', 'important missions', 'past investments', 'climate change', 'health care', 'equal opportunities', 'small countries', 'Warner Music', 'four start-ups', 'business angels', 'other founders', 'tech start-ups', 'Taavet Hinrikus', 'world-leading companies', 'three companies', 'asset managers', 'other investors', 'Ian Hogarth', 'Khaled Heloui', 'Sten Tamkivi', '14 companies', 'continent', 'decades', 'experience', 'scratch', 'Plural', 'launch', 'midst', 'statement', 'craft', 'move', 'February', 'rules', 'visibility', 'ASML', 'DeepMind', 'Arm', 'potential', 'builders', 'website', 'peers', 'governance', 'Skype', 'Teleport', 'Topia', 'economies', 'Estonia', 'time', 'SongKick', 'Bigpoint', 'Youzu', 'Certific', 'portfolio', 'Deliveroo', 'Hopin', 'Pipedrive', 'Chorus', 'Uber', 'Zego', 'Bolt', 'NFTport', 'MOS']",2022-06-28,2022-06-29,euronews.com

The government gets to use the proceeds from the purchase for its expenses and agrees to periodically pay interest payments to the investor. After maturity of the bond  the government returns the initial sale price ‚Äî the principal investment ‚Äî to creditors and the debt dissolves.Screenshot of the Russian bond that lapsed on SundayWhat counts as default is stipulated in the legal fine print. Each government bond comes as a long legal document  in the case of one of the Russian bonds in question 143 pages of text. This document  seen by DW  defines seven events of default. Most pressing: Nonpayment.Did Russia default?Even though Moody's declared Russia in default  the legal documents present a messy picture. Speaking on the condition of anonymity  a capital markets lawyer in London told DW that at the very least Russia hasn‚Äôt ""complied with their obligations under the contract.""With regard to what ""nonpayment"" means in the legal documents  the lawyer said: ""Can someone fail to pay if they have actually done all there is to do within their control to make the payment ... and ensure the relevant funds leave the relevant account?""Legally  courts will decide whether the country defaulted. But how can money be paid but not received?Did Russia pay its creditors?The inner workings of international finance are intricate. At least one investor had knowledge of a payment sent but not received  US business newspaper The Wall Street Journal reported this week. And Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told reporters in Moscow last week that Russia has done everything ""to lead the horse to water. But it's not up to us whether it wants to drink or not.""Because of the US-led sanctions regime  the international channels of sending payments aren't open for Russia anymore. In such a transaction multiple agents are involved like paying agents  who send the funds to clearing institutions which handle interest payments for debtors and creditors.The lapsed Russian bonds were to be cleared through Euroclear or Clearstream ‚Äî two private companies that offer such services but which are currently barred from clearing Russian payments as a result of sanctions.Instead  Russia's Finance Ministry said it had transferred interest payments to a Euroclear account in the Russian settlement system  the National Settlement Depository (NSD). Under normal circumstances  Euroclear would have then transferred the money into its own system and then to the depository banks that have accounts with Euroclear and finally to the bondholders. But Euroclear is not allowed to process any further.""So technically speaking the money is no longer in an account of the Russian Federation  but it's already in an account that doesn't belong to the Russian Federation  and the Russian Federation cannot take the money back "" the capital markets lawyer said  assuming the money ""is somewhere stuck in the plumbing.""Russia has precautions against seizure of assetsCountries have defaulted in the past. Argentina defaulted nine times in the past 200 years. During a period of default in December 2013  the Latin American country was unsure about its assets.Bond holders can seize a defaulted debtor's assets  which was why Argentina's government chartered a British plane for then President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to visit Asia and the Middle East. This way the government's jet wasn't on the line.""I suspect  remembering what happened with Argentina  that the Americans would be keen to have creditors chasing Russian assets all over the world "" Paul McNamara  an emerging-market fund manager at GAM  told the Wall Street Journal.But Russia's default is different. Not only is there a willingness to service the debt. The two bonds breached on Sunday lack one feature usually present in such documents: a waiver of immunity.""There is money  and there is also the readiness to pay "" Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov saidUsually  governments grant creditors the ability to sue them. The Russian bonds issued in 2016 and 2021 have no such clause. An investigation posted to Harvard Law School Bankruptcy Roundtable found  there are legal ways around this hurdle. It concludes  investors in Russian bonds should organize themselves and force legal action.What's at stake for Russia with default?As of now  Moscow's coffers are filled with euros and dollars from commodities exports and funding isn't an issue. But in the future Russia may want to borrow from outside of its borders again  for example from China.Being declared in default is a problem because investors aren't keen on lending to defaulters. As of now  international lenders are mostly scared away from lending to Russia as they fear to entangle themselves in the Western sanctions regime.But  even if Russia were to find allies to the east  it would come at a cost  Timothy Ash  an economist at BlueBay Asset Management  told DW. ""I think Chinese entities will look at Russia very differently if it's in default. ... If they want to still lend to Russia  they will charge a high premium for that "" he said.Edited by: Uwe Hessler",negative,0.01,0.12,0.87,negative,0.02,0.19,0.79,True,English,"['Russia', 'default', 'investors', 'hit', 'President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner', 'Harvard Law School Bankruptcy Roundtable', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'The Wall Street Journal', 'initial sale price', 'US business newspaper', 'emerging-market fund manager', 'two private companies', 'National Settlement Depository', 'capital markets lawyer', 'The Russian bonds', 'legal fine print', 'US-led sanctions regime', 'Latin American country', 'Missed coupon payment', 'Russian settlement system', 'international ratings agency', 'long legal document', 'future coupon payments', 'international finance', 'Finance Ministry', 'two bonds', 'Russian payments', 'Russian Federation', 'depository banks', 'international channels', 'legal picture', 'legal ways', 'legal action', 'interest payments', 'legal documents', 'principal investment', 'seven events', 'messy picture', 'inner workings', 'multiple agents', 'paying agents', 'normal circumstances', 'British plane', 'Middle East', 'Paul McNamara', 'one feature', 'commodities exports', 'Russian assets', 'Bond holders', 'foreign debt', 'government bonds', 'relevant funds', 'relevant account', 'one investor', 'past 200 years', 'government debt', 'Euroclear account', 'Moody', 'bondholders', 'default', 'statement', 'Monday', 'total', 'status', 'investors', 'proceeds', 'purchase', 'expenses', 'maturity', 'creditors', 'Screenshot', 'Sunday', 'case', 'question', '143 pages', 'text', 'DW', 'Nonpayment', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'London', 'obligations', 'contract', 'regard', 'someone', 'control', 'courts', 'money', 'knowledge', 'reporters', 'Moscow', 'everything', 'horse', 'water', 'transaction', 'institutions', 'debtors', 'lapsed', 'Clearstream', 'services', 'result', 'NSD', 'accounts', 'plumbing', 'precautions', 'seizure', 'Countries', 'Argentina', 'period', 'December', 'Asia', 'jet', 'line', 'Americans', 'world', 'GAM', 'willingness', 'waiver', 'immunity', 'readiness', 'governments', 'ability', 'clause', 'investigation', 'hurdle', 'stake', 'coffers', 'euros', 'dollars', 'funding', 'issue', 'outs']",2022-06-29,2022-06-29,dw.com

In such a transaction multiple agents are involved like paying agents  who send the funds to clearing institutions which handle interest payments for debtors and creditors.The lapsed Russian bonds were to be cleared through Euroclear or Clearstream ‚Äî two private companies that offer such services but which are currently barred from clearing Russian payments as a result of sanctions.Instead  Russia's Finance Ministry said it had transferred interest payments to a Euroclear account in the Russian settlement system  the National Settlement Depository (NSD). Under normal circumstances  Euroclear would have then transferred the money into its own system and then to the depository banks that have accounts with Euroclear and finally to the bondholders. But Euroclear is not allowed to process any further.""So technically speaking the money is no longer in an account of the Russian Federation  but it's already in an account that doesn't belong to the Russian Federation  and the Russian Federation cannot take the money back "" the capital markets lawyer said  assuming the money ""is somewhere stuck in the plumbing.""Russia has precautions against seizure of assetsCountries have defaulted in the past. Argentina defaulted nine times in the past 200 years. During a period of default in December 2013  the Latin American country was unsure about its assets.Bond holders can seize a defaulted debtor's assets  which was why Argentina's government chartered a British plane for then President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to visit Asia and the Middle East. This way the government's jet wasn't on the line.""I suspect  remembering what happened with Argentina  that the Americans would be keen to have creditors chasing Russian assets all over the world "" Paul McNamara  an emerging-market fund manager at GAM  told the Wall Street Journal.But Russia's default is different.

The two bonds breached on Sunday lack one feature usually present in such documents: a waiver of immunity.""There is money  and there is also the readiness to pay "" Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov saidUsually  governments grant creditors the ability to sue them. The Russian bonds issued in 2016 and 2021 have no such clause. An investigation posted to Harvard Law School Bankruptcy Roundtable found  there are legal ways around this hurdle. It concludes  investors in Russian bonds should organize themselves and force legal action.What's at stake for Russia with default?As of now  Moscow's coffers are filled with euros and dollars from commodities exports and funding isn't an issue. But in the future Russia may want to borrow from outside of its borders again  for example from China.Being declared in default is a problem because investors aren't keen on lending to defaulters. As of now  international lenders are mostly scared away from lending to Russia as they fear to entangle themselves in the Western sanctions regime.But  even if Russia were to find allies to the east  it would come at a cost  Timothy Ash  an economist at BlueBay Asset Management  told DW.

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT MAY BE CONTRARY TO THE LAW IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.,"International Petroleum CorporationNOT FOR DISTRIBUTION IN OR TO  OR TO ANY PERSON LOCATED IN OR RESIDING IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE THE ISSUANCE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT IS PROHIBITED BY LAW. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT MAY BE CONTRARY TO THE LAW IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.TORONTO  June 29  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- International Petroleum Corporation (IPC or the Corporation) (TSX  Nasdaq Stockholm: IPCO) is pleased to announce the results of its substantial issuer bid (the Offer) under which it will accept for purchase for cancellation 8 258 064 of its common shares (Shares) at a purchase price of CDN$15.50 (equivalent to approximately SEK 122 as at the expiry date of the Offer) per Share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately CDN$128 million (equivalent to approximately SEK 1 007 million and US$100 million‚Ä¨ as at the expiry date of the Offer). Shares to be purchased under the Offer represent approximately 5.5% of the issued and outstanding Shares as at May 16  2022  the date the Offer was commenced. Immediately following completion of the Offer  there will be 142 707 949 Shares issued and outstanding.Mike Nicholson  IPC‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer  commented: ‚ÄúWe are very pleased to have concluded our first Substantial Issuer Bid in line with our capital allocation framework to materially increase returns to shareholders in a higher oil price environment. IPC will be returning US$100 million to participating shareholders  with our remaining shareholders benefiting from the cancellation of the repurchased shares. We now intend to continue to distribute value to our shareholders by restarting our Normal Course Issuer Bid that has been on hold pending completion of the Offer.‚ÄùBased on the final count by Computershare Investor Services Inc.  the Canadian depositary for the Offer  a total of 8 815 989 Shares were validly deposited to the Offer and not withdrawn  including 100 000 Shares that were tendered through the guaranteed delivery procedure. Payment for the Shares accepted for purchase under the Offer will occur in accordance with the terms of the Offer and applicable securities laws. As the Offer was oversubscribed  shareholders who made auction tenders at a price of CDN$15.50 or less per Share and purchase price tenders are expected to have between approximately 93.7% and 94.7% of their successfully tendered Shares purchased by IPC. The Canadian depositary will return all other Shares tendered and not purchased.Story continuesThe Corporation expects to be eligible to recommence purchases under its normal course issuer bid after all Shares accepted for purchase under the Offer have been taken up.Shareholders who hold Shares directly or indirectly through Swedish central securities depository system maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB (Euroclear) will receive a corresponding amount in Swedish Krona to the purchase price in Canadian dollars  less an amount on account of Canadian withholding taxes. The corresponding amount in Swedish Krona for the purchase price will be determined by Pareto Securities AB  the Swedish manager for the Offer  based on the available market rate on the date the purchase price is converted from Canadian dollars to Swedish Krona. The risk of any fluctuations in such foreign exchange rate  including risks relating to the particular date and time at which funds are converted  will be borne solely by the tendering shareholders who hold Shares directly or indirectly through Euroclear.To assist shareholders in determining the tax consequences of the Offer  IPC estimates that for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) a deemed dividend in the amount of CDN$12.50 per Share will be triggered on the repurchase of each Share  based on the estimated paid-up capital of CDN$3.00 per Share as at the date the Shares are purchased for cancellation. For the purposes of subsection 191(4) of the Income Tax Act (Canada)  the ‚Äúspecified amount‚Äù in respect of each Share is CDN$15.45. Shareholders should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the income tax consequences of the disposition of their Shares under the Offer.Details of the Offer are included in the formal offer to purchase and issuer bid circular dated May 11  2022  as amended by a notice of variation dated June 8  2022  and the amended letter of transmittal and amended notice of guaranteed delivery  which have been filed with the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities and made available  without charge  on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and the Corporation's website at www.international-petroleum.com.The information relating to the Offer contained in this press release is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell Shares.International Petroleum Corp.

Olga Maltseva/APRussia missed a Sunday deadline to pay $100 million in interest on two foreign-currency bonds.It has the money to pay  but sanctions are blocking payments from moving through the global system.Russia last defaulted on its foreign debt in 1918 during the Bolshevik Revolution.Russia has defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in more than a century  as the country can't pay creditors because of sanctions over the war in Ukraine  according to media reports.The country missed a deadline Sunday to pay $100 million in dollar- and euro-denominated interest on two foreign-currency bonds  The Wall Street Journal reported  citing bondholders. Some Taiwanese holders of Russian bonds also did not receive interest due Sunday  Reuters reported  citing two sources.Russia said it had sent the money to Euroclear for distribution to investors  the BBC reported. But the payment is held up there  Bloomberg reported. Euroclear would not say whether the distribution had been blocked and said it followed all sanctions  the BBC report said.In May  the US Treasury ended a key sanctions exemption that allowed Russian sovereign-bond payments to pass through to US investors. In response  Russia said it would start using rubles to pay down dollar-bond payments.Moscow said it had sent the eurobond payments to the country's National Settlement Depository  Reuters reported last week. But the bonds' covenants do not allow for payments in rubles  which means the payments would still be considered a default.It's also unclear how bondholders can access the ruble payments  as Russia's National Settlement Depository has been sanctioned by the European Union.This marks Russia's first default on its foreign debt since 1918  when  during the Bolshevik Revolution  the communist leader Vladimir Lenin repudiated the debt of the czarist era.But Russia isn't defaulting this time around because it doesn't have the money to pay; its finances are holding up well  thanks to soaring energy prices. Instead  the default comes as sweeping US and European Union sanctions are blocking its bond interest payments from moving through the international payments system.Story continuesUp until Sunday  Russia had been making good on its bond payments even amid sweeping sanctions. But markets have been expecting the country to eventually default on its foreign bonds as international trade restrictions intensify.To counter the situation  President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Wednesday to handle payments on foreign bonds under a new program ‚Äî which signals that Moscow considers the interest paid  even when payments are made in rubles  Reuters reported. Russia has about $40 billion in outstanding foreign-currency payments.Russia says it's not a defaultFormal default declarations are typically issued by credit-rating agencies  but the big three agencies ‚Äî S&P  Moody's and Fitch ‚Äî have all withdrawn ratings on Russian entities because of sanctions.Russia has hit back against what it calls a ""force-majeure situation "" with its finance minister  Anton Siluanov  calling the situation a ""farce "" Bloomberg reported Thursday.""Anyone can declare whatever they like "" Siluanov said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg last week. ""But anyone who understands what's going on knows that this is in no way a default.""According to Reuters  a Kremlin spokesperson said Russia made its bond payments in May and that the fact Western sanctions were holding them up at Euroclear was ""not our problem.""Russia may still have until the end of the day Monday to pay up  as there's no exact deadline specified in the bonds' prospectus  lawyers told Reuters.And while Russia may still be able to get the money through the financial institution to bondholders  ""the overwhelming probability is they won't be able to  because no bank is going to move the money "" Jay S. Auslander  a top sovereign-debt lawyer at Wilk Auslander  told The Associated Press.The influence of Russia's debt default on the world's financial systems would be limited  as the country doesn't have extensive financial links globally  Insider's Harry Robertson reported in March.Russia's foreign debts are pretty low compared with the size of its economy  so a default is unlikely to severely affect the country now. However  a default would affect Russia's credit trustworthiness and make it harder for the country to borrow on the international markets.Read more: Buy these 13 cheap stocks that will outperform in a recession-fueled bear market  according to MorningstarRead the original article on Business Insider",negative,0.01,0.08,0.91,mixed,0.07,0.18,0.75,True,English,"['foreign debt', 'first time', 'a century', 'Russia', 'reports', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'The Wall Street Journal', 'communist leader Vladimir Lenin', 'The Associated Press', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'Some Taiwanese holders', 'National Settlement Depository', 'soaring energy prices', 'top sovereign-debt lawyer', 'recession-fueled bear market', 'international trade restrictions', 'big three agencies', 'extensive financial links', 'Jay S.

Two scientific presentations have been accepted  including one non-clinical poster and a late-breaking oral presentation. DBV will also host a symposium and a booth in the congress exhibit hall.The data to be presented will discuss the direct out-of-pocket costs and indirect costs of peanut allergy in households with peanut-allergic children ages 4 to 11 years across Germany  France and the United Kingdom. Additionally  DBV will present an innovative approach to predicting peanut challenge outcomes using a novel Basophil Activation Test (BAT) and serum parameters as a potential biomarker of oral food challenge outcomes. These data can help to inform food allergy diagnosis  and potentially introduce a novel approach to predicting oral food challenge outcomes for patients participating in immunotherapy clinical trials.‚ÄúThe data that we are showcasing at EAACI this year highlight the global burden that food allergy families and patients carry every day ‚Äù said Dr. Pharis Mohideen  Chief Medical Officer of DBV Technologies. ‚ÄúThere is an urgent unmet medical need for food allergy treatment options and innovations in this space  such as predictive biomarkers in clinical trials  that may one day improve quality of life for this population. I am pleased that we will be engaging in robust discussions around these topics.‚ÄùSeparately  DBV is hosting a symposium on ‚ÄúFood Allergies in Europe: Accumulating Evidence‚Äù that will discuss the burden of peanut allergy and the potential of the Viaskin‚Ñ¢ technology. Symposium topics will explore the viability of using Viaskin to treat an array of allergic conditions  including milk  cashew and peanut. Viaskin Peanut (DBV712 250 Œºg) is the Company‚Äôs lead product candidate designed to potentially reduce the risk of allergic reactions in peanut-allergic children ages 4 to 11 years due to accidental exposure to peanuts.

Ipsen is seeking approval of palovarotene  an oral  selective retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RARŒ≥) agonist for the prevention of heterotopic ossification (HO; new bone formation outside of the normal skeletal system). The FDA has assigned 29 December 2022 as the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date  which is on track with anticipated regulatory submission timelines.‚Äú This FDA submission acceptance marks a significant milestone for those living with FOP in the U.S. where no approved treatment options exist today for this progressive and debilitating ultra-rare genetic disorder ‚Äù said Dr. Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development  Ipsen. ‚Äú Ipsen is committed to developing life-changing treatments for patients living with rare diseases despite the challenges that exist when there are few  or no precedents to build on when developing a new  innovative medicine for a complex condition. We remain committed to the FOP community  and we hope the Priority Review is one step closer towards getting a much needed treatment to people living with FOP as soon as possible.‚ÄùThe FDA‚Äôs Priority Review designation is assigned to investigational therapies that  if approved  represent a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment compared to the current standard of care.In January 2022  Health Canada was the first regulatory authority to approve SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules) to reduce the formation of HO in adults and children aged 8 years and above for females and 10 years and above for males with FOP. Sohonos is approved in Canada for the treatment of patients with FOP for both chronic use and for flare-ups in these patient populations. Palovarotene is not currently approved outside of Canada. A Marketing Authorization Application for palovarotene has also been filed in the E.U. in 2021  with responses to questions raised by the European Medicines Agency submitted in June 2022  in line with the ongoing regulatory process. Ipsen anticipates additional applications to other regulatory agencies in due course.FOP has an estimated prevalence of 1.36 per million individuals; however  the number of confirmed cases varies by country.1 2 It is characterized by new bone formation outside of the normal skeletal system  like in soft connective tissues  a process known as HO [3] which can be preceded by painful soft-tissue swelling or ‚Äôflare-ups‚Äô.2 Flare-up episodes are common and are a substantial contributor to the formation of new HO  however HO can form in the absence of a flare-up. HO  once formed  is irreversible and leads to loss of mobility and shortened life expectancy.3# # #About palovarotenePalovarotene is an oral investigational  selective retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RARŒ≥) agonist being developed as a potential treatment for people living with the debilitating ultra-rare genetic disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Palovarotene  which received rare pediatric disease and Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the potential treatment of FOP  was acquired by Ipsen through the acquisition of Clementia Pharmaceuticals in April 2019. The palovarotene New Drug Application (NDA) was initially accepted by the FDA for Priority Review on May 28  2021  and Ipsen announced withdrawal of the NDA on August 13  2021. The resubmission of the palovarotene NDA has been accepted by the FDA for Priority Review in the U.S.About fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP)Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an ultra-rare genetic disorder characterized by bone that forms outside the normal skeleton  in muscles  tendons  or soft tissue.3 FOP has an estimated prevalence of 1.36 per million individuals globally; however  the number of confirmed cases varies by country.1 2 The median age at time of FOP diagnosis is five years old.4About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

For more information visit www.ipsen.com.Ipsen‚Äôs forward looking statementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen‚Äôs management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen‚Äôs business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers.

The next phase of the project will be completed in three equal phases of 100MW each  and Phase 2a will supply up to 40 tons per day of green hydrogen and is scheduled to be online in 2025. Phase 1 of the project  a 20MW electrolyser which is currently under construction  will supply 8 tons per day of green hydrogen  is scheduled to be commissioned in 4th Quarter 2022 and will represent Europe‚Äôs largest electrolyzer in operation.Crossbridge operates the Fredericia  Denmark refinery  which supplies 35 percent of the total Danish liquid fuel consumption as well as supplies Northern Europe. Crossbridge has made substantial progress on its ambitions for a greener future  including successfully co-processing biogenic feedstock in February 2022; the signing of Everfuel Phase 2 is the next step towards the realization of its energy transition ambitions.Everfuel Phase 2 is the second of three phases anticipated for the HySynergy  which will bring over 1 000 MW of clean energy to Fredericia and surrounding areas. The HySynergy plant will enable the production of biofuels such as Renewable Diesel (‚ÄúRD‚Äù)  and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (‚ÄúSAF‚Äù)  along with supporting hydrogen mobility.Crossbridge and Everfuel have also jointly agreed to further develop opportunities with external parties for the supply of excess oxygen and heat from the hydrogen plant in order to maximize the overall efficiency of the operations.‚ÄúHydrogen is the key to unlocking the full potential of green fuels. With Crossbridge Energy‚Äôs refinery and the Everfuel‚Äôs HySynergy project  we are now taking a significant leap toward more sustainable fuels as we aim to replace our fossil fuels sourced hydrogen used in the manufacturing process with sustainable green hydrogen. We are also starting the next part of the Danish Power to X (‚ÄúPtX‚Äù) journey generating renewable fuels from green power ‚Äù says Finn Schousboe  CEO at Crossbridge Energy A/S.‚ÄùReaching an agreement on the commercial terms is  of course  crucial for the continuous development of the second phase of HySynergy. The partnership with Crossbridge Energy has always run smoothly  and we look forward to continuing to collaborate on building the large-scale PtX facility  which will be a game-changer in the energy transition. But first of all  we look forward to being in operation on the first phase later this year and deliver the first green hydrogen to our partners and our stations ‚Äù says Jacob Krogsgaard  CEO at Everfuel.About Crossbridge | crossbridgepartners.comCrossbridge is a leading energy platform with an environmental focus on developing and driving sustainable energy solutions.

The study  titled Epic Travel Experiences of the Thrifty Traveler  unpacks the motivations and desires of budget travelers who seek and craft epic travel experiences in the face of rising ticket prices  high fuel costs  and inflation.Travel brands need to understand how best to navigate these dynamics so that they engage with their audiences in the most targeted and meaningful way. The study explores the new mindset of these thrifty Gen Z and millennial travelers  and it seeks to define the new ‚Äúessentials‚Äù of what constitutes a rewarding travel experience for them.For two years  consumers were immersed in safety precautions that kept them closer to home. But now  as travelers emerge from COVID-19 lockdowns and mandates  the travel industry anticipates what some call the summer of ‚Äúrevenge travel ‚Äù with bookings already booming despite economic headwinds. There is no denying that changing consumer attitudes and behaviors  coupled with 40-year high inflation  have transformed the travel landscape. In turn  motivations around travel  the way consumers approach their planning  and their expectations of the experience have changed irrevocably.True immersion doesn‚Äôt have a hefty price tagA major shift in the travel landscape includes the perception of a ‚Äúmemorable experience.‚Äù Gone are the days of a 5-star luxury hotel stay to convey one‚Äôs vacation status. Instead  consumers today look at the holistic travel experience to determine its worth. The study found that 75% of respondents say the trips they value the most are ones that do not cost a lot of money. Further  40% are willing to spend half or more of their travel budget on a highly curated moment or experience. Forty-seven percent of travelers  and 55% of Gen Z specifically  say that spending a lot of money on a trip could even dilute a more immersive and authentic experience.In fact  with extended remote work policies  75% of people are open to a digital nomad lifestyle  and 42% want the opportunity to ‚Äúlive‚Äù in a new place  rather just visit it. Further  40% of travelers expect to forge a connection with the local culture and community while 87% say stumbling upon an activity on a trip is more rewarding than planning for it.Consumers want personalized experiences that create stories to tellAll travelers agree that it is important to have a personalized journey  regardless of budget. According to the Razorfish study  two in five respondents stated that the purpose of a trip is  ‚Äúto capture a singular  epic moment ‚Äù while 90% of respondents believe the most important keepsake from a trip is a story to tell about it. But  today‚Äôs travelers also value personal enrichment: 79% believe that traveling isn‚Äôt about getting to a new place  it‚Äôs about how you grow as a result of the journey.No two travelers are alikeDespite a common desire for bespoke  curated experiences  generational differences emerge when it comes to emotional drivers: 43% of respondents (52% of Gen Z) want to get out of their comfort zone and 39% (50% of Gen Z) want a sense of risk and excitement while traveling. Gen Z specifically seeks out a sense of suffering  with 64% (42% overall) saying the more complicated the journey (e.g.  multi-leg) to arrive at a destination  the better.The study also found marked gender differences in how men and women get their travel inspiration. For example  73% of women (vs. 55% of men) seek travel inspiration from friends  family  and coworkers  and 24% of men turn to news sites (vs. 14% of women). Gender also plays a role when it comes to:Lodging: 66% of women are more likely to stay in an Airbnb while 38% of men prefer an all-inclusive resortExperiences: 58% of men say the purpose of a trip is to capture a singular epic moment vs. 28% or womenTransportation: 38% of men will splurge on transportation vs. 68% of women who are more cost-conscious‚ÄúThe public health  cultural  geo-political  and economic shifts over the past few years have undeniably transformed the travel industry ‚Äù said Malavika Rao  Senior Director  Brand Strategy at Razorfish. ‚ÄúPent-up travel demand and rising inflation have created a unique confluence for travel brands. As individuals re-enter the world of travel  brands need to understand how to best leverage their resources to create the most valuable engagements and experiences that align with evolving traveler expectations despite today‚Äôs macro pressures.‚Äù‚ÄúConsumers today view themselves as a traveler instead of a tourist‚Äîthe term traveler carries cachet ‚Äù said Julie Arbit  Global SVP  Insights at VICE Media Group. ‚ÄúThis view is due to the numerous global events over the past two years that have had an effect on consumers‚Äô expectations and desires around travel. Gone are the days of mundane travel--for business or leisure--and instead  consumers now look for spontaneity and excitement in their adventures. Travel brands that provide the opportunity for consumers to step outside of their comfort zones will come out on top at the end of this busy summer season.‚ÄùTravel brands need to understand how to navigate the evolving landscape and meet the shifting priorities of today‚Äôs travelers. With this in mind  Razorfish recommends that brands remember:No two travelers are alike: Understand where needs converge and diverge  and personalize your experience to different travel segments. Elevate the experience: Sell the benefit  not just the journey. Keep it 100% authentic: Think like a local  market like a local. Travel choices are influenced by culture: Understand the true sources of inspiration and intersect them in the moment. Stories are the ultimate currency: Ensure there are ample opportunities for people to write their own. Reimagine the value exchange of travel: Entertainment is short-lived; enrichment and transformation are forever.Note to Editor: The full study  Epic Travel Experiences of the Thrifty Traveler  is available on razorfish.com  and publishable images can be downloaded here.MethodologyRazorfish and VICE Media Group conducted two phases of research in the US. During Phase 1  Razorfish conducted 12 one-hour IDIs with members of VICE and Refinery29‚Äôs online communities  VICE Voices and Mad Chatter. These participants had traveled within the month leading up to the interviews and classified their trip as low budget/cost-conscious. Phase 2  February 4 - February 21  2022  consisted of an online survey. Razorfish quantified learnings using an online survey that included 548 Gen Z and Millennial VICE and Refinery29 audience members. These respondents were recent travelers and incorporated elements of low budget/cost-conscious travel in their trips. The budget element was important to carry through both phases in order to illustrate how to create accessible epic experiences at any price point.Of the 12 budget travelers interviewed  100% were millennials and 50% female  50% male. Of the 548 budget travelers surveyed  25% were Gen Z and 75% millennials; 53% were female  47% male and 3% nonbinary.About RazorfishRazorfish is a global leader in marketing transformation.

With the support ...,"Almost 140 years after the first Orient Express luxury trains changed rail travel forever  the legend continues. Orient Express  artisan of travel since 1883  announces the return of its legendary train and a new and unique format.With the support of Accor and leadership of its Chairman & CEO S√©bastien Bazin  Orient Express has entrusted architect Maxime d'Angeac with a new  crucial  and historic mission: to revive the legend  by reinterpreting the decor of the Nostalgie-Istanbul-Orient-Express. In 2024  just in time for the Paris Olympic Games  the first cars designed in collaboration with the finest French artisans will unveil the new charms of the Orient Express.This contemporary vision of luxury and extreme comfort will invite travelers to relive the legend aboard 17 original Orient Express cars dating from the 1920s-1930s  adorned with exceptional decor. This set of carriages  most recently known as the ""Nostalgie-Istanbul-Orient-Express"" was a dream train-cruise inaugurated in the early 1980s by Swiss tour operator and businessman Albert Glatt  and in which ran between Zurich and Istanbul. Under the name of ‚ÄúExtr√™me-Orient-Express‚Äù the train made the longest journey ever between Paris and Tokyo  before stopping a few years later and disappearing.In 2015  Arthur Mettetal  a researcher specializing in industrial history  conducted a worldwide inventory of the Orient Express for the SNCF. In the course of his research  he discovered the famous cars surprisingly well-preserved. The interiors maintained the same Morrison and Nelson marquetry and Lalique panels  emblematic of Art Deco style. After two years of negotiations  the Nostalgie-Istanbul-Orient-Express was sold to Orient Express. A Dantesque convoy brought the 17 cars - 12 sleeping cars  1 restaurant  3 lounges and 1 van - back to France.Maxime d'Angeac  architect says: ""The rebirth of the Orient Express is a technological challenge  meeting scientific  artistic and technical criteria  where the entire project has been conceived as a work of art. From the nuts and bolts stamped with Orient Express‚Äô signature to the innovative concept of the suites  an exact science of detail will allow travelers to rediscover the great splendor of the Orient Express. Entrusted to the best artisans and decorators specializing in their unique fields  this embassy of French luxury will unveil a setting of absolute refinement  faithful to the art of tailoring. It will be an incomparable train travel experience  imagined through a contemporary vision of comfort and extreme luxury.‚ÄùAbout AccorAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of more than 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

Prospectuses are used for marketing as well as disclosures to prospective investors.Both documents warned that ‚Äúcontinued geopolitical tensions  particularly if they were to result in additional sanctions and retaliatory measures  could have a material adverse impact on the Russian Federation‚Äôs economy  the economies of the other countries involved  and global economic conditions‚Äù.Russia missed a key deadline over the weekend to pay $100 million (‚Ç¨94.6 million) of interest payments owed on the two bonds  as sanctions imposed in the wake of the country‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in late February made it impossible for it to get the money to international creditors.Ratings agency Moody‚Äôs said the missed payments ‚Äì following a 30-day period of grace after the interest fell due in late May ‚Äì constituted a default under its definition  adding that the Kremlin would also likely default on future bond payments.Russia‚Äôs last sovereign default occurred in 1998  during the nation‚Äôs financial collapse and rouble devaluation led to then president Boris Yeltsin‚Äôs government reneging on $40 billon of rouble-denominated debt. However  this is the country‚Äôs first external default since 1918  during the Bolshevik Revolution when Vladimir Lenin  the newly installed communist leader  repudiated the debt of the Russian empire.When Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February  more than half of Russia‚Äôs $40 billion of euro and dollar-denominated debt was listed on the Euronext Dublin exchange  the world‚Äôs No1 bond listings venue  under prospectuses approved by the Central Bank. The securities themselves are actually governed by English law  but the documents do not say where disputes could be settled.The bonds were not traded on the Irish exchange before they were delisted  but over the counter in securities broker-dealer hubs such as London and Frankfurt. Still  Euronext Dublin and an ecosystem of professional services firms in the capital earn lucrative fees from the bond listings line of work. As such  Dublin has played its role in facilitating Mr Putin‚Äôs government in accessing global debt markets over the years.‚ÄúThe Central Bank of Ireland reviews a prospectus to ensure it contains all of the disclosures as required under the [EU] Prospectus Regulation ‚Äù a spokesman for the bank said. ‚ÄúApproval of the prospectus is granted when those requirements are met. The Central Bank is not responsible for verifying the information the issuer includes in the prospectus.‚ÄùThe Kremlin  which has the money to make payments thanks to oil and gas revenues  has accused the West of driving Russia into an artificial default.A formal default is seen as largely symbolic as Russia is currently unable to borrow internationally and does not need to thanks to plentiful oil and gas export revenues.

By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  NOXXON‚Äôs approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses against the immune system and enable greater therapeutic impact. NOXXON‚Äôs lead program NOX-A12 has delivered final top-line data from a Keytruda¬Æ combination trial in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients published at the ESMO conference in September 2020 and in July 2021 the company announced its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck‚Äôs Keytruda¬Æ and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. NOXXON is also studying NOX-A12 in brain cancer in combination with radiotherapy which has been granted orphan drug status in the US and EU for the treatment of certain brain cancers. GLORIA  a trial of NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy has delivered top-line data from all three dose-escalation cohorts showing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA has been expanded to assess the benefit of NOX-A12 with other treatment combinations  radiotherapy + bevacizumab and radiotherapy + pembrolizumab. The company‚Äôs second clinical-stage asset NOX-E36 is a Phase 2 TME asset targeting the innate immune system. NOXXON plans to test NOX‚ÄëE36 in patients with solid tumors. Further information can be found at: www.noxxon.com.Keytruda¬Æ is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.Visit NOXXON on LinkedIn and Twitter.About the GLORIA StudyGLORIA (NCT04121455) is NOXXON‚Äôs dose-escalation  phase 1/2 study of NOX-A12 in combination with irradiation in first-line partially resected or unresected glioblastoma (brain cancer) patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter (resistant to standard chemotherapy). GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 three additional arms combining NOX-A12 with: A. radiotherapy in patients with complete tumor resection; B. radiotherapy and bevacizumab; and C. radiotherapy and pembrolizumab.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is NOXXON‚Äôs open-label two-arm phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.
