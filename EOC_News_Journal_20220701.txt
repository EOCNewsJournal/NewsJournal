The spot Bitcoin ETF will start trading on the Euronext Amsterdam Exchange under the ticker BCOIN.The Jacobi Bitcoin ETF is positioned as the first spot Bitcoin ETF launched in Europe  Jacobi founder and CEO Jamie Khurshid told Cointelegraph.""Our product is the first spot or physical-backed Bitcoin fund  and the fund is not allowed to lend  stake or leverage any of the assets it owns. For the first time in Europe  investors buying an exchange-traded Bitcoin product will own the units that own the Bitcoin "" Khurshid said. ""There are other exchange-traded products in Europe but no other spot BTC ETF "" he added.A spokesperson for Euronext confirmed that BCOIN will be the first spot Bitcoin ETF ever listed on Euronext. ""This will be the first Bitcoin ETF on Euronext  or the first fund directly investing in Bitcoin.

While the ETF will arrive in July  Euronext did not provide a specific date for the launch.As previously reported  Jacobi received approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission to launch the Bitcoin ETF in October 2021.Custodial services for the Jacobi Bitcoin ETF will be provided by Fidelity’s crypto arm Fidelity Digital Assets while Flow Traders and DRW would serve as market makers to facilitate trading. Institutional and professional investors in Europe will be able to have access to the ETF for a 1.5% annual management fee  the announcement notes.A former investment banker at Goldman Sachs  Khurshid believes that the new Bitcoin ETF launch will help bring more stability to the crypto market amid a massive sell-off. He said:“We believe this will now remove the barrier to entry for those investment firms that have mandates to invest in regulated products only and will therefore increase adoption of digital assets bringing more stability and less influence from the whales  which is nothing short of a necessity for the crypto industry.”Jacobi’s Bitcoin ETF launch in the Netherlands is a significant milestone in the global spot crypto ETF market as Amsterdam is associated with Europe’s top sharing trading venue  reportedly outstripping London in 2021.As previously reported  Canada was one of the first countries in the world to debut a spot Bitcoin ETF with the launch of the Purpose Bitcoin ETF in February 2021.

However  realizing the full potential of CAR T in an allogeneic setting requires universal CAR T-cells that can kill target tumor cells  avoid depletion by the host immune system via the host versus graft reaction (HvG)  and proliferate without attacking host tissues via the graft versus host reaction (GvH).While the prevention of GvH can be readily addressed by the inactivation of T cell receptor T αβ (TCRαβ) expression in a CAR T-cell  prevention of HvG remains a major challenge.To address this challenge  the Cellectis investigators engineered CAR T-cells to be deficient in Class 1 major histocompatibility complex (MHC-1) and to express the Natural Killer (NK) inhibitor HLA-E  in order to endow them with immune-evasive properties toward alloreactive Tc ells and NK cells.“This engineering approach is very promising and could enable the universal CAR T-cells to become transiently invisible to NK and alloreactive T-cells  allowing them to eradicate tumor cells before being rejected by the patient’s immune system. This could enable the broad use of universal CAR T-cells in allogeneic settings  for the benefit of a wider population of patients ” said Julien Valton  Ph.D.  Vice President Gene Therapy at Cellectis.Story continues“One potential advantage of this approach is to spare endogenous immune effectors and allow them to work in concert with CAR T-cells in the fight against hard-to-treat cancers  including solid tumors ” said Laurent Poirot  Ph.D. Senior Vice President Immuno-Oncology at Cellectis.The research data show that:Endowing universal CAR T-cells with immune-evasive properties via TALEN®-mediated gene editing and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-dependent gene insertion  is highly efficient and specific  transferable to different CAR constructs and adaptable to conventional CAR T-cell manufacturing processes.Immune-evasive universal CAR T-cells overcame alloresponsive T-cell and NK cells attacks and exhibit prolonged antitumor activity  even in the presence of highly active NK cells.Immune-evasive properties against NK cells from most healthy donors and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were similar  demonstrating the robustness and transportability of this hypoimmunogenic approach to persistence and warranting further evaluation in preclinical and clinical settings.This article is available on Nature Communications’ website by clicking on this link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30896-2About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury  today anno…,EINDHOVEN  the Netherlands & LAUSANNE  Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury  today announces a Nature Neuroscience publication showing the potential for ONWARD’s ARCIM Therapy to restore movement and function in hands and arms after spinal cord injury.Regaining hand and arm function is the highest priority for many people with cervical spinal cord injury. Even mild functional deficits in hand and arm function lead to significantly reduced independence and quality of life. It has historically been challenging to develop new therapies for hand and arm function because their movements are complex and multidimensional. Researchers in today’s Nature Neuroscience publication investigated a potentially more effective approach to improving motor control of the upper limbs after spinal cord injury – an implantable neurostimulation system that modulates the spinal cord region involved in controlling hand and arm function. This preclinical data showed that precise electrical stimulation targeting relevant spinal cord segments enhanced muscle activation and strength  and facilitated more efficient hand and arm movements.“We are preparing to launch our transcutaneous ARCEX Therapy to restore hand and arm function in 2023 ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. ”The findings from this Nature Neuroscience publication suggest there may also be a role for implanted ARCIM Therapy to help people with spinal cord injury regain arm and hand function. Indeed  the greater precision and 24/7 availability of implanted ARCIM Therapy may offer meaningful support for activities of daily living.”“Small improvements in hand and arm function offer large benefits in independence and quality of life. Current approaches such as functional electrical stimulation (FES) induce fatigue and fail to sustain the three-dimensional movements required for activities of daily life”  said Grégoire Courtine  professor at EPFL and co-author of the Nature Neuroscience paper. “We look forward to studying this approach in humans within the next several months and working with ONWARD to potentially commercialize this important therapy.”As part of its suite of intellectual property agreements with EPFL  ONWARD has the rights to develop and commercialize cervical spinal cord stimulation therapy to improve hand and arm function in people with spinal cord injury.The publication features preclinical research performed by neuroscientists at EPFL  University of Fribourg  and University of Pittsburgh. The research initiative was sponsored by the Wyss Foundation  ONWARD  the Bertarelli Foundation  the Swiss National Science Foundation  and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.To learn more about ONWARD’s ARC Therapy and the company’s vision to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury  please visit ONWD.com.About ONWARDONWARD is a medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injuries.

Other nations like Saudi Arabia and Algeria have also snapped up wheat in recent days.France was the largest supplier in Egypt’s tender  a change from before the war  when sales early in the season tended to be dominated by Black Sea crops. The wheat trade has been disrupted by the conflict and most Ukrainian ports remain shut  which is expected to boost demand from alternative shippers like the European Union.The purchases follow a recent drop across grain futures  as commodities were dragged down by the recessionary worries hanging over financial markets. Chicago wheat has retreated more than 30% from a record reached in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Still  prices remain historically high  straining importers’ budgets. Egypt’s supply minister said it aims to cut back imports by eking out more subsidized bread from its grain.Egypt’s tender was also notable in that it sought wheat over a three-month span  rather than a few weeks as usual  stretching out the sales. The country ultimately booked supply for August  September and the first half of October  according to traders who asked not to be identified. Cargoes from the EU -- Romania  France and Bulgaria -- accounted for the bulk at 640 000 tons  and Russia sold 175 000 tons.“This illustrates the competitiveness of French origin on the international scene  and the tensions that exist linked to the situation in the Black Sea basin ” Paris-based adviser Agritel said in a note.Story continuesMilling-wheat futures on the Euronext exchange traded little changed on Thursday.(Adds additional details in third paragraph  analyst quote in seventh paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.08,0.19,0.72,True,English,"['Wheat Supplies', 'Supersized Tender', 'Egypt', 'Black Sea crops', 'Black Sea basin', 'Paris-based adviser Agritel', 'largest single purchase', 'most Ukrainian ports', 'recent price slump', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'largest supplier', 'recent days', 'recent drop', 'most wheat', 'a decade', 'global supplies', 'state-run buyer', 'Other nations', 'Saudi Arabia', 'alternative shippers', 'European Union', 'recessionary worries', 'financial markets', 'importers’ budgets', 'three-month span', 'first half', 'French origin', 'international scene', 'Milling-wheat futures', 'Euronext exchange', 'additional details', 'third paragraph', 'analyst quote', 'seventh paragraph', 'Bloomberg show', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'wheat trade', 'Chicago wheat', 'grain futures', 'supply minister', 'Egypt', 'tender', 'advantage', 'stockpiles', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'country', '815,000 tons', 'Wednesday', 'data', 'Algeria', 'France', 'war', 'sales', 'season', 'conflict', 'demand', 'purchases', 'commodities', 'record', 'wake', 'prices', 'imports', 'bread', 'weeks', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'traders', 'Cargoes', 'Romania', 'Bulgaria', 'bulk', '640,000 tons', '175,000 tons', 'competitiveness', 'tensions', 'situation', 'note', 'Story', 'Thursday']",2022-06-30,2022-07-01,finance.yahoo.com

The Jacobi Bitcoin ETF will be the largest spot Bitcoin ETF in the world  building on the spot ETFs in smaller markets.More accessibility to Bitcoin nowThe selection of ETFs available to European investors is less extensive than those available to U.S investors. In fact  only between 15% and 20% of retail investors in Europe utilize ETFs  compared to 40% of those in the U.S.However  the decision to permit a spot Bitcoin ETF in Europe will probably open up a previously closed channel of entry for organizations like pension funds  mutual funds  and insurance companies.

Thanks to the six years ownership of the site by VALGO and its expertise in asbestos removal  soil and water table decontamination  in-situ waste treatment and development  this area has now become a suitable site for the development of new industries and business activities.On the banks of the river Seine and close to the A13 highway  the 32-hectare area of land offers its future users a highly strategic location. Following the extensive depollution work carried out by VALGO  the site is now ready for redevelopment. VGP expanded into France only a few months ago and is delighted to start its French business activities in the dynamic Rouen Normandy metropolis area  via this major project. In total  around 150 000 m² of land are set to be redeveloped to accommodate industrial and logistics projects  with work due to begin in 2023.Collaboration with local authorities is an absolute priority for the Group  since development projects directly impact their surroundings. In Petit-Couronne  the revitalization of this brownfield site will therefore be an opportunity to help stimulate the area in terms of employment and so meet the economic and environmental challenges of the Rouen region. Aurélien Coudert  General Manager of VGP France  is delighted that the Group’s first steps in France are being taken in partnership with VALGO and is convinced by the attractiveness of the region and its development potential.VGP and VALGO are also joining forces to implement an ambitious and innovative environmental policy. Through a policy of innovation serving clients and geographies  VGP puts the challenges of energy efficiency  carbon footprint reduction and sustainable buildings at the heart of its projects. The company is committed to being carbon neutral by 2025 and is also aiming for BREEAM Excellent building certification  as well as green energy production on its projects. In addition  the VGP Foundation  created in 2019  already supports 29 projects that address issues around access to education  biodiversity preservation and the protection of cultural heritage.Story continuesJan Van Geet  CEO VGP:“VGP is delighted to begin its business activities in France on a site as exceptional as this one  with strong economic and environmental ambitions that are shared by both our partner  VALGO  and the local authorities. As the rehabilitation of brownfield sites is at the heart of our business  this project is a great opportunity for us to deploy our industrial and logistical know-how. The uncertain geopolitical situation and the rise in transport prices mean that companies are increasingly looking for local support to start their business. In this context  we strongly believe in the relevance of our integrated model with a long-term vision. We are now eager to get to work and bring all the expertise of the Group to the project.""François Bouché  CEO VALGO:""We are delighted that this huge piece of land has been sold to a major investor with experience in redeveloping brownfields in Europe. However  I would first like to celebrate the work of the men and women who worked so hard to make this colossal project a success. It took more than 1 million hours and over €60 million in investment by VALGO to turn the page on over 80 years of refining on this site  which already employs 600 people.”VGP is advised on this project by the legal practices Cheuvreux (Eric Hervy)  Ireo (Marine Javelle) and EOL (Jean-François Mounic).CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTORS AND MEDIA ENQUIRIESInvestor Relations VGP Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Petra VanclovaExternal Communications VGP Tel: +32 (0)3 289 14 32petra.vanclova@vgpparks.eu Apolline ThomassetEsprit des Sens voor VGP Tel: +33 6 19 42 57 83a.thomasset@eds-groupe.com Caroline CazanaveVALGO Tel: +33 6 98 35 08 99caroline.cazanave@valgo.comABOUT VGP AND VALGOVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

7251,Euroclear,Bing API,https://theconversation.com/russian-debt-default-two-experts-explain-what-it-means-for-russia-and-for-global-financial-markets-186130,Russian debt default: two experts explain what it means for Russia and for global financial markets,Experts discuss the implications of Russia’s recent debt default for the global financial markets and Russia’s reputation,Russia’s recent default on its foreign debt – it’s first since 1918 – has been hailed as proof that the sanctions imposed by western governments since the invasion of Ukraine in February are working.A 30-day grace period on US$100 million (£82 million) in interest on two bonds ended on June 27 2022  with Russia’s repayments on this foreign debt not reaching creditors. While the Kremlin claims the payment has been held up by clearing house Euroclear  ratings agency Moody’s has predicted the country is likely to continue to default on payments because it is repaying in roubles  rather than the currency specified in the bond prospectuses.Amid this uncertainty  potential longer-term implications include the impact a default will have on Russia’s ability to attract investors  now and in the future.We asked a legal expert and an economist who have been following the situation to explain the significance of the defaults. Here’s what they said:Nasir Aminu  Senior Lecturer in Economics and Finance  Cardiff Metropolitan UniversityRussia’s failure to pay US$100 million in US dollar- and euro-denominated interest payments on June 27 2022 shows the Kremlin is running out of options to respond to western sanctions. The default on foreign debt was not unexpected. The economic sanctions placed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February have limited the country’s financial capabilities. This debt default  therefore  is a result of western governments’ ban on all transactions with the National Central Bank of Russia and the freezing of its foreign reserves  worth more than US$600 billion.In theory  the debt default on foreign creditors is surprising because Russia’s finances remain strong despite a protracted war in Ukraine. The country reportedly continues to receive revenues of about US$1 billion per day from the sale of oil to China  India and other Kremlin-friendly importers. This income means Russia did not default because of an inability to pay.Russia’s default will have a relatively small impact on global financial institutions  including its own financial sector. There is always a risk of global contagion – when an event has an indirect or unexpected effect on another part of the market – but foreign investors have had less exposure to Russia since it annexed Crimea in 2014. The few investors that do have high exposure are already looking to sell  although they face difficulties due to the western sanctions.European banks are the most exposed financial institutions to Russian debt. The most recent figures from the Bank for International Settlements  which cover up to the end of 2021  show French and Italian banks have the most exposure to Russia  with outstanding claims of more than US$20 billion  while Austrian banks have US$17.5 billion in outstanding claims on Russian debt.The most worrying consequence of debt default for Russia will be the loss of access to global investors through the international capital markets. The default will tint Russia’s reputation  making its bonds less attractive in the future due to the risk of further defaults. The country will have to pay a higher cost of borrowing to attract new investors and to keep those it already has because of the increased credit risk resulting from this recent default.Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal  Professor of Banking and Finance Law  Queen Mary University of LondonRussia’s missed interest payments were on two of its sovereign bonds: the 2026 US dollar and 2036 euro bonds.In addition to the actual currency of these bonds  both allow interest payments to be made in pounds or Swiss francs if  for reasons beyond its control  Russia is unable to make payments in US dollars or euros. The 2036 euro bond goes even further by adding the Russian rouble as a possible alternative payment currency. These additional options may seem useful  but creditors might prefer to avoid a currency mismatch by having Russia make repayments in the original currency of the bond.These bonds also include a currency indemnity clause  which would allow Russia to be discharged from its repayment obligations if the investor receives or recovers the entire amount due on the bond. Any payment in roubles must match the original amount owed when converted into US dollars or euros  however. In this case  roubles would probably be most useful to Russia since it has been largely cut off from the international financial markets.In any event  the full impact of the default remains uncertain until the global financial market gets clarity on the following questions:Would a payment deposited to an account in Russia in the name of the creditor amount to “receiving” the payment and therefore discharge Russia from its obligations? A creditor might receive repayments in this way  but actually recovering the money from the account could be complicated by government plans to restrict access to or transfers of Russia-based assets at the moment.Also  was Russia prevented from paying because of the western sanctions? If so  since this is outside of its control  Russia could argue it is not to blame for the default. If a court deems the situation is self-inflicted  however  Russia may not be excused.These issues would be subject to interpretation by a court of law. But Russia has not waived its sovereign immunity and has not submitted to the jurisdiction of a court named in either of the two bond prospectuses. As such  creditors and the global markets must continue to wait for further clarity.,negative,0.02,0.29,0.69,negative,0.01,0.15,0.84,True,English,"['Russian debt default', 'global financial markets', 'two experts', 'possible alternative payment currency', '30-day grace period', 'potential longer-term implications', 'Cardiff Metropolitan University', 'other Kremlin-friendly importers', 'Queen Mary University', 'international capital markets', 'currency indemnity clause', 'international financial markets', 'National Central Bank', 'western governments’ ban', 'global financial institutions', 'global financial market', 'euro-denominated interest payments', 'International Settlements', 'financial capabilities', 'financial sector', 'global contagion', 'actual currency', 'currency mismatch', 'original currency', 'global investors', 'foreign debt', 'ratings agency', 'legal expert', 'Nasir Aminu', 'Senior Lecturer', 'western sanctions', 'foreign reserves', 'protracted war', 'unexpected effect', 'less exposure', 'high exposure', 'European banks', 'Russian debt', 'recent figures', 'Italian banks', 'most exposure', 'outstanding claims', 'Austrian banks', 'worrying consequence', 'higher cost', 'Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal', '2026 US dollar', 'Swiss francs', 'US dollars', 'Russian rouble', 'entire amount', 'original amount', 'following questions', 'government plans', 'Russia-based assets', 'economic sanctions', 'small impact', 'full impact', 'foreign investors', 'new investors', 'recent default', 'two bonds', 'bond prospectuses', 'debt default', 'sovereign bonds', '2036 euro bonds', 'additional options', 'repayment obligations', 'foreign creditors', 'credit risk', 'proof', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'June', 'repayments', 'house', 'Euroclear', 'Moody', 'country', 'roubles', 'uncertainty', 'ability', 'future', 'economist', 'situation', 'significance', 'defaults', 'Economics', 'Finance', 'failure', 'result', 'transactions', 'freezing', 'theory', 'revenues', 'sale', 'oil', 'China', 'India', 'income', 'event', 'indirect', 'part', 'Crimea', 'difficulties', 'French', 'loss', 'access', 'reputation', 'borrowing', 'Professor', 'Banking', 'Law', 'London', 'pounds', 'reasons', 'control', 'euros', 'case', 'clarity', 'account', 'name', 'way', 'money', 'transfers', 'moment']",2022-07-01,2022-07-01,theconversation.com
7252,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.newsclick.in/Russia-Default-Explained-Will-Investors-Take-Hit,Russia's Default Explained: Will Investors Take a Hit?,By most accounts  Russia has defaulted on its sovereign debt because it was unable to make a payment to its creditors. But reality is trickier than that  and shows Moscow has been strategic in bracing for the fallout.,"Russia's interest payment has reportedly left the finance ministry. Where is it now?Moody's ratings agency has confirmed that Russia defaulted on foreign debt after bondholders did not receive $100 million (€94.9 million) in interest payments.""Missed coupon payment constitutes a default "" the international ratings agency said in a statement late on Monday  adding that further defaults on future coupon payments ""are likely.""Russia has a total of about $40 billion outstanding in foreign debt  and the legal picture is unclear as to the status of default.What is default?The way government debt works is that investors globally buy so-called government bonds — basically legal documents. The government gets to use the proceeds from the purchase for its expenses and agrees to periodically pay interest payments to the investor. After maturity of the bond  the government returns the initial sale price — the principal investment — to creditors and the debt dissolves.Screenshot of the Russian bond that lapsed on SundayWhat counts as default is stipulated in the legal fine print. Each government bond comes as a long legal document  in the case of one of the Russian bonds in question 143 pages of text. This document  seen by DW  defines seven events of default. Most pressing: Nonpayment.Did Russia default?Even though Moody's declared Russia in default  the legal documents present a messy picture. Speaking on the condition of anonymity  a capital markets lawyer in London told DW that at the very least Russia hasn’t ""complied with their obligations under the contract.""With regard to what ""nonpayment"" means in the legal documents  the lawyer said: ""Can someone fail to pay if they have actually done all there is to do within their control to make the payment ... and ensure the relevant funds leave the relevant account?""Legally  courts will decide whether the country defaulted. But how can money be paid but not received?Did Russia pay its creditors?The inner workings of international finance are intricate. At least one investor had knowledge of a payment sent but not received  US business newspaper The Wall Street Journal reported this week. And Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told reporters in Moscow last week that Russia has done everything ""to lead the horse to water. But it's not up to us whether it wants to drink or not.""Because of the US-led sanctions regime  the international channels of sending payments aren't open for Russia anymore. In such a transaction multiple agents are involved like paying agents  who send the funds to clearing institutions which handle interest payments for debtors and creditors.The lapsed Russian bonds were to be cleared through Euroclear or Clearstream — two private companies that offer such services but which are currently barred from clearing Russian payments as a result of sanctions.Instead  Russia's Finance Ministry said it had transferred interest payments to a Euroclear account in the Russian settlement system  the National Settlement Depository (NSD). Under normal circumstances  Euroclear would have then transferred the money into its own system and then to the depository banks that have accounts with Euroclear and finally to the bondholders. But Euroclear is not allowed to process any further.""So technically speaking the money is no longer in an account of the Russian Federation  but it's already in an account that doesn't belong to the Russian Federation  and the Russian Federation cannot take the money back "" the capital markets lawyer said  assuming the money ""is somewhere stuck in the plumbing.""Russia has precautions against seizure of assetsCountries have defaulted in the past. Argentina defaulted nine times in the past 200 years. During a period of default in December 2013  the Latin American country was unsure about its assets.Bond holders can seize a defaulted debtor's assets  which was why Argentina's government chartered a British plane for then President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to visit Asia and the Middle East. This way the government's jet wasn't on the line.""I suspect  remembering what happened with Argentina  that the Americans would be keen to have creditors chasing Russian assets all over the world "" Paul McNamara  an emerging-market fund manager at GAM  told the Wall Street Journal.But Russia's default is different. Not only is there a willingness to service the debt. The two bonds breached on Sunday lack one feature usually present in such documents: a waiver of immunity.""There is money  and there is also the readiness to pay "" Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov saidUsually  governments grant creditors the ability to sue them. The Russian bonds issued in 2016 and 2021 have no such clause. An investigation posted to Harvard Law School Bankruptcy Roundtable found  there are legal ways around this hurdle. It concludes  investors in Russian bonds should organize themselves and force legal action.What's at stake for Russia with default?As of now  Moscow's coffers are filled with euros and dollars from commodities exports and funding isn't an issue. But in the future Russia may want to borrow from outside of its borders again  for example from China.Being declared in default is a problem because investors aren't keen on lending to defaulters. As of now  international lenders are mostly scared away from lending to Russia as they fear to entangle themselves in the Western sanctions regime.But  even if Russia were to find allies to the east  it would come at a cost  Timothy Ash  an economist at BlueBay Asset Management  told DW. ""I think Chinese entities will look at Russia very differently if it's in default. ... If they want to still lend to Russia  they will charge a high premium for that "" he said.Edited by: Uwe Hessler",negative,0.01,0.15,0.83,negative,0.02,0.19,0.79,True,English,"['Russia', 'Investors', 'Hit', 'President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner', 'Harvard Law School Bankruptcy Roundtable', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'The Wall Street Journal', 'initial sale price', 'US business newspaper', 'emerging-market fund manager', 'two private companies', 'National Settlement Depository', 'capital markets lawyer', 'The Russian bonds', 'legal fine print', 'future coupon payments', 'US-led sanctions regime', 'Latin American country', 'Missed coupon payment', 'Russian settlement system', 'international ratings agency', 'long legal document', 'international finance', 'finance ministry', 'two bonds', 'Russian payments', 'Russian Federation', 'depository banks', 'international channels', 'legal picture', 'legal ways', 'legal action', 'interest payments', 'legal documents', 'principal investment', 'seven events', 'messy picture', 'inner workings', 'multiple agents', 'paying agents', 'normal circumstances', 'British plane', 'Middle East', 'Paul McNamara', 'one feature', 'commodities exp', 'Russian assets', 'Bond holders', 'foreign debt', 'government bonds', 'relevant funds', 'relevant account', 'one investor', 'past 200 years', 'government debt', 'Euroclear account', 'Moody', 'bondholders', 'default', 'statement', 'Monday', 'total', 'status', 'investors', 'proceeds', 'purchase', 'expenses', 'maturity', 'creditors', 'Screenshot', 'Sunday', 'case', 'question', '143 pages', 'text', 'DW', 'Nonpayment', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'London', 'obligations', 'contract', 'regard', 'someone', 'control', 'courts', 'money', 'knowledge', 'reporters', 'Moscow', 'everything', 'horse', 'water', 'transaction', 'institutions', 'debtors', 'lapsed', 'Clearstream', 'services', 'result', 'NSD', 'accounts', 'plumbing', 'precautions', 'seizure', 'Countries', 'Argentina', 'period', 'December', 'Asia', 'jet', 'line', 'Americans', 'world', 'GAM', 'willingness', 'waiver', 'immunity', 'readiness', 'governments', 'ability', 'clause', 'investigation', 'hurdle', 'stake', 'coffers', 'euros', 'dollars']",2022-07-01,2022-07-01,newsclick.in

Importantly  the agency did not report any issues related to data generated during Maxigesic IV®’s clinical development program  and the deficiency is confined solely to the Quality section of the application dossier  and more specifically to revise a risk assessment of the required leachable compound study.“We are corresponding with the FDA to address the recommendations highlighted in the letter as soon as possible ” said Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris. “Hyloris initially submitted a toxicological risk assessment for all leachable compounds  however  we will need to re-submit this information based on confirmed compounds quantified using validated methods. As previously stated  this request required by the FDA falls well within the parameters of our normal operational budget and can be completed expeditiously  requiring no additional clinical data to be generated. Hyloris remains committed to Maxigesic IV®  and ensuring the product fulfills its commercial potential in the U.S. We will be updating the market on revisions to the U.S. commercialization timeline for this product candidate as we gain more clarity about the FDA’s request.”Story continuesAbout Maxigesic IV®Maxigesic IV has been developed under the development collaboration agreement signed in 2012 between Hyloris and AFT Pharmaceuticals  and is to date  licensed in more than 100 countries  approved in 39 countries and marketed in seven countries. Maxigesic IV® is a unique combination of 1000mg paracetamol with 300mg ibuprofen solution for infusion for use post-operatively. The superior analgesic effect of Maxigesic IV demonstrated in a phase 3 trial was supported by a range of secondary endpoints  including reduced opioid consumption compared to the paracetamol IV and ibuprofen IV treatment groups (P<0.005). An additional exposure study demonstrated Maxigesic IV’s efficacy and safety in an expanded population group over a longer treatment period. Maxigesic IV is protected by several granted and pending patent applications.About Hyloris PharmaceuticalsHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

7275,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forfarmers-n-v-forfarmers-2agriculture-045500079.html,ForFarmers N.V.: ForFarmers and 2Agriculture join forces in the United Kingdom,Lochem  1 July 2022 ForFarmers and 2Agriculture join forces in the United Kingdom Joint venture well positioned to meet changing demands in agri and food...,"ForFarmers N.V.Lochem  1 July 2022ForFarmers and 2Agriculture join forces in the United KingdomJoint venture well positioned to meet changing demands in agri and food sectorForFarmers United Kingdom (ForFarmers UK) and 2Agriculture have come to an agreement to merge their businesses into a joint venture to serve a wider customer base. The joint venture will have a balanced feed portfolio across species  with an expected combined sales volume of more than 3 million tonnes of compound feed per year. At the same time the joint venture makes for a robust business  with improved expertise and presence across species  to successfully meet the changing demands from the entire value chain.The mutual agreement to enter into a joint venture meets the strategic objectives of both partners. ForFarmers UK strengthens its position in its home country in the promising poultry sector and at the same time creates possibilities to make the organisation more efficient. 2Agriculture benefits from shared investment opportunities across a larger volume  an increased geographic spread of manufacturing sites and exposure to other species markets.The deal will be subject to approval from the UK competition authority.Profiles of Partners in the joint ventureForFarmers UK  a subsidiary of the Dutch-based ForFarmers N.V.  is a feed company in the United Kingdom selling approximately 2 million tonnes of compound feed volumes annually (i.e. excluding volumes of straights and co-products) across species  produced in 14 mills. The majority of feed produced by ForFarmers is for ruminants and pigs  with smaller volumes being produced for poultry. The company has approximately 900 employees.2Agriculture is a UK company that supplies approximately 1.2 million tonnes of feed annually to poultry farmers mostly into the integrated market  but also to independent customers. The company employs 250 employees and operates 5 mills located in Scotland  East Anglia and North Wales and has an extrusion plant in Cambridgeshire.Story continuesStrategic RationaleThe joint venture will bring together 2Agriculture’s expertise in the promising poultry feed sector with ForFarmers’ capabilities in research and development as well as in formulation  particularly in ruminant and pig feeds. In addition  the combined broad geographic coverage will provide synergy opportunities  particularly in production and logistics. Similarly  the joint venture will generate further benefits for its customers by being able to combine the sourcing of raw materials. Finally  the joint venture will invest in expansion of the supply chain  enabling improved transparency around sustainability and the origin and quality of food.Steven Read  Managing Director of ForFarmers UK and nominated Managing Director of the intended joint venture: “We are excited to announce the merger with 2Agriculture  which will bring benefits to customers and supply chains in all sectors. Together  we can meet the changing requirements from customers and society through our strength in innovation and feed concepts. At the same time  we have the opportunity to create further value for our customers across all species by constantly driving improvements and optimising our service in the most efficient manner. We look forward to working with the colleagues at 2Agriculture to make this happen”.Kevin Sketcher  Managing Director of 2Agriculture and nominated Board member of the intended joint venture: “We look forward to joining forces with ForFarmers  a company that is also very focused on delivering quality feed and good advice to customers to enable them to realise sustainable and enhanced returns on farm. We see the anticipated joint venture as a good strategic step forward for both parties. We will be able to give our combined customer base across all species value for money by providing them with sustainable high quality feed. Moreover  we will be well positioned to support the agricultural sector offering food security to UK consumers. ”Market characteristicsThe total feed market in the United Kingdom is estimated at approximately 17.5 million tonnes. Expectations per species vary  with the expectations for the poultry sector at present being the most positive. The majority of poultry feed produced in the United Kingdom is manufactured in-house by poultry processors for integrated use in their supply chains. The United Kingdom is not fully self-sufficient with respect to production of fresh chicken (95%) nor of pig meat (60%). Although the pig market is expected to grow in the mid to longer term  the short-term outlook is that the market will remain stable due to the destabilised European pig market as a result of various outbreaks of African swine fever. The dairy market is self-sufficient and the ruminant sector in general is expected to grow minimally.Deal structureThe merger agreement is a non-cash transaction. The share split will be 50.1% for ForFarmers UK and 49.9% for 2Agriculture. This is based on the current enterprise value of both joint venture partners  and takes into account the respective expectations for 2022 and beyond. The share split also reflects the fact that 2Agriculture is fully focused on the promising poultry sector and has existing supply arrangements in the integrated market. ForFarmers will consolidate 2Agriculture fully into its financial results.You can also read the press release and download a pdf via this link.This press release contains information that qualifies as inside information in the sense of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.Note to the editor / For additional information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director Investor RelationsM: 0031 6 10 94 91 61E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euKevin Sketcher  Managing Director 2AgricultureE: kevin.sketcher@2agriculture.comAbout ForFarmers N.V.ForFarmers N.V. is an international organisation that provides complete innovative feed solutions to the (organic) livestock farming industry.

They discuss how education  technology and innovation can make a lasting change in the landscape of tourism  the importance of engaging local communities and building experiences locally and how by empowering the younger generation we will better shape the future of the sector.Accor’s Heart of Hospitality campaign returns this week with a new podcast series and a wealth of hospitality worker case studies from across Europe  sharing the passion  craft  creativity and heart that fills the travel and hospitality sector. As the global staffing crisis continues  Accor is using its sector leadership in Europe to spotlight the industry  its people  opportunities and careers and champion hospitality as an economically crucial sector and a personally fulfilling career choice.Duncan O’Rourke  CEO Accor Northern Europe said: “Travel and hospitality is fuelled by people. As the world reopens and recovery continues at an exceptional pace  people are once again travelling the world  experiencing different places and cultures  creating memories that will last a lifetime and extending their business beyond the virtual screen. It is people that make that possible  who craft those moments and welcome travellers all over the world. Hospitality and tourism contributes billions each year to global economies. It remains the employer of 1 in 10 people around the world. Far beyond this macro view  hospitality is all about people and the heart  craft and passion they demonstrate as they grow through their rewarding careers.”On the latest episode of Accor’s Heart of Hospitality podcast  Duncan O’Rourke and Natalia Bayona talk about the importance of innovation; the role of technology in service  sustainability and education; the incredible value and power of education and the importance of leadership and development in global communities.With a career spanning nearly two decades  Natalia Bayona rose quickly from a young  energetic and driven millennial joining the Department of Tourism of the Tourism Trade in her home-country of Columbia  to an international career championing education  innovation and sector investment around the world with the UNWTO.“If you have the energy and if you want to learn different things  you can empower yourself to an amazing career ” says Natalia of her career and the opportunities in the tourism sector. “The best way to get educated is by travelling because it's the way you open your brain to cultures. Tourism is a driver of peace  enabling you to see how people from different cultures are joined together for the same cause.”The episode celebrates the valuable voice and perspective of the youth  a demographic that contributes 50% of the global tourism workforce  and discusses the opportunities and importance of young people in the sector. “Innovation has to be led by the youth and we need to empower them in order to shape the future. Hospitality is the sector that employs the most number of youth  so it's a very young  dynamic and innovative sector. It is the most human economic sector  for people and by people. Because it is so human-centric you need to innovate every single moment because each human is different in the world.”Natalia concludes  “That's the magic of tourism - it is very human and you can see the benefits immediately. It's not a thing of five years from now or five months from now. It's something that can change your life immediately  so I don't think any other sector can do that for you.”For more information about careers in hospitality  visit https://careers.accor.com/.BIOGRAPHY: NATALIA BAYONADIRECTOR OF INNOVATION  EDUCATION AND INVESTMENTS AT THE WORLD TOURISM ORGANIZATION  THE UNWTONatalia Bayona leads the innovation  education and investments strategy of UNWTO  the UN specialized agency for the promotion of sustainable tourism.With a diverse background on politics  destination management and business  she has become the first innovation director at UNWTO  has introduced entrepreneurship and education as key factors for tourism and development  and has positioned UNWTO as an innovation benchmark within the wider United Nations system as recognized by the UN Chief Executive Board (CEB) in 2020.Her work consists on identifying the most disruptive startups and investment projects and matching them with Member States and leading corporations.

Even though the wealth in the world is unequally distributed  however  the growing demand in luxury products is obviously present.,Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton  commonly known as LVMH  is a French multinational luxury goods company. Headquartered in Paris  LMVH was formed 1987 through a merger of the fashion house Louis Vuitton (founded in 1854) with Moët Hennessy (established in 1971). The company controls and manages 75 prestigious brands under the umbrellas of 6 branches: Perfumes and Cosmetics  Wine and Spirits  Watches and Jewelry  Fashion Group  Selective Distribution  and Other Activities. LVMH is a part of CAC40 index. Investors can trade it under the ticker $MC at Euronext Paris and under $LVMHF in US in form of ADRs.From the first days on the stock exchange  $MC title is in a permanent growth. From the fundamental point of view  this behavior may demonstrate a steady need of luxury goods in the society. Even though the wealth in the world is unequally distributed  however  the growing demand in luxury products is obviously present. The latter should be rising even stronger in the coming years. This development should advance  without any doubt  the luxury giant LVMH to new highs.In the initial article from October 2020  we have forecasted the break of January 2020 high to take place. We were right. $MC has not only broken 439.05 highs  but the stock price has printed an all- time high in January 2022 at 758.50. Here  we provide an update and outlook.LVMH monthly Elliott Wave analysis 06.29.2022The monthly chart below shows the LVMH stock $MC listed at Euronext. From the all-time lows  first  the stock price has developed a cycle higher in wave (I) of a super cycle degree. It has ended in August 2000 at 98.70. From the top  a correction lower in wave (II) has unfolded as an Elliott Wave zigzag pattern. It has printed a bottom on September 2001 at 28.40. From the September 2001 lows  LVMH has broken to new highs and is still within a strong rally. This rise shows an extension of more than 4.236 multiples in relation to the length of the wave (I). Without any doubt  one can qualify the cycle higher as the blue wave (III). From 2001 lows  it shows 7 swings higher. Currently  the 8th swing in red wave IV is unfolding as a double three structure. Once finished  the 9th swing within wave V should end the impulse in wave (III).Indeed  motive sequences develop in 5 – 9 – 13 – 17 – … (5+4 x n) swings. Therefore  one should expect a new high above 758.50 which will provide the 9th swing from September 2001 lows. On the one hand  a new high and 9 swings may accomplish the 2001 cycle higher in blue wave (III). On the other hand  they dont have to. As mentionned above  13  17 and more swings within cycle in wave (III) are also possible.LVMH daily Elliott Wave analysis 06.29.2022The daily chart below shows in more detail the 8th swing lower. From the all-time highs in January 2022 at 758.50  the pullback in red wave IV is unfolding as a double-three correction. First  3 swings of black wave ((W)) have bottommed in March 2022 at 543.90. Then  a bounce in wave ((X)) has printed a connector at 675.20. Later  a new low below 543.90 has opened a bearish sequence. Therefore  more downside within black wave ((Y)) should take place. Currently  wave (C) of ((Y)) is in progress.Investors and traders should be looking to buy LVMH in a pullback from 460.23-327.43 area targeting towards 828.89 and possibly higher.,neutral,0.06,0.91,0.03,mixed,0.1,0.29,0.6,True,English,"['Luxury producer', 'LVMH', 'opportunity', 'rally', 'French multinational luxury goods company', 'Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton', 'LVMH monthly Elliott Wave analysis', 'LVMH daily Elliott Wave analysis', 'Elliott Wave zigzag pattern', 'double three structure', 'luxury giant LVMH', 'red wave IV', 'super cycle degree', 'monthly chart', 'daily chart', 'luxury products', 'LVMH stock', 'blue wave', 'wave V', 'black wave', 'fashion house', '75 prestigious brands', 'Fashion Group', 'Selective Distribution', 'Other Activities', 'CAC40 index', 'first days', 'stock exchange', 'permanent growth', 'fundamental point', 'steady need', 'growing demand', 'coming years', 'initial article', 'stock price', 'strong rally', '8th swing', '9th swing', 'motive sequences', '4 x n', 'new high', 'one hand', 'other hand', 'bearish sequence', '460.23-327.43 area', 'time lows', 'time highs', 'double-three correction', 'September 2001 lows', '$MC title', 'Euronext Paris', '439.05 highs', '2001 cycle', 'LMVH', 'merger', 'umbrellas', '6 branches', 'Perfumes', 'Cosmetics', 'Wine', 'Spirits', 'Watches', 'Jewelry', 'part', 'Investors', 'ticker', 'LVMHF', 'form', 'ADRs', 'view', 'behavior', 'society', 'wealth', 'world', 'latter', 'development', 'doubt', 'October', 'break', 'January', 'place', 'update', 'outlook', 'August', 'top', 'bottom', 'rise', 'extension', '4.236 multiples', 'relation', 'length', '7 swings', 'impulse', '9 swings', 'detail', 'pullback', '3 swings', 'March', 'bounce', 'connector', 'downside', 'progress', 'traders', '17']",2022-07-01,2022-07-01,fxstreet.com
