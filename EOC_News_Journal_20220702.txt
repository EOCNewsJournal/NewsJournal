The FDA has only requested additional data on one remaining topic.“We believe  along with our partners at AFT  that generating the additional information that FDA requires to support the NDA submission of Maxigesic IV® will allow the product to fulfill its full commercial potential in the US and not affect the Company’s other existing development programs.

Importantly  the agency did not report any issues related to data generated during Maxigesic IV®’s clinical development program  and the deficiency is confined solely to the Quality section of the application dossier  and more specifically to revise a risk assessment of the required leachable compound study.“We are corresponding with the FDA to address the recommendations highlighted in the letter as soon as possible ” said Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris. “Hyloris initially submitted a toxicological risk assessment for all leachable compounds  however  we will need to re-submit this information based on confirmed compounds quantified using validated methods. As previously stated  this request required by the FDA falls well within the parameters of our normal operational budget and can be completed expeditiously  requiring no additional clinical data to be generated. Hyloris remains committed to Maxigesic IV®  and ensuring the product fulfills its commercial potential in the U.S. We will be updating the market on revisions to the U.S. commercialization timeline for this product candidate as we gain more clarity about the FDA’s request.”Story continuesAbout Maxigesic IV®Maxigesic IV has been developed under the development collaboration agreement signed in 2012 between Hyloris and AFT Pharmaceuticals  and is to date  licensed in more than 100 countries  approved in 39 countries and marketed in seven countries. Maxigesic IV® is a unique combination of 1000mg paracetamol with 300mg ibuprofen solution for infusion for use post-operatively. The superior analgesic effect of Maxigesic IV demonstrated in a phase 3 trial was supported by a range of secondary endpoints  including reduced opioid consumption compared to the paracetamol IV and ibuprofen IV treatment groups (P<0.005). An additional exposure study demonstrated Maxigesic IV’s efficacy and safety in an expanded population group over a longer treatment period. Maxigesic IV is protected by several granted and pending patent applications.About Hyloris PharmaceuticalsHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

The joint venture will have a balanced feed portfolio across species  with an expected combined sales volume of more than 3 million tonnes of compound feed per year. At the same time the joint venture makes for a robust business  with improved expertise and presence across species  to successfully meet the changing demands from the entire value chain.The mutual agreement to enter into a joint venture meets the strategic objectives of both partners. ForFarmers UK strengthens its position in its home country in the promising poultry sector and at the same time creates possibilities to make the organisation more efficient. 2Agriculture benefits from shared investment opportunities across a larger volume  an increased geographic spread of manufacturing sites and exposure to other species markets.The deal will be subject to approval from the UK competition authority.Profiles of Partners in the joint ventureForFarmers UK  a subsidiary of the Dutch-based ForFarmers N.V.  is a feed company in the United Kingdom selling approximately 2 million tonnes of compound feed volumes annually (i.e. excluding volumes of straights and co-products) across species  produced in 14 mills. The majority of feed produced by ForFarmers is for ruminants and pigs  with smaller volumes being produced for poultry. The company has approximately 900 employees.2Agriculture is a UK company that supplies approximately 1.2 million tonnes of feed annually to poultry farmers mostly into the integrated market  but also to independent customers. The company employs 250 employees and operates 5 mills located in Scotland  East Anglia and North Wales and has an extrusion plant in Cambridgeshire.Story continuesStrategic RationaleThe joint venture will bring together 2Agriculture’s expertise in the promising poultry feed sector with ForFarmers’ capabilities in research and development as well as in formulation  particularly in ruminant and pig feeds. In addition  the combined broad geographic coverage will provide synergy opportunities  particularly in production and logistics. Similarly  the joint venture will generate further benefits for its customers by being able to combine the sourcing of raw materials. Finally  the joint venture will invest in expansion of the supply chain  enabling improved transparency around sustainability and the origin and quality of food.Steven Read  Managing Director of ForFarmers UK and nominated Managing Director of the intended joint venture: “We are excited to announce the merger with 2Agriculture  which will bring benefits to customers and supply chains in all sectors. Together  we can meet the changing requirements from customers and society through our strength in innovation and feed concepts. At the same time  we have the opportunity to create further value for our customers across all species by constantly driving improvements and optimising our service in the most efficient manner. We look forward to working with the colleagues at 2Agriculture to make this happen”.Kevin Sketcher  Managing Director of 2Agriculture and nominated Board member of the intended joint venture: “We look forward to joining forces with ForFarmers  a company that is also very focused on delivering quality feed and good advice to customers to enable them to realise sustainable and enhanced returns on farm. We see the anticipated joint venture as a good strategic step forward for both parties. We will be able to give our combined customer base across all species value for money by providing them with sustainable high quality feed. Moreover  we will be well positioned to support the agricultural sector offering food security to UK consumers. ”Market characteristicsThe total feed market in the United Kingdom is estimated at approximately 17.5 million tonnes. Expectations per species vary  with the expectations for the poultry sector at present being the most positive. The majority of poultry feed produced in the United Kingdom is manufactured in-house by poultry processors for integrated use in their supply chains. The United Kingdom is not fully self-sufficient with respect to production of fresh chicken (95%) nor of pig meat (60%). Although the pig market is expected to grow in the mid to longer term  the short-term outlook is that the market will remain stable due to the destabilised European pig market as a result of various outbreaks of African swine fever. The dairy market is self-sufficient and the ruminant sector in general is expected to grow minimally.Deal structureThe merger agreement is a non-cash transaction. The share split will be 50.1% for ForFarmers UK and 49.9% for 2Agriculture. This is based on the current enterprise value of both joint venture partners  and takes into account the respective expectations for 2022 and beyond. The share split also reflects the fact that 2Agriculture is fully focused on the promising poultry sector and has existing supply arrangements in the integrated market. ForFarmers will consolidate 2Agriculture fully into its financial results.You can also read the press release and download a pdf via this link.This press release contains information that qualifies as inside information in the sense of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.Note to the editor / For additional information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director Investor RelationsM: 0031 6 10 94 91 61E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euKevin Sketcher  Managing Director 2AgricultureE: kevin.sketcher@2agriculture.comAbout ForFarmers N.V.ForFarmers N.V. is an international organisation that provides complete innovative feed solutions to the (organic) livestock farming industry.

They discuss how education  technology and innovation can make a lasting change in the landscape of tourism  the importance of engaging local communities and building experiences locally and how by empowering the younger generation we will better shape the future of the sector.Accor’s Heart of Hospitality campaign returns this week with a new podcast series and a wealth of hospitality worker case studies from across Europe  sharing the passion  craft  creativity and heart that fills the travel and hospitality sector. As the global staffing crisis continues  Accor is using its sector leadership in Europe to spotlight the industry  its people  opportunities and careers and champion hospitality as an economically crucial sector and a personally fulfilling career choice.Duncan O’Rourke  CEO Accor Northern Europe said: “Travel and hospitality is fuelled by people. As the world reopens and recovery continues at an exceptional pace  people are once again travelling the world  experiencing different places and cultures  creating memories that will last a lifetime and extending their business beyond the virtual screen. It is people that make that possible  who craft those moments and welcome travellers all over the world. Hospitality and tourism contributes billions each year to global economies. It remains the employer of 1 in 10 people around the world. Far beyond this macro view  hospitality is all about people and the heart  craft and passion they demonstrate as they grow through their rewarding careers.”On the latest episode of Accor’s Heart of Hospitality podcast  Duncan O’Rourke and Natalia Bayona talk about the importance of innovation; the role of technology in service  sustainability and education; the incredible value and power of education and the importance of leadership and development in global communities.With a career spanning nearly two decades  Natalia Bayona rose quickly from a young  energetic and driven millennial joining the Department of Tourism of the Tourism Trade in her home-country of Columbia  to an international career championing education  innovation and sector investment around the world with the UNWTO.“If you have the energy and if you want to learn different things  you can empower yourself to an amazing career ” says Natalia of her career and the opportunities in the tourism sector. “The best way to get educated is by travelling because it's the way you open your brain to cultures. Tourism is a driver of peace  enabling you to see how people from different cultures are joined together for the same cause.”The episode celebrates the valuable voice and perspective of the youth  a demographic that contributes 50% of the global tourism workforce  and discusses the opportunities and importance of young people in the sector. “Innovation has to be led by the youth and we need to empower them in order to shape the future. Hospitality is the sector that employs the most number of youth  so it's a very young  dynamic and innovative sector. It is the most human economic sector  for people and by people. Because it is so human-centric you need to innovate every single moment because each human is different in the world.”Natalia concludes  “That's the magic of tourism - it is very human and you can see the benefits immediately. It's not a thing of five years from now or five months from now. It's something that can change your life immediately  so I don't think any other sector can do that for you.”For more information about careers in hospitality  visit https://careers.accor.com/.BIOGRAPHY: NATALIA BAYONADIRECTOR OF INNOVATION  EDUCATION AND INVESTMENTS AT THE WORLD TOURISM ORGANIZATION  THE UNWTONatalia Bayona leads the innovation  education and investments strategy of UNWTO  the UN specialized agency for the promotion of sustainable tourism.With a diverse background on politics  destination management and business  she has become the first innovation director at UNWTO  has introduced entrepreneurship and education as key factors for tourism and development  and has positioned UNWTO as an innovation benchmark within the wider United Nations system as recognized by the UN Chief Executive Board (CEB) in 2020.Her work consists on identifying the most disruptive startups and investment projects and matching them with Member States and leading corporations.

7295,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://theconversation.com/russian-debt-default-two-experts-explain-what-it-means-for-russia-and-for-global-financial-markets-186130,Russian debt default: two experts explain what it means for Russia and for global financial markets,Experts discuss the implications of Russia’s recent debt default for the global financial markets and Russia’s reputation,Russia’s recent default on its foreign debt – it’s first since 1918 – has been hailed as proof that the sanctions imposed by western governments since the invasion of Ukraine in February are working.A 30-day grace period on US$100 million (£82 million) in interest on two bonds ended on June 27 2022  with Russia’s repayments on this foreign debt not reaching creditors. While the Kremlin claims the payment has been held up by clearing house Euroclear  ratings agency Moody’s has predicted the country is likely to continue to default on payments because it is repaying in roubles  rather than the currency specified in the bond prospectuses.Amid this uncertainty  potential longer-term implications include the impact a default will have on Russia’s ability to attract investors  now and in the future.We asked a legal expert and an economist who have been following the situation to explain the significance of the defaults. Here’s what they said:Nasir Aminu  Senior Lecturer in Economics and Finance  Cardiff Metropolitan UniversityRussia’s failure to pay US$100 million in US dollar- and euro-denominated interest payments on June 27 2022 shows the Kremlin is running out of options to respond to western sanctions. The default on foreign debt was not unexpected. The economic sanctions placed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February have limited the country’s financial capabilities. This debt default  therefore  is a result of western governments’ ban on all transactions with the National Central Bank of Russia and the freezing of its foreign reserves  worth more than US$600 billion.In theory  the debt default on foreign creditors is surprising because Russia’s finances remain strong despite a protracted war in Ukraine. The country reportedly continues to receive revenues of about US$1 billion per day from the sale of oil to China  India and other Kremlin-friendly importers. This income means Russia did not default because of an inability to pay.Russia’s default will have a relatively small impact on global financial institutions  including its own financial sector. There is always a risk of global contagion – when an event has an indirect or unexpected effect on another part of the market – but foreign investors have had less exposure to Russia since it annexed Crimea in 2014. The few investors that do have high exposure are already looking to sell  although they face difficulties due to the western sanctions.European banks are the most exposed financial institutions to Russian debt. The most recent figures from the Bank for International Settlements  which cover up to the end of 2021  show French and Italian banks have the most exposure to Russia  with outstanding claims of more than US$20 billion  while Austrian banks have US$17.5 billion in outstanding claims on Russian debt.The most worrying consequence of debt default for Russia will be the loss of access to global investors through the international capital markets. The default will tint Russia’s reputation  making its bonds less attractive in the future due to the risk of further defaults. The country will have to pay a higher cost of borrowing to attract new investors and to keep those it already has because of the increased credit risk resulting from this recent default.Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal  Professor of Banking and Finance Law  Queen Mary University of LondonRussia’s missed interest payments were on two of its sovereign bonds: the 2026 US dollar and 2036 euro bonds.In addition to the actual currency of these bonds  both allow interest payments to be made in pounds or Swiss francs if  for reasons beyond its control  Russia is unable to make payments in US dollars or euros. The 2036 euro bond goes even further by adding the Russian rouble as a possible alternative payment currency. These additional options may seem useful  but creditors might prefer to avoid a currency mismatch by having Russia make repayments in the original currency of the bond.These bonds also include a currency indemnity clause  which would allow Russia to be discharged from its repayment obligations if the investor receives or recovers the entire amount due on the bond. Any payment in roubles must match the original amount owed when converted into US dollars or euros  however. In this case  roubles would probably be most useful to Russia since it has been largely cut off from the international financial markets.In any event  the full impact of the default remains uncertain until the global financial market gets clarity on the following questions:Would a payment deposited to an account in Russia in the name of the creditor amount to “receiving” the payment and therefore discharge Russia from its obligations? A creditor might receive repayments in this way  but actually recovering the money from the account could be complicated by government plans to restrict access to or transfers of Russia-based assets at the moment.Also  was Russia prevented from paying because of the western sanctions? If so  since this is outside of its control  Russia could argue it is not to blame for the default. If a court deems the situation is self-inflicted  however  Russia may not be excused.These issues would be subject to interpretation by a court of law. But Russia has not waived its sovereign immunity and has not submitted to the jurisdiction of a court named in either of the two bond prospectuses.

July 1  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Sanofi's licensure request for vaccine approval for the upcoming 2022-2023 flu season  including: Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine)  Flublok Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) and Fluzone Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine).5 This approval comes on the heels of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) preferential recommendation for adults 65+ including Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent and Flublok Quadrivalent.6 Following this licensure  Sanofi will begin to ship their vaccines helping to ensure more people  including some of our most vulnerable population of 65 years and older  will be immunized with the vaccine best suited for their needs as recommended by the ACIP.Influenza disproportionately impacts people over 65  underrepresented communities  and people with co-morbidities such as diabetes  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and heart disease.7 Since 2010  it's estimated by the CDC that between 70% and 85% of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65+  and between 50% and 70% of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations have occurred among people in this age group.4 ACIP's June 22nd recommendation will undoubtedly help reduce the risk of influenza cases and severe flu-related complications in this population at highest risk.Michael Greenberg  MD  MPHNorth America Medial Head of Vaccines at Sanofi""ACIP's recommendation is a first step to help improve protection against flu and its complications for this 65 years and older high-risk population. Not every flu vaccine is created equal and we are pleased with ACIP's acknowledgment that Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent & Flublok Quadrivalent have demonstrated improved protection from flu & its related complications through randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence.8 Of note ACIP recognized that Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent had the most data available  including evidence favoring its use over standard dose for all the benefit outcomes within the GRADE analysis; influenza illnesses  outpatient/ER visits  hospitalizations  and deaths.8 Nevertheless  we believe even more can be done to provide healthcare providers with clearer guidance. As a leader in flu vaccination  we remain committed to ensure adults 65 years and older have access to flu vaccines  proven to protect them from what really matters  such as flu-related hospitalizations due to cardiovascular events and pneumonia.""About the Composition of Sanofi's 2022-2023 Licensed and Approved Influenza VaccinesEach year  the FDA  World Health Organization (WHO)  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  and other partners collaborate by collecting and reviewing data on the circulating strains of influenza from around the world to identify those likely to cause the most illness in the upcoming flu season.9 Once strains are selected  flu vaccine manufacturers include the newly selected flu strains in their FDA-approved vaccines  and then submit applications to the FDA to include the new flu strains in their FDA-approved vaccines  including for Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent  Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluzone Quadrivalent.9 Today those requests for licensure were approved for the upcoming 2022-2023 flu season.5About Fluzone® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine)  Flublok® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) and Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine)Fluzone Quadrivalent  Flublok Quadrivalent  and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent are vaccines indicated for immunization against disease caused by influenza A and B strains contained in the vaccine. Fluzone Quadrivalent is given to people 6 months of age and older. Flublok Quadrivalent is given to people 18 years of age and older. Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent is given to people 65 years of age and older.With protection against four flu strains  Fluzone High-Dose is the only influenza vaccine licensed for use in adults 65 years of age and older to have demonstrated superior efficacy in a randomized controlled trial versus a standard dose influenza vaccine for the prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza illness and the only influenza vaccine with 10 years of data demonstrating protection from flu and its related complications.2 3 a b In a meta-analysis of 15 published reports  including approximately 34 million people  those who received Fluzone High-Dose experienced an 18% reduction in cardiorespiratory hospitalizations and 28% decrease in pneumonia hospitalizations  both of which are reductions above what the standard dose vaccines provided.3Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent builds on the legacy of the trivalent formulation  which was clinically proven to be 24.2% more effective at preventing flu than standard-dose Fluzone (Influenza Vaccine) in adults 65+.10 Based on data from Fluzone High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine)  side effects were slightly more frequent after vaccination with Fluzone High-Dose compared to a standard-dose vaccine.11The efficacy of trivalent formulation is relevant to Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent since both products are manufactured according to the same process and have overlapping compositions.2In a clinical study  Flublok Quadrivalent is the first and only recombinant influenza vaccine for adults 18+ that was proven to be 30% more effective than a standard dose vaccine at preventing flu infection in over 9 000 adults 50+.1 In adults 50+  the most common side effects were tenderness  and/or pain at the injection site; headache  and tiredness.1aProven superiority in a clinical trial between Fluzone High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine) (trivalent formulation) and a standard-dose influenza vaccine2bIncludes 10 years of evidence (2009-2019) with Fluzone High-Dose (trivalent formulation)3Important Safety Information for Fluzone® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine)  Flublok® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) and Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine)Fluzone Quadrivalent  Flublok Quadrivalent  and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine (including eggs or egg products for Fluzone Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent) or after previous dose of the vaccine. In addition  Fluzone Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction after previous dose of any influenza vaccine.Tell your health care provider if you have ever had Guillain-Barré syndrome (severe muscle weakness) after a previous influenza vaccination.If Fluzone Quadrivalent  Flublok Quadrivalent  and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent are given to people with a compromised immune system  including those receiving therapies that suppress the immune system  the immune response may be lower than expected.Vaccination with Fluzone Quadrivalent  Flublok Quadrivalent  and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent may not protect all people who receive the vaccine.For Fluzone Quadrivalent  in children 6 months through 35 months of age  the most common side effects were pain  tenderness  redness  and/or swelling where you got the shot; irritability  abnormal crying  general discomfort  drowsiness  loss of appetite  muscle aches  vomiting  and fever. In children 3 years through 8 years of age  the most common side effects were pain  redness  and/or swelling where you got the shot; muscle aches  general discomfort  and headache. In adults 18 years and older  the most common side effects were pain where you got the shot; muscle aches  headache  and general discomfort.For Flublok Quadrivalent  in adults 18 through 49 years of age  the most common side effects were tenderness  and/or pain where you got the shot; headache  tiredness  muscle aches  and joint pain. In adults 50 years of age and older the most common side effects were tenderness  and/or pain where you got the shot; headache and tiredness.For Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent  in adults 65 years of age and older  the most common side effects were pain  redness  and/or swelling where you got the shot; muscle aches  headache  and general discomfort.For Fluzone Quadrivalent  Flublok Quadrivalent  and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent  other side effects may occur.Please refer to the full Prescribing Information for Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent   Flublok Quadrivalent   or Fluzone Quadrivalent.
