7345,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/07/03/tencents-biggest-shareholder-just-made-a-huge-move/,Tencent's Biggest Shareholder Just Made a Huge Move to Create Value,Naspers/Prosus management may have finally gotten the message.,"For years  Tencent's (TCEHY -0.24%) largest shareholder  early investor Naspers (NPSNY 5.73%)  along with its cross-held holding company subsidiary Prosus (PROSY 2.75%)  has traded at a discount to its Tencent stake. Despite Naspers/Prosus' best efforts at financial engineering and diversifying its business into food delivery  digital payments  education technology  and e-commerce in emerging markets  the discount has continued to widen.Just how wide? Based on its recent net asset value  incorporating both prevailing market prices and analyst estimates for private assets  Prosus trades at just over half of its net asset value (NAV)  while Naspers is even cheaper  at around 45% of NAV.In its recent earnings release last week  however  Naspers/Prosus announced its boldest move to close the discount yet. While previous moves have failed  this new strategy is bigger  bolder  and could tangibly increase intrinsic value per share in a significant way.An open-ended repurchase program funded by Tencent salesEven though Naspers and Prosus have attempted to diversify their assets  and Tencent's stock has declined over the past year  Tencent still accounts for 77% of Naspers/Prosus' NAV. Meanwhile  most of Naspers/Prosus' other businesses are growing strongly but don't produce much cash flow. While the company has lots of liquidity  it also has just as much debt as cash and would probably like the ability to make an acquisition if an opportunity arises in this adverse environment.That leaves Naspers/Prosus with no other option to raise cash in order to buy back stock other than selling more Tencent. While the company initially said it wouldn't sell any more Tencent for three years after selling some of its stake in early 2021  management changed its tune  surprising the market last week.The new plan is for an open-ended sale of Tencent shares  along with a simultaneous repurchase of Naspers/Prosus shares. According to management  it will buy Naspers and Prosus shares in equal proportion to their ownership of total assets  with Naspers having 42% of the economic interest in Prosus' assets and Prosus shareholders outside of Naspers owning the remaining 58%. The program will occur as long as there is a ""significant"" discount  although management didn't give specifics on what that meant.While liquidating a very attractive  cash-flowing company like Tencent seems like a sacrifice  the discount is so large that Naspers and Prosus shareholders will actually see its ownership of Tencent increase on a per-share basis.For instance  management gave an example in which it sold $10 billion of Tencent and repurchased $10 billion of Prosus shares. That would lower Prosus' net asset value by 5.9%  but Prosus' share count would decrease by 13.5%. The result? An increase in NAV per share of 9%. A $20 billion sale and repurchase at the same level would increase NAV per share by 20%  and a $30 billion sale and repurchase would increase NAV per share by 38%.How this could be more effective than past movesNo doubt  Naspers and Prosus have made financial engineering moves in an attempt to close the discount before. However  this one seems like it has a much better chance of working.In 2019  Naspers created Prosus  a separate holding company for its non-South-African assets. Naspers  a South African company  had become so large on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange that management believed its size was limiting the amount asset managers could purchase. The thinking was that by creating Prosus and spinning off Prosus shares to Naspers shareholders on the Euronext Exchange  Naspers' market cap would shrink on the JSE  even though its assets would not go down. They would merely be transferred out of South Africa.However  that didn't work  likely because it created more complications with the two-company structure. In 2021  management then executed a share swap between Naspers and Prosus in an attempt to further shrink Naspers' weighting. However  that added even more complications  and the discount widened again.Meanwhile  Naspers has sold Tencent shares in the past  both in 2018 and then in 2021. However  the cash from those proceeds  while going partly to a buyback  mostly went to buying more companies across classifieds  digital payments  e-commerce  and other ventures. Those assets have declined in value over the past year along with Tencent as the tech market has crashed  so the NAV per share didn't really improve.However  this new change could work much better. The prior creation of Prosus was more of a financial engineering gimmick meant to decrease Naspers' weighting on an index. Meanwhile  investors aren't giving the company any credit for its diversification into other areas  still regarding the stock as a play on Tencent.This move  however  is large and open-ended and seems to be a capitulation on management's part that it must do something different to be regarded as anything other than a Tencent proxy. Meanwhile  a large-scale repurchase will make a tangible difference in value per share immediately. Naspers' management has tried to do everything in its power to hang on to as much Tencent as possible for the long term  but investors have shunned that strategy because it hasn't addressed the discount. However  management now seems to be capitulating  finally declaring the huge and widening discount ""unacceptable.""An interesting  idiosyncratic play in a tough marketI've been wrong in thinking Naspers/Prosus' past moves would help close the discount. However  this new strategy seems a bit different. With China now cutting interest rates and perhaps ending its regulatory crackdown on its tech giants  it's also possible Tencent may begin rising in value before U.S. indexes do. When you add this repurchase of Naspers/Prosus at half of its intrinsic value  it's an intriguing idiosyncratic option in an otherwise tough market.",positive,0.76,0.17,0.07,mixed,0.12,0.14,0.74,True,English,"['Biggest Shareholder', 'Huge Move', 'Tencent', 'Value', 'cross-held holding company subsidiary', 'recent net asset value', ""Prosus' net asset value"", 'recent earnings release', 'separate holding company', 'financial engineering gimmick', 'attractive, cash-flowing company', 'prevailing market prices', 'South African company', 'financial engineering moves', 'Johannesburg Stock Exchange', ""Naspers/Prosus' other businesses"", ""Naspers' market cap"", 'early investor Naspers', ""Prosus' share count"", 'asset managers', 'intrinsic value', 'Euronext Exchange', 'previous moves', 'other option', 'other ventures', 'tech market', 'other areas', 'past moves', 'largest shareholder', 'best efforts', 'food delivery', 'digital payments', 'education technology', 'emerging markets', 'analyst estimates', 'new strategy', 'significant way', 'adverse environment', 'new plan', 'open-ended sale', 'equal proportion', 'economic interest', '$20 billion sale', 'same level', '$30 billion sale', 'two-company structure', 'new change', 'prior creation', 'tangible difference', 'past year', 'Prosus shares', 'Prosus shareholders', 'open-ended repurchase', 'simultaneous repurchase', 'large-scale repurchase', 'private assets', 'total assets', 'South-African assets', 'boldest move', 'three years', 'Naspers shareholders', ""Naspers' weighting"", 'share basis', 'share swap', 'Tencent sales', 'Tencent shares', 'Tencent proxy', ""Prosus' assets"", 'cash flow', 'significant"" discount', 'Tencent stake', 'Tencent increase', ""Naspers/Prosus' NAV"", ""Naspers' management"", 'TCEHY', 'NPSNY', 'PROSY', 'e-commerce', 'half', 'lots', 'liquidity', 'debt', 'ability', 'acquisition', 'opportunity', 'order', 'tune', 'ownership', 'program', 'specifics', 'sacrifice', 'instance', 'example', 'result', 'attempt', 'chance', 'size', 'amount', 'thinking', 'JSE', 'complications', 'proceeds', 'buyback', 'companies', 'classifieds', 'index', 'investors', 'credit', 'diversification', 'play', 'capitulation', 'part', 'something']",2022-07-03,2022-07-03,fool.com
