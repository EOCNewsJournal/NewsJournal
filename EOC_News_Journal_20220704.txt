7345,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/07/03/tencents-biggest-shareholder-just-made-a-huge-move/,Tencent's Biggest Shareholder Just Made a Huge Move to Create Value,Naspers/Prosus management may have finally gotten the message.,"For years  Tencent's (TCEHY -0.24%) largest shareholder  early investor Naspers (NPSNY 5.73%)  along with its cross-held holding company subsidiary Prosus (PROSY 2.75%)  has traded at a discount to its Tencent stake. Despite Naspers/Prosus' best efforts at financial engineering and diversifying its business into food delivery  digital payments  education technology  and e-commerce in emerging markets  the discount has continued to widen.Just how wide? Based on its recent net asset value  incorporating both prevailing market prices and analyst estimates for private assets  Prosus trades at just over half of its net asset value (NAV)  while Naspers is even cheaper  at around 45% of NAV.In its recent earnings release last week  however  Naspers/Prosus announced its boldest move to close the discount yet. While previous moves have failed  this new strategy is bigger  bolder  and could tangibly increase intrinsic value per share in a significant way.An open-ended repurchase program funded by Tencent salesEven though Naspers and Prosus have attempted to diversify their assets  and Tencent's stock has declined over the past year  Tencent still accounts for 77% of Naspers/Prosus' NAV. Meanwhile  most of Naspers/Prosus' other businesses are growing strongly but don't produce much cash flow. While the company has lots of liquidity  it also has just as much debt as cash and would probably like the ability to make an acquisition if an opportunity arises in this adverse environment.That leaves Naspers/Prosus with no other option to raise cash in order to buy back stock other than selling more Tencent. While the company initially said it wouldn't sell any more Tencent for three years after selling some of its stake in early 2021  management changed its tune  surprising the market last week.The new plan is for an open-ended sale of Tencent shares  along with a simultaneous repurchase of Naspers/Prosus shares. According to management  it will buy Naspers and Prosus shares in equal proportion to their ownership of total assets  with Naspers having 42% of the economic interest in Prosus' assets and Prosus shareholders outside of Naspers owning the remaining 58%. The program will occur as long as there is a ""significant"" discount  although management didn't give specifics on what that meant.While liquidating a very attractive  cash-flowing company like Tencent seems like a sacrifice  the discount is so large that Naspers and Prosus shareholders will actually see its ownership of Tencent increase on a per-share basis.For instance  management gave an example in which it sold $10 billion of Tencent and repurchased $10 billion of Prosus shares. That would lower Prosus' net asset value by 5.9%  but Prosus' share count would decrease by 13.5%. The result? An increase in NAV per share of 9%. A $20 billion sale and repurchase at the same level would increase NAV per share by 20%  and a $30 billion sale and repurchase would increase NAV per share by 38%.How this could be more effective than past movesNo doubt  Naspers and Prosus have made financial engineering moves in an attempt to close the discount before. However  this one seems like it has a much better chance of working.In 2019  Naspers created Prosus  a separate holding company for its non-South-African assets. Naspers  a South African company  had become so large on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange that management believed its size was limiting the amount asset managers could purchase. The thinking was that by creating Prosus and spinning off Prosus shares to Naspers shareholders on the Euronext Exchange  Naspers' market cap would shrink on the JSE  even though its assets would not go down. They would merely be transferred out of South Africa.However  that didn't work  likely because it created more complications with the two-company structure. In 2021  management then executed a share swap between Naspers and Prosus in an attempt to further shrink Naspers' weighting. However  that added even more complications  and the discount widened again.Meanwhile  Naspers has sold Tencent shares in the past  both in 2018 and then in 2021. However  the cash from those proceeds  while going partly to a buyback  mostly went to buying more companies across classifieds  digital payments  e-commerce  and other ventures. Those assets have declined in value over the past year along with Tencent as the tech market has crashed  so the NAV per share didn't really improve.However  this new change could work much better. The prior creation of Prosus was more of a financial engineering gimmick meant to decrease Naspers' weighting on an index. Meanwhile  investors aren't giving the company any credit for its diversification into other areas  still regarding the stock as a play on Tencent.This move  however  is large and open-ended and seems to be a capitulation on management's part that it must do something different to be regarded as anything other than a Tencent proxy. Meanwhile  a large-scale repurchase will make a tangible difference in value per share immediately. Naspers' management has tried to do everything in its power to hang on to as much Tencent as possible for the long term  but investors have shunned that strategy because it hasn't addressed the discount. However  management now seems to be capitulating  finally declaring the huge and widening discount ""unacceptable.""An interesting  idiosyncratic play in a tough marketI've been wrong in thinking Naspers/Prosus' past moves would help close the discount. However  this new strategy seems a bit different. With China now cutting interest rates and perhaps ending its regulatory crackdown on its tech giants  it's also possible Tencent may begin rising in value before U.S. indexes do. When you add this repurchase of Naspers/Prosus at half of its intrinsic value  it's an intriguing idiosyncratic option in an otherwise tough market.",positive,0.76,0.17,0.07,mixed,0.12,0.14,0.74,True,English,"['Biggest Shareholder', 'Huge Move', 'Tencent', 'Value', 'cross-held holding company subsidiary', 'recent net asset value', ""Prosus' net asset value"", 'recent earnings release', 'separate holding company', 'financial engineering gimmick', 'attractive, cash-flowing company', 'prevailing market prices', 'South African company', 'financial engineering moves', 'Johannesburg Stock Exchange', ""Naspers/Prosus' other businesses"", ""Naspers' market cap"", 'early investor Naspers', ""Prosus' share count"", 'asset managers', 'intrinsic value', 'Euronext Exchange', 'previous moves', 'other option', 'other ventures', 'tech market', 'other areas', 'past moves', 'largest shareholder', 'best efforts', 'food delivery', 'digital payments', 'education technology', 'emerging markets', 'analyst estimates', 'new strategy', 'significant way', 'adverse environment', 'new plan', 'open-ended sale', 'equal proportion', 'economic interest', '$20 billion sale', 'same level', '$30 billion sale', 'two-company structure', 'new change', 'prior creation', 'tangible difference', 'past year', 'Prosus shares', 'Prosus shareholders', 'open-ended repurchase', 'simultaneous repurchase', 'large-scale repurchase', 'private assets', 'total assets', 'South-African assets', 'boldest move', 'three years', 'Naspers shareholders', ""Naspers' weighting"", 'share basis', 'share swap', 'Tencent sales', 'Tencent shares', 'Tencent proxy', ""Prosus' assets"", 'cash flow', 'significant"" discount', 'Tencent stake', 'Tencent increase', ""Naspers/Prosus' NAV"", ""Naspers' management"", 'TCEHY', 'NPSNY', 'PROSY', 'e-commerce', 'half', 'lots', 'liquidity', 'debt', 'ability', 'acquisition', 'opportunity', 'order', 'tune', 'ownership', 'program', 'specifics', 'sacrifice', 'instance', 'example', 'result', 'attempt', 'chance', 'size', 'amount', 'thinking', 'JSE', 'complications', 'proceeds', 'buyback', 'companies', 'classifieds', 'index', 'investors', 'credit', 'diversification', 'play', 'capitulation', 'part', 'something']",2022-07-03,2022-07-04,fool.com

A 30-day grace,Russia’s recent default on its foreign debt – it’s first since 1918 – has been hailed as proof that the sanctions imposed by western governments since the invasion of Ukraine in February are working.A 30-day grace period on US$100 million (£82 million) in interest on two bonds ended on June 27 2022  with Russia’s repayments on this foreign debt not reaching creditors. While the Kremlin claims the payment has been held up by clearing house Euroclear  ratings agency Moody’s has predicted the country is likely to continue to default on payments because it is repaying in roubles  rather than the currency specified in the bond prospectuses.Amid this uncertainty  potential longer-term implications include the impact a default will have on Russia’s ability to attract investors  now and in the future.We asked a legal expert and an economist who have been following the situation to explain the significance of the defaults. Here’s what they said:Nasir Aminu  Senior Lecturer in Economics and Finance  Cardiff Metropolitan UniversityRussia’s failure to pay US$100 million in US dollar- and euro-denominated interest payments on June 27 2022 shows the Kremlin is running out of options to respond to western sanctions. The default on foreign debt was not unexpected. The economic sanctions placed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February have limited the country’s financial capabilities. This debt default  therefore  is a result of western governments’ ban on all transactions with the National Central Bank of Russia and the freezing of its foreign reserves  worth more than US$600 billion.In theory  the debt default on foreign creditors is surprising because Russia’s finances remain strong despite a protracted war in Ukraine. The country reportedly continues to receive revenues of about US$1 billion per day from the sale of oil to China  India and other Kremlin-friendly importers. This income means Russia did not default because of an inability to pay.Russia’s default will have a relatively small impact on global financial institutions  including its own financial sector. There is always a risk of global contagion – when an event has an indirect or unexpected effect on another part of the market – but foreign investors have had less exposure to Russia since it annexed Crimea in 2014. The few investors that do have high exposure are already looking to sell  although they face difficulties due to the western sanctions.European banks are the most exposed financial institutions to Russian debt. The most recent figures from the Bank for International Settlements  which cover up to the end of 2021  show French and Italian banks have the most exposure to Russia  with outstanding claims of more than US$20 billion  while Austrian banks have US$17.5 billion in outstanding claims on Russian debt.The most worrying consequence of debt default for Russia will be the loss of access to global investors through the international capital markets. The default will tint Russia’s reputation  making its bonds less attractive in the future due to the risk of further defaults. The country will have to pay a higher cost of borrowing to attract new investors and to keep those it already has because of the increased credit risk resulting from this recent default.Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal  Professor of Banking and Finance Law  Queen Mary University of LondonRussia’s missed interest payments were on two of its sovereign bonds: the 2026 US dollar and 2036 euro bonds.In addition to the actual currency of these bonds  both allow interest payments to be made in pounds or Swiss francs if  for reasons beyond its control  Russia is unable to make payments in US dollars or euros. The 2036 euro bond goes even further by adding the Russian rouble as a possible alternative payment currency. These additional options may seem useful  but creditors might prefer to avoid a currency mismatch by having Russia make repayments in the original currency of the bond.These bonds also include a currency indemnity clause  which would allow Russia to be discharged from its repayment obligations if the investor receives or recovers the entire amount due on the bond. Any payment in roubles must match the original amount owed when converted into US dollars or euros  however. In this case  roubles would probably be most useful to Russia since it has been largely cut off from the international financial markets.In any event  the full impact of the default remains uncertain until the global financial market gets clarity on the following questions:Would a payment deposited to an account in Russia in the name of the creditor amount to “receiving” the payment and therefore discharge Russia from its obligations? A creditor might receive repayments in this way  but actually recovering the money from the account could be complicated by government plans to restrict access to or transfers of Russia-based assets at the moment.Also  was Russia prevented from paying because of the western sanctions? If so  since this is outside of its control  Russia could argue it is not to blame for the default. If a court deems the situation is self-inflicted  however  Russia may not be excused.These issues would be subject to interpretation by a court of law. But Russia has not waived its sovereign immunity and has not submitted to the jurisdiction of a court named in either of the two bond prospectuses.

This extends the Company's cash runway until the end of the second quarter 2023  based on existing cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits and without taking into account the credit facility with the European Investment Bank (the “EIB”). The Company also finalized the documentation requirement under the credit facility with the EIB (the ""Finance Contract"") for up to €50 million as announced on May 16  2022 by the signing of a warrant agreement (the ""Warrant Agreement""). The Company plans to use the proceeds from the EIB facility towards its preclinical and clinical pipeline  including to help fund a portion of its Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in patients with NASH.Equity raised through the At-The-Market Program:On June 15  2022  the Company sold 1 260 618 American Depositary Shares (""ADS"") for an amount of $9 769 789.501 pursuant to the Company's ATM program established on August 2  2021  through Jefferies LLC  acting as sales agent. Each ADS represents one ordinary share of the Company.The new shares underlying the ADS issued under the ATM Program represented approximatively 3% of the share capital of the Company as of the date of the transaction.Non-dilutive debt financing of €5.3m in the form of an additional state-guaranteed loan facility and two loans from a stimulus economic plan:In June 2022  the Company signed three loan agreements with French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million  guaranteed in part by the French State. Implemented as part of a state-guaranteed PGE loan facility (""Prêt Garanti par l’Etat"") with Bpifrance and two loans from a stimulus economic plan (""Prêts Participatifs Relance"") granted by Crédit Agricole Champagne-Bourgogne and Société Générale  they are in large part guaranteed by the French State and have a duration of eight-year and a four-year repayment schedule.Terms of the Finance Contract:As previously announced  the Finance Contract is divided into two tranches of €25 million each which are subject to the completion of certain condition precedents. The disbursement of the first tranche (with capitalized interest of 8% and a maturity date of four years) is subject to  among other conditions  (i) the Company entering into a subscription agreement under the Warrant Agreement to issue warrants to the EIB and (ii) the receipt by the Company of an aggregate amount of at least €18 million  paid either through the issuance of new Company shares  or through upfront or milestone payments. As of today  the Company raised €9.3 million through a capital increase under its ATM Program.The disbursement of the second tranche of €25 million (with capitalized interest of 7% and a maturity date of three years) is further subject to  among other conditions  (i) the full drawdown of the first tranche  (ii) the issue of the second tranche of warrants  (iii) the receipt by the Company of an aggregate amount of at least €70 million (inclusive of the €18 million mentioned above)  made of either the issuance of new Company shares  or through upfront or milestone payments coming from business development activities on the various assets of the Company  (iv) (a) an out-licensing  partnership or royalty transaction with an upfront payment of at least €10 million  or (b) the initiation of a Phase III clinical trial of cedirogant by AbbVie Inc; and (v) operational criteria based on patient enrollment and number of sites activated in the Company’s Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in patients with NASH.The two tranches will be available within 36 months following the signature of the Finance Contract.Prepayment events under the Finance Contract:The Finance Contract may  in certain circumstances  be prepaid  in whole or in part  for a prepayment fee  either at the election of the Company or as a result of EIB’s demand following certain prepayment events  including a change of control or change in senior management of the Company.Subject to certain terms and conditions  upon the occurrence of usual events of default (i.e. including payment default  misrepresentation  cross default)  EIB may demand immediate repayment by the Company of all or part of the outstanding loan and/or cancel the undisbursed tranches.Terms and Conditions of the warrants:As described above  in connection with the Finance Contract  the Company agreed to issue warrants to EIB as a condition to the funding of each tranche. The number of warrants to be issued to EIB will be determined based on (i) the aggregate amount raised by the Company through one or more equity offerings  or through upfront or milestone payments  from the date of the Finance Contract to the time of the disbursement of the relevant tranche  and (ii)(a) the average price per share paid for the Company shares in its most recent qualifying equity offering  or (b) for the first tranche only  in case of no qualifying equity offering  the volume weighted average price per share of the Company shares over the last 180 calendar days. The subscription price shall be €0.01 per warrant.The warrants have a maturity of twelve years and shall be exercisable following the earliest to occur of (i) a change of control event  (ii) the maturity date of the first tranche  (iii) an event of default under the Finance Contract  or (iv) a repayment demand by the EIB under the Finance Contract. The warrants shall automatically be deemed null and void if they are not exercised within the twelve-year period.

ELEMANTA H2 will also enable hydrogen bunkering to meet the refueling needs of future hydrogen ships.Maritime transport accounted for 13.5% of European total greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. In order to reach the European objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030  the sector must accelerate its energy transition. ELEMANTA H2 aims to contribute to the decarbonization of port activities.The partners have identified the Port of Rouen and the Rubis Terminal location as a pioneer site because of its strategic position close to Paris. With the support of Normandie Energies and the port operator HAROPA  a demonstration barge will embed a high-power hydrogen fuel cell system manufactured in France by HDF Energy. A high-pressure green hydrogen storage system will cover the need for autonomy during port calls.ELEMANTA H2 will be commissioned in 2025 and will offer a low-carbon alternative to the diesel generators that currently power these ships at berth  reducing their CO2 emissions by 85% and all nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions during port calls.The objective is to standardize and replicate the solution  with higher power levels  in the main European ports  including future large hydrogen hub projects. Finally  locally produced hydrogen reduces the impact of the volatility of international fossil fuel markets.Damien Havard  President of HDF Energy  said: ""HDF is proud to bring its expertise in hydrogen technologies to the development of the Elemanta H2 barge.
