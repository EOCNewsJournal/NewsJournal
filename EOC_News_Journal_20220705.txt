This extends the Company's cash runway until the end of the second quarter 2023  based on existing cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits and without taking into account the credit facility with the European Investment Bank (the “EIB”). The Company also finalized the documentation requirement under the credit facility with the EIB (the ""Finance Contract"") for up to €50 million as announced on May 16  2022 by the signing of a warrant agreement (the ""Warrant Agreement""). The Company plans to use the proceeds from the EIB facility towards its preclinical and clinical pipeline  including to help fund a portion of its Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in patients with NASH.Equity raised through the At-The-Market Program:On June 15  2022  the Company sold 1 260 618 American Depositary Shares (""ADS"") for an amount of $9 769 789.501 pursuant to the Company's ATM program established on August 2  2021  through Jefferies LLC  acting as sales agent. Each ADS represents one ordinary share of the Company.The new shares underlying the ADS issued under the ATM Program represented approximatively 3% of the share capital of the Company as of the date of the transaction.Non-dilutive debt financing of €5.3m in the form of an additional state-guaranteed loan facility and two loans from a stimulus economic plan:In June 2022  the Company signed three loan agreements with French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million  guaranteed in part by the French State. Implemented as part of a state-guaranteed PGE loan facility (""Prêt Garanti par l’Etat"") with Bpifrance and two loans from a stimulus economic plan (""Prêts Participatifs Relance"") granted by Crédit Agricole Champagne-Bourgogne and Société Générale  they are in large part guaranteed by the French State and have a duration of eight-year and a four-year repayment schedule.Terms of the Finance Contract:As previously announced  the Finance Contract is divided into two tranches of €25 million each which are subject to the completion of certain condition precedents. The disbursement of the first tranche (with capitalized interest of 8% and a maturity date of four years) is subject to  among other conditions  (i) the Company entering into a subscription agreement under the Warrant Agreement to issue warrants to the EIB and (ii) the receipt by the Company of an aggregate amount of at least €18 million  paid either through the issuance of new Company shares  or through upfront or milestone payments. As of today  the Company raised €9.3 million through a capital increase under its ATM Program.The disbursement of the second tranche of €25 million (with capitalized interest of 7% and a maturity date of three years) is further subject to  among other conditions  (i) the full drawdown of the first tranche  (ii) the issue of the second tranche of warrants  (iii) the receipt by the Company of an aggregate amount of at least €70 million (inclusive of the €18 million mentioned above)  made of either the issuance of new Company shares  or through upfront or milestone payments coming from business development activities on the various assets of the Company  (iv) (a) an out-licensing  partnership or royalty transaction with an upfront payment of at least €10 million  or (b) the initiation of a Phase III clinical trial of cedirogant by AbbVie Inc; and (v) operational criteria based on patient enrollment and number of sites activated in the Company’s Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in patients with NASH.The two tranches will be available within 36 months following the signature of the Finance Contract.Prepayment events under the Finance Contract:The Finance Contract may  in certain circumstances  be prepaid  in whole or in part  for a prepayment fee  either at the election of the Company or as a result of EIB’s demand following certain prepayment events  including a change of control or change in senior management of the Company.Subject to certain terms and conditions  upon the occurrence of usual events of default (i.e. including payment default  misrepresentation  cross default)  EIB may demand immediate repayment by the Company of all or part of the outstanding loan and/or cancel the undisbursed tranches.Terms and Conditions of the warrants:As described above  in connection with the Finance Contract  the Company agreed to issue warrants to EIB as a condition to the funding of each tranche. The number of warrants to be issued to EIB will be determined based on (i) the aggregate amount raised by the Company through one or more equity offerings  or through upfront or milestone payments  from the date of the Finance Contract to the time of the disbursement of the relevant tranche  and (ii)(a) the average price per share paid for the Company shares in its most recent qualifying equity offering  or (b) for the first tranche only  in case of no qualifying equity offering  the volume weighted average price per share of the Company shares over the last 180 calendar days. The subscription price shall be €0.01 per warrant.The warrants have a maturity of twelve years and shall be exercisable following the earliest to occur of (i) a change of control event  (ii) the maturity date of the first tranche  (iii) an event of default under the Finance Contract  or (iv) a repayment demand by the EIB under the Finance Contract. The warrants shall automatically be deemed null and void if they are not exercised within the twelve-year period. Each warrant will entitle EIB to one ordinary share of the Company in exchange for the exercise price (subject to anti-dilutive provisions).The exercise price will be equal to 95% of the volume weighted average of the trading price of the Company shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris for the last trading session preceding the decision of the competent body of the Company to issue such warrant. EIB shall be entitled to a put option at its intrinsic value  (subject to a cap equal to the drawn amount under the Finance Contract) to require the Company to buy back all or part of the warrants then exercisable but not yet exercised in certain circumstances (for instance in case of change of control or at the maturity date of the first tranche or in case of event of default). Furthermore  the Company shall be entitled to a call option to require EIB to sell to the Company (or a substitute third party) all the warrants  and a right of first refusal to buy back any warrants that are offered for sale to a third party  subject to certain exceptions.Pursuant to the provisions of the Warrant Agreement  if the first tranche of the warrants was issued today  the underlying shares would represent a potential dilution of approximatively 3.2% of the current share capital of the Company2.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs.

ELEMANTA H2 will also enable hydrogen bunkering to meet the refueling needs of future hydrogen ships.Maritime transport accounted for 13.5% of European total greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. In order to reach the European objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030  the sector must accelerate its energy transition. ELEMANTA H2 aims to contribute to the decarbonization of port activities.The partners have identified the Port of Rouen and the Rubis Terminal location as a pioneer site because of its strategic position close to Paris. With the support of Normandie Energies and the port operator HAROPA  a demonstration barge will embed a high-power hydrogen fuel cell system manufactured in France by HDF Energy. A high-pressure green hydrogen storage system will cover the need for autonomy during port calls.ELEMANTA H2 will be commissioned in 2025 and will offer a low-carbon alternative to the diesel generators that currently power these ships at berth  reducing their CO2 emissions by 85% and all nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions during port calls.The objective is to standardize and replicate the solution  with higher power levels  in the main European ports  including future large hydrogen hub projects. Finally  locally produced hydrogen reduces the impact of the volatility of international fossil fuel markets.Damien Havard  President of HDF Energy  said: ""HDF is proud to bring its expertise in hydrogen technologies to the development of the Elemanta H2 barge.

IPC will be returning US$100 million to participating shareholders ,"NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION IN OR TO  OR TO ANY PERSON LOCATED IN OR RESIDING IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE THE ISSUANCE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT IS PROHIBITED BY LAW. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT MAY BE CONTRARY TO THE LAW IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.International Petroleum Corporation (IPC or the Corporation) (TSX  Nasdaq Stockholm: IPCO) is pleased to announce the results of its substantial issuer bid (the Offer) under which it will accept for purchase for cancellation 8 258 064 of its common shares (Shares) at a purchase price of CDN$15.50 (equivalent to approximately SEK 122 as at the expiry date of the Offer) per Share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately CDN$128 million (equivalent to approximately SEK 1 007 million and US$100 million‬ as at the expiry date of the Offer). Shares to be purchased under the Offer represent approximately 5.5% of the issued and outstanding Shares as at May 16  2022  the date the Offer was commenced. Immediately following completion of the Offer  there will be 142 707 949 Shares issued and outstanding.Mike Nicholson  IPC’s Chief Executive Officer  commented: “We are very pleased to have concluded our first Substantial Issuer Bid in line with our capital allocation framework to materially increase returns to shareholders in a higher oil price environment. IPC will be returning US$100 million to participating shareholders  with our remaining shareholders benefiting from the cancellation of the repurchased shares. We now intend to continue to distribute value to our shareholders by restarting our Normal Course Issuer Bid that has been on hold pending completion of the Offer.”Based on the final count by Computershare Investor Services Inc.  the Canadian depositary for the Offer  a total of 8 815 989 Shares were validly deposited to the Offer and not withdrawn  including 100 000 Shares that were tendered through the guaranteed delivery procedure. Payment for the Shares accepted for purchase under the Offer will occur in accordance with the terms of the Offer and applicable securities laws. As the Offer was oversubscribed  shareholders who made auction tenders at a price of CDN$15.50 or less per Share and purchase price tenders are expected to have between approximately 93.7% and 94.7% of their successfully tendered Shares purchased by IPC. The Canadian depositary will return all other Shares tendered and not purchased.The Corporation expects to be eligible to recommence purchases under its normal course issuer bid after all Shares accepted for purchase under the Offer have been taken up.Shareholders who hold Shares directly or indirectly through Swedish central securities depository system maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB (Euroclear) will receive a corresponding amount in Swedish Krona to the purchase price in Canadian dollars  less an amount on account of Canadian withholding taxes. The corresponding amount in Swedish Krona for the purchase price will be determined by Pareto Securities AB  the Swedish manager for the Offer  based on the available market rate on the date the purchase price is converted from Canadian dollars to Swedish Krona. The risk of any fluctuations in such foreign exchange rate  including risks relating to the particular date and time at which funds are converted  will be borne solely by the tendering shareholders who hold Shares directly or indirectly through Euroclear.To assist shareholders in determining the tax consequences of the Offer  IPC estimates that for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) a deemed dividend in the amount of CDN$12.50 per Share will be triggered on the repurchase of each Share  based on the estimated paid-up capital of CDN$3.00 per Share as at the date the Shares are purchased for cancellation. For the purposes of subsection 191(4) of the Income Tax Act (Canada)  the “specified amount” in respect of each Share is CDN$15.45. Shareholders should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the income tax consequences of the disposition of their Shares under the Offer.Details of the Offer are included in the formal offer to purchase and issuer bid circular dated May 11  2022  as amended by a notice of variation dated June 8  2022  and the amended letter of transmittal and amended notice of guaranteed delivery  which have been filed with the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities and made available  without charge  on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and the Corporation's website at www.international-petroleum.com.The information relating to the Offer contained in this press release is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell Shares.International Petroleum Corp.

The information was submitted for publication  through the contact persons set out above  at 8:30 am (Central European Summer Time) on June 29  2022.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains statements and information which constitute “forward-looking statements” or “forward-looking information” (within the meaning of applicable securities laws). Such statements and information (together  forward-looking statements) relate to future events. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release  unless otherwise indicated. IPC does not intend  and does not assume any obligation  to update these forward-looking statements  except as required by applicable securities laws.All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions  expectations  beliefs  plans  projections  forecasts  guidance  budgets  objectives  assumptions or future events or performance (often  but not always  using words or phrases such as “seek”  “anticipate”  “plan”  “continue”  “estimate”  “expect”  “may”  “will”  “project”  “forecast”  “predict”  “potential”  “targeting”  “intend”  “could”  “might”  “should”  “believe”  “budget” and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be “forward-looking statements”. Forward-looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements with respect to: number of Shares tendered through notice of guaranteed delivery; pro-ration factor with respect to Shares tendered to the Offer; timing for payment for the Shares accepted for purchase under the Offer and the timing for recommencement of IPC’s normal course issuer bid  including the benefits and value to IPC shareholders as a result thereof.The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by IPC  including expectations and assumptions concerning the number of Shares properly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to expiration of the Offer; and that Shares tendered through notice of guaranteed delivery will be delivered within the prescribed two trading day settlement period.Although IPC believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable  undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because IPC can give no assurances that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions  by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include  but are not limited to: changes in or interpretation of laws or regulations and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

These molecules have separate and distinct mechanisms of action: PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-stereoisomer of pioglitazone which exerts effects via multiple non-genomic pathways engaged by thiazolidinedione molecules; PXL770 is a novel  first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator. Both compounds are preparing to enter into Phase 2a clinical Proof-of-Concept (POC) biomarker studies in ALD patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) as soon as possible  subject to financing.An article on PXL065 has been published in The Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (“JIMD”) and is entitled “Therapeutic potential of deuterium-stabilized (R)-pioglitazone - PXL065 - for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy”. It is available here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35510808/.An article on PXL770 has been published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (“JPET”)  and is entitled “Beneficial effects of the direct AMP-Kinase activator PXL770 in in vitro and in vivo models of X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy”. This publication is available here: https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/early/2022/06/25/jpet.122.001208.These publications describe similar beneficial preclinical profiles of PXL770 and PXL065 in models of ALD. Elevated levels of toxic very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are a driver of ALD pathology. The published in vitro results show correction of this phenotype in ALD patient-derived cells. In a classical in vivo rodent model of ALD  elevated VLCFA levels were also suppressed by chronic treatment with both compounds (in plasma  brain and spinal cord). The two compounds also improved mitochondrial function and signs of inflammation in patient-derived cells. Importantly  improvements in neurologic deficits were also documented in the ALD mouse model (sciatic nerve morphology and locomotor function) with each of the two compounds. Given different mechanisms of action  it is anticipated that pursuit of the pending (identical design) Phase 2a clinical studies could yield results that will help determine diffentiation between these agents in this disease.About ALDX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an orphan neurometabolic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which encodes for a key protein that is required for metabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) by peroxisomes (cellular organelles). ALD is the most common leukodystrophy with a prevalence similar to hemophilia – up to 1/10 000 individuals in the general population have ALD [https://rarediseases.org]. Forms of this disease include cerebral ALD (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) which is the most common form – typically occurring in adolescence through adulthood. AMN is characterized by chronic and progressive distal axonopathy involving the long tracts of the spinal cord and to a lesser extent the peripheral nerves resulting in progressive stiffness and weakness in the legs  impaired gait and balance  incontinence  and loss of sensation. Nearly all men with a diagnosis of ALD will develop AMN  and many women also present with features of AMN with a later onset. C-ALD is characterized by inflammatory demyelination of cells in the brain and typically afflicts children  but many men with AMN may also develop cerebral disease; these white matter brain lesions lead to severe neurologic deficits and death. There are no approved medicines for ALD (other than glucocorticoid supplements for associated adrenal insufficiency). C-ALD when first detected in early childhood  can be treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HSCT is currently limited to early stage of C-ALD and this procedure is at risk of severe adverse reactions.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. Poxel has clinical and earlier-stage programs from its adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator and deuterated TZD platforms targeting chronic and rare metabolic diseases. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) is in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). PXL770  a first-in-class direct AMPK activator  has successfully completed a Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of NASH  which met its objectives. For the rare inherited metabolic disorder  adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)  the company intends to initiate Phase 2a proof of concept studies with PXL065 and PXL770 in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). TWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)  Poxel’s first-in-class lead product that targets mitochondrial dysfunction  has been approved and launched for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan. Poxel expects to receive royalties and sales-based payments from Sumitomo Pharma. Poxel has a strategic partnership with Sumitomo Pharma for Imeglimin in Japan  China  South Korea  Taiwan and nine other Southeast Asian countries. The Company intends to generate further growth through strategic partnerships and pipeline development.

Investment bank Raymond James has previously said that music streaming was in a better position than video streaming  urging investors not to dump streaming shares too quickly.“So what we see in the competitive environment for streaming music is a lot more stable environment than you see  for instance  in streaming video  where content owners are increasingly taking ownership of their content  walling it off  going directly to consumers”  analyst Andrew Marok said.This was echoed by analyst Ian Whittaker  who told City A.M. that the fact that music giants generally don’t need to create their own content like Prime Video or Disney + do means there is less pressure for constant heavy investment.Whittaker also said that the lack of exclusivity for most music on specific platform means the consumer doesn’t need multiple subscriptions nor has the same incentive to flip between services to watch a must watched programme: Elton John’s hits can coexist on Spotify and Apple Music.,neutral,0.02,0.64,0.34,mixed,0.25,0.16,0.58,True,English,"['French music streamer', 'Deezer', 'debut', 'Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueira', 'proud French tech Unicorn', 'French music streamer Deezer', 'tough “market conditions', 'money equity valuation', 'analyst Andrew Marok', 'City A.M.', 'constant heavy investment', 'tough debut day', 'France-based SPAC I2PO', 'analyst Ian Whittaker', 'unicorn firm', 'French company', 'Investment bank', 'Apple Music', 'music streaming', 'streaming music', 'music giants', 'most music', 'bell-ringing ceremony', 'Raymond James', 'video streaming', 'competitive environment', 'stable environment', 'streaming video', 'Prime Video', 'less pressure', 'specific platform', 'multiple subscriptions', 'same incentive', 'Elton John', 'Paris Euronext', 'streaming shares', 'content owners', '35 per', '8.50 euros', 'stock', 'markets', 'eyebrows', 'Spotify', 'leap', 'faith', 'position', 'investors', 'instance', 'ownership', 'consumers', 'fact', 'Disney', 'lack', 'exclusivity', 'services', 'programme', 'hits']",2022-07-05,2022-07-05,cityam.com

7426,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/22522/the-bitcoin-crypto-etf-primer-series-part-iii,The ‘Bitcoin (Crypto) ETF’ Primer Series: PART III (Rodrigo Zepeda),By Rodrigo Zepeda  CEO  Storm-7 Consulting Crypto Market Developments in Europe and the United Stat,By Rodrigo Zepeda  CEO  Storm-7 ConsultingCrypto Market Developments in Europe and the United StatesIn Part I of this Blog Series  I noted that crypto commentators such as Moeller (2022) had made statements such as:“Enthusiasts view a spot ETF as a more legitimate method of investment because a spot ETF involves holding Bitcoin” and“Crypto industry pundits often fight for a firm to establish a Bitcoin spot ETF as they believe that markets will take Bitcoin seriously after a spot ETF has been established”.We can now see why such observations in relation to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are elementary and misinformed. They are elementary because they are generalistic and are therefore prone to potentially mislead crypto investors. When we discuss crypto investments  we need precision. We need to identify which type of enthusiasts we are discussing. Are they crypto enthusiasts or financial investment enthusiasts  or a mixture of both? And we most certainly need to know which countries they represent.Crypto investments in Europe  will be different to those in the United States (US)  which will both be different to those in Vietnam  Singapore  or Hong Kong. Moreover  we previously saw that ETF investments can be undertaken with physical (full/optimised) replication or with synthetic replication (The Investment Association 2018  pp. 6-7). So  whether ETFs physically hold the underlying asset  or they replicate the asset synthetically  this in no way affects their legitimacy  as all such methods form completely legitimate ETF investment methodologies.Therefore  in financial markets  speaking of the difference in legitimacy of ETF investment method in terms of physically holding an asset  or synthetically replicating the asset  is nonsensical. This is a misinformed view. The same can be said of any discussion concerning “Crypto industry pundits”  “markets”  and taking Bitcoin seriously. Which crypto markets  or financial markets are we talking about? We previously identified that the most relevant financial markets are the US and Europe (European Union (EU)). It was demonstrated that these are the ones that matter most.Are these the markets under discussion? Or are they the Canadian markets? Because the ‘Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC.Canada)’ commenced trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on 18 February 2021 (Liu 2022). Does this mean that the “markets” that were referred to will now take Bitcoin (BTC) seriously  as this was a spot ETF now launched in Canada? Or  in actuality  will this only occur after Jacobi Asset Management launches its European spot Bitcoin ETF (BCOIN) this July 2022 on Euronext Amsterdam (i.e.  the European markets) (Wright 2022)? As can be seen  this generic reference to “markets” is therefore confusing.It may inadvertently mislead crypto investors to think that because many cryptocurrencies operate in a decentralised manner  that all cryptocurrency or Bitcoin markets are similar in nature. They are not. That is why when we talk about crypto ETFs  and principally Bitcoin futures ETFs and Bitcoin spot ETFs  what matters most is precision. That is  explaining issues and matters in ways that inform and empower crypto investors  rather than distorting their views and understandings via elementary and misinformed observations. Bearing this in mind  we will explore some of the theoretical benefits and problems that may arise with the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US financial market in more detail.Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Theoretical Problems v. Theoretical BenefitsInvesting in Bitcoin via a crypto exchange will not provide a crypto investor with any way to short Bitcoin. They will only be able to take a long position. This is problematic because given the volatile nature of Bitcoin  investors may either wish to speculate on a fall in the price of Bitcoin  or they may need to hedge their existing long position. Certain Bitcoin futures ETFs enable crypto investors to take short positions on the price of Bitcoin  which can be used for hedging or speculation purposes.However  as was seen in Part II of this Blog Series  Bitcoin futures ETFs suffer from a number of intrinsic characteristics (e.g.  asset tracking accuracy  underperformance  contango  roll premium  management fees and other expenses  small US market size  volume limits) that may detract from their overall investment proposition. So  at present  Bitcoin futures ETFs are still not attractive to all groups of crypto and financial investors  as they may not always be ideal financial instruments for Bitcoin hedging or speculation.In theory  certain types of derivatives could address any residual market demand for alternative Bitcoin hedging or speculation instruments. For instance  a ‘Contract for Difference’ (CFD) is a financial derivative contract the value of which represents the difference between the agreed initial opening and subsequent closing price (at time of settlement) of an underlying asset. In theory  a Bitcoin CFD would enable an investor to directly speculate on  or hedge  the price movements of Bitcoin (long/short)  without actually purchasing Bitcoin as an asset.The inherent problem is that the use of CFDs has been effectively banned in the US for US residents and citizens. In the United Kingdom (UK)  the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) prohibited the sale to retail clients of investment products that referenced cryptoassets in 2020 (FCA 2020). This included CFDs  options  and futures that reference unregulated transferable cryptoassets such as Bitcoin (FCA 2020). This ban was based on the FCA’s belief that cryptocurrency CFDs represented an extremely high-risk  speculative investment  which would feature:(1) extreme price volatility (e.g.  >30% decline in value in a single day);(2) massive risks from excessive available leverage (e.g.  some firms were offering up to 50:1 leverage which would massively amplify potential losses);(3) high charges and funding costs (e.g.  spread  funding charges  commissions); and(4) significant market risks relating to a lack of fair and accurate price transparency (FCA 2017).The US ban on CFDs  along with the views of the UK FCA on cryptocurrency CFDs has not changed. So  it it would seem to be the case that Bitcoin spot ETFs represent an alternative way to overcome existing bans on crypto and Bitcoin CFDs in the US. In practice  Bitcoin spot ETFs may be attractive to certain important groups of crypto and financial investors  and these are retail investors and institutional investors (e.g.  mutual funds  pension funds  insurance companies.They may be attractive to retail investors because Bitcoin futures ETFs may still present too many issues  Bitcoin futures ETFs may not directly reflect current Bitcoin market values  and also US/UK retail investors are banned from using Bitcoin CFDs. Institutional investors are typically prohibited by their investment mandates from directly holding a range of cryptoassets  including Bitcoin. In theory  Bitcoin spot ETFs would therefore provide a new way for institutional investors to diversify their portfolio holdings with exposure to a new asset class.Institutional investors typically represent a very significant proportion of financial market investments. By providing access to Bitcoin investments in this way  Bitcoin spot ETFs hold the potential to significantly open up trading volumes and liquidity in US Bitcoin spot ETF markets. This is important because:(1) the US is the largest ETF market in the world  with approximately $502 billion of Assets under Management (AuM) (Deutsche Asset Management (DAM) 2017  p. 5);(2) 40% of retail investors use ETFs in the US compared to only 15-20% of retail investors in the EU  resulting in higher trading volumes and higher global impact (Wright 2022);(3) the US features the top worldwide Bitcoin trading volume (n=$1 523.6 million in 2020) (Statista 2020); and(4) the US financial markets feature two of the most  if not the most  advanced financial regulators in the world  namely the ‘U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’ (SEC)  and the ‘U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’ (CFTC).This means that the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US could potentially catalyse the global acceptance of Bitcoin spot ETFs  as well as other crypto spot ETFs  by many more jurisdictions around the world. Overall  this could help to mitigate and stabilise the overall volatility of global Bitcoin prices in the long-term  which could in turn mitigate and stabilise the overall volatility of other correlated cryptocurrency prices. Lower volatility of Bitcoin could in turn increase its attractiveness as an investment asset  and its legitimacy as a cryptocurrency that holds its value.At the same time  there are still a number of issues that can be identified that need to be addressed and potentially overcome. The first problem is identifying whether or not Bitcoin spot ETFs are actually the best way to open up and stabilise the volatility of Bitcoin markets  which raises the issues in question. In Part I of this Blog Series  we identified that the key ETF characteristics for investors were: (1) transparency; (2) cost-effectiveness; (3) diversification; (4) flexibility; and (5) liquidity (The Investment Association 2018  pp. 8-9).However  crypto investors can already achieve flexibility by trading on a wide range of crypto exchanges. A Bitcoin spot ETF may provide transparency  but it is questionable whether one would immediately be cost-effective  as the benefits from scale management and lower transaction costs may only come about after a significant number of Bitcoin spot ETFs are available to competitively trade on the market. Furthermore  one of the most important objectives behind ETF investments is diversification.Yet  Bitcoin spot ETFs in themselves provide no such diversification  as there is no securities basket which is replicated within the offering. The whole point behind many equity ETFs on US markets is replication of a diversified basket of underlying securities. In practice  such diversification reduces ETF investment risk. What this actually means  is that instead of the benefit of diversification  Bitcoin spot ETFs provide investors with concentration risk  as pricing is concentrated within a single asset.There is also a significant challenge of liquidity that may arise. This is because traditional ETFs are structured in such a way as to ensure that large differences between share prices and the ‘net asset value’ (NAV) of the portfolio of securities are unlikely to persist (Investment Company Institute 2017  p. 7). As was seen in Part I of this Blog Series  the ETF creation/redemption mechanism is used by ‘Authorised Participants’ (APs) to provide liquidity within the relevant ETF ‘Primary Market’ and ‘Secondary Market’ (Deutsche Asset Management 2017  p. 11).APs can therefore arbitrage any difference in an ETF’s intraday market price and its NAV by trading via the Primary and Secondary Markets (SEC 2012  p. 3). Theoretically  such arbitrage activities by APs will help to ensure that the ETF’s Secondary Market price falls back in line with its NAV (The Investment Association 2018  p. 11). However  Deutsche Asset Management (DAM) notes that:“ETF arbitrage is possible only when the fund’s price moves by more than a certain amount above or below its NAV. The width of this so-called no-arbitrage or fair value band reflects the costs of creating or redeeming the ETF  including the bid-offer spreads on the underlying securi-ties  any creation or redemption fees set by the issuer  transaction taxes (where applicable) and hedging and inventory costs.” (DAM 2017  p. 11).This underlying ETF arbitrage mechanism can actually fail in times of high market stress or panic  as market liquidity dries up which impacts bid-offer spreads  APs are not able to trade the funds’ underlying stocks and bonds  and ETF liquidity may evaporate (Kay 2009). Crypto and Bitcoin investors that believe this would never happen because of the global liquidity of crypto and Bitcoin markets would be wrong.We need look no further than the Canadian listed 'Purpose Bitcoin ETF' which lost half its assets (24 510 Bitcoins - approximately $500 million) in one day in June 2022  likely because of a huge liquidation  to evidence such a potentiality (Sandor 2022; Pan and Hajric 2022). Added to this  in May 2022  the Canadian listed '3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF' also suffered large investment outflows (7 401 Bitcoins) (Sandor 2022). Therefore  whilst I accept that US financial markets are significantly larger than Canadian financial markets  I am not convinced that similar market panics/shocks would not present themselves in US Bitcoin spot ETF markets  should they be approved by the US regulatory authorities.Moreover  the latest decision by the SEC with respect to a pending Bitcoin spot ETF application by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (Greyscale)  would seem to confirm the SEC's continuing strong reluctance to provide such approval (see: SEC Release No. 34-95180; File No. SR-NYSEArca-2021-90 issued on 29 June 2022 (Greyscale Case 2022)). The Greyscale decision issued last week confirmed that the SEC disapproved the ‘proposed rule change’ (PRC) by Greyscale under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E (Commodity-Based Trust Shares).The SEC held that the US electronic securities exchange ‘NYSE Arca’ had failed to demonstrate that the PRC was sufficient to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices (Greyscale Case 2022  p. 18). In Greyscale  the SEC received and acknowledged significant and extensive documentary evidence and assertions from market commentators. In summary  these asserted that:(1) the SEC should approve the PRC as this would satisfy investor demand for a US regulated investment vehicle with direct exposure to Bitcoin;(2) approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF would provide a simpler  safer  and more efficient way for retail investors to invest in Bitcoin (such as over-the-counter Bitcoin funds  Bitcoin futures funds  or foreign Bitcoin funds);(3) approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF would reduce custody and cybersecurity risks for investors;(4) approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF would facilitate lower costs and risks than Bitcoin futures ETFs;(5) disapproving a Bitcoin spot ETF after approving Bitcoin futures ETFs would harm investors;(6) Bitcoin futures ETFs present structural disadvantages over Bitcoin spot ETFs (e.g.  monthly roll-costs and risks owing to position limits);(7) approval of a Bitcoin spot fund would enhance efficiency  liquidity  and price discovery of the underlying Bitcoin markets; and(8) approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF would enhance investor choice  improve market structure and competition thereby benefitting investors  and would facilitate capital formation (Greyscale Case 2022  pp. 77-82).Despite such wide-ranging arguments supported by market commentators  the SEC clearly disagreed with such views (Greyscale Case 2022  p. 82). Moreover  it confirmed that the test to be applied to such a PRC application  was inherently not a balancing test that could incorporate and take into account potential market and investor benefits (Greyscale Case 2022  p. 83).

The project is part of the European Space Agency (ESA) programme of Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems (ARTES) led by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).Ekinops’ SixSq joins 5G-EMERGE to build solutions for the satellite-enabled 5G media marketThe 5G-EMERGE project aims at developing an integrated satellite and terrestrial system based on open standards to enable high-quality content distribution services over multi-layer IP infrastructures. Telecommunications satellites will efficiently deliver high-demand content  including streaming of live events  as close as possible to the end user – to the 'edge'. The project includes demonstrations in 5G base stations  users' homes and vehicles.A consortium of 20 companies from six European countries will collaborate on developing the distributed edge technology and service-delivery features. SixSq's contribution includes leading the demonstration work package and providing the edge-to-cloud software infrastructure based on its Nuvla.io B2B SaaS platform and marketplace of containerised applications  as well as its open source NuvlaEdge software.SixSq CEO Marc-Elian Bégin said  ""leveraging satellite broadcast and 5G is a great opportunity to deliver the right high-density content at the right location with the right customization. However  this requires fine-tuned orchestration of the entire value chain and this is what SixSq edge-to-cloud software provides. We are no stranger to big challenges posed by ESA and EBU and are looking forward to pushing the boundaries of edge-to-cloud  bringing together the space sector  5G and multi-media content delivery.""""The 5G-Emerge project is yet another example of Ekinops' long commitment towards software innovation as a mean to add value to the telecommunications sector "" commented Vincent Munière  Group Chief Technology Officer & VP R&D at Ekinops.

7430,EuroNext,Bing API,https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/deezer-stock-plunges-ipo-1235309119/,French Streaming Service Deezer’s Stock Plunges in Public Debut on Paris Exchange,The French audio streaming service Deezer made its debut on the Paris Euronext market Tuesday and immediately plunged 35% from its €8.5 opening  rising slightly to level off at around €6.2 by late,The French audio streaming service Deezer made its debut on the Paris Euronext market Tuesday and immediately plunged 35% from its €8.5 opening  rising slightly to level off at around €6.2 by late in the afternoon.Earlier this year the company  which is one of the world’s largest streaming services despite a relatively low U.S. profile  merged with I2PO  a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC)  with an eye toward going public at a $1.13 billion valuation. Although it formed in 2007  just a year after Spotify  Deezer has struggled in its efforts to break into a field that has become dominated by Spotify  Apple Music  Amazon Music and YouTube. It attempted an IPO in 2015 but backed off after a steep decline in listeners at Pandora radio cooled the market for streaming services.Today’s curiously timed listing arrives against a backdrop of a possible global recession and Spotify’s value plunging to its lowest price as a public company just two months ago due to weak paid subscriber growth exacerbated by controversies around its top podcaster  Joe Rogan.“The sector is super competitive ” DZ Bank analyst Manuel Muehl told Yahoo Finance. “There are multiple services – Amazon Prime  Apple Music etc – which are run by large U.S. companies with very deep pockets. [They] can subsidize their business with other income streams  and therefore they do not depend on the success of their music-platforms unlike ‘pure-play’ companies do.”Regardless  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire  who attended the ceremony marking Deezer’s market debut  sung its praises on social media. “@DeezerFR’s IPO is not only an economic and technological success  but it is also a cultural success ” Le Maire tweeted. “Defending Deezer is defending our culture… our musical heritage.”In April  Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueira (pictured above) told the Wall Street Journal  “What we’re trying to do with our partners is replicate the Apple and Amazon strategy  but we bring the music product and they bring the user base  so together we can replicate that model. We need to compete against them and our partners need to compete against them  and together we can compete better.”Paris-based Deezer has 9.6 million subscribers and generated revenue of €400 million in 2021  the company said. In addition to a music catalog of 90 million-plus songs  it also offers as podcasts  audio books and radio channels. While it has a 29% market share in France and 17% in Brazil  its global reach is just 2%  compared with 31% for world leader Spotify  15% for Apple Music and 13% for Amazon Music  the three largest providers.According to Deezer’s investor relations site  the company’s largest shareholder with 38.6% is Access Industries  the industrial conglomerate founded by billionaire Len Blavatnik that controls Warner Music Group  with telco operator Orange Participations second with 8.13% and Kingdom Holding Co.  which is controlled by Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal  third with 5.41%.,neutral,0.03,0.65,0.32,mixed,0.14,0.14,0.72,True,English,"['French Streaming Service', 'Stock Plunges', 'Public Debut', 'Paris Exchange', 'Deezer', 'French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire', 'DZ Bank analyst Manuel Muehl', 'low U.S. profile', 'weak paid subscriber growth', 'Prince al-Waleed bin Talal', 'French audio streaming service', 'large U.S. companies', 'Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueira', 'other income streams', 'Wall Street Journal', 'investor relations site', 'billionaire Len Blavatnik', 'Kingdom Holding Co.', 'Saudi Arabian billionaire', 'three largest providers', 'possible global recession', 'Warner Music Group', 'Paris Euronext market', 'largest streaming services', 'special-purpose acquisition company', 'world leader Spotify', 'Yahoo Finance', 'pure-play’ companies', 'audio books', 'largest shareholder', 'global reach', 'multiple services', 'Amazon Music', 'music product', 'music catalog', '$1.13 billion valuation', 'steep decline', 'Pandora radio', 'lowest price', 'top podcaster', 'Joe Rogan', 'Amazon Prime', 'deep pockets', 'social media', 'musical heritage', 'Amazon strategy', 'user base', '9.6 million subscribers', '90 million-plus songs', 'radio channels', '29% market share', 'Access Industries', 'industrial conglomerate', 'telco operator', 'Orange Participations', 'Apple Music', 'technological success', 'cultural success', 'public company', 'Paris-based Deezer', 'market debut', '€8.5 opening', 'afternoon', 'I2PO', 'SPAC', 'eye', 'efforts', 'field', 'YouTube', 'IPO', 'listeners', 'listing', 'backdrop', 'value', 'controversies', 'sector', 'business', 'music-platforms', 'ceremony', 'praises', 'DeezerFR', 'economic', 'culture', 'April', 'partners', 'model', 'revenue', 'addition', 'podcasts', 'France', 'Brazil']",2022-07-05,2022-07-05,variety.com

7432,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.voltimum.co.uk/articles/signify-calls-accelerated-transition,Signify calls for an accelerated transition to energy-efficient LED lighting to mitigate the energy crisis,In light of the current energy crisis  Signify calls on the leaders and businesses in the UK&I region to accelerate the transition to energy-efficient connected LED lighting to help households and businesses mitigate the energy crisis.,In light of the current energy crisis  Signify calls on the leaders and businesses in the UK&I region to accelerate the transition to energy-efficient connected LED lighting to help households and businesses mitigate the energy crisis. The move will also ensure quick wins in the UK’s Race to Zero.Business leaders in the United Kingdom and Ireland (UK&I) region should focus on making changes that deliver results quickly and impact both the professional and consumer lighting marketsThe switch to LED lighting can help the average British household save upto £250 per year  helping millions of households pushed into fuel poverty due to the change price cap in April’ 2022In the UK’s Race to Zero  a green switch to LED lighting in the professional market could mean eliminating 3.9 million tonnes of CO2 emissions and saving a total of EUR 3.8 billion per yearLondon – With the recent change in price cap introduced in April 2022  millions of households have been pushed into fuel poverty and several businesses are now facing added volatility due to its impact. In light of this  Signify (Euronext: LIGHT)  the world leader in lighting  advocates an accelerated transition to energy-efficient connected LED lighting to help households and businesses while positively impacting the UK’s Race to Zero. With energy prices around the globe reaching all-time highs and global emissions rising at unprecedented levels  it is now more urgent than ever that businesses in UK&I lead by example and take quick action to tackle climate change.More than a decade after Signify’s call to phase out the incandescent light bulb worldwide  it now calls for the transition to energy-efficient connected LED lighting as the new standard of ‘general lighting’1. The move will help meet the goals the UK’s ten point plan and other commitments that nations have made around the world in line with the Paris Agreement.Impact for BusinessesAccording to Signify’s findings  switching to LED lighting in the professional lighting market could reduce CO 2 emissions by 3.9 million tonnes in the UK&I region  the same amount of CO 2 that 175 million trees could sequester in a year. Making the switch would also save 16.1 TWh of electricity  which is equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of more than 4.3 million households. This would result in a saving of EUR 3.8 billion on electricity costs2. Upgrading to connected LED lighting3 can offer enhanced controls for better energy consumption management.Impact for householdsResearch from the Energy Saving Trust4 indicates that lighting takes up about 11% of the average UK household electricity consumption. Our data5 suggests that after the change in the energy price cap introduced in April  switching to energy-efficient LED lighting can help the average British household save £15-£18 per light bulb  which equates to a saving of £2506 per year. Given that there are likely more lamps to replace in homes hit by fuel poverty  the positive impact would be more significant there. The switch to smart LED lighting will also pay a huge role in reducing CO2 emissions  furthering the UK&I’s progress to a greener future.The International Energy Agency (IEA) echoes Signify’s call to action.Nicholas Howarth  Senior Analyst at the International Energy Agency said “The world is facing the most significant energy crisis in recent history and energy efficiency is a solution to many of its most urgent challenges. Highlighting its importance  in June at the IEA Global Conference on Energy Efficiency  27 governments from around the world issued the Sønderburg Action Plan calling for energy efficiency and demand side action to play a much greater role protecting households  businesses and the economy from high energy prices. This is vital for addressing the energy crisis  rising inflation and greenhouse gas emissions.”Stronger policy packages covering regulations  information and incentives will play a key role accelerating energy efficiency and related measures. This includes the deployment of smart  efficient lighting  upgrading homes with better insulation  improving the fuel efficiency of cars  as well fostering investment in new industrial machinery. Efficient lighting is a proven technology to reduce electricity demand  fast. This will also help create extra electricity capacity needed for electric heat pumps and vehicles which put upwards pressure on power demand’’Climate Group  an international non-profit working with businesses and governments around the world to drive climate action  also aligns with Signify’s ambition. Morgan  Senior Manager  Built Environment  Climate Group  said“Climate Group is proud to work in partnership with Signify to raise awareness of the multiple benefits of energy efficient LED lighting for businesses and cities. LEDs play a key role in decarbonisation as we strive to halve emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero carbon buildings by 2050.”“The unprecedented energy savings from LEDs compared to traditional lighting presents compelling urgency to raise the priority of global LED adoption. The drive towards smart  connected LEDs can also serve as a digital platform for smart building and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions  opening up a myriad of options for businesses.”Stephen Rouatt  CEO  Signify UK&I said: “Households in the UK are now in one of the most difficult situations as they see their energy bills rise by 54%  while businesses continue to struggle as well. We understand the urgency created by the energy crisis to help families and businesses under pressure. Switching to energy-efficient LED lighting guarantees quick wins in saving money on energy bills and responding to the urgent action needed to tackle the climate crisis. After the change in the energy price cap introduced in April  switching to energy-efficient LED lighting can help the average British household save upto £250 per year (£15-£18 per light bulb). Accelerating the transition to LED lighting is one of the quickest renovations that can dramatically cut CO 2 – it does not require large capital investments  has a short payback time  and can positively impact the challenge posed by the UK’s built environment and its carbon footprint.”“As leaders in the lighting sector  we have a firm commitment to transformative action and there is no better opportunity than London Climate Action Week (LCAW) to commit to change. This is an opportunity to harness the power that businesses  climate professionals and communities in London can bring forward to tackle global climate action.’’Learn more about our actions to accelerate climate action here: Sustainability | Signify Company Website1‘General lighting’ is defined as everyday lighting: bulbs and luminaires for home and professional settings (e.g. offices  commercial buildings  retail  stadiums  road and street  bridge  park and tunnel lighting  etc).

The music streaming service made its stock market debut in its home country of France on the Euronext Paris this morning (Tuesday July 5) ,Spotify rival Deezer is officially a publicly-listed company.The music streaming service made its stock market debut in its home country of France on the Euronext Paris this morning (Tuesday July 5)  after combining its business with I2PO  a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) based in France.The company’s public listing comes seven years after the plug was pulled on its previous attempt at an IPO.Deezer becomes this year’s latest music streaming service to become a publicly listed company via a SPAC merger  following MENA-focused Anghami‘s recent IPO on the NASDAQ in New York.On a fully diluted basis  the I2PO merger gave Deezer a pre-money equity valuation of EUR €1.050 billion (USD $1.095bn at current exchange rates).That valuation corresponded to an enterprise valuation of approximately €1.075 billion ($1.11bn)  I2PO confirmed in April.Speaking at the bell-ringing ceremony in Paris this morning  Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueira said that “as a proud French tech Unicorn  going public in Paris for us was really important”.He added: “This is a historical day for our company.”As reported by Reuters this morning  Deezer’s shares opened at EUR €8.50 ($8.75)  but fell to €7.950 ($8.19) by 07:39 am GMT.At the time of writing (11:30 am GMT/ 12:30 CET)  the company’s share price had fallen to €6.50 ($6.70).According to Deezer’s investor relations site  as of today (July 5  2022)  Access Industries owns the biggest chunk (38.06%) of the company’s share capital with 44 753 926 ordinary shares  while telecoms giant Orange Participations S.A. owns the second largest  with 9 561 723 ordinary shares  or 8.13% of the firm’s share capital (see below).As reported by MBW in April  now that the merger between Deezer and France-based SPAC I2PO is complete  the combined company will benefit from cash previously held by I2PO  in addition to cash raised through a PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity).The prospectus for this PIPE was approved by the French financial markets authority  the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF)  in June.This PIPE was subscribed to by most of the pre-existing shareholders of Deezer including Access Industries  Universal Music Group  Warner Music Group  Orange  Kingdom Holdings  Eurazeo and Xavier Niel  as well as a group of long-term French and international investors including Groupe Artémis  Bpifrance and Media Participations.According to Deezer’s merger prospectus  the music streaming service had 9.6 million subscribers in 2021  including 5.6 million B2C (direct) subscribers and 3.9 million B2B subscribers.Deezer generated revenue of EUR €400 million in 2021.Speaking at the bell ringing ceremony this morning  Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueira explained that Deezer “feel[s] that it’s the right time for us to become a publicly listed company ” adding that  “in the last year since I joined  we started to reposition Deezer with a new strategy to capture share in the fast-growing music streaming market that still has plenty of potential”.Said Folgueira  at this morning’s bell-ringing ceremony: “This is a historical day for our company and I would like to start by thanking everyone that made this day possible  starting with our original team led by founder Daniel [Marhely] that’s here with us and some of the original employees that still work with Dezeer today  the shareholders of Deezer that have been supporting us for many years led by Access Industries  our strategic partners such as Orange that have also been instrumental in our success  but most importantly for all the Deezer employees current and former that have worked really hard for the last 15 years to make this a success and take this to where it is today.”“We believe that we are in a really good position to take the company to the next level  and as a publicly listed company  really get the most out of our opportunities.” Jeronimo Folgueira  DeezerAdded Folgueira: “We are focusing on large markets and we are focusing on replicating the very successful model we have in France of our hybrid B2B to C model and doubling down on differentiation  creating a really unique product built on innovation and great customer experience.“This transaction also shows  not only the support we have from our shareholders  but also the belief from new shareholders  on our vision  our strategy  and also the potential for value creation that Deezer brings.“We already see some of the results of our new strategy with our growth having accelerated substantially in the last year and reaching double digits in Q1.“We believe that we are in a really good position to take the company to the next level  and as a publicly listed company  really get the most out of our opportunities.”Music Business Worldwide,neutral,0.02,0.93,0.05,mixed,0.73,0.17,0.1,True,English,"['stock
