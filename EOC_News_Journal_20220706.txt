It is available here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35510808/.An article on PXL770 has been published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (“JPET”)  and is entitled “Beneficial effects of the direct AMP-Kinase activator PXL770 in in vitro and in vivo models of X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy”. This publication is available here: https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/early/2022/06/25/jpet.122.001208.These publications describe similar beneficial preclinical profiles of PXL770 and PXL065 in models of ALD. Elevated levels of toxic very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are a driver of ALD pathology. The published in vitro results show correction of this phenotype in ALD patient-derived cells. In a classical in vivo rodent model of ALD  elevated VLCFA levels were also suppressed by chronic treatment with both compounds (in plasma  brain and spinal cord). The two compounds also improved mitochondrial function and signs of inflammation in patient-derived cells. Importantly  improvements in neurologic deficits were also documented in the ALD mouse model (sciatic nerve morphology and locomotor function) with each of the two compounds. Given different mechanisms of action  it is anticipated that pursuit of the pending (identical design) Phase 2a clinical studies could yield results that will help determine diffentiation between these agents in this disease.About ALDX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an orphan neurometabolic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which encodes for a key protein that is required for metabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) by peroxisomes (cellular organelles). ALD is the most common leukodystrophy with a prevalence similar to hemophilia – up to 1/10 000 individuals in the general population have ALD [https://rarediseases.org]. Forms of this disease include cerebral ALD (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) which is the most common form – typically occurring in adolescence through adulthood. AMN is characterized by chronic and progressive distal axonopathy involving the long tracts of the spinal cord and to a lesser extent the peripheral nerves resulting in progressive stiffness and weakness in the legs  impaired gait and balance  incontinence  and loss of sensation. Nearly all men with a diagnosis of ALD will develop AMN  and many women also present with features of AMN with a later onset. C-ALD is characterized by inflammatory demyelination of cells in the brain and typically afflicts children  but many men with AMN may also develop cerebral disease; these white matter brain lesions lead to severe neurologic deficits and death. There are no approved medicines for ALD (other than glucocorticoid supplements for associated adrenal insufficiency). C-ALD when first detected in early childhood  can be treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HSCT is currently limited to early stage of C-ALD and this procedure is at risk of severe adverse reactions.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. Poxel has clinical and earlier-stage programs from its adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator and deuterated TZD platforms targeting chronic and rare metabolic diseases. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) is in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). PXL770  a first-in-class direct AMPK activator  has successfully completed a Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of NASH  which met its objectives. For the rare inherited metabolic disorder  adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)  the company intends to initiate Phase 2a proof of concept studies with PXL065 and PXL770 in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). TWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)  Poxel’s first-in-class lead product that targets mitochondrial dysfunction  has been approved and launched for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan.

This mechanism is a transparent practice that is known to all market players and is standard practice in the world of professional electrical equipment distribution.Rexel is currently studying the statement of objections  which in no way prejudges the culpability of the companies involved and is the customary first step in contradictory proceedings before the Competition Authority.Rexel constantly strives to strictly comply with applicable laws and regulations and the Group will assert its position and its rights within the framework of this procedure.ABOUT REXEL GROUPRexel  worldwide expert in the multichannel professional distribution of products and services for the energy world  addresses three main markets: residential  commercial  and industrial.

Investment bank Raymond James has previously said that music streaming was in a better position than video streaming  urging investors not to dump streaming shares too quickly.“So what we see in the competitive environment for streaming music is a lot more stable environment than you see  for instance  in streaming video  where content owners are increasingly taking ownership of their content  walling it off  going directly to consumers”  analyst Andrew Marok said.This was echoed by analyst Ian Whittaker  who told City A.M. that the fact that music giants generally don’t need to create their own content like Prime Video or Disney + do means there is less pressure for constant heavy investment.Whittaker also said that the lack of exclusivity for most music on specific platform means the consumer doesn’t need multiple subscriptions nor has the same incentive to flip between services to watch a must watched programme: Elton John’s hits can coexist on Spotify and Apple Music.,neutral,0.02,0.64,0.34,mixed,0.25,0.16,0.58,True,English,"['French music streamer', 'Deezer', 'debut', 'Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueira', 'proud French tech Unicorn', 'French music streamer Deezer', 'tough “market conditions', 'money equity valuation', 'analyst Andrew Marok', 'City A.M.', 'constant heavy investment', 'tough debut day', 'France-based SPAC I2PO', 'analyst Ian Whittaker', 'unicorn firm', 'French company', 'Investment bank', 'Apple Music', 'music streaming', 'streaming music', 'music giants', 'most music', 'bell-ringing ceremony', 'Raymond James', 'video streaming', 'competitive environment', 'stable environment', 'streaming video', 'Prime Video', 'less pressure', 'specific platform', 'multiple subscriptions', 'same incentive', 'Elton John', 'Paris Euronext', 'streaming shares', 'content owners', '35 per', '8.50 euros', 'stock', 'markets', 'eyebrows', 'Spotify', 'leap', 'faith', 'position', 'investors', 'instance', 'ownership', 'consumers', 'fact', 'Disney', 'lack', 'exclusivity', 'services', 'programme', 'hits']",2022-07-05,2022-07-06,cityam.com

7426,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/22522/the-bitcoin-crypto-etf-primer-series-part-iii,The ‘Bitcoin (Crypto) ETF’ Primer Series: PART III (Rodrigo Zepeda),By Rodrigo Zepeda  CEO  Storm-7 Consulting Crypto Market Developments in Europe and the United Stat,By Rodrigo Zepeda  CEO  Storm-7 ConsultingCrypto Market Developments in Europe and the United StatesIn Part I of this Blog Series  I noted that crypto commentators such as Moeller (2022) had made statements such as:“Enthusiasts view a spot ETF as a more legitimate method of investment because a spot ETF involves holding Bitcoin” and“Crypto industry pundits often fight for a firm to establish a Bitcoin spot ETF as they believe that markets will take Bitcoin seriously after a spot ETF has been established”.We can now see why such observations in relation to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are elementary and misinformed. They are elementary because they are generalistic and are therefore prone to potentially mislead crypto investors. When we discuss crypto investments  we need precision. We need to identify which type of enthusiasts we are discussing. Are they crypto enthusiasts or financial investment enthusiasts  or a mixture of both? And we most certainly need to know which countries they represent.Crypto investments in Europe  will be different to those in the United States (US)  which will both be different to those in Vietnam  Singapore  or Hong Kong. Moreover  we previously saw that ETF investments can be undertaken with physical (full/optimised) replication or with synthetic replication (The Investment Association 2018  pp. 6-7). So  whether ETFs physically hold the underlying asset  or they replicate the asset synthetically  this in no way affects their legitimacy  as all such methods form completely legitimate ETF investment methodologies.Therefore  in financial markets  speaking of the difference in legitimacy of ETF investment method in terms of physically holding an asset  or synthetically replicating the asset  is nonsensical. This is a misinformed view. The same can be said of any discussion concerning “Crypto industry pundits”  “markets”  and taking Bitcoin seriously. Which crypto markets  or financial markets are we talking about? We previously identified that the most relevant financial markets are the US and Europe (European Union (EU)). It was demonstrated that these are the ones that matter most.Are these the markets under discussion? Or are they the Canadian markets? Because the ‘Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC.Canada)’ commenced trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on 18 February 2021 (Liu 2022). Does this mean that the “markets” that were referred to will now take Bitcoin (BTC) seriously  as this was a spot ETF now launched in Canada? Or  in actuality  will this only occur after Jacobi Asset Management launches its European spot Bitcoin ETF (BCOIN) this July 2022 on Euronext Amsterdam (i.e.  the European markets) (Wright 2022)? As can be seen  this generic reference to “markets” is therefore confusing.It may inadvertently mislead crypto investors to think that because many cryptocurrencies operate in a decentralised manner  that all cryptocurrency or Bitcoin markets are similar in nature. They are not. That is why when we talk about crypto ETFs  and principally Bitcoin futures ETFs and Bitcoin spot ETFs  what matters most is precision. That is  explaining issues and matters in ways that inform and empower crypto investors  rather than distorting their views and understandings via elementary and misinformed observations. Bearing this in mind  we will explore some of the theoretical benefits and problems that may arise with the launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US financial market in more detail.Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Theoretical Problems v. Theoretical BenefitsInvesting in Bitcoin via a crypto exchange will not provide a crypto investor with any way to short Bitcoin. They will only be able to take a long position. This is problematic because given the volatile nature of Bitcoin  investors may either wish to speculate on a fall in the price of Bitcoin  or they may need to hedge their existing long position. Certain Bitcoin futures ETFs enable crypto investors to take short positions on the price of Bitcoin  which can be used for hedging or speculation purposes.However  as was seen in Part II of this Blog Series  Bitcoin futures ETFs suffer from a number of intrinsic characteristics (e.g.  asset tracking accuracy  underperformance  contango  roll premium  management fees and other expenses  small US market size  volume limits) that may detract from their overall investment proposition. So  at present  Bitcoin futures ETFs are still not attractive to all groups of crypto and financial investors  as they may not always be ideal financial instruments for Bitcoin hedging or speculation.In theory  certain types of derivatives could address any residual market demand for alternative Bitcoin hedging or speculation instruments. For instance  a ‘Contract for Difference’ (CFD) is a financial derivative contract the value of which represents the difference between the agreed initial opening and subsequent closing price (at time of settlement) of an underlying asset. In theory  a Bitcoin CFD would enable an investor to directly speculate on  or hedge  the price movements of Bitcoin (long/short)  without actually purchasing Bitcoin as an asset.The inherent problem is that the use of CFDs has been effectively banned in the US for US residents and citizens. In the United Kingdom (UK)  the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) prohibited the sale to retail clients of investment products that referenced cryptoassets in 2020 (FCA 2020). This included CFDs  options  and futures that reference unregulated transferable cryptoassets such as Bitcoin (FCA 2020). This ban was based on the FCA’s belief that cryptocurrency CFDs represented an extremely high-risk  speculative investment  which would feature:(1) extreme price volatility (e.g.  >30% decline in value in a single day);(2) massive risks from excessive available leverage (e.g.  some firms were offering up to 50:1 leverage which would massively amplify potential losses);(3) high charges and funding costs (e.g.  spread  funding charges  commissions); and(4) significant market risks relating to a lack of fair and accurate price transparency (FCA 2017).The US ban on CFDs  along with the views of the UK FCA on cryptocurrency CFDs  has not changed. So  it it would seem to be the case that Bitcoin spot ETFs represent an alternative way to overcome existing bans on crypto and Bitcoin CFDs in the US. In practice  Bitcoin spot ETFs may be attractive to certain important groups of crypto and financial investors  and these are retail investors and institutional investors (e.g.  mutual funds  pension funds  insurance companies.They may be attractive to retail investors because Bitcoin futures ETFs may still present too many issues  Bitcoin futures ETFs may not directly reflect current Bitcoin market values  and also US/UK retail investors are banned from using Bitcoin CFDs. Institutional investors are typically prohibited by their investment mandates from directly holding a range of cryptoassets  including Bitcoin. In theory  Bitcoin spot ETFs would therefore provide a new way for institutional investors to diversify their portfolio holdings with exposure to a new asset class.Institutional investors typically represent a very significant proportion of financial market investments. By providing access to Bitcoin investments in this way  Bitcoin spot ETFs hold the potential to significantly open up trading volumes and liquidity in US Bitcoin spot ETF markets. This is important because:(1) the US is the largest ETF market in the world  with approximately $502 billion of Assets under Management (AuM) (Deutsche Asset Management (DAM) 2017  p. 5);(2) 40% of retail investors use ETFs in the US compared to only 15-20% of retail investors in the EU  resulting in higher trading volumes and higher global impact (Wright 2022);(3) the US features the top worldwide Bitcoin trading volume (n=$1 523.6 million in 2020) (Statista 2020); and(4) the US financial markets feature two of the most  if not the most  advanced financial regulators in the world  namely the ‘U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’ (SEC)  and the ‘U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’ (CFTC).This means that the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US could potentially catalyse the global acceptance of Bitcoin spot ETFs  as well as other crypto spot ETFs  by many more jurisdictions around the world. Overall  this could help to mitigate and stabilise the overall volatility of global Bitcoin prices in the long-term  which could in turn mitigate and stabilise the overall volatility of other correlated cryptocurrency prices. Lower volatility of Bitcoin could in turn increase its attractiveness as an investment asset  and its legitimacy as a cryptocurrency that holds its value.At the same time  there are still a number of issues that can be identified that need to be addressed and potentially overcome. The first problem is identifying whether or not Bitcoin spot ETFs are actually the best way to open up and stabilise the volatility of Bitcoin markets  which raises the issues in question. In Part I of this Blog Series  we identified that the key ETF characteristics for investors were: (1) transparency; (2) cost-effectiveness; (3) diversification; (4) flexibility; and (5) liquidity (The Investment Association 2018  pp. 8-9).However  crypto investors can already achieve flexibility by trading on a wide range of crypto exchanges. A Bitcoin spot ETF may provide transparency  but it is questionable whether one would immediately be cost-effective  as the benefits from scale management and lower transaction costs may only come about after a significant number of Bitcoin spot ETFs are available to competitively trade on the market. Furthermore  one of the most important objectives behind ETF investments is diversification.Yet  Bitcoin spot ETFs in themselves provide no such diversification  as there is no securities basket which is replicated within the offering. The whole point behind many equity ETFs on US markets is replication of a diversified basket of underlying securities. In practice  such diversification reduces ETF investment risk. What this actually means  is that instead of the benefit of diversification  Bitcoin spot ETFs provide investors with concentration risk  as pricing is concentrated within a single asset.There is also a significant challenge of liquidity that may arise. This is because traditional ETFs are structured in such a way as to ensure that large differences between share prices and the ‘net asset value’ (NAV) of the portfolio of securities are unlikely to persist (Investment Company Institute 2017  p. 7). As was seen in Part I of this Blog Series  the ETF creation/redemption mechanism is used by ‘Authorised Participants’ (APs) to provide liquidity within the relevant ETF ‘Primary Market’ and ‘Secondary Market’ (Deutsche Asset Management 2017  p. 11).APs can therefore arbitrage any difference in an ETF’s intraday market price and its NAV by trading via the Primary and Secondary Markets (SEC 2012  p. 3). Theoretically  such arbitrage activities by APs will help to ensure that the ETF’s Secondary Market price falls back in line with its NAV (The Investment Association 2018  p. 11). However  Deutsche Asset Management (DAM) notes that:“ETF arbitrage is possible only when the fund’s price moves by more than a certain amount above or below its NAV. The width of this so-called no-arbitrage or fair value band reflects the costs of creating or redeeming the ETF  including the bid-offer spreads on the underlying securi-ties  any creation or redemption fees set by the issuer  transaction taxes (where applicable) and hedging and inventory costs.” (DAM 2017  p. 11).This underlying ETF arbitrage mechanism can actually fail in times of high market stress or panic  as market liquidity dries up which impacts bid-offer spreads  APs are not able to trade the funds’ underlying stocks and bonds  and ETF liquidity may evaporate (Kay 2009). Crypto and Bitcoin investors that believe this would never happen because of the global liquidity of crypto and Bitcoin markets would be wrong.We need look no further than the Canadian listed 'Purpose Bitcoin ETF' which lost half its assets (24 510 Bitcoins - approximately $500 million) in one day in June 2022  likely because of a huge liquidation  to evidence such a potentiality (Sandor 2022; Pan and Hajric 2022). Added to this  in May 2022  the Canadian listed '3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF' also suffered large investment outflows (7 401 Bitcoins) (Sandor 2022). Therefore  whilst I accept that US financial markets are significantly larger than Canadian financial markets  I am not convinced that similar market panics/shocks would not present themselves in US Bitcoin spot ETF markets  should they be approved by the US regulatory authorities.Moreover  the latest decision by the SEC with respect to a pending Bitcoin spot ETF application by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (Greyscale)  would seem to confirm the SEC's continuing strong reluctance to provide such approval (see: SEC Release No. 34-95180; File No. SR-NYSEArca-2021-90 issued on 29 June 2022 (Greyscale Case 2022)). The Greyscale decision issued last week confirmed that the SEC disapproved the ‘proposed rule change’ (PRC) by Greyscale under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E (Commodity-Based Trust Shares).The SEC held that the US electronic securities exchange ‘NYSE Arca’ had failed to demonstrate that the PRC was sufficient to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices (Greyscale Case 2022  p. 18). In Greyscale  the SEC received and acknowledged significant and extensive documentary evidence and assertions from market commentators. In summary  these asserted that:(1) the SEC should approve the PRC as this would satisfy investor demand for a US regulated investment vehicle with direct exposure to Bitcoin;(2) approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF would provide a simpler  safer  and more efficient way for retail investors to invest in Bitcoin (such as over-the-counter Bitcoin funds  Bitcoin futures funds  or foreign Bitcoin funds);(3) approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF would reduce custody and cybersecurity risks for investors;(4) approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF would facilitate lower costs and risks than Bitcoin futures ETFs;(5) disapproving a Bitcoin spot ETF after approving Bitcoin futures ETFs would harm investors;(6) Bitcoin futures ETFs present structural disadvantages over Bitcoin spot ETFs (e.g.  monthly roll-costs and risks owing to position limits);(7) approval of a Bitcoin spot fund would enhance efficiency  liquidity  and price discovery of the underlying Bitcoin markets; and(8) approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF would enhance investor choice  improve market structure and competition thereby benefitting investors  and would facilitate capital formation (Greyscale Case 2022  pp. 77-82).Despite such wide-ranging arguments supported by market commentators  the SEC clearly disagreed with such views (Greyscale Case 2022  p. 82). Moreover  it confirmed that the test to be applied to such a PRC application  was inherently not a balancing test that could incorporate and take into account potential market and investor benefits (Greyscale Case 2022  p. 83). Rather  it was instead strictly limited to the specific legislative requirements set out in Section 6(b)(5) of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934.As such  the SEC found that the PRC did not sufficiently cover rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices  and to protect investors and the public interest. As the final Part IV of this Blog Series will show  the case was important because it provided a more detailed explanation as to how a Bitcoin spot ETF could be approved in the future in the US. Most importantly  it confirmed that there were other possibilities apart from surveillance-sharing agreements that could be used by exchanges to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices (Greyscale Case 2022  p. 9).To be continued.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.01,0.11,0.88,True,English,"['Bitcoin (Crypto) ETF’ Primer Series', 'Rodrigo Zepeda', 'PART', 'small US market size', 'legitimate ETF investment methodologies', 'Certain Bitcoin futures ETFs', 'European spot Bitcoin ETF', 'residual market demand', 'The Investment Association', 'overall investment proposition', 'physical (full/optimised) replication', 'Toronto Stock Exchange', 'Crypto Market Developments', 'Crypto industry pundits', 'US financial market', 'ideal financial instruments', 'existing long position', 'asset tracking accuracy', 'subsequent closing price', 'Purpose Bitcoin ETF', 'financial derivative contract', 'Jacobi Asset Management', 'relevant financial markets', 'Bitcoin spot ETF', 'financial investment enthusiasts', 'alternative Bitcoin hedging', 'legitimate method', 'crypto ETFs', 'European Union', 'crypto exchange', 'ETF investments', 'synthetic replication', 'management fees', 'financial investors', 'European markets', 'speculation instruments', 'crypto commentators', 'crypto investments', 'Rodrigo Zepeda', 'Storm-7 Consulting', 'United States', 'Blog Series', 'exchange-traded funds', 'Hong Kong', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'generic reference', 'many cryptocurrencies', 'decentralised manner', 'theoretical benefits', 'short positions', 'intrinsic characteristics', 'other expenses', 'volume limits', 'initial opening', 'crypto investors', 'crypto enthusiasts', 'underlying asset', 'crypto markets', 'Bitcoin markets', 'price movements', 'Canadian markets', 'speculation purposes', 'Bitcoin CFD', 'misinformed observations', 'Theoretical Problems', 'volatile nature', 'Part II', 'CEO', 'Moeller', 'statements', 'firm', 'relation', 'precision', 'type', 'mixture', 'countries', 'Vietnam', 'Singapore', 'way', 'legitimacy', 'methods', 'difference', 'terms', 'view', 'discussion', 'BTCC.', 'Canada', 'trading', '18 February', 'Liu', 'actuality', 'BCOIN', 'Wright', 'cryptocurrency', 'issues', 'matters', 'understandings', 'elementary', 'mind', 'launch', 'detail', 'fall', 'number', 'underperformance', 'contango', 'premium', 'present', 'groups', 'theory', 'derivatives', 'instance', 'value', 'time', 'settlement']",2022-07-05,2022-07-06,finextra.com

7450,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artmarket-com-artprice-100-index-120000180.html,Artmarket.com: the Artprice 100© index up +36% in 2021,Art is now widely considered an alternative investment that not only offers high returns but also a relatively low correlation to other financial assets...,"PARIS  July 6  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Art is now widely considered an alternative investment that not only offers high returns but also a relatively low correlation to other financial assets. Investing in the greatest artists (such as Pablo Picasso  Claude Monet  or Georgia O'Keeffe) can therefore be a matter of personal satisfaction and financial advantage – as long as we take into consideration certain art market specificities such as the timeframes for selling unique works and the considerable associated costs.Artmarket.com: the Artprice 100© index up +36% in 2021 (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)Thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com: ""We are very proud to have played a leading role for 25 years  with Artprice  in the process of democratizing the art market. Restricted to an elite group of connoisseurs until the end of the 20th century  the art market is now accessssible to a much larger number of people. Our services offer affordable information that can be consulted anywhere  without limit and it is updated every hour. With our value-added data  art professionals and enthusiasts can buy and sell exceptional and family works with complete peace of mind"".Frequently  it seems  the Art World is shaken by a sensational story. From the discovery of a Turner in the bric-a-brac of a garage sale to the sudden increase in value of a self-destructing Banksy at the end of its sale… there appears to be many different ways to make a substantial profit on the art market. But in reality  these sensational stories remain exceptional  and for each of them  tens of thousands of works change hands every year in a much more discreet and reasonable manner.Reducing uncertaintyRisk  in the financial sense  is an integral part of any form of investment  and art is no exception to this rule; indeed quite the contrary. Fortunately  this risk can be partly controlled in several ways  notably by knowing how to recognize the value of a work and by buying at the best price.The buyer who dared to acquire Christopher Wool's Untitled (1990) in 2000 for $35 250  completed an extraordinary operation by reselling it fifteen years later for $2 405 000. Nevertheless  that investment involved significant financial risks linked to a high level of uncertainty. The value accretion of works by Christopher Wool essentially began after the financial crisis of 2008  as revealed by the price index calculated by Artprice for original works by this artist. In fact  a collector who bought a canvas (or a drawing) by Christopher Wool just after he joined the Gagosian and Simon Lee galleries in 2006  would have benefited almost as much from Wool's success  but without taking the same risks as the buyer who bought in 2000.Story continuesInvestment StrategyThe second way to reduce volatility is – as with any other asset class – to diversify a portfolio. This is the practical raison d'être of the Artprice100©: to simulate a collection that follows a simple and objective diversification strategy. Like the major stock market indices  the Artprice100© invests in the hundred best-performing signatures on the secondary art market.Description of the Artprice100© and its methodology:https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/artprice-launches-its-blue-chip-art-market-index-artprice100-designed-for-financiers-and-investors-2The benefits of diversification do however have certain limits. While the Artprice100© shows an increase of +36%  substantially higher than that of the S&P 500 (+27% over the year 2021)  the Artprice Global Index reveals that the value of a general portfolio  i.e. relating to the entire art market  would have fallen by -1% during the same year 2021.The ""division"" of artworks… ""fractional"" investingThe Artprice100© is by nature a purely theoretical exercise since it is practically impossible to constitute a portfolio that would unite works representative of the markets of the world's one hundred most successful artists. Nevertheless  many investors like the idea of instruments that allow them to participate in the art market in a flexible way.In this domain  a number of new proposals have recently been made – notably by the companies Masterworks and ARTBnk – that offer investors the opportunity to acquire shares in collections for which the risks and returns have been estimated. These offers include a particularly interesting feature: the freedom to buy and resell your shares at any time. This type of instrument has the distinct advantage of obviating the need for what can be a long and costly operation when it comes to reselling a unique work in the best place and at the best time.In this context  NFTs open up highly original perspectives. With NFTs  you can exchange a digital title (of a unique or a limited edition work) on ultra-secure blockchain networks. Transaction costs are much lower (around 2% to 3%) compared to those practiced on the traditional art market.

7451,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-the-artprice-100-index-up-36-in-2021-301581416.html,Artmarket.com: the Artprice 100© index up +36% in 2021,PARIS  July 6  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Art is now widely considered an alternative investment that not only offers high returns but also a relatively low correlation to other financial assets. Investing in the greatest artists (such as Pablo Picasso  Claude Mone…,"Thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com: "" We are very proud to have played a leading role for 25 years  with Artprice  in the process of democratizing the art market. Restricted to an elite group of connoisseurs until the end of the 20th century  the art market is now accessssible to a much larger number of people. Our services offer affordable information that can be consulted anywhere  without limit and it is updated every hour. With our value-added data  art professionals and enthusiasts can buy and sell exceptional and family works with complete peace of mind "".Frequently  it seems  the Art World is shaken by a sensational story. From the discovery of a Turner in the bric-a-brac of a garage sale to the sudden increase in value of a self-destructing Banksy at the end of its sale… there appears to be many different ways to make a substantial profit on the art market. But in reality  these sensational stories remain exceptional  and for each of them  tens of thousands of works change hands every year in a much more discreet and reasonable manner.Reducing uncertaintyRisk  in the financial sense  is an integral part of any form of investment  and art is no exception to this rule; indeed quite the contrary. Fortunately  this risk can be partly controlled in several ways  notably by knowing how to recognize the value of a work and by buying at the best price.The buyer who dared to acquire Christopher Wool's Untitled (1990) in 2000 for $35 250  completed an extraordinary operation by reselling it fifteen years later for $2 405 000. Nevertheless  that investment involved significant financial risks linked to a high level of uncertainty. The value accretion of works by Christopher Wool essentially began after the financial crisis of 2008  as revealed by the price index calculated by Artprice for original works by this artist. In fact  a collector who bought a canvas (or a drawing) by Christopher Wool just after he joined the Gagosian and Simon Lee galleries in 2006  would have benefited almost as much from Wool's success  but without taking the same risks as the buyer who bought in 2000.Investment StrategyThe second way to reduce volatility is – as with any other asset class – to diversify a portfolio. This is the practical raison d'être of the Artprice100©: to simulate a collection that follows a simple and objective diversification strategy. Like the major stock market indices  the Artprice100© invests in the hundred best-performing signatures on the secondary art market.Description of the Artprice100© and its methodology:https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/artprice-launches-its-blue-chip-art-market-index-artprice100-designed-for-financiers-and-investors-2The benefits of diversification do however have certain limits. While the Artprice100© shows an increase of +36%  substantially higher than that of the S&P 500 (+27% over the year 2021)  the Artprice Global Index reveals that the value of a general portfolio  i.e. relating to the entire art market  would have fallen by -1% during the same year 2021.The ""division"" of artworks… ""fractional"" investingThe Artprice100© is by nature a purely theoretical exercise since it is practically impossible to constitute a portfolio that would unite works representative of the markets of the world's one hundred most successful artists. Nevertheless  many investors like the idea of instruments that allow them to participate in the art market in a flexible way.In this domain  a number of new proposals have recently been made – notably by the companies Masterworks and ARTBnk – that offer investors the opportunity to acquire shares in collections for which the risks and returns have been estimated. These offers include a particularly interesting feature: the freedom to buy and resell your shares at any time. This type of instrument has the distinct advantage of obviating the need for what can be a long and costly operation when it comes to reselling a unique work in the best place and at the best time.In this context  NFTs open up highly original perspectives. With NFTs  you can exchange a digital title (of a unique or a limited edition work) on ultra-secure blockchain networks. Transaction costs are much lower (around 2% to 3%) compared to those practiced on the traditional art market. However  these low costs reflect the absence of expert appraisal and promotion work provided by art dealers and auction houses.The information and econometric studies sold or published by Artmarket.com provide an analysis of the trends and statistical evolution of the art market and should not in any way be considered as a solicitation  incentive  or advice to invest in the art market.Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Restricted to an elite group of connoisseurs until the end of the 20th century  the art market is now accessssible to a much larger number of people. Our services offer affordable information that can be consulted anywhere  without limit and it is updated every hour. With our value-added data  art professionals and enthusiasts can buy and sell exceptional and family works with complete peace of mind "".Frequently  it seems  the Art World is shaken by a sensational story. From the discovery of a Turner in the bric-a-brac of a garage sale to the sudden increase in value of a self-destructing Banksy at the end of its sale… there appears to be many different ways to make a substantial profit on the art market. But in reality  these sensational stories remain exceptional  and for each of them  tens of thousands of works change hands every year in a much more discreet and reasonable manner.Reducing uncertaintyRisk  in the financial sense  is an integral part of any form of investment  and art is no exception to this rule; indeed quite the contrary. Fortunately  this risk can be partly controlled in several ways  notably by knowing how to recognize the value of a work and by buying at the best price.The buyer who dared to acquire Christopher Wool's Untitled (1990) in 2000 for $35 250  completed an extraordinary operation by reselling it fifteen years later for $2 405 000. Nevertheless  that investment involved significant financial risks linked to a high level of uncertainty. The value accretion of works by Christopher Wool essentially began after the financial crisis of 2008  as revealed by the price index calculated by Artprice for original works by this artist. In fact  a collector who bought a canvas (or a drawing) by Christopher Wool just after he joined the Gagosian and Simon Lee galleries in 2006  would have benefited almost as much from Wool's success  but without taking the same risks as the buyer who bought in 2000.Investment StrategyThe second way to reduce volatility is – as with any other asset class – to diversify a portfolio. This is the practical raison d'être of the Artprice100©: to simulate a collection that follows a simple and objective diversification strategy. Like the major stock market indices  the Artprice100© invests in the hundred best-performing signatures on the secondary art market.Description of the Artprice100© and its methodology:https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/artprice-launches-its-blue-chip-art-market-index-artprice100-designed-for-financiers-and-investors-2The benefits of diversification do however have certain limits. While the Artprice100© shows an increase of +36%  substantially higher than that of the S&P 500 (+27% over the year 2021)  the Artprice Global Index reveals that the value of a general portfolio  i.e. relating to the entire art market  would have fallen by -1% during the same year 2021.The ""division"" of artworks… ""fractional"" investingThe Artprice100© is by nature a purely theoretical exercise since it is practically impossible to constitute a portfolio that would unite works representative of the markets of the world's one hundred most successful artists. Nevertheless  many investors like the idea of instruments that allow them to participate in the art market in a flexible way.In this domain  a number of new proposals have recently been made – notably by the companies Masterworks and ARTBnk – that offer investors the opportunity to acquire shares in collections for which the risks and returns have been estimated. These offers include a particularly interesting feature: the freedom to buy and resell your shares at any time. This type of instrument has the distinct advantage of obviating the need for what can be a long and costly operation when it comes to reselling a unique work in the best place and at the best time.In this context  NFTs open up highly original perspectives. With NFTs  you can exchange a digital title (of a unique or a limited edition work) on ultra-secure blockchain networks. Transaction costs are much lower (around 2% to 3%) compared to those practiced on the traditional art market. However  these low costs reflect the absence of expert appraisal and promotion work provided by art dealers and auction houses.The information and econometric studies sold or published by Artmarket.com provide an analysis of the trends and statistical evolution of the art market and should not in any way be considered as a solicitation  incentive  or advice to invest in the art market.Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

With this  Campine continues its expansion plans in the circular economy.By a judgement dated July 6th 2022  the commercial court of Paris approved the assets sale offer submitted by Campine for selected assets of Recylex SA. Campine will consequently become the new owner of the lead battery recycling plants located in Escaudoeuvres (near Cambrai) and Villefranche-sur-Saône (near Lyon)  France  as well as the plastics recycling company C2P  a subsidiary of Recylex SA  operating on the same site in Villefranche.The 2 Recylex sites employ about 60 people and have a current recycling capacity of about 90 000 tonnes of used batteries and 11 000 tonnes of PP (Polypropylene) plastic waste. The acquisition is a substantial upstream expansion of Campine’s battery recycling scope and adds recycled plastics as an additional material output. The 2021 yearly sales revenue (as reported by Recylex) of the acquired assets amounts to about 88 million €.“This is a huge step for us” says CEO De Vos “Campine is now really a multi material recycling enterprise. We are one of the very few companies effectively recycling and producing metals  chemicals and plastics. With the addition of the 2 battery breaker plants  we also realise a next step towards a higher material recovery rate in our waste recycling processes.” Campine also sees interesting opportunities in the circular economy for plastics. “There are considerable synergies with our Specialty Chemicals business in terms of technology and customer base and the plastics recycling business offers plenty of chances for growth” CEO De Vos concludes.Today Campine produces about 60 000 tonnes of refined lead metal from scraps (mainly used car-batteries). It does presently not ‘dismantle’ nor break the batteries into the different material fractions  but processes the complete battery in the shaft furnace in Belgium. The new assets will allow Campine to recover more materials in the recycling process  such as the PP (Polypropylene) plastic from the outer casing of the battery. Nicolas De Backer  who is appointed Managing Director of Campine France  the French company wholly owned by Campine NV which was specifically incorporated for the purpose of the acquisition  specifies that ”We will maximise the output of the breaker factories  by supplying the former Recylex customers and gradually add the breaking of the batteries used on our Beerse site today. The breaker sites will thus also become suppliers of our Belgian lead smelter”.Story continuesCampine paid a total sum of about 0.75 million € for the assets and a complement*. Campine takes control as of July 7th and has the economic responsibility going forward.Campine will maintain employment in the 3 factories and plans about 8 to 10 M€ of investments in the next 4 years to improve efficiency and introduce new technologies. Campine also aims to continue the relationship with the existing suppliers  service providers and customers.The transaction is completely debt free and none of the Recylex debt-liabilities is transferred to Campine. All legal proceedings against Recylex remain in Recylex SA  who will continue to exist under the insolvency proceedings. Also the environmental liabilities linked to the former Recylex smelter and refining activities operated on the sites remains within Recylex  with exception of those related to the acquired breaker business.* Campine paid a total sum of about 0.75 M€ for the assets (including normalized stocks for Recylex SA and normalized working capital for C2P) and a complement for all additional stocks of raw material and finished goods of Recylex SA and the additional available cash (above the normalized working capital) of C2P. The final complement price will be subsequently adjusted to the basis of the real amounts of such elements on July 7th 2022 and is estimated to about 3.5 M€.For further information you can contact Karin Leysen (tel. no +32 14 60 15 49)(email: Karin.Leysen@campine.com)Attachments,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.34,0.36,0.29,True,English,"['two battery recycling factories', 'circular economy', 'one plastics', 'Campine', 'growth', 'acquisition', 'higher material recovery rate', 'multi material recycling enterprise', 'Recylex S.A. group', 'lead battery recycling plants', 'different material fractions', '2021 yearly sales revenue', 'CEO De Vos', 'Nicolas De Backer', 'Belgian lead smelter', 'current recycling capacity', 'waste recycling processes', 'normalized working capital', 'additional available cash', 'substantial upstream expansion', 'battery recycling scope', '2 battery breaker plants', 'former Recylex smelter', 'specialty chemicals company', 'Specialty Chemicals business', 'additional material output', 'final complement price', 'plastics recycling company', 'plastics recycling business', 'assets sale offer', 'former Recylex customers', 'Polypropylene) plastic waste', 'raw material', 'lead metal', 'breaker business', 'French company', 'normalized stocks', 'additional stocks', 'complete battery', '3 recycling factories', 'expansion plans', 'metals recycling', 'Recylex SA', 'Recylex debt-liabilities', 'July 6th', 'Euronext Brussels', 'insolvency proceedings', 'circular economy', 'commercial court', 'new owner', 'Villefranche-sur-Saône', 'same site', 'recycled plastics', 'huge step', 'next step', 'interesting opportunities', 'considerable synergies', 'customer base', 'shaft furnace', 'outer casing', 'Managing Director', 'total sum', 'July 7th', 'economic responsibility', 'next 4 years', 'new technologies', 'service providers', 'legal proceedings', 'environmental liabilities', 'refining activities', 'finished goods', 'real amounts', 'Karin Leysen', 'Karin.Leysen', 'breaker factories', 'breaker sites', '2 Recylex sites', 'Occasional information', 'new assets', 'Beerse site', 'existing suppliers', '8 to 10 M€', 'Campine NV', 'Campine France', '3 factories', '0.75 M', '3.5 M', 'Belgium', 'context', 'judgement', 'Paris', 'Escaudoeuvres', 'Cambrai', 'Lyon', 'C2P', 'subsidiary', 'The', '60 people', '90,000 tonnes', 'batteries', '11,000 tonnes', 'acquisition', 'companies', 'terms', 'technology', 'plenty', 'chances', 'growth', '60,000 tonnes', 'scraps', 'materials', 'purpose', 'breaking', 'Story', 'control', 'employment', 'investments', 'efficiency', 'relationship', 'transaction', 'none', 'exception', 'basis', 'elements', 'tel', 'email', 'Attachments']",2022-07-06,2022-07-06,finance.yahoo.com

(Euronext Paris : FR0000120388 - RX) welcomes the decision of the Paris Commercial Court to adopt a partial disposal plan and to order  as a consequence  the judicial disposal  as part of a ""prepack cession"" procedure  of the lead and polypropylene recycling activities of its operating sites of Escaudoeuvres (North) and of Villefranche-sur-Saône (Rhône) to the benefit of Campine NV  a company listed on Euronext Brussels  operating company of the Belgian industrial group of the same name.This decision is part of the reorganization proceeding (redressement judiciaire) opened at the request of Recylex S.A. by the Paris Commercial Court on May 5  2022i.The takeover of the two lead battery recycling sites will be accompanied by the takeover of all the jobs associated with these sites (some 60 direct jobs) and the transfer to Campine NV of Recylex S.A.'s stake in C2P S.A.S. (the company operating the polypropylene recycling business at the Villefranche-sur-Saône site).This takeover will also benefit the activities of Recylex S.A.'s partners  suppliers and subcontractors in these two local and regional areas.This takeover  which will make it possible to maintain an industrial recycling activity in France representing 90 000 tons of batteries per year and involving the recovery and treatment of around five million batteries (from cars  trucks  machines  submarines  etc.) as well as almost 11 000 tons of plastic waste per year  would not have been possible without the support of the various public and private stakeholders who worked alongside the Recylex S.A. management team  assisted by the investment bank Oddo BHF Corporate Finance which approached about 80 potential buyers.The management of these activities is ensured par Campine NV as of July 7  2022.The purchase price of the related activities (including inventories) amounts to roughly 4 million of eurosii  that is less than 10% of the total indebtedness of Recylex S.A. partly inherited from the former Metaleurop company  with its various creditors (mainly Glencore International AG  the European Commission  SNCF Réseau  Rétia  …).Story continuesFollowing the adoption of this partial disposal plan  Recylex S.A.'s activity will be reduced to that of a holding company  consisting of the management of heavy financial and environmental liabilities and of the 50% stake in Recytech S.A.  which is the subject of several pledges.In view of the above  Recylex S.A. is being kept in reorganization proceeding in order to study a legal solution for restructuring its debt  which is nevertheless very uncertain.The Company also announces that by order of the Commercial Court of Paris dated June 30  2022  the deadline for holding the shareholders' meeting to approve the 2021 financial statements has been extended to October 30  2022 iii.In this context  there are no plans to resume the listing of Recylex S.A. shares.***i See press releases dated April 15th  May 6th  June 15th 2022ii Namely  in accordance with the offer submitted by Campine NV and examined by the Paris Commercial Court  €0.75 million for the assets taken over (including Recylex S.A's standardized inventories and C2P S.A.S' standardized working capital) and an additional amount for Recylex S.A's additional raw materials and finished goods inventories and C2P S.A.S.'s additional working capital (over and above normalized working capital). The final amount of the earn-out will be adjusted on the basis of actual values as of July 7  2022 and is estimated at approximately €3.5 million.iii Given the impossibility for the Board of Directors to close the accounts for the year ending December 31  2021 as a going concern  the Company had asked the President of the Paris Commercial Court to postpone the deadline for the Annual General Meeting to October 30  2022 at the latest.

Preparations have since then been made for the imminent inauguration of the financial product.Fidelity Digital Services  a subsidiary of American financial services corporation Fidelity Investments  will be providing custodial services for the fund.

7473,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artmarket-com-artprice-100-index-120000180.html,Artmarket.com: the Artprice 100© index up +36% in 2021,Art is now widely considered an alternative investment that not only offers high returns but also a relatively low correlation to other financial assets...,"PARIS  July 6  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Art is now widely considered an alternative investment that not only offers high returns but also a relatively low correlation to other financial assets. Investing in the greatest artists (such as Pablo Picasso  Claude Monet  or Georgia O'Keeffe) can therefore be a matter of personal satisfaction and financial advantage – as long as we take into consideration certain art market specificities such as the timeframes for selling unique works and the considerable associated costs.Artmarket.com: the Artprice 100© index up +36% in 2021 (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)Thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com: ""We are very proud to have played a leading role for 25 years  with Artprice  in the process of democratizing the art market. Restricted to an elite group of connoisseurs until the end of the 20th century  the art market is now accessssible to a much larger number of people. Our services offer affordable information that can be consulted anywhere  without limit and it is updated every hour. With our value-added data  art professionals and enthusiasts can buy and sell exceptional and family works with complete peace of mind"".Frequently  it seems  the Art World is shaken by a sensational story. From the discovery of a Turner in the bric-a-brac of a garage sale to the sudden increase in value of a self-destructing Banksy at the end of its sale… there appears to be many different ways to make a substantial profit on the art market. But in reality  these sensational stories remain exceptional  and for each of them  tens of thousands of works change hands every year in a much more discreet and reasonable manner.Reducing uncertaintyRisk  in the financial sense  is an integral part of any form of investment  and art is no exception to this rule; indeed quite the contrary. Fortunately  this risk can be partly controlled in several ways  notably by knowing how to recognize the value of a work and by buying at the best price.The buyer who dared to acquire Christopher Wool's Untitled (1990) in 2000 for $35 250  completed an extraordinary operation by reselling it fifteen years later for $2 405 000. Nevertheless  that investment involved significant financial risks linked to a high level of uncertainty. The value accretion of works by Christopher Wool essentially began after the financial crisis of 2008  as revealed by the price index calculated by Artprice for original works by this artist. In fact  a collector who bought a canvas (or a drawing) by Christopher Wool just after he joined the Gagosian and Simon Lee galleries in 2006  would have benefited almost as much from Wool's success  but without taking the same risks as the buyer who bought in 2000.Story continuesInvestment StrategyThe second way to reduce volatility is – as with any other asset class – to diversify a portfolio. This is the practical raison d'être of the Artprice100©: to simulate a collection that follows a simple and objective diversification strategy. Like the major stock market indices  the Artprice100© invests in the hundred best-performing signatures on the secondary art market.Description of the Artprice100© and its methodology:https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/artprice-launches-its-blue-chip-art-market-index-artprice100-designed-for-financiers-and-investors-2The benefits of diversification do however have certain limits. While the Artprice100© shows an increase of +36%  substantially higher than that of the S&P 500 (+27% over the year 2021)  the Artprice Global Index reveals that the value of a general portfolio  i.e. relating to the entire art market  would have fallen by -1% during the same year 2021.The ""division"" of artworks… ""fractional"" investingThe Artprice100© is by nature a purely theoretical exercise since it is practically impossible to constitute a portfolio that would unite works representative of the markets of the world's one hundred most successful artists. Nevertheless  many investors like the idea of instruments that allow them to participate in the art market in a flexible way.In this domain  a number of new proposals have recently been made – notably by the companies Masterworks and ARTBnk – that offer investors the opportunity to acquire shares in collections for which the risks and returns have been estimated. These offers include a particularly interesting feature: the freedom to buy and resell your shares at any time. This type of instrument has the distinct advantage of obviating the need for what can be a long and costly operation when it comes to reselling a unique work in the best place and at the best time.In this context  NFTs open up highly original perspectives. With NFTs  you can exchange a digital title (of a unique or a limited edition work) on ultra-secure blockchain networks. Transaction costs are much lower (around 2% to 3%) compared to those practiced on the traditional art market. However  these low costs reflect the absence of expert appraisal and promotion work provided by art dealers and auction houses.The information and econometric studies sold or published by Artmarket.com provide an analysis of the trends and statistical evolution of the art market and should not in any way be considered as a solicitation  incentive  or advice to invest in the art market.Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

7476,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2022/07/06/heathbeacon-issues-sales-warning-amid-delays-in-chip-supplies/,HealthBeacon issues sales warning amid delays in chip supplies,CEO says company still well positioned for growth in 2023 and beyond despite near-term challenges,HealthBeacon  the Dublin-based medical technology company  issued a sales warning on Wednesday  saying delays in securing computer chips have temporarily held up production of devices that help patients stick to injection routines.The company  which floated on Euronext Dublin last December  said the delays meant the company would be able to deploy only 15 000 of its digital sharps bins this year. It has also had to push out by three months the timeline of its key target of having 100 000 of the devices in the market  to the end of March 2024. Shares in the company fell more than 15 per cent.HealthBeacon  which was founded in 2013  has developed a digital sharps bin aimed at making it easier for patients injecting themselves with medicines at home to stick to their medication schedule. Its devices are digitally connected to individuals’ smartphones and are used for the disposal of injector pens and syringes and tracking of individual patients’ adherence to medication regimes. The system will also remind people to stick with their course of medicine  if necessary.The company  led by chief executive and co-founder Jim Joyce  said it expected to have its supply chain challenges resolved by the fourth quarter of this year.HealthBeacon said in investor presentations around the time of its €25 million initial public offering (IPO) last year that it expected its number of deployed units to grow from about 10 200 in 2021 to 35 000-60 000 units this year  before rising to 100 000 in 2023.The company’s main distribution channel to date has been through deals with pharmaceutical companies  including Sanofi  Novartis and Teva  that cover the cost of the devices. It has also expanded recently into selling units directly to consumers in the US through home appliances distributor Hamilton Beach Brands  and is developing a sales channel where costs are reimbursed by health insurance programmes.Mr Joyce said early last month that uneven reopening of economies from lockdown has led to all sorts of supply chain issues and inflation across everything from plastics to computer chips and transport used by HealthBeacon. However  he said the key target of having 100 000 units deployed by the end of 2023 remained in sight.“Our product is transforming the management of patients on critical injectable medications and our ambition to be a global leader in adherence devices is being realised. Despite these near-term challenges  the company is well positioned for growth in 2023 and beyond ” Mr Joyce said in the statement on Wednesday.Analysts at Goodbody Stockbrokers  which managed the company’s IPO last year  said in a note: “While the statement from HealthBeacon this morning is clearly disappointing  we would point to the supply nature of the delay  with constraints in terms of chip components a constraint across industry in general.”Shares in HealthBeacon were off 33 per cent from their IPO price on Wednesday.,negative,0.02,0.21,0.77,negative,0.01,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['sales warning', 'chip supplies', 'HealthBeacon', 'delays', '€25 million initial public offering', 'Dublin-based medical technology company', 'digital sharps bins', 'Hamilton Beach Brands', 'health insurance programmes', 'critical injectable medications', 'supply chain issues', 'main distribution channel', 'supply chain challenges', 'home appliances distributor', 'individual patients’ adherence', 'supply nature', 'sales channel', 'near-term challenges', 'sales warning', 'computer chips', 'injection routines', 'Euronext Dublin', 'three months', 'key target', 'medication schedule', 'individuals’ smartphones', 'injector pens', 'medication regimes', 'chief executive', 'Jim Joyce', 'fourth quarter', 'investor presentations', 'pharmaceutical companies', 'Mr Joyce', 'uneven reopening', 'global leader', 'Goodbody Stockbrokers', 'chip components', 'adherence devices', 'IPO price', '35,000-60,000 units', '100,000 units', 'HealthBeacon', 'Wednesday', 'delays', 'production', 'timeline', 'market', 'end', 'March', 'Shares', 'medicines', 'disposal', 'syringes', 'tracking', 'system', 'people', 'course', 'founder', 'year', 'number', 'date', 'deals', 'Sanofi', 'Novartis', 'Teva', 'cost', 'consumers', 'US', 'economies', 'lockdown', 'sorts', 'inflation', 'everything', 'plastics', 'transport', 'sight', 'management', 'ambition', 'growth', 'statement', 'Analysts', 'note', 'constraints', 'terms', '15']",2022-07-06,2022-07-06,irishtimes.com

7478,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-the-artprice-100-index-up-36-in-2021-301581416.html,Artmarket.com: the Artprice 100© index up +36% in 2021,PARIS  July 6  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Art is now widely considered an alternative investment that not only offers high returns but also a relatively low correlation to other financial assets. Investing in the greatest artists (such as Pablo Picasso  Claude Mone…,"Thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com: "" We are very proud to have played a leading role for 25 years  with Artprice  in the process of democratizing the art market. Restricted to an elite group of connoisseurs until the end of the 20th century  the art market is now accessssible to a much larger number of people. Our services offer affordable information that can be consulted anywhere  without limit and it is updated every hour. With our value-added data  art professionals and enthusiasts can buy and sell exceptional and family works with complete peace of mind "".Frequently  it seems  the Art World is shaken by a sensational story. From the discovery of a Turner in the bric-a-brac of a garage sale to the sudden increase in value of a self-destructing Banksy at the end of its sale… there appears to be many different ways to make a substantial profit on the art market. But in reality  these sensational stories remain exceptional  and for each of them  tens of thousands of works change hands every year in a much more discreet and reasonable manner.Reducing uncertaintyRisk  in the financial sense  is an integral part of any form of investment  and art is no exception to this rule; indeed quite the contrary. Fortunately  this risk can be partly controlled in several ways  notably by knowing how to recognize the value of a work and by buying at the best price.The buyer who dared to acquire Christopher Wool's Untitled (1990) in 2000 for $35 250  completed an extraordinary operation by reselling it fifteen years later for $2 405 000. Nevertheless  that investment involved significant financial risks linked to a high level of uncertainty. The value accretion of works by Christopher Wool essentially began after the financial crisis of 2008  as revealed by the price index calculated by Artprice for original works by this artist. In fact  a collector who bought a canvas (or a drawing) by Christopher Wool just after he joined the Gagosian and Simon Lee galleries in 2006  would have benefited almost as much from Wool's success  but without taking the same risks as the buyer who bought in 2000.Investment StrategyThe second way to reduce volatility is – as with any other asset class – to diversify a portfolio. This is the practical raison d'être of the Artprice100©: to simulate a collection that follows a simple and objective diversification strategy. Like the major stock market indices  the Artprice100© invests in the hundred best-performing signatures on the secondary art market.Description of the Artprice100© and its methodology:https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/artprice-launches-its-blue-chip-art-market-index-artprice100-designed-for-financiers-and-investors-2The benefits of diversification do however have certain limits. While the Artprice100© shows an increase of +36%  substantially higher than that of the S&P 500 (+27% over the year 2021)  the Artprice Global Index reveals that the value of a general portfolio  i.e. relating to the entire art market  would have fallen by -1% during the same year 2021.The ""division"" of artworks… ""fractional"" investingThe Artprice100© is by nature a purely theoretical exercise since it is practically impossible to constitute a portfolio that would unite works representative of the markets of the world's one hundred most successful artists. Nevertheless  many investors like the idea of instruments that allow them to participate in the art market in a flexible way.In this domain  a number of new proposals have recently been made – notably by the companies Masterworks and ARTBnk – that offer investors the opportunity to acquire shares in collections for which the risks and returns have been estimated. These offers include a particularly interesting feature: the freedom to buy and resell your shares at any time. This type of instrument has the distinct advantage of obviating the need for what can be a long and costly operation when it comes to reselling a unique work in the best place and at the best time.In this context  NFTs open up highly original perspectives. With NFTs  you can exchange a digital title (of a unique or a limited edition work) on ultra-secure blockchain networks. Transaction costs are much lower (around 2% to 3%) compared to those practiced on the traditional art market. However  these low costs reflect the absence of expert appraisal and promotion work provided by art dealers and auction houses.The information and econometric studies sold or published by Artmarket.com provide an analysis of the trends and statistical evolution of the art market and should not in any way be considered as a solicitation  incentive  or advice to invest in the art market.Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Although it formed in 2007  just a year after Spotify  Deezer has struggled in its efforts to break into a field that has become dominated by Spotify  Apple Music  Amazon Music and YouTube. It attempted an IPO in 2015 but backed off after a steep decline in listeners at Pandora radio cooled the market for streaming services.Today’s curiously timed listing arrives against a backdrop of a possible global recession and Spotify’s value plunging to its lowest price as a public company just two months ago due to weak paid subscriber growth exacerbated by controversies around its top podcaster  Joe Rogan.“The sector is super competitive ” DZ Bank analyst Manuel Muehl told Yahoo Finance. “There are multiple services – Amazon Prime  Apple Music etc – which are run by large U.S. companies with very deep pockets. [They] can subsidize their business with other income streams  and therefore they do not depend on the success of their music-platforms unlike ‘pure-play’ companies do.”Regardless  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire  who attended the ceremony marking Deezer’s market debut  sung its praises on social media. “@DeezerFR’s IPO is not only an economic and technological success  but it is also a cultural success ” Le Maire tweeted. “Defending Deezer is defending our culture… our musical heritage.”In April  Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueira (pictured above) told the Wall Street Journal  “What we’re trying to do with our partners is replicate the Apple and Amazon strategy  but we bring the music product and they bring the user base  so together we can replicate that model.

A day for celebration? Well  the champagne may have tasted slightly flat once the market’s first-day verdict was delivered.,Deezer famously abandoned its plans for an IPO in 2015  but seven years on it has finally gone public – through that most 2022 of mechanisms  a ‘SPAC’ merger. A day for celebration? Well  the champagne may have tasted slightly flat once the market’s first-day verdict was delivered.Deezer opened trading on the Euronext Paris exchange at €8.50 per share ($8.72) before the price dived by 35%  recovering to €6.52 later in the morning. A bumpy first day  although as ever with this kind of listing  the true verdict will be delivered over weeks and months  not hours.Deezer  of course  will be looking to the positive. Its merger with a company called I2PO included €143m of new funding: a combination of cash held by that company  and ‘PIPE’ (Private Investment in Public Equity  when investors buy shares from a public company below market price) involving existing backers including Access Industries  Universal Music  Warner Music and Orange.“Through merging with I2PO and going public  we have created a solid foundation to execute our strategic plan  with the right capital  expertise  and network ” was CEO Jeronimo Folgueira’s pitch. “With a highly competitive product  a clear strategy  and a renewed and experienced management team  we will make the most of this opportunity to create substantial shareholder value.”The early performance of Deezer’s shares suggests investors will take a bit more convincing. We reported in April on the figures revealed by Deezer’s SPAC announcement. It showed that the company added 0.2 million net new subscribers in 2021  while its revenues grew by 5.5% that year to €400m – 60.7% of which came from its homeland  France.Still  now the listing is done  Deezer will be focusing on proving to investors that it can accelerate its growth  and compete against much-bigger rivals in various parts of the world. As a public company  we’ll now have quarterly updates on how that’s going. And  of course  a real-time and sometimes brutally honest metric – the share price – to gauge investors’ responses.Written by: Stuart Dredge Share:Sign Up For Music Ally's Free Weekly Newsletter The Knowledge - at-a-glance analysis of the modern music industry,negative,0.01,0.03,0.96,mixed,0.14,0.16,0.69,True,English,"['Deezer', 'bumpy', 'listing', '0.2 million net new subscribers', 'Euronext Paris exchange', 'CEO Jeronimo Folgueira', 'experienced management team', 'substantial shareholder value', 'Free Weekly Newsletter', 'modern music industry', 'Stuart Dredge Share', 'new funding', 'Universal Music', 'Warner Music', 'Music Ally', 'seven years', 'first-day verdict', 'bumpy first', 'true verdict', 'Private Investment', 'Public Equity', 'existing backers', 'Access Industries', 'solid foundation', 'strategic plan', 'right capital', 'competitive product', 'clear strategy', 'early performance', 'SPAC announcement', 'bigger rivals', 'various parts', 'quarterly updates', 'honest metric', 'The Knowledge', 'glance analysis', 'share price', 'SPAC’ merger', 'public company', 'investors’ responses', 'market price', 'Deezer', 'plans', 'IPO', 'mechanisms', 'celebration', 'champagne', 'trading', 'morning', 'kind', 'listing', 'weeks', 'months', 'hours', 'course', 'positive', 'combination', 'cash', 'PIPE', 'shares', 'Orange', 'I2PO', 'expertise', 'network', 'pitch', 'renewed', 'opportunity', 'April', 'figures', 'revenues', 'homeland', 'France', 'growth', 'world', 'real-time', '2022', '60']",2022-07-06,2022-07-06,musically.com

The solution - Smart Broker Router - is now available worldwide to asset managers  who will benefit from automated trading workflows and data-driven decision making  thus improving trading outcomes.There is increasing pressure on asset managers to do more with less as costs climb and revenues decrease. Efficiencies must be found to stay competitive and best execution is increasingly critical as firms try to secure the most optimized price and trade execution possible. Linedata’s cloud-based trading solutions enable investment managers to enjoy benefits of outsourcing such as intelligent automation  while retaining complete control over broker and execution relationships.“We are innovating continuously and by forming strategic partnerships with companies such as BTON Financial  we will help even more asset managers gain an edge against competitors and operate in a leaner way amidst a difficult economy. Automated SaaS tools  such as the Smart Broker Router  add value to AMP in two key ways: trading performance is improved by using large TCA datasets that asset managers would struggle to collect and maintain in-house  and automation frees up time to work on larger orders ” said Timothée Raymond  Global Head of Innovation and Technology at Linedata. “Our strategy moving forward will see the addition of many more turnkey trading solutions to Linedata AMP that will empower asset managers to get an edge on their competition.”Linedata’s trading solution enables scalability while reducing the need for custom integrations. The BTON Smart Broker Router routes relevant orders to the most appropriate broker for that specific order  using a database of post-trade Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) as pre-trade analysis  and is available now for asset managers who trade globally.,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.44,0.24,0.32,True,English,"['BTON partnership', 'Linedata', 'offering', 'The BTON Smart Broker Router', 'new best execution trading solution', 'post-trade Transaction Cost Analysis', 'cloud-based Asset Management Platform', 'cloud-based trading solutions', 'data-driven decision making', 'Automated SaaS tools', 'two key ways', 'Timothée Raymond', 'turnkey trading solutions', 'automated trading workflows', 'credit technology data', 'large TCA datasets', 'BTON Financial', 'pre-trade analysis', 'appropriate broker', 'trading outcomes', 'trade execution', 'execution relationships', 'trading performance', 'asset managers', 'Euronext Paris', 'global provider', 'increasing pressure', 'optimized price', 'investment managers', 'complete control', 'strategic partnerships', 'leaner way', 'difficult economy', 'larger orders', 'Global Head', 'custom integrations', 'relevant orders', 'specific order', 'intelligent automation', 'Linedata Linedata', 'Linedata AMP', 'Source', 'services', 'evolution', 'collaboration', 'less', 'costs', 'revenues', 'Efficiencies', 'firms', 'benefits', 'outsourcing', 'companies', 'edge', 'competitors', 'value', 'time', 'Innovation', 'strategy', 'addition', 'many', 'competition', 'scalability', 'need', 'database']",2022-07-06,2022-07-06,finextra.com
7487,EuroNext,Bing API,https://completemusicupdate.com/article/deezer-arrives-on-paris-stock-exchange-share-price-slumps/,Deezer arrives on Paris stock exchange  share price slumps,Business News Digital Deezer arrives on Paris stock exchange  share price slumps By Chris Cooke \| Published on Wednesday 6 July 2022. Deezer formally arrived on the Euronext stock,Deezer arrives on Paris stock exchange  share price slumpsBy Chris Cooke | Published on Wednesday 6 July 2022Deezer formally arrived on the Euronext stock exchange in Paris yesterday following its merger with the special purpose acquisition company I2PO  creating so much excitement that its share price at one point slumped by 35%. Party time!The French streaming firm announced its plan to become a publicly listed company via the I2PO merger back in April. For its part  I2PO raised monies on the Paris stock exchange last year with the stated intent that it would use that cash for acquisitions in the entertainment sector.With that transaction and stock market listing now complete  Deezer said yesterday that it “intends to continue to grow  directing its efforts towards large attractive markets through its partnership-first strategy and focusing on product innovation and brand differentiation as the home of music  connecting fans and artists around the world”.The digital music business also reminded investors that this transaction brings 143 million euros of new money to the company  which includes cash held by I2PO plus further monies raised via a ‘private investment in public equity’ scheme  which was supported by many of the firm’s previous investors.Talking of which  Deezer’s new investor relations site also sets out the approximate stock holdings of its biggest shareholders. Access Industries – which also controls Warner Music of course – remains the biggest shareholder with a 38.06% stake. Which is considerably bigger than the stake owned by the next biggest shareholder  Orange  an early investor in Deezer  which now controls 8.13% of the company.Bigging up the future of the new publicly listed Deezer  CEO Jeronimo Folgueira said: “Deezer’s IPO on Euronext Paris is a milestone in the company’s history. We are now taking the first steps on a new and exciting journey to develop  expand and capture an even bigger part of the growing music streaming market”.“Through merging with I2PO and going public  we have created a solid foundation to execute our strategic plan  with the right capital  expertise and network”  he added. “With a highly competitive product  a clear strategy  and a renewed and experienced management team  we will make the most of this opportunity to create substantial shareholder value. We are honoured to join the Euronext Tech Leaders segment and to be ranked among the greatest tech companies in Europe”.So that’s all exciting. But does the investment community share Folgueira’s optimism? Well  the first day’s trading of the streaming firm’s shares would suggest not really. Deezer’s share price ended the day 29.4% down on its price at the point of listing  having been 35.1% down at one point.It’s no secret that some in the investment world are concerned about the likely future performance of subscription streaming services in an increasingly competitive marketplace  with the COVID-caused surge in home entertainment now over  and wider economic turmoil likely to result in at least some consumers seeking to cut their entertainment costs  while advertising budgets could also slide.Spotify has been trying very hard of late to convince investors that things aren’t as bad as some analysts reckon  particularly with audio streaming as compared to video streaming  but its share price is yet to recover from a year of decline. And Spotify  of course  is much  much bigger in terms of users and revenues than Deezer in a business where the model really needs significant scale to work.All of which means that a summer 2022 stock market listing for Deezer was always going to be tricky. But whatever happens next  now that it has a share price to monitor and quarterly financial reports to scrutinise  both investors and the music industry will be watching the progression of Deezer much more closely in the years ahead.READ MORE ABOUT: Deezer,negative,0.01,0.07,0.92,mixed,0.3,0.19,0.5,True,English,"['Paris stock exchange', 'share price', 'Deezer', 'Euronext Tech Leaders segment', 'special purpose acquisition company', 'summer 2022 stock market listing', 'The French streaming firm', 'new investor relations site', 'growing music streaming market', 'greatest tech companies', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'approximate stock holdings', 'large attractive markets', 'public equity’ scheme', 'experienced management team', 'wider economic turmoil', 'subscription streaming services', 'substantial shareholder value', 'Paris stock exchange', 'next biggest shareholder', 'CEO Jeronimo Folgueira', 'digital music business', 'Euronext Paris', 'early investor', 'audio streaming', 'video streaming', 'Warner Music', 'music industry', 'biggest shareholders', 'Chris Cooke', 'Party time', 'entertainment sector', 'partnership-first strategy', 'product innovation', 'brand differentiation', '143 million euros', 'new money', 'Access Industries', 'first steps', 'exciting journey', 'solid foundation', 'right capital', 'competitive product', 'clear strategy', 'competitive marketplace', 'COVID-caused surge', 'entertainment costs', 'advertising budgets', 'significant scale', 'financial reports', 'share price', 'one point', 'private investment', 'bigger part', 'strategic plan', 'first day', 'future performance', 'home entertainment', 'previous investors', 'investment world', 'I2PO merger', 'Deezer', 'Wednesday', 'July', 'excitement', 'April', 'monies', 'intent', 'cash', 'acquisitions', 'transaction', 'efforts', 'fans', 'artists', 'course', '38.06% stake', 'Orange', 'IPO', 'milestone', 'history', 'expertise', 'network', 'opportunity', 'Europe', 'community', 'optimism', 'trading', 'shares', 'secret', 'likely', 'consumers', 'Spotify', 'things', 'analysts', 'year', 'decline', 'terms', 'users', 'revenues', 'model', 'progression', 'READ']",2022-07-06,2022-07-06,completemusicupdate.com
