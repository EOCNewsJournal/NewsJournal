Investing in the greatest artists (such as Pablo Picasso  Claude Monet  or Georgia O'Keeffe) can therefore be a matter of personal satisfaction and financial advantage – as long as we take into consideration certain art market specificities such as the timeframes for selling unique works and the considerable associated costs.Artmarket.com: the Artprice 100© index up +36% in 2021 (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)Thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com: ""We are very proud to have played a leading role for 25 years  with Artprice  in the process of democratizing the art market.

Our services offer affordable information that can be consulted anywhere  without limit and it is updated every hour. With our value-added data  art professionals and enthusiasts can buy and sell exceptional and family works with complete peace of mind"".Frequently  it seems  the Art World is shaken by a sensational story. From the discovery of a Turner in the bric-a-brac of a garage sale to the sudden increase in value of a self-destructing Banksy at the end of its sale… there appears to be many different ways to make a substantial profit on the art market. But in reality  these sensational stories remain exceptional  and for each of them  tens of thousands of works change hands every year in a much more discreet and reasonable manner.Reducing uncertaintyRisk  in the financial sense  is an integral part of any form of investment  and art is no exception to this rule; indeed quite the contrary. Fortunately  this risk can be partly controlled in several ways  notably by knowing how to recognize the value of a work and by buying at the best price.The buyer who dared to acquire Christopher Wool's Untitled (1990) in 2000 for $35 250  completed an extraordinary operation by reselling it fifteen years later for $2 405 000. Nevertheless  that investment involved significant financial risks linked to a high level of uncertainty. The value accretion of works by Christopher Wool essentially began after the financial crisis of 2008  as revealed by the price index calculated by Artprice for original works by this artist. In fact  a collector who bought a canvas (or a drawing) by Christopher Wool just after he joined the Gagosian and Simon Lee galleries in 2006  would have benefited almost as much from Wool's success  but without taking the same risks as the buyer who bought in 2000.Story continuesInvestment StrategyThe second way to reduce volatility is – as with any other asset class – to diversify a portfolio.

7462,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/campine-continues-growth-circular-economy-155000594.html,Campine continues growth in the circular economy with the acquisition of one plastics and two battery recycling factories,Occasional information – July 6th 2022 – 17:30 Campine NV  metals recycling and specialty chemicals company from Beerse  Belgium and listed on Euronext...,Campine NVOccasional information – July 6th 2022 – 17:30Campine NV  metals recycling and specialty chemicals company from Beerse  Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels has acquired 3 recycling factories in France in the context of the insolvency proceedings opened for the Recylex S.A. group. With this  Campine continues its expansion plans in the circular economy.By a judgement dated July 6th 2022  the commercial court of Paris approved the assets sale offer submitted by Campine for selected assets of Recylex SA. Campine will consequently become the new owner of the lead battery recycling plants located in Escaudoeuvres (near Cambrai) and Villefranche-sur-Saône (near Lyon)  France  as well as the plastics recycling company C2P  a subsidiary of Recylex SA  operating on the same site in Villefranche.The 2 Recylex sites employ about 60 people and have a current recycling capacity of about 90 000 tonnes of used batteries and 11 000 tonnes of PP (Polypropylene) plastic waste. The acquisition is a substantial upstream expansion of Campine’s battery recycling scope and adds recycled plastics as an additional material output. The 2021 yearly sales revenue (as reported by Recylex) of the acquired assets amounts to about 88 million €.“This is a huge step for us” says CEO De Vos “Campine is now really a multi material recycling enterprise. We are one of the very few companies effectively recycling and producing metals  chemicals and plastics. With the addition of the 2 battery breaker plants  we also realise a next step towards a higher material recovery rate in our waste recycling processes.” Campine also sees interesting opportunities in the circular economy for plastics. “There are considerable synergies with our Specialty Chemicals business in terms of technology and customer base and the plastics recycling business offers plenty of chances for growth” CEO De Vos concludes.Today Campine produces about 60 000 tonnes of refined lead metal from scraps (mainly used car-batteries). It does presently not ‘dismantle’ nor break the batteries into the different material fractions  but processes the complete battery in the shaft furnace in Belgium. The new assets will allow Campine to recover more materials in the recycling process  such as the PP (Polypropylene) plastic from the outer casing of the battery. Nicolas De Backer  who is appointed Managing Director of Campine France  the French company wholly owned by Campine NV which was specifically incorporated for the purpose of the acquisition  specifies that ”We will maximise the output of the breaker factories  by supplying the former Recylex customers and gradually add the breaking of the batteries used on our Beerse site today. The breaker sites will thus also become suppliers of our Belgian lead smelter”.Story continuesCampine paid a total sum of about 0.75 million € for the assets and a complement*. Campine takes control as of July 7th and has the economic responsibility going forward.Campine will maintain employment in the 3 factories and plans about 8 to 10 M€ of investments in the next 4 years to improve efficiency and introduce new technologies. Campine also aims to continue the relationship with the existing suppliers  service providers and customers.The transaction is completely debt free and none of the Recylex debt-liabilities is transferred to Campine. All legal proceedings against Recylex remain in Recylex SA  who will continue to exist under the insolvency proceedings. Also the environmental liabilities linked to the former Recylex smelter and refining activities operated on the sites remains within Recylex  with exception of those related to the acquired breaker business.* Campine paid a total sum of about 0.75 M€ for the assets (including normalized stocks for Recylex SA and normalized working capital for C2P) and a complement for all additional stocks of raw material and finished goods of Recylex SA and the additional available cash (above the normalized working capital) of C2P. The final complement price will be subsequently adjusted to the basis of the real amounts of such elements on July 7th 2022 and is estimated to about 3.5 M€.For further information you can contact Karin Leysen (tel. no +32 14 60 15 49)(email: Karin.Leysen@campine.com)Attachments,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.34,0.36,0.29,True,English,"['two battery recycling factories', 'circular economy', 'one plastics', 'Campine', 'growth', 'acquisition', 'higher material recovery rate', 'multi material recycling enterprise', 'Recylex S.A. group', 'lead battery recycling plants', 'different material fractions', '2021 yearly sales revenue', 'CEO De Vos', 'Nicolas De Backer', 'Belgian lead smelter', 'current recycling capacity', 'waste recycling processes', 'normalized working capital', 'additional available cash', 'substantial upstream expansion', 'battery recycling scope', '2 battery breaker plants', 'former Recylex smelter', 'specialty chemicals company', 'Specialty Chemicals business', 'additional material output', 'final complement price', 'plastics recycling company', 'plastics recycling business', 'assets sale offer', 'former Recylex customers', 'Polypropylene) plastic waste', 'raw material', 'lead metal', 'breaker business', 'French company', 'normalized stocks', 'additional stocks', 'complete battery', '3 recycling factories', 'expansion plans', 'metals recycling', 'Recylex SA', 'Recylex debt-liabilities', 'July 6th', 'Euronext Brussels', 'insolvency proceedings', 'circular economy', 'commercial court', 'new owner', 'Villefranche-sur-Saône', 'same site', 'recycled plastics', 'huge step', 'next step', 'interesting opportunities', 'considerable synergies', 'customer base', 'shaft furnace', 'outer casing', 'Managing Director', 'total sum', 'July 7th', 'economic responsibility', 'next 4 years', 'new technologies', 'service providers', 'legal proceedings', 'environmental liabilities', 'refining activities', 'finished goods', 'real amounts', 'Karin Leysen', 'Karin.Leysen', 'breaker factories', 'breaker sites', '2 Recylex sites', 'Occasional information', 'new assets', 'Beerse site', 'existing suppliers', '8 to 10 M€', 'Campine NV', 'Campine France', '3 factories', '0.75 M', '3.5 M', 'Belgium', 'context', 'judgement', 'Paris', 'Escaudoeuvres', 'Cambrai', 'Lyon', 'C2P', 'subsidiary', 'The', '60 people', '90,000 tonnes', 'batteries', '11,000 tonnes', 'acquisition', 'companies', 'terms', 'technology', 'plenty', 'chances', 'growth', '60,000 tonnes', 'scraps', 'materials', 'purpose', 'breaking', 'Story', 'control', 'employment', 'investments', 'efficiency', 'relationship', 'transaction', 'none', 'exception', 'basis', 'elements', 'tel', 'email', 'Attachments']",2022-07-06,2022-07-07,finance.yahoo.com

(Euronext Paris : FR0000120388 - RX) welcomes the decision of the Paris Commercial Court to adopt a partial disposal plan and to order  as a consequence  the judicial disposal  as part of a ""prepack cession"" procedure  of the lead and polypropylene recycling activities of its operating sites of Escaudoeuvres (North) and of Villefranche-sur-Saône (Rhône) to the benefit of Campine NV  a company listed on Euronext Brussels  operating company of the Belgian industrial group of the same name.This decision is part of the reorganization proceeding (redressement judiciaire) opened at the request of Recylex S.A. by the Paris Commercial Court on May 5  2022i.The takeover of the two lead battery recycling sites will be accompanied by the takeover of all the jobs associated with these sites (some 60 direct jobs) and the transfer to Campine NV of Recylex S.A.'s stake in C2P S.A.S. (the company operating the polypropylene recycling business at the Villefranche-sur-Saône site).This takeover will also benefit the activities of Recylex S.A.'s partners  suppliers and subcontractors in these two local and regional areas.This takeover  which will make it possible to maintain an industrial recycling activity in France representing 90 000 tons of batteries per year and involving the recovery and treatment of around five million batteries (from cars  trucks  machines  submarines  etc.) as well as almost 11 000 tons of plastic waste per year  would not have been possible without the support of the various public and private stakeholders who worked alongside the Recylex S.A. management team  assisted by the investment bank Oddo BHF Corporate Finance which approached about 80 potential buyers.The management of these activities is ensured par Campine NV as of July 7  2022.The purchase price of the related activities (including inventories) amounts to roughly 4 million of eurosii  that is less than 10% of the total indebtedness of Recylex S.A. partly inherited from the former Metaleurop company  with its various creditors (mainly Glencore International AG  the European Commission  SNCF Réseau  Rétia  …).Story continuesFollowing the adoption of this partial disposal plan  Recylex S.A.'s activity will be reduced to that of a holding company  consisting of the management of heavy financial and environmental liabilities and of the 50% stake in Recytech S.A.  which is the subject of several pledges.In view of the above  Recylex S.A. is being kept in reorganization proceeding in order to study a legal solution for restructuring its debt  which is nevertheless very uncertain.The Company also announces that by order of the Commercial Court of Paris dated June 30  2022  the deadline for holding the shareholders' meeting to approve the 2021 financial statements has been extended to October 30  2022 iii.In this context  there are no plans to resume the listing of Recylex S.A. shares.***i See press releases dated April 15th  May 6th  June 15th 2022ii Namely  in accordance with the offer submitted by Campine NV and examined by the Paris Commercial Court  €0.75 million for the assets taken over (including Recylex S.A's standardized inventories and C2P S.A.S' standardized working capital) and an additional amount for Recylex S.A's additional raw materials and finished goods inventories and C2P S.A.S.'s additional working capital (over and above normalized working capital). The final amount of the earn-out will be adjusted on the basis of actual values as of July 7  2022 and is estimated at approximately €3.5 million.iii Given the impossibility for the Board of Directors to close the accounts for the year ending December 31  2021 as a going concern  the Company had asked the President of the Paris Commercial Court to postpone the deadline for the Annual General Meeting to October 30  2022 at the latest.

Preparations have since then been made for the imminent inauguration of the financial product.Fidelity Digital Services  a subsidiary of American financial services corporation Fidelity Investments  will be providing custodial services for the fund.

7473,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artmarket-com-artprice-100-index-120000180.html,Artmarket.com: the Artprice 100© index up +36% in 2021,Art is now widely considered an alternative investment that not only offers high returns but also a relatively low correlation to other financial assets...,"PARIS  July 6  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Art is now widely considered an alternative investment that not only offers high returns but also a relatively low correlation to other financial assets. Investing in the greatest artists (such as Pablo Picasso  Claude Monet  or Georgia O'Keeffe) can therefore be a matter of personal satisfaction and financial advantage – as long as we take into consideration certain art market specificities such as the timeframes for selling unique works and the considerable associated costs.Artmarket.com: the Artprice 100© index up +36% in 2021 (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)Thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com: ""We are very proud to have played a leading role for 25 years  with Artprice  in the process of democratizing the art market. Restricted to an elite group of connoisseurs until the end of the 20th century  the art market is now accessssible to a much larger number of people. Our services offer affordable information that can be consulted anywhere  without limit and it is updated every hour. With our value-added data  art professionals and enthusiasts can buy and sell exceptional and family works with complete peace of mind"".Frequently  it seems  the Art World is shaken by a sensational story. From the discovery of a Turner in the bric-a-brac of a garage sale to the sudden increase in value of a self-destructing Banksy at the end of its sale… there appears to be many different ways to make a substantial profit on the art market. But in reality  these sensational stories remain exceptional  and for each of them  tens of thousands of works change hands every year in a much more discreet and reasonable manner.Reducing uncertaintyRisk  in the financial sense  is an integral part of any form of investment  and art is no exception to this rule; indeed quite the contrary. Fortunately  this risk can be partly controlled in several ways  notably by knowing how to recognize the value of a work and by buying at the best price.The buyer who dared to acquire Christopher Wool's Untitled (1990) in 2000 for $35 250  completed an extraordinary operation by reselling it fifteen years later for $2 405 000. Nevertheless  that investment involved significant financial risks linked to a high level of uncertainty. The value accretion of works by Christopher Wool essentially began after the financial crisis of 2008  as revealed by the price index calculated by Artprice for original works by this artist. In fact  a collector who bought a canvas (or a drawing) by Christopher Wool just after he joined the Gagosian and Simon Lee galleries in 2006  would have benefited almost as much from Wool's success  but without taking the same risks as the buyer who bought in 2000.Story continuesInvestment StrategyThe second way to reduce volatility is – as with any other asset class – to diversify a portfolio. This is the practical raison d'être of the Artprice100©: to simulate a collection that follows a simple and objective diversification strategy. Like the major stock market indices  the Artprice100© invests in the hundred best-performing signatures on the secondary art market.Description of the Artprice100© and its methodology:https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/artprice-launches-its-blue-chip-art-market-index-artprice100-designed-for-financiers-and-investors-2The benefits of diversification do however have certain limits. While the Artprice100© shows an increase of +36%  substantially higher than that of the S&P 500 (+27% over the year 2021)  the Artprice Global Index reveals that the value of a general portfolio  i.e. relating to the entire art market  would have fallen by -1% during the same year 2021.The ""division"" of artworks… ""fractional"" investingThe Artprice100© is by nature a purely theoretical exercise since it is practically impossible to constitute a portfolio that would unite works representative of the markets of the world's one hundred most successful artists. Nevertheless  many investors like the idea of instruments that allow them to participate in the art market in a flexible way.In this domain  a number of new proposals have recently been made – notably by the companies Masterworks and ARTBnk – that offer investors the opportunity to acquire shares in collections for which the risks and returns have been estimated. These offers include a particularly interesting feature: the freedom to buy and resell your shares at any time. This type of instrument has the distinct advantage of obviating the need for what can be a long and costly operation when it comes to reselling a unique work in the best place and at the best time.In this context  NFTs open up highly original perspectives. With NFTs  you can exchange a digital title (of a unique or a limited edition work) on ultra-secure blockchain networks. Transaction costs are much lower (around 2% to 3%) compared to those practiced on the traditional art market. However  these low costs reflect the absence of expert appraisal and promotion work provided by art dealers and auction houses.The information and econometric studies sold or published by Artmarket.com provide an analysis of the trends and statistical evolution of the art market and should not in any way be considered as a solicitation  incentive  or advice to invest in the art market.Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

7476,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2022/07/06/heathbeacon-issues-sales-warning-amid-delays-in-chip-supplies/,HealthBeacon issues sales warning amid delays in chip supplies,CEO says company still well positioned for growth in 2023 and beyond despite near-term challenges,HealthBeacon  the Dublin-based medical technology company  issued a sales warning on Wednesday  saying delays in securing computer chips have temporarily held up production of devices that help patients stick to injection routines.The company  which floated on Euronext Dublin last December  said the delays meant the company would be able to deploy only 15 000 of its digital sharps bins this year. It has also had to push out by three months the timeline of its key target of having 100 000 of the devices in the market  to the end of March 2024. Shares in the company fell more than 15 per cent.HealthBeacon  which was founded in 2013  has developed a digital sharps bin aimed at making it easier for patients injecting themselves with medicines at home to stick to their medication schedule. Its devices are digitally connected to individuals’ smartphones and are used for the disposal of injector pens and syringes and tracking of individual patients’ adherence to medication regimes. The system will also remind people to stick with their course of medicine  if necessary.The company  led by chief executive and co-founder Jim Joyce  said it expected to have its supply chain challenges resolved by the fourth quarter of this year.HealthBeacon said in investor presentations around the time of its €25 million initial public offering (IPO) last year that it expected its number of deployed units to grow from about 10 200 in 2021 to 35 000-60 000 units this year  before rising to 100 000 in 2023.The company’s main distribution channel to date has been through deals with pharmaceutical companies  including Sanofi  Novartis and Teva  that cover the cost of the devices. It has also expanded recently into selling units directly to consumers in the US through home appliances distributor Hamilton Beach Brands  and is developing a sales channel where costs are reimbursed by health insurance programmes.Mr Joyce said early last month that uneven reopening of economies from lockdown has led to all sorts of supply chain issues and inflation across everything from plastics to computer chips and transport used by HealthBeacon. However  he said the key target of having 100 000 units deployed by the end of 2023 remained in sight.“Our product is transforming the management of patients on critical injectable medications and our ambition to be a global leader in adherence devices is being realised. Despite these near-term challenges  the company is well positioned for growth in 2023 and beyond ” Mr Joyce said in the statement on Wednesday.Analysts at Goodbody Stockbrokers  which managed the company’s IPO last year  said in a note: “While the statement from HealthBeacon this morning is clearly disappointing  we would point to the supply nature of the delay  with constraints in terms of chip components a constraint across industry in general.”Shares in HealthBeacon were off 33 per cent from their IPO price on Wednesday.,negative,0.02,0.21,0.77,negative,0.01,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['sales warning', 'chip supplies', 'HealthBeacon', 'delays', '€25 million initial public offering', 'Dublin-based medical technology company', 'digital sharps bins', 'Hamilton Beach Brands', 'health insurance programmes', 'critical injectable medications', 'supply chain issues', 'main distribution channel', 'supply chain challenges', 'home appliances distributor', 'individual patients’ adherence', 'supply nature', 'sales channel', 'near-term challenges', 'sales warning', 'computer chips', 'injection routines', 'Euronext Dublin', 'three months', 'key target', 'medication schedule', 'individuals’ smartphones', 'injector pens', 'medication regimes', 'chief executive', 'Jim Joyce', 'fourth quarter', 'investor presentations', 'pharmaceutical companies', 'Mr Joyce', 'uneven reopening', 'global leader', 'Goodbody Stockbrokers', 'chip components', 'adherence devices', 'IPO price', '35,000-60,000 units', '100,000 units', 'HealthBeacon', 'Wednesday', 'delays', 'production', 'timeline', 'market', 'end', 'March', 'Shares', 'medicines', 'disposal', 'syringes', 'tracking', 'system', 'people', 'course', 'founder', 'year', 'number', 'date', 'deals', 'Sanofi', 'Novartis', 'Teva', 'cost', 'consumers', 'US', 'economies', 'lockdown', 'sorts', 'inflation', 'everything', 'plastics', 'transport', 'sight', 'management', 'ambition', 'growth', 'statement', 'Analysts', 'note', 'constraints', 'terms', '15']",2022-07-06,2022-07-07,irishtimes.com

7478,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-the-artprice-100-index-up-36-in-2021-301581416.html,Artmarket.com: the Artprice 100© index up +36% in 2021,PARIS  July 6  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Art is now widely considered an alternative investment that not only offers high returns but also a relatively low correlation to other financial assets. Investing in the greatest artists (such as Pablo Picasso  Claude Mone…,"Thierry Ehrmann  CEO  and Founder of Artmarket.com: "" We are very proud to have played a leading role for 25 years  with Artprice  in the process of democratizing the art market. Restricted to an elite group of connoisseurs until the end of the 20th century  the art market is now accessssible to a much larger number of people. Our services offer affordable information that can be consulted anywhere  without limit and it is updated every hour. With our value-added data  art professionals and enthusiasts can buy and sell exceptional and family works with complete peace of mind "".Frequently  it seems  the Art World is shaken by a sensational story. From the discovery of a Turner in the bric-a-brac of a garage sale to the sudden increase in value of a self-destructing Banksy at the end of its sale… there appears to be many different ways to make a substantial profit on the art market. But in reality  these sensational stories remain exceptional  and for each of them  tens of thousands of works change hands every year in a much more discreet and reasonable manner.Reducing uncertaintyRisk  in the financial sense  is an integral part of any form of investment  and art is no exception to this rule; indeed quite the contrary. Fortunately  this risk can be partly controlled in several ways  notably by knowing how to recognize the value of a work and by buying at the best price.The buyer who dared to acquire Christopher Wool's Untitled (1990) in 2000 for $35 250  completed an extraordinary operation by reselling it fifteen years later for $2 405 000. Nevertheless  that investment involved significant financial risks linked to a high level of uncertainty. The value accretion of works by Christopher Wool essentially began after the financial crisis of 2008  as revealed by the price index calculated by Artprice for original works by this artist. In fact  a collector who bought a canvas (or a drawing) by Christopher Wool just after he joined the Gagosian and Simon Lee galleries in 2006  would have benefited almost as much from Wool's success  but without taking the same risks as the buyer who bought in 2000.Investment StrategyThe second way to reduce volatility is – as with any other asset class – to diversify a portfolio. This is the practical raison d'être of the Artprice100©: to simulate a collection that follows a simple and objective diversification strategy. Like the major stock market indices  the Artprice100© invests in the hundred best-performing signatures on the secondary art market.Description of the Artprice100© and its methodology:https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/artprice-launches-its-blue-chip-art-market-index-artprice100-designed-for-financiers-and-investors-2The benefits of diversification do however have certain limits. While the Artprice100© shows an increase of +36%  substantially higher than that of the S&P 500 (+27% over the year 2021)  the Artprice Global Index reveals that the value of a general portfolio  i.e. relating to the entire art market  would have fallen by -1% during the same year 2021.The ""division"" of artworks… ""fractional"" investingThe Artprice100© is by nature a purely theoretical exercise since it is practically impossible to constitute a portfolio that would unite works representative of the markets of the world's one hundred most successful artists. Nevertheless  many investors like the idea of instruments that allow them to participate in the art market in a flexible way.In this domain  a number of new proposals have recently been made – notably by the companies Masterworks and ARTBnk – that offer investors the opportunity to acquire shares in collections for which the risks and returns have been estimated. These offers include a particularly interesting feature: the freedom to buy and resell your shares at any time. This type of instrument has the distinct advantage of obviating the need for what can be a long and costly operation when it comes to reselling a unique work in the best place and at the best time.In this context  NFTs open up highly original perspectives. With NFTs  you can exchange a digital title (of a unique or a limited edition work) on ultra-secure blockchain networks. Transaction costs are much lower (around 2% to 3%) compared to those practiced on the traditional art market. However  these low costs reflect the absence of expert appraisal and promotion work provided by art dealers and auction houses.The information and econometric studies sold or published by Artmarket.com provide an analysis of the trends and statistical evolution of the art market and should not in any way be considered as a solicitation  incentive  or advice to invest in the art market.Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The stock exchange was targeted as part of international sanctions against Russia in 2022 and had to suspend all operations for one month.Global stock exchanges are popular destinations for digital asset-related products. Canada’s Toronto Stock Exchange is known for listing the world’s first Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund in 2021. Some European stock market operators like Deutsche Boerse have launched dedicated digital asset divisions listing a number of crypto investment products.The latest report adds some confusion to Russia’s overall stance on crypto though as the Bank of Russia has been strongly opposed to opening a local regulated crypto trading platform.“Cryptocurrencies should not be traded on organized marketplaces because these assets are too volatile  too risky for potential investors ” Bank of Russia governor Elvira Nabiullina said last month.

Launched in 2021 by Axylia  a consulting firm specialized in responsible finance  the index comprises the largest French companies listed on the Paris Stock Exchange committed to reducing carbon emissions  including those able to “afford” the cost of their carbon footprint.The Axylia Carbon Score rates a company’s ability to cover its carbon footprint cost on a scale from A to F. The cost includes all of the company’s CO 2 emissions (Scopes 1  2 and 3)  which are converted into euros thanks to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) CO 2 cost estimates. Teleperformance has obtained a Carbon Score of ‘A’  the best possible rating.French companies able to pay the cost of their carbon footprint are ranked from highest to lowest by market capitalization adjusted for their carbon valuation. The top 35 companies are then included in the Vérité40 index  and the five remaining companies in the index are selected on the basis of their commitments to reducing carbon emissions.This distinction reflects Teleperformance’s strong commitment to fighting climate change  already recognized in 2021 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)  which approved the Group’s new targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.

Over 30 sites located in France  United Kingdom  Belgium  Netherlands and United States have already been qualified to participate in this clinical trial. Topline results are expected to be published in the second half of 2023.Prof. Michelle Lai  M.D.  Ph.D.  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and co-principal investigator of the LEGEND Phase IIa clinical trial  said: “The LEGEND trial is expected to help us better understand the pathophysiology of patients we care for in our clinics who suffer of NASH and T2D. Insulin resistance is a root cause leading to the development of NASH  and the combination of lanifibranor and empagliflozin could potentially provide complementary effects and provide additional therapeutic benefits to improve the overall cardiometabolic health of our patients.”Dr. Michael Cooreman  Chief Medical Officer of Inventiva  commented: “We are delighted to see the initiation of this Proof-of-Concept study  which we believe will further draw attention to NASH as a multisystemic liver disease with a highly relevant cardiometabolic aspect. This clinical trial is anticipated to not only add to the body of evidence demonstrating the therapeutic benefits of lanifibranor on the broad spectrum of the disease biology of NASH  but should also provide insights on how the complementary mechanisms of action of a pan-PPAR agonist and an SGLT2 inihibitor could enhance the therapeutic benefits of lanifibranor.”Story continuesThe Phase IIa trial  LEGEND  has been designed as a multi-center randomized  placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of lanifibranor in combination with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of adult patients with non-cirrhotic NASH and T2D. The trial is double-blind for the placebo and lanifibranor arms and open-label for the combination of lanifibranor and empagliflozin arm.LEGEND is expected to recruit a total of 63 patients with non-cirrhotic NASH and T2D. In the trial  the diagnosis of non-cirrhotic NASH will be based on a historic histology evaluation or a combination of non-invasive methods including imaging and serum-based metabolic diagnostic tests.The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is a change in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at the end of the 24-week treatment compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints include changes in liver enzymes  glycaemic and lipids parameters  inflammatory markers and body fat composition. The trial is designed to provide valuable information on body weight evolution and body fat composition in patients with NASH and T2D when treated with lanifibranor and empagliflozin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based imaging will allow the collection of non-invasive data on hepatic fat  inflammation and fibrosis.About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms  which are well‑characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well‑balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan‑PPAR agonist in clinical development. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan‑PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre‑clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of NASH and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.The Company has established a strategic collaboration with AbbVie in the area of autoimmune diseases that resulted in the discovery of the drug candidate cedirogant (ABBV-157)  an oral RORγ inverse agonist which is being evaluated in a Phase IIb clinical trial  led by AbbVie  in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA - ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.com .ContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupLaurence Frost /Tristan Roquet Montegon /Aude LepreuxMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

Stellantis announced that the Fiat Doblò will become the fourth model built on the production line at Mangualde  joining the light commercial vehicle (LCV) line-up of Peugeot Partner  Citroën Berlingo and Opel Combo.“We intend to lead the commercial vehicle market and now with the addition of the Fiat Doblò to Mangualde’s portfolio  we will achieve greater efficiency  improve our competitiveness and offer the very best to our professional customers ” said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares. “Today we also celebrate our many team members for their commitment to sustainable production with the installation of the solar energy park that will power one-third of the plant’s energy needs once complete. I also want to warmly thank the President for joining me as we honor the automotive industry here in Portugal.”“It was important to me to be here today  together with all of you  to celebrate the 60 years of this plant in Mangualde. This factory has had a unique history  overcoming all kinds of crises and managed to resist  and now reaching the present day with an unparalleled reputation  which places it at the top in terms of quality and efficiency overall. As part of Stellantis  Mangualde represents one of the leaders in the transport and mobility sector  one of the most global in the world ” said His Excellency  the President of the Portuguese Republic  Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. “Today  I came here to hear good news  as Stellantis is adding another brand and another model to this factory's portfolio. And  additionally  the launch of a project that will help Portugal continue leading the climate and energy transition. Congratulations to all!”Story continuesIn a symbolic gesture  the President of the Republic took advantage of his presence in Mangualde to award the official acronym of the Order of Merit to António Loureiro Marques  the factory's oldest employee. In this gesture  the President of the Republic extended the distinction to all those who over the last 60 years have contributed to the success of the Mangualde factory.Opened in 1962  the Stellantis Production Center in Mangualde has produced 1.5 million vehicles to date. It is a pillar of Portuguese industrial activity and now almost one in every four vehicles produced in Portugal comes from the Mangualde production line.The plant currently builds the Citroën Berlingo Van/Berlingo  Peugeot Partner/Rifter and Opel Combo Cargo/Combo Life models - co-elected ‘International Van of the Year 2019’. The Berlingo  Partner and Combo models with the Mangualde ‘label’ are the most sought after by professional customers and companies  and form the top three LCV sales in Portugal  with a total share of 32%. In 2021  a total of 67 841 vehicles left the Stellantis plant  equivalent to almost a quarter (23.5%) of the total volume of vehicles produced in Portugal.Mangualde Adds Fourth Model: New Fiat Doblò joins Partner-Berlingo-Combo trioPlanned for October  the Fiat Doblò will become the fourth model built at Mangualde joining the list of 22 models produced at the plant over its 60 years of operation  including the three models that are currently manufactured there.The introduction of the Doblò reinforces Stellantis’ commitment to the Portuguese industry  while also creating even greater efficiency and competitiveness. The move is designed to support the needs of an increasingly diversified and demanding automotive market constantly impacted by external factors.Photovoltaic Solar Energy Park to Power 31% of Energy NeedStellantis also announced the implementation of a solar photovoltaic energy capture project for self-consumption. Once fully implemented  it will cover 31% of the Mangualde plant’s annual electricity needs  allowing the annual avoidance of 2 500 tons of CO 2 emissions  corresponding to the capturing of this same volume of CO 2 from approximately 16 000 trees. This effort supports Stellantis’ Dare Forward 2030 commitment to becoming carbon net zero by 2038  with a 50% reduction by 2030  and contributing to a sustainable future.As a result of more than €3.2 million in investments in partnership with Prosolia Energy  the project will integrate 6 363 photovoltaic panels occupying an area equivalent to six football fields. It will have an installed capacity of 3 436 MWp  equivalent to the annual consumption of 320 households  allowing  in a clean and sustainable way  to increase the competitiveness of the complex in a context that has been increasingly marked by consistent peaks in energy costs. The completion of the project’s phase 1 is scheduled for the third quarter of 2022  and phase 2 is planned to start in early 2023.As part of this investment  a sustainable energy consumption zone is also being established in collaboration with the Municipality of Mangualde and with neighboring companies  who will also benefit from the solar power.Growing  Transforming and Modernizing the Mangualde Production CenterThe Mangualde Production Center is home to four laboratories focused on studying and adopting new technologies or processes that enable more sustainable  more digital  and more connected production. Founded by Stellantis in 2022  the collaborative ecosystem of partners spanning startups  universities  suppliers  tech centers and the Portuguese government is dedicated to R&D activity related to the IoT (Internet of Things)  5G (and soon after 6G)  process engineering and additive production.

A day for celebration? Well  the champagne may have tasted slightly flat once the market’s first-day verdict was delivered.Deezer opened trading on the Euronext Paris exchange at €8.50 per share ($8.72) before the price dived by 35%  recovering to €6.52 later in the morning. A bumpy first day  although as ever with this kind of listing  the true verdict will be delivered over weeks and months  not hours.Deezer  of course  will be looking to the positive. Its merger with a company called I2PO included €143m of new funding: a combination of cash held by that company  and ‘PIPE’ (Private Investment in Public Equity  when investors buy shares from a public company below market price) involving existing backers including Access Industries  Universal Music  Warner Music and Orange.“Through merging with I2PO and going public  we have created a solid foundation to execute our strategic plan  with the right capital  expertise  and network ” was CEO Jeronimo Folgueira’s pitch. “With a highly competitive product  a clear strategy  and a renewed and experienced management team  we will make the most of this opportunity to create substantial shareholder value.”The early performance of Deezer’s shares suggests investors will take a bit more convincing. We reported in April on the figures revealed by Deezer’s SPAC announcement. It showed that the company added 0.2 million net new subscribers in 2021  while its revenues grew by 5.5% that year to €400m – 60.7% of which came from its homeland  France.Still  now the listing is done  Deezer will be focusing on proving to investors that it can accelerate its growth  and compete against much-bigger rivals in various parts of the world. As a public company  we’ll now have quarterly updates on how that’s going. And  of course  a real-time and sometimes brutally honest metric – the share price – to gauge investors’ responses.Written by: Stuart Dredge Share:Sign Up For Music Ally's Free Weekly Newsletter The Knowledge - at-a-glance analysis of the modern music industry,negative,0.01,0.03,0.96,mixed,0.14,0.16,0.69,True,English,"['Deezer', 'bumpy', 'listing', '0.2 million net new subscribers', 'Euronext Paris exchange', 'CEO Jeronimo Folgueira', 'experienced management team', 'substantial shareholder value', 'Free Weekly Newsletter', 'modern music industry', 'Stuart Dredge Share', 'new funding', 'Universal Music', 'Warner Music', 'Music Ally', 'seven years', 'first-day verdict', 'bumpy first', 'true verdict', 'Private Investment', 'Public Equity', 'existing backers', 'Access Industries', 'solid foundation', 'strategic plan', 'right capital', 'competitive product', 'clear strategy', 'early performance', 'SPAC announcement', 'bigger rivals', 'various parts', 'quarterly updates', 'honest metric', 'The Knowledge', 'glance analysis', 'share price', 'SPAC’ merger', 'public company', 'investors’ responses', 'market price', 'Deezer', 'plans', 'IPO', 'mechanisms', 'celebration', 'champagne', 'trading', 'morning', 'kind', 'listing', 'weeks', 'months', 'hours', 'course', 'positive', 'combination', 'cash', 'PIPE', 'shares', 'Orange', 'I2PO', 'expertise', 'network', 'pitch', 'renewed', 'opportunity', 'April', 'figures', 'revenues', 'homeland', 'France', 'growth', 'world', 'real-time', '2022', '60']",2022-07-06,2022-07-07,musically.com
7517,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://gcaptain.com/shippings-esg-and-sustainability-reporting-a-work-in-progress/,Shipping’s ESG and Sustainability Reporting: A Work In Progress,In recent years  shipping company disclosures have expanded to include ESG (Environment  Social  Governance). For companies with shares listed in the U.S.  these disclosures are moving beyond the requisite business...,In recent years  shipping company disclosures have expanded to include ESG (Environment  Social  Governance). For companies with shares listed in the U.S.  these disclosures are moving beyond the requisite business disclosures and financial filings required by regulators.Indeed  companies in U.S. listed markets are now studying potential new disclosure mandates from the Securities and Exchange Commission. For non-listed private companies  ESG disclosures are completely voluntary. As more shipping businesses seek to report on their efforts  I wanted to look at the “state of the art”  starting with a “compare and contrast” exercise between reports from two companies I am familiar with. Crowley  a privately-held U.S. icon in the maritime industry  released its “Sustainability Report ” a splashy 73 McKinsey-esque page report on a much broader overall ESG positioning  two weeks ago.Earlier this year  MPC Container Ships  an Oslo-listed owner of vessels serving regional and feeder trades  has issued its more modestly presented  but perhaps more correctly titled  2021 “ESG report” (28 pages- its third annual report; such reporting is required for companies listed on the Norwegian bourse).In both companies’ reports  matters covered include governance  and  closer to home for gCaptain readers  the human side of the business. MPC notes the importance of the “Neptune Declaration” – a seafarer repatriation initiative borne out of Covid-related difficulties. Crowley  well known for its efforts in providing a lifeline to Puerto Rico during the pandemic  talks about its “safety culture” which was integral to its overall functioning and responsiveness during 2020 and 2021.In my view (which  admittedly  could be considered short-sighted)  “sustainability” is about emissions  the “E” in “ESG”. With my eyes looking for quantitative disclosures of emissions  I found one page in the Crowley publication (p.39) with numerical data- comparable to that provided by MPC (spread out in microbursts on pages 12  13 and 14  with more detail on page 21). For both companies  2021 saw more emissions than 2020  as Covid-recovery trade surged.Importantly though  Crowley takes a crack at measuring the all-important Scope 3 emissions  which include “all of the emissions a company is responsible for outside of its own walls—from the goods it purchases to the disposal of the products it sells ” a definition taken from World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The SEC rules  mentioned earlier  would require listed entities to estimate Scope 3 emissions  if they are enacted in a form similar to the agency’s end-March  2022 proposal.There are no precise templates for ESG reveals  but MPC’s disclosure illustrates the wide array of methodologies driving the report contents. In discussing its 2021 report  the Norway-based containership owner notes that: “Our second ESG report  published in March 2021 and covering calendar year 2020  includes disclosures which meet the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association’s reporting requirements and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (“SASB”) Marine Transportation Standard. Material topics included in the report are selected based on stakeholder feedback and an analysis of the significance of the impacts for each topic. Our approach to determining material topics is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards’ materiality principle…As an Oslo Stock Exchange-listed company  we follow the Euronext guidance on ESG reporting of January 2020. The Euronext reporting process is based on the GRI Standards.”Crowley follows the GRI  and devotes seven pages (pp. 66-72) of its publication to simply matching up GRI requirements with the content in its report. MPC links the contents of its report to the SASB (pp. 21-22) and also to the GRI (pp. 24-25).The past two years have seen shipping move into the spotlight  with the “supply chain crisis” generally and  more recently  shifting cargo flows resulting from the war in Ukraine. In coming years  social media will grow exponentially in importance; conventional channels of press releases and regulatory “disclosures” will continue to become components of larger communications strategies. Individual companies will need to craft their own business-specific messaging  separate from those of larger “coalitions” that have sprung up in the past few years (and mentioned by both Crowley and MPC). The two reports here show that this process is well underway.While I would prefer to leave the McKinsey-like styling out of such efforts  the folks at Crowley clearly “get it” in a big way. Their attention-grabbing style of outreach (presumably to charterers  and also  my guess  to a broader audience and pool of future talent  with a far broader definition of “sustainability” than mine) portends a direction that may be emulated by other shipping enterprises.RESOURCES:,neutral,0.09,0.88,0.03,mixed,0.09,0.13,0.77,True,English,"['Sustainability Reporting', 'Shipping', 'ESG', 'Work', 'Progress', 'Oslo Stock Exchange-listed company', 'potential new disclosure mandates', 'Sustainability Accounting Standards Board', 'GRI”) Standards’ materiality principle', 'U.S. listed markets', 'splashy 73 McKinsey-esque page report', 'broader overall ESG positioning', 'The Euronext reporting process', 'The SEC rules', 'U.S. icon', 'seafarer repatriation initiative', 'Marine Transportation Standard', 'supply chain crisis', 'Norway-based containership owner', 'larger communications strategies', 'Global Reporting Initiative', 'World Business Council', 'other shipping enterprises', 'third annual report', 'World Resources Institute', 'Norwegian Shipowners’ Association', 'requisite business disclosures', 'MPC Container Ships', 'important Scope 3 emissions', 'second ESG report', 'shipping company disclosures', 'past two years', 'GRI Standards', 'overall functioning', 'listed entities', 'Euronext guidance', 'broader audience', 'Oslo-listed owner', 'larger “coalitions', 'reporting requirements', 'ESG reporting', 'one page', 'shipping businesses', 'broader definition', 'recent years', 'financial filings', 'Exchange Commission', 'ESG disclosures', 'contrast” exercise', 'maritime industry', 'Sustainability Report', 'feeder trades', '2021 “ESG report', 'gCaptain readers', 'human side', 'Neptune Declaration', 'Covid-related difficulties', 'Puerto Rico', 'safety culture', 'quantitative disclosures', 'numerical data', 'Covid-recovery trade', 'Sustainable Development', 'end-March, 2022 proposal', 'precise templates', 'wide array', 'calendar year', 'Material topics', 'stakeholder feedback', 'GRI requirements', 'cargo flows', 'coming years', 'conventional channels', 'press releases', 'regulatory “disclosures', 'business-specific messaging', 'two reports', 'big way', 'attention-grabbing style', 'future talent', 'two companies', 'private companies', 'report contents', 'social media', 'Individual companies', 'seven pages', 'companies’ reports', 'Crowley publication', '2021 report', '28 pages', 'Environment', 'Governance', 'shares', 'regulators', 'Securities', 'efforts', 'state', 'art', 'compare', 'vessels', 'regional', 'bourse', 'matters', 'home', 'importance', 'lifeline', 'pandemic', 'responsiveness', 'view', 'eyes', 'microbursts', 'detail', 'crack', 'walls', 'goods', 'disposal', 'products', 'WRI', 'WBCSD', 'form', 'agency', 'methodologies', 'SASB', 'analysis', 'significance', 'impacts', 'approach', 'January', 'spotlight', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'components', 'folks', 'outreach', 'guess', 'pool', 'direction', '2020']",2022-07-07,2022-07-07,gcaptain.com

7526,EuroNext,Bing API,https://pressgazette.co.uk/media-spacs-publishers-capital/,With the SPACs craze kaput  where now for media looking to raise capital?,SPACs are out  leaving a trail of capital-hungry media in their wake. Press Gazette asked some market experts what publishers can do now to raise cash.,Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) have fallen out of fashion in media this year  meaning publishers are seeking new ways to raise capital.Press Gazette has taken a closer look at SPACs and the wider market for raising investment in media.What is a SPAC?Often referred to as blank-cheque companies  SPACs are publicly-traded entities that don’t do any real business. Instead  they exist for the purpose of merging with or acquiring a private company – with the effect of bringing the latter onto the public market.They came to wider attention in late 2020 when a string of companies – often younger tech businesses – used them as vehicles to go public. Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic  sports betting company Draft Kings and content promotion service Taboola were among those companies to go public by merging with a SPAC.SPACs are not a new invention  and they are not gone either: on Tuesday French music streaming company Deezer went public on Europe’s Euronext stock exchange by merging with a SPAC named I2PO. (Although most prominent SPACs have been in the US  they can be used elsewhere.)But Deezer’s early fortunes hint at the way the SPAC trend has gone: its share price sank 35% on debut.Neil Begley  an analyst and senior vice president at Moody’s  told Press Gazette SPACs became so popular because they helped companies come to market faster and with fewer of the preconditions a company might encounter going public through a traditional initial public offering (IPO).“The reason why I believe they became so powerful and so popular from the standpoint of the companies  the issuers  is because it was fairly easy  you know – they became popular very quickly and and they also effectively became almost like a blank cheque for many of these companies  or a way for them to take their companies public.“Whenever you hear the term blank cheque  I mean – that’s obviously something that is going to draw a lot of interest for people seeking capital.“And from an investor standpoint  you have to essentially trust that people are organised and transparent about what their goals are. But there’s also a lot of suspicion.“And as soon as some of these SPACs don’t generate the returns of expectations  they are going to cool very quickly to this product. And I think  effectively  that’s what’s happened over the last year.”SPACs and the mediaTaboola was one of the first media companies to get in on the SPAC trend  announcing its plans to go public through blank-cheque company ION Acquisition in January 2021. That merger was completed in June the same year.In May 2021 it was reported Vice Media was targeting a $3 billion valuation through a merger with the SPAC 7GC & Co Holdings – but it dropped the plans in September  instead raising $85 million from existing investors.Forbes followed a similar trajectory  announcing its SPAC intentions in August 2021 before cancelling them last month  citing a “deteriorating SPAC market”.But the most prominent media SPACs story is that of Buzzfeed – both because the company successfully went through with the merger and because of the flotation’s complicated aftermath.Buzzfeed merged with the blank-cheque company 890 5th Avenue Partners in December 2021  raising only $16 million (£13 million) of the hoped-for $250 million (£200 million).Investors and executives had been barred from selling their shares for the six months following the flotation – and once that period elapsed  sell they did  causing the share price to drop a further 41%.It subsequently emerged that some of Buzzfeed’s ex-employees had been able to trade their shares in the newly-public company while others couldn’t  heaping further fuel on a lawsuit by former staff charging the business had botched its flotation.But it wasn’t just media SPACs having a difficult time. CNBC reported at the end of June that its index tracking the fortunes of SPACs after their mergers was down nearly 50% that year – more than double the decline in the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same period.Why did the SPACs craze go sour?Simon Olsen  a partner in Deloitte’s equity capital markets group and a specialist in IPOs and SPACs  told Press Gazette that SPACs weren’t the only things on the market seeing diminished interest.“The appetite for anything new from investors – IPOs  back transactions  etc. – has definitely diminished from the highs of 2021.“It was slowing down at the end of 2021  which was partly due to a bit of IPO fatigue  but also due to the early signs of some of the macro factors we’re now seeing played out in full.”He cited among those factors inflation  interest rates  supply chain problems and the war in Ukraine.Investors  he said  “want to spend their time focusing on their existing investments  what it all means for them and what they should do with those existing investments. So the appetite for new has disappeared.”Olsen said he didn’t think we would see the return of the levels of interest in SPACs that persisted from late 2020 to 2021.“And actually  I don’t think we’ll see that again  full stop.“What I think we will see with SPACs is them becoming much more professional about it.”Olsen said he believed that the days “of people in the City who maybe have a couple of million dollars that they want to throw at a SPAC to make some money – or worse  pop stars and sports stars doing SPACs – I think those days are gone.”With SPACs out  how are media raising money now?So Jay-Z isn’t likely to be investing in media SPACs anytime soon. What ways are publishers seeking to raise capital instead?Andrew Evans  a partner in Deloitte’s financial advisory business  emphasised to Press Gazette that “subscription models  generally  in recessions  do badly.”Some subscription services have already begun to report this  but Evans said: “One of the things that’s interesting with subscriptions is  obviously  you renew on an annual basis.“And as the economic challenges  the headwinds we’re seeing  means that probably everyone’s got ‘til the end of December  if you’re on a calendar subscription period – and so you might see it start to come through a bit later.”Combined with advertisers “really starting to question how they get value” and inflation hiking costs  Evans said he wouldn’t be surprised “if you had some quite substantial cost cutting  even just to stand still” among media businesses.But there were still traits investors might be looking for that news media could offer.Evans said: “What does the market want to see from these types of businesses? Maybe it isn’t growth at all cost  and maybe it’s about profitable growth  and maybe it’s [something] like cash generation.”Olsen said that if one looks “at what has been successful in SPAC deals  I think there’s much less speculation. That is not inconsistent with wider IPOs – people have had a flight to quality  so they want to see businesses that are growing profitably.“They want to see businesses that have cash generation  they want to seek businesses that have a proven track record  have a proven model and a proven product that is being sold to customers  etcetera.”Moody’s SVP Begley identified three areas that were still open to media businesses looking to raise cash: “Strategic investors  if there are any; private equity investors  which are much more open to not being strategic  but they tend to look for industries that have cash flow but low valuations and they tend to want to lever them up to use their returns  so that is usually negative for credit.“And then asset sales… like real estate and other things [that] are not as productive as they once were. There’s a lot of capital assets that they can monetise and put that capital to work so it does generate more profits for the company or possibly  de-leverage the company  and in doing so de-risk the company from a financial standpoint.”Paramount Global (then named ViacomCBS) sold its CBS Studio Center lot for $1.85 billion in November last year. Further from the news media industry  book publisher Houghton Mifflin sold its trade book publishing division to HarperCollins in March 2021.Begley said in many cases such assets may “have been around the company a long time and they’re physical assets that no longer are necessary in the digital world as much. And so they’re disposing of them.”Looking aheadCNBC reported last month that US media executives seemed reasonably confident about weathering a possible recession. It cited Buzzfeed chief executive Jonah Peretti  for example  who said the company had built “an agile  diversified business model”.Justin B Smith  the former Bloomberg Media executive now launching a new outlet to be named Semafor  told CNBC: “The media industry is in better shape than it was a decade ago. Strategies are more sensible. Digital adoption is more ubiquitous. Models are clearer. Revenue streams are more diverse.”Asked what he thought of that  Deloitte’s Evans told Press Gazette: “I think most businesses have right-sized their cost base [during] COVID  as you would expect. However  a lot of those were sort of pumped up by cheap money  or indeed free money from local government  in whatever jurisdiction they’re in.“Businesses are definitely a lot leaner. And there has been a huge increase in demand… But it really depends on the strength of your balance sheet. And that’s on a case by case basis. And every company is different.”More specifically  Olsen said: “I think we will see corporate transactions  M&A disposals  buying new technology  selling old technology  carving out nonprofits. I think  oddly  that will continue  notwithstanding the fact we’re probably heading into domestic recession.”Evans said he foresaw consolidation – but emphasised that  “if you’re talking about news publishers  there’s clearly restrictions generally on a geographical basis from regulators about who can own and operate that.”He was  more broadly  less confident than the media executives CNBC spoke with.“I imagine there will be winners and losers as there are through volatile times. I don’t know if… all media companies are feeling positive.“I think some will be  and I think some won’t. And I think you know  back to Simon’s point  markets are really interested in profitable growth and cash generation  perhaps more so than they were 12-18 months ago.”Picture: Spencer Platt/Getty Images,negative,0.01,0.04,0.95,mixed,0.06,0.15,0.79,True,English,"['SPACs craze kaput', 'media', 'capital', 'Virgin Galactic, sports betting company', 'traditional initial public offering', 'French music streaming company', 'equity capital markets group', 'benchmark S&P 500 index', 'blank-cheque company ION Acquisition', 'Special Purpose Acquisition Companies', 'prominent media SPACs story', 'younger tech businesses', 'content promotion service', 'Euronext stock exchange', '890 5th Avenue Partners', 'supply chain problems', 'senior vice president', 'term blank cheque', 'first media companies', 'Press Gazette SPACs', 'public company', 'full s', 'private company', 'prominent SPACs', 'Vice Media', 'blank-cheque companies', 'public market', 'new ways', 'closer look', 'wider attention', 'Richard Branson', 'Draft Kings', 'new invention', 'share price', 'Neil Begley', '$3 billion valuation', 'Co Holdings', 'similar trajectory', 'complicated aftermath', 'six months', 'former staff', 'back transactions', 'early signs', 'existing investments', 'SPAC trend', 'SPAC 7GC', 'SPAC intentions', 'SPACs craze', 'wider market', 'real business', 'early fortunes', 'investor standpoint', 'last year', 'difficult time', 'same period', 'Simon Olsen', 'IPO fatigue', 'macro factors', 'existing investors', 'interest rates', 'fashion', 'publishers', 'entities', 'effect', 'late', 'string', 'vehicles', 'Taboola', 'Tuesday', 'Deezer', 'Europe', 'debut', 'analyst', 'Moody', 'fewer', 'preconditions', 'reason', 'issuers', 'something', 'lot', 'people', 'goals', 'suspicion', 'returns', 'expectations', 'product', 'plans', 'January', 'merger', 'June', 'May', 'September', 'Forbes', 'August', 'Buzzfeed', 'December', 'executives', 'shares', 'employees', 'others', 'fuel', 'lawsuit', 'CNBC', 'decline', 'Deloitte', 'specialist', 'IPOs', 'things', 'appetite', 'highs', 'bit', 'inflation', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'levels']",2022-07-07,2022-07-07,pressgazette.co.uk
