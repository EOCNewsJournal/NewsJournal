7502,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-moscow-exchange-is-a-good-base-for-crypto-trading-russian-lawmaker-says,The Moscow Exchange is a good base for crypto trading  Russian lawmaker says,MOEX is likely to do a great job in launching a crypto trading division due to its full compliance with the rules of the Bank of Russia  the official said.,Russia continues sending mixed messages about the legal status of cryptocurrency  with a parliament official urging the launch of crypto trading on the country’s largest stock exchange.The Moscow Exchange (MOEX) is the best match for hosting a regulated crypto exchange in Russia  according to Anatoly Aksakov  head of the Russian Banking Association and a financial committee within the State Duma.At a recent press conference  Aksakov stressed the importance of building a crypto exchange under the strict requirements of the Russian central bank  local news agency Prime reported on Thursday.The lawmaker pointed out that MOEX is likely to do a great job in launching a crypto trading division due to its full compliance with the rules of the Bank of Russia.“That division — which will work as part of a respected organization with great traditions and highly engaged in actively interacting with the central bank — will do an excellent job with the task of handling cryptocurrency operations ” Aksakov noted.Aksakov’s remarks came shortly after MOEX said last week that it planned a legal challenge against European Union sanctions on the National Settlement Depository and would seek to protect the interests of Russian investors. The stock exchange was targeted as part of international sanctions against Russia in 2022 and had to suspend all operations for one month.Global stock exchanges are popular destinations for digital asset-related products. Canada’s Toronto Stock Exchange is known for listing the world’s first Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund in 2021. Some European stock market operators like Deutsche Boerse have launched dedicated digital asset divisions listing a number of crypto investment products.The latest report adds some confusion to Russia’s overall stance on crypto though as the Bank of Russia has been strongly opposed to opening a local regulated crypto trading platform.“Cryptocurrencies should not be traded on organized marketplaces because these assets are too volatile  too risky for potential investors ” Bank of Russia governor Elvira Nabiullina said last month. A deputy governor at the bank also declared last year that Russia will only allow crypto trading via foreign trading platforms like Binance.Related: Russia seems to be preparing to mine Bitcoin with flare gasAs previously reported  Russians have been actively investing in crypto in recent years despite the local government not legalizing a single local crypto trading exchange.

Launched in 2021 by Axylia  a consulting firm specialized in responsible finance  the index comprises the largest French companies listed on the Paris Stock Exchange committed to reducing carbon emissions  including those able to “afford” the cost of their carbon footprint.The Axylia Carbon Score rates a company’s ability to cover its carbon footprint cost on a scale from A to F. The cost includes all of the company’s CO 2 emissions (Scopes 1  2 and 3)  which are converted into euros thanks to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) CO 2 cost estimates. Teleperformance has obtained a Carbon Score of ‘A’  the best possible rating.French companies able to pay the cost of their carbon footprint are ranked from highest to lowest by market capitalization adjusted for their carbon valuation. The top 35 companies are then included in the Vérité40 index  and the five remaining companies in the index are selected on the basis of their commitments to reducing carbon emissions.This distinction reflects Teleperformance’s strong commitment to fighting climate change  already recognized in 2021 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)  which approved the Group’s new targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.

Participation in this Series A also includes some of Phytolon's current shareholders: The Trendlines Group (the largest shareholder in the company)  Arkin Holdings  Millennium Foodtech  Agriline (administered by Consensus Business Group)  Stern Tech  and OpenValley/Yossi Ackerman.Phytolon TeamPhytolon's proprietary technology is based on licensed technology from the Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel) and addresses the need for healthy  efficient  and sustainable natural food-coloring alternatives to azo/synthetic dyes used in food and beverages.Current natural food colors are agriculture-dependent and mostly derived from fruit and vegetables. Phytolon leverages a novel technology to produce betalain pigments by fermentation of baker's yeast. Phytolon offers a wide range of natural colors from yellow to purple  at competitive coloring performance and cost-in-use  for multiple food categories like alternative meat  dairy  frozen products  baked goods  confectionery  and snacks.Phytolon's technology has already reached a semi-industrial production scale and the company has prepared the ground for regulatory clearances in the USA and Europe.Dr. Halim Jubran  Co-founder and CEO of Phytolon  said: ""The investments of DSM Venturing  Cibus Fund  and Ginkgo Bioworks open the door for broad penetration of our products in the global food industry. We are excited to have new investors who share our vision to create healthy  efficient  and sustainable food systems via biotechnology.""Phytolon's Board of Directors is chaired by Steve Dubin  who played a pivotal role in directing Phytolon through this financing round. Mr. Dubin has worked with several biotechnology/nutrition companies including as CEO of Martek Biosciences (acquired by DSM in 2011)  as Chairman of Enzymotec  and as Senior Advisor to DSM (until 2012). Commenting on the transaction  Mr. Dubin added: ""I believe this investment round and DSM's participation in Phytolon will accelerate the commercialization of Phytolon's proprietary palette of sustainable food colors that will provide important benefits to both food producers and consumers.""Story continuesAbout Phytolon:Phytolon is an Israel-based biotechnology startup company that is taking food coloring to the next level by leveraging a novel technology to produce natural pigments via precision fermentation of yeast.

Over 30 sites located in France  United Kingdom  Belgium  Netherlands and United States have already been qualified to participate in this clinical trial. Topline results are expected to be published in the second half of 2023.Prof. Michelle Lai  M.D.  Ph.D.  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and co-principal investigator of the LEGEND Phase IIa clinical trial  said: “The LEGEND trial is expected to help us better understand the pathophysiology of patients we care for in our clinics who suffer of NASH and T2D. Insulin resistance is a root cause leading to the development of NASH  and the combination of lanifibranor and empagliflozin could potentially provide complementary effects and provide additional therapeutic benefits to improve the overall cardiometabolic health of our patients.”Dr. Michael Cooreman  Chief Medical Officer of Inventiva  commented: “We are delighted to see the initiation of this Proof-of-Concept study  which we believe will further draw attention to NASH as a multisystemic liver disease with a highly relevant cardiometabolic aspect. This clinical trial is anticipated to not only add to the body of evidence demonstrating the therapeutic benefits of lanifibranor on the broad spectrum of the disease biology of NASH  but should also provide insights on how the complementary mechanisms of action of a pan-PPAR agonist and an SGLT2 inihibitor could enhance the therapeutic benefits of lanifibranor.”Story continuesThe Phase IIa trial  LEGEND  has been designed as a multi-center randomized  placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of lanifibranor in combination with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of adult patients with non-cirrhotic NASH and T2D. The trial is double-blind for the placebo and lanifibranor arms and open-label for the combination of lanifibranor and empagliflozin arm.LEGEND is expected to recruit a total of 63 patients with non-cirrhotic NASH and T2D. In the trial  the diagnosis of non-cirrhotic NASH will be based on a historic histology evaluation or a combination of non-invasive methods including imaging and serum-based metabolic diagnostic tests.The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is a change in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at the end of the 24-week treatment compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints include changes in liver enzymes  glycaemic and lipids parameters  inflammatory markers and body fat composition. The trial is designed to provide valuable information on body weight evolution and body fat composition in patients with NASH and T2D when treated with lanifibranor and empagliflozin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based imaging will allow the collection of non-invasive data on hepatic fat  inflammation and fibrosis.About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms  which are well‑characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well‑balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan‑PPAR agonist in clinical development. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan‑PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre‑clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of NASH and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.The Company has established a strategic collaboration with AbbVie in the area of autoimmune diseases that resulted in the discovery of the drug candidate cedirogant (ABBV-157)  an oral RORγ inverse agonist which is being evaluated in a Phase IIb clinical trial  led by AbbVie  in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 80 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA - ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.com .ContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupLaurence Frost /Tristan Roquet Montegon /Aude LepreuxMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

Stellantis announced that the Fiat Doblò will become the fourth model built on the production line at Mangualde  joining the light commercial vehicle (LCV) line-up of Peugeot Partner  Citroën Berlingo and Opel Combo.“We intend to lead the commercial vehicle market and now with the addition of the Fiat Doblò to Mangualde’s portfolio  we will achieve greater efficiency  improve our competitiveness and offer the very best to our professional customers ” said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares. “Today we also celebrate our many team members for their commitment to sustainable production with the installation of the solar energy park that will power one-third of the plant’s energy needs once complete. I also want to warmly thank the President for joining me as we honor the automotive industry here in Portugal.”“It was important to me to be here today  together with all of you  to celebrate the 60 years of this plant in Mangualde. This factory has had a unique history  overcoming all kinds of crises and managed to resist  and now reaching the present day with an unparalleled reputation  which places it at the top in terms of quality and efficiency overall. As part of Stellantis  Mangualde represents one of the leaders in the transport and mobility sector  one of the most global in the world ” said His Excellency  the President of the Portuguese Republic  Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. “Today  I came here to hear good news  as Stellantis is adding another brand and another model to this factory's portfolio. And  additionally  the launch of a project that will help Portugal continue leading the climate and energy transition. Congratulations to all!”Story continuesIn a symbolic gesture  the President of the Republic took advantage of his presence in Mangualde to award the official acronym of the Order of Merit to António Loureiro Marques  the factory's oldest employee. In this gesture  the President of the Republic extended the distinction to all those who over the last 60 years have contributed to the success of the Mangualde factory.Opened in 1962  the Stellantis Production Center in Mangualde has produced 1.5 million vehicles to date. It is a pillar of Portuguese industrial activity and now almost one in every four vehicles produced in Portugal comes from the Mangualde production line.The plant currently builds the Citroën Berlingo Van/Berlingo  Peugeot Partner/Rifter and Opel Combo Cargo/Combo Life models - co-elected ‘International Van of the Year 2019’. The Berlingo  Partner and Combo models with the Mangualde ‘label’ are the most sought after by professional customers and companies  and form the top three LCV sales in Portugal  with a total share of 32%. In 2021  a total of 67 841 vehicles left the Stellantis plant  equivalent to almost a quarter (23.5%) of the total volume of vehicles produced in Portugal.Mangualde Adds Fourth Model: New Fiat Doblò joins Partner-Berlingo-Combo trioPlanned for October  the Fiat Doblò will become the fourth model built at Mangualde joining the list of 22 models produced at the plant over its 60 years of operation  including the three models that are currently manufactured there.The introduction of the Doblò reinforces Stellantis’ commitment to the Portuguese industry  while also creating even greater efficiency and competitiveness. The move is designed to support the needs of an increasingly diversified and demanding automotive market constantly impacted by external factors.Photovoltaic Solar Energy Park to Power 31% of Energy NeedStellantis also announced the implementation of a solar photovoltaic energy capture project for self-consumption. Once fully implemented  it will cover 31% of the Mangualde plant’s annual electricity needs  allowing the annual avoidance of 2 500 tons of CO 2 emissions  corresponding to the capturing of this same volume of CO 2 from approximately 16 000 trees. This effort supports Stellantis’ Dare Forward 2030 commitment to becoming carbon net zero by 2038  with a 50% reduction by 2030  and contributing to a sustainable future.As a result of more than €3.2 million in investments in partnership with Prosolia Energy  the project will integrate 6 363 photovoltaic panels occupying an area equivalent to six football fields. It will have an installed capacity of 3 436 MWp  equivalent to the annual consumption of 320 households  allowing  in a clean and sustainable way  to increase the competitiveness of the complex in a context that has been increasingly marked by consistent peaks in energy costs. The completion of the project’s phase 1 is scheduled for the third quarter of 2022  and phase 2 is planned to start in early 2023.As part of this investment  a sustainable energy consumption zone is also being established in collaboration with the Municipality of Mangualde and with neighboring companies  who will also benefit from the solar power.Growing  Transforming and Modernizing the Mangualde Production CenterThe Mangualde Production Center is home to four laboratories focused on studying and adopting new technologies or processes that enable more sustainable  more digital  and more connected production. Founded by Stellantis in 2022  the collaborative ecosystem of partners spanning startups  universities  suppliers  tech centers and the Portuguese government is dedicated to R&D activity related to the IoT (Internet of Things)  5G (and soon after 6G)  process engineering and additive production. It also prioritizes training of future professionals.The partners include the Instituto Politécnico de Viseu (Polytechnic Institute of Viseu)  the University of Porto  the University of Coimbra  as well as suppliers Simoldes and HFA and the Centro Tecnológíco de Automoción de Galicia (CTAG; Galicia Automotive Technology Center).# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

For companies with shares listed in the U.S.  these disclosures are moving beyond the requisite business disclosures and financial filings required by regulators.Indeed  companies in U.S. listed markets are now studying potential new disclosure mandates from the Securities and Exchange Commission. For non-listed private companies  ESG disclosures are completely voluntary. As more shipping businesses seek to report on their efforts  I wanted to look at the “state of the art”  starting with a “compare and contrast” exercise between reports from two companies I am familiar with. Crowley  a privately-held U.S. icon in the maritime industry  released its “Sustainability Report ” a splashy 73 McKinsey-esque page report on a much broader overall ESG positioning  two weeks ago.Earlier this year  MPC Container Ships  an Oslo-listed owner of vessels serving regional and feeder trades  has issued its more modestly presented  but perhaps more correctly titled  2021 “ESG report” (28 pages- its third annual report; such reporting is required for companies listed on the Norwegian bourse).In both companies’ reports  matters covered include governance  and  closer to home for gCaptain readers  the human side of the business. MPC notes the importance of the “Neptune Declaration” – a seafarer repatriation initiative borne out of Covid-related difficulties. Crowley  well known for its efforts in providing a lifeline to Puerto Rico during the pandemic  talks about its “safety culture” which was integral to its overall functioning and responsiveness during 2020 and 2021.In my view (which  admittedly  could be considered short-sighted)  “sustainability” is about emissions  the “E” in “ESG”. With my eyes looking for quantitative disclosures of emissions  I found one page in the Crowley publication (p.39) with numerical data- comparable to that provided by MPC (spread out in microbursts on pages 12  13 and 14  with more detail on page 21). For both companies  2021 saw more emissions than 2020  as Covid-recovery trade surged.Importantly though  Crowley takes a crack at measuring the all-important Scope 3 emissions  which include “all of the emissions a company is responsible for outside of its own walls—from the goods it purchases to the disposal of the products it sells ” a definition taken from World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The SEC rules  mentioned earlier  would require listed entities to estimate Scope 3 emissions  if they are enacted in a form similar to the agency’s end-March  2022 proposal.There are no precise templates for ESG reveals  but MPC’s disclosure illustrates the wide array of methodologies driving the report contents. In discussing its 2021 report  the Norway-based containership owner notes that: “Our second ESG report  published in March 2021 and covering calendar year 2020  includes disclosures which meet the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association’s reporting requirements and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (“SASB”) Marine Transportation Standard. Material topics included in the report are selected based on stakeholder feedback and an analysis of the significance of the impacts for each topic. Our approach to determining material topics is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards’ materiality principle…As an Oslo Stock Exchange-listed company  we follow the Euronext guidance on ESG reporting of January 2020. The Euronext reporting process is based on the GRI Standards.”Crowley follows the GRI  and devotes seven pages (pp. 66-72) of its publication to simply matching up GRI requirements with the content in its report. MPC links the contents of its report to the SASB (pp. 21-22) and also to the GRI (pp. 24-25).The past two years have seen shipping move into the spotlight  with the “supply chain crisis” generally and  more recently  shifting cargo flows resulting from the war in Ukraine. In coming years  social media will grow exponentially in importance; conventional channels of press releases and regulatory “disclosures” will continue to become components of larger communications strategies. Individual companies will need to craft their own business-specific messaging  separate from those of larger “coalitions” that have sprung up in the past few years (and mentioned by both Crowley and MPC). The two reports here show that this process is well underway.While I would prefer to leave the McKinsey-like styling out of such efforts  the folks at Crowley clearly “get it” in a big way. Their attention-grabbing style of outreach (presumably to charterers  and also  my guess  to a broader audience and pool of future talent  with a far broader definition of “sustainability” than mine) portends a direction that may be emulated by other shipping enterprises.RESOURCES:,neutral,0.09,0.88,0.03,mixed,0.09,0.13,0.77,True,English,"['Sustainability Reporting', 'Shipping', 'ESG', 'Work', 'Progress', 'Oslo Stock Exchange-listed company', 'potential new disclosure mandates', 'Sustainability Accounting Standards Board', 'GRI”) Standards’ materiality principle', 'U.S. listed markets', 'splashy 73 McKinsey-esque page report', 'broader overall ESG positioning', 'The Euronext reporting process', 'The SEC rules', 'U.S. icon', 'seafarer repatriation initiative', 'Marine Transportation Standard', 'supply chain crisis', 'Norway-based containership owner', 'larger communications strategies', 'Global Reporting Initiative', 'World Business Council', 'other shipping enterprises', 'third annual report', 'World Resources Institute', 'Norwegian Shipowners’ Association', 'requisite business disclosures', 'MPC Container Ships', 'important Scope 3 emissions', 'second ESG report', 'shipping company disclosures', 'past two years', 'GRI Standards', 'overall functioning', 'listed entities', 'Euronext guidance', 'broader audience', 'Oslo-listed owner', 'larger “coalitions', 'reporting requirements', 'ESG reporting', 'one page', 'shipping businesses', 'broader definition', 'recent years', 'financial filings', 'Exchange Commission', 'ESG disclosures', 'contrast” exercise', 'maritime industry', 'Sustainability Report', 'feeder trades', '2021 “ESG report', 'gCaptain readers', 'human side', 'Neptune Declaration', 'Covid-related difficulties', 'Puerto Rico', 'safety culture', 'quantitative disclosures', 'numerical data', 'Covid-recovery trade', 'Sustainable Development', 'end-March, 2022 proposal', 'precise templates', 'wide array', 'calendar year', 'Material topics', 'stakeholder feedback', 'GRI requirements', 'cargo flows', 'coming years', 'conventional channels', 'press releases', 'regulatory “disclosures', 'business-specific messaging', 'two reports', 'big way', 'attention-grabbing style', 'future talent', 'two companies', 'private companies', 'report contents', 'social media', 'Individual companies', 'seven pages', 'companies’ reports', 'Crowley publication', '2021 report', '28 pages', 'Environment', 'Governance', 'shares', 'regulators', 'Securities', 'efforts', 'state', 'art', 'compare', 'vessels', 'regional', 'bourse', 'matters', 'home', 'importance', 'lifeline', 'pandemic', 'responsiveness', 'view', 'eyes', 'microbursts', 'detail', 'crack', 'walls', 'goods', 'disposal', 'products', 'WRI', 'WBCSD', 'form', 'agency', 'methodologies', 'SASB', 'analysis', 'significance', 'impacts', 'approach', 'January', 'spotlight', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'components', 'folks', 'outreach', 'guess', 'pool', 'direction', '2020']",2022-07-07,2022-07-08,gcaptain.com

MBW’s round-up is supported by Centtrip ,Welcome to Music Business Worldwide’s weekly round-up – where we make sure you caught the five biggest stories to hit our headlines over the past seven days. MBW’s round-up is supported by Centtrip  which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximise their income and reduce their touring costs.Songwriters scored a major victory in the US seven days ago.Back in January 2018  the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) ruled that US songwriter/publisher royalty rates for on-demand streaming (and other uses) were to rise from 10.5% to 15.1% between 2018 and 2022.You might remember  however  that Spotify  Amazon  and Google/Alphabet subsequently launched a legal appeal against the new rates.But on July 1  the CRB maintained its decision to increase the headline rate paid to songwriters in the US to 15.1%.Also this week  France-born Spotify rival Deezer made its stock market debut on the Euronext Paris  after combining its business with I2PO  a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) based in France.Deezer became 2022’s latest music streaming service to go public via a SPAC merger  following MENA-focused Anghami‘s IPO on the NASDAQ in New York.Meanwhile  the Financial Times reported this week that TikTok has scrapped the expansion of its TikTok Shop feature into Europe and the US.Launched in the UK in December 2021  TikTok Shop lets creators sell products directly on TikTok through in-feed videos and live streams. Last year  in an interview with MBW  TikTok’s Global Head of Music Ole Obermann discussed plans for e-commerce features for artists within its app.MBW reached out to TikTok to clarify whether the claims reported by the FT would have any impact on TikTok’s music-related e-commerce plans outlined by Obermann.Elsewhere  music veteran Irv Gotti sold a stake in his Murder Inc. master recordings to Iconoclast as part of a $300 million deal  while Universal Music Group struck a licensing deal with African music service Mdundo.Here’s what happened this week…The saga is over.On July 1  the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) maintained its decision to increase the headline rate paid to songwriters in the United States from on-demand streaming services between the years 2018 and 2022.To refresh your memory: In January 2018  songwriters enjoyed a major victory when the CRB ruled that songwriter/publisher royalty rates for streaming and other mechanical uses were to rise significantly in the US.That ruling centered on an increase in the overall percentage of streaming services’ US revenues that legally have to be paid by the likes of Spotify to songwriters.The CRB decided to move that percentage figure up from 10.5% to 15.1% across the five years between 2018 and 2022. It was the largest rate increase in the history of the CRB.However  Spotify and other companies  including Amazon and Google/Alphabet – but NOT Apple – subsequently launched a legal appeal against the new rates  arguing that they were unjustified.Now  the CRB has made its final decision – and the 15.1% rate is going nowhere…Spotify rival Deezer is officially a publicly-listed company.The music streaming service made its stock market debut in its home country of France on the Euronext Paris on Tuesday (July 5)  after combining its business with I2PO  a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) based in France.The company’s public listing comes seven years after the plug was pulled on its previous attempt at an IPO.Deezer becomes this year’s latest music streaming service to become a publicly listed company via a SPAC merger  following MENA-focused Anghami’s recent IPO on the NASDAQ in New York…Last year  in an interview with MBW  TikTok’s Global Head of Music Ole Obermann discussed plans for e-commerce features for artists within its app.He noted that TikTok “recently did a few tests in the US where we worked with big-name artists to enable them to sell physical products off of their TikTok accounts”.Obermann cited artists including Lizzo and Billie Eilish as being involved in those tests  telling MBW at the time that  “the numbers were massive” adding: “It blew us away”.An article published by the Financial Times this week left major questions hanging over the future of those e-commerce plans for artists on the platform…Veteran music executive and producer Irv Gotti (Irving Lorenzo)  the founder of rap label Murder Inc  has sold a stake in his master recordings to Olivier Chastan’s acquisition vehicle  Iconoclast.The music exec has announced that the deal is worth $300 million  and according to a media release  “sees him sell his 50% ownership stake of his masters  with additional funding for various film and television projects”….African music service Mdundo  which listed on the Danish stock exchange (the Nasdaq First North Growth Market) in September 2020  has struck a licensing deal with Universal Music Group (UMG).UMG says that its new deal covers key African territories.Mdundo reports to have 17 million active monthly users across Africa  which means the service has added 10 million since February 2021…MBW’s Weekly Round-Up is supported by Centtrip  which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximise their income and reduce their touring costs.Music Business Worldwide,neutral,0.1,0.78,0.12,mixed,0.08,0.2,0.72,True,English,"['songwriters’ streaming royalty rate win', 'Weekly Round-Up', 'Deezer', 'IPO', 'MBW', 'Nasdaq First North Growth Market', 'rap label Murder Inc', '17 million active monthly users', 'Murder Inc. master recordings', 'Special Purpose Acquisition Company', 'latest music streaming service', 'streaming services’ US revenues', 'France-born Spotify rival Deezer', 'US songwriter/publisher royalty rates', 'stock market debut', 'Copyright Royalty Board', 'past seven days', 'demand streaming services', 'Danish stock exchange', 'key African territories', 'Universal Music Group', 'African music service', 'five biggest stories', 'Veteran music executive', 'other mechanical uses', 'Music Business Worldwide', 'Music Ole Obermann', 'music-related e-commerce plans', 'largest rate increase', 'TikTok Shop feature', 'music veteran', 'acquisition vehicle', 'other uses', '$300 million deal', 'new rates', 'other companies', 'e-commerce features', 'touring costs', 'major victory', 'legal appeal', 'headline rate', 'Euronext Paris', 'MENA-focused Anghami', 'New York', 'Financial Times', 'feed videos', 'live streams', 'Global Head', 'Irv Gotti', 'United States', 'overall percentage', 'percentage figure', 'five years', 'home country', 'public listing', 'previous attempt', 'Billie Eilish', 'major questions', 'Irving Lorenzo', 'Olivier Chastan', 'media release', 'additional funding', 'various film', 'television projects', 'licensing deal', 'new deal', 'weekly round-up', 'SPAC merger', 'physical products', 'TikTok accounts', 'selling artists', 'final decision', 'recent IPO', 'big-name artists', '50% ownership stake', 'The CRB', '15.1% rate', 'headlines', 'MBW', 'Centtrip', 'income', 'Songwriters', 'January', 'Amazon', 'Google/Alphabet', 'July', 'I2PO', 'expansion', 'Europe', 'UK', 'December', 'creators', 'interview', 'claims', 'FT', 'impact', 'Iconoclast', 'part', 'Mdundo', 'saga', 'memory', 'ruling', 'likes', 'history', 'Apple', 'Tuesday', 'plug', 'tests', 'Lizzo', 'numbers', 'article', 'future', 'platform', 'producer', 'founder', 'masters', 'September', 'UMG', 'February']",2022-07-08,2022-07-08,musicbusinessworldwide.com

In comparison  he said the average trade size on many electronic exchange order books is €0.01m and Turquoise Plato consistently offers industry-leading low price reversion after the trade  which is a measure of execution quality.“Coincident with this trend  we routinely see single orders above €100m or €150m entered into Turquoise Plato that partially execute ” he added. “The insight for the community is that the automated service caters well for large orders.”He highlighted another feature of blocks clustering with other blocks  and follow-on block liquidity within seconds or minutes after the immediate print of a block trade matched via Turquoise Plato.In order to efficiently inform the buy side of this follow-on block liquidity while minimising information leakage  Turquoise Plato has designed an innovative notification integrated with partners OpenFin and FlexTrade. A block trade on Turquoise Plato in a stock that is relevant to an investor can immediately alert that investor’s execution management system. The investor can choose or have set rules that auto populate an order ticket via a broker of choice  or algo wheel directly to Turquoise in order to increase the probability of capturing that follow on block liquidity.“This is the first time three different actors across a trade have come together to deliver an integrated innovation for the benefit of the buy and sell side ” Barnes added.Connecting equities globallyBarnes argues that Europe has the best quality of execution mechanisms on a per stock basis  with lit order books  the closing auction and the rich intraday liquidity opportunities for active investors. However  the growth in European equities values traded trails those of America and Asia.As a result the exchange has spoken to over 100 brokers and sees rising demand for US stocks from Asian investors  including outside of normal US market hours. Last year  the exchange connected Asia to the US by enabling Turquoise members to trade fungible US securities on the existing Turquoise lit order book  with direct settlement into The Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.Robert Barnes  Turquoise“Senior leaders among Asian clients have told us this could be a game changer ” said Barnes. “Turquoise can meet demands in Asia for increasing early hours trading relative to the market open in the US and  for the first time  provide a single connection to trade US stocks as well as the UK  Swiss and European stock universe.”In addition  Asian brokers have a new way to offer a more diverse portfolio to their clients  enhance their business development and benefit from Turquoise’s differentiated execution channels and midpoint electronic blocks to help address the higher implicit trading costs in Asia  where bid offer spreads are wider than in the UK and Europe.“The initiative signposts our ambition to connect financial centres and enable equities to be more available worldwide ” added Barnes. “Not only will access to our stock universe become more efficient but we will also be able to scale our innovations designed in partnership with the community  such as midpoint electronic block trading and frequent batch auctions  around the world.”He believes there is a bigger probability that LSEG will be able to increase overall turnover of equity trading in Europe which will enable brokers to offer more value-added services through interconnection.“We want to continue to deliver the best results on a continuous basis ” said Barnes. “Imagine a world where ultimately you can trade equities 24 hours a day. To deliver that vision we need to enable customers to do more with what they have  further innovation in the market and to deliver ever better results.”Barnes sees the evolution of the market as more cooperation and collaboration for mutual benefit.“We understand well the value of the network effect  and that is why we feel that financial centres that connect can thrive ” he added. “After years of mandatory projects such as MiFID II and contingency planning for Brexit  the industry can now come together and work on the next generation of tools and a relentless focus on innovation and efficiency.”Retail demandInstitutions  particularly in Europe  have expressed interest in increasing interaction with a growing retail order flow according to Barnes. This year Turquoise Plato Lit Auctions will add a flag specifically for retail to enable buy-side institutions through their brokers to interact and compete with market makers.“This new Turquoise model is not a payment for order flow model  and we are not segregating retail orders away from institutional members in a separate book ” added Barnes. “The beauty of the model is the potential to get midpoint execution for these retail orders  a better execution for both buyer and seller.Barnes said Turquoise is delighted to be working with retail intermediaries to introduce its model to Europe and the UK with the aim of empowering retail intermediaries with the same powerful execution tools that it provides to wholesale institutions.Another area of innovation that Barnes highlighted is continuing to answer the call from sovereign wealth funds and other investors keen to support the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises through growth markets.“London Stock Exchange’s AIM is the largest European SME growth market and Turquoise admitted for trading the top AIM order book traded securities in 2017 ” he said. “More recently we have added Euronext Growth stocks.”He argued that AIM offers the full selection of interoperating clearing houses while Euronext Growth clears via LCH SA in Paris and clearing house interoperability  which has been championed by LSE for decades  has been successful in delivering significant savings to the industry.“Embracing the preferred clearing model can reduce settlement costs by up to 50% and we’ve seen significant growth Euronext Growth activity in the last year  although from a low base ” said Barnes. “Our Q2 2022 quarterly value traded of Euronext growth stocks compared with Q2 2021 has increased by 116%  that is more than a factor of two.”,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.59,0.08,0.33,True,English,"['Global Financial Centres', 'Turquoise Plato', 'Turquoise Plato anniversary LSE Market-Closing Ceremony', 'existing Turquoise lit order book', 'anonymous European equity block trading', 'many electronic exchange order books', 'industry-leading low price reversion', 'The Depository Trust Company', 'leading fully automated service', 'rich intraday liquidity opportunities', 'CEO Turquoise Global Holdings', 'The London Stock Exchange', 'higher implicit trading costs', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'Turquoise Plato Block Discovery', 'normal US market hours', 'lit order books', 'market close ceremony', 'automated service caters', 'European stock universe', 'equity market structure', 'early hours trading', 'electronic block trading', 'profit industry group', 'three different actors', 'bid offer spreads', 'stock universe beco', 'conditional order workflow', 'significant investment efficiencies', 'An LSEG Business', 'execution management system', 'differentiated execution channels', 'European equities values', 'Turquoise Plato Uncross', 'Turquoise Plato users', 'average trade size', 'fungible US securities', 'midpoint electronic blocks', 'five-year anniversary', 'block liquidity', 'securities trading', 'group head', 'Turquoise Plato™', 'trading venue', 'German stock', 'stock basis', 'order ticket', 'block trade', 'Plato Partnership', 'increased efficiencies', 'market participants', 'market convention', 'execution quality', 'execution mechanisms', 'business development', 'Turquoise members', 'multiple securities', 'Trade Turquoise', 'cooperation agreement', 'first time', 'end investors', 'Markets Media', 'asset managers', 'new records', 'single trades', 'six countries', 'single orders', 'large orders', 'other blocks', 'immediate print', 'information leakage', 'innovative notification', 'best quality', 'closing auction', 'active investors', 'rising demand', 'US stocks', 'Asian investors', 'direct settlement', 'Senior leaders', 'game changer', 'single connection', 'new way', 'diverse portfolio', 'financial centres', 'largest trade', 'Connecting equities', 'integrated innovation', 'Asian clients', 'Asian brokers', 'buy side', 'Robert Barnes', 'sell side', '100 brokers', 'June', 'person', 'pandemic', 'September', 'vision', 'MTF', 'displayed', 'services', '5 years', 'growth', 'customers', 'launch', 'ADT', 'h0vkar9Q2r', 'bU5U97vYM8', 'tradeturquoise', 'comparison', 'measure', 'trend', 'insight', 'community', 'feature', 'seconds', 'minutes', 'OpenFin', 'FlexTrade', 'rules', 'choice', 'algo', 'probability', 'benefit', 'trails', 'America', 'result', 'DTC', 'demands', 'UK', 'Swiss', 'addition', 'initiative', 'ambition']",2022-07-08,2022-07-08,tradersmagazine.com
