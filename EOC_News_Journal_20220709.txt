By working hand in hand with schools  we’re giving students the opportunity to develop their expertise within a leading global hospitality player  as well as potentially join Accor after their studies. Driven by the ambition to create the hospitality of the future  we want to generate value and stimulate creativity thanks to an approach of open innovation which harnesses the driving forces of progress. And attracting emerging as well as existing talent is one of them. Our commitment to innovation translates into the following three student competitions.Three  Two  One… TakeOff!A worldwide student competition launched by Accor in 2012  the TakeOff! Student Challenge aims to empower students by giving them the opportunity to explore a challenge our Group is facing and test out their ideas with a global group of Accor experts.In the 2022 edition  we are extending our focus on the people element centered on our employee promise #BELimitless  by setting students the challenge to come up with new ways for Accor to attract new talent in the post-COVID-19 rebound.Nearly 600 students of more than 50 nationalities from 37 countries registered and over 170 projects were completed over the challenge duration with the final presentations taking place June 22. And the first prize  a trip to Paris and a workshop at Accor’s HQ to develop their project  went to Pei Rong Chia  Min Feng Ng and Shi Yun Phuan from Singapore for their first MetaHotel. Paving the way for the future of hospitality in the Metaverse is Accor's very first AccorVerse  with the integration of gamification and entertainment to craft innovative ways of recruiting new talents  therefore revolutionizing the hiring process for the future of hospitality.Front-runners: Accor Design AwardsOur worldwide competition devoted to architecture and interior design students across the globe was first launched in 2016 and make up part of Accor’s strategy  where taking an active and visionary role in crafting the future of hospitality design and guests’ expectations around lifestyle  sustainability and wellness are key.Every year  Accor invites design schools from around the world and provides their students with a brief outlining the year’s challenge. Once submitted  Accor’s global Design and Technical Services teams select a shortlist of students with the best projects. A VIP jury as well as Accor key representatives then vote for the 3 wining projects. Public choice award is voted by the public via a bespoke online platform.For students and schools  the Awards represent the possibility to work on a real-life project  in an operational case study. The students compete with other schools and other cultures  and are mentored by key actors in the hospitality market. Thanks to the awards  participants are able to build a network  get a taste of the professional world  actively participate in tomorrow’s hospitality industry  and every so often  see their projects brought to life at real working hotels.And this year’s winning projects include Roll by École Bleue - Global Design in first place with a movie-infused concept located in Tribe Batignolles. The second prize was awarded to a team from Berlin International University  for their design concept based on ethical farming and harvesting. Third place went to L’Ecole de Design Nantes Atlantique who created a project which ambition is to turn hotels into city-center hubs. Last but not least  the public choice award went to another team from L’Ecole de Design Nantes Atlantique for their Là-Haut project - a rooftop bubble that offers guests a 360 degrees view.A More Sustainable Future is Now: Young Talent Awards x Hospitality ONLaunched this month  Young Talent Awards x Hospitality ON is a challenge that will shape the future of hospitality and is aimed at young international talent. In this inaugural edition  the challenge is around making tomorrow’s hospitality industry sustainable  as well as to support the attractiveness of the hospitality sector by promoting employer brands.Participants are battling it out for the top prize  a six-month internship in 2023 in the southern European marketing team to work on a new customer experience linked to our CSR roadmap. So watch this space for the results!The three events are fun and stimulating opportunities to discover new talent and trends by exploring each school’s unique vision.

The stock exchange was established on July 9  1875  after a resolution was passed by a group of Bombay brokers to form an association to protect the character  status and interest of native shares and stock brokers. The 147-year-old exchange  which started functioning from under a banyan tree near the Town Hall in south Bombay  shifted to the PJ Towers only in 1980.In August 1957  the BSE became the first stock exchange to be recognised by the Indian government under the Securities Contracts Regulation Act.Over the past 147 years  the BSE has had an interesting and eventful journey in the history of India's securities market.

Over the next 10 years  the brokers shifted from Town Hall to the banyan trees at Meadows Street as their tribe increased. After moving from place to place to accommodate the growing number of brokers  the peripatetic group finally started functioning from a permanent place in Dalal Street in 1874.

7582,EuroNext,Bing API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4522517-frontline-euronav-merger-negotiations-ongoing,Frontline Euronav Merger Negotiations Still Ongoing (NYSE:FRO) (NYSE:EURN),The merger between Frontline and Euronav is still ongoing. Read more to see why I recommend buying FRO at or below $8.3 with potential lower support at $7.65.,"HeliRyIntroductionBermuda-based Frontline Ltd. (NYSE:FRO) reported its first-quarter 2022 results on May 24  2022.Important note: This article is an update of my article published on February 22  2022. I have been following FRO on Seeking Alpha since 2015.1 - 1Q22 results snapshotFrontline reported a net income of $31.15 million  or $0.15 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022  compared to $28.90 million or $0.15 per share in 1Q21. The Adjusted net loss was $1.61 million  or $0.01 per diluted share  for the first quarter of 2022.Furthermore  Frontline reported total operating revenues of $217.44 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $193.99 million in 1Q21. Results were in line with analysts' expectations.FRO 1Q22 financial highlights Presentation (Frontline Presentation)However  the most important news is  without a doubt  the private acquisition of 3.82% of Euronav (EURN) using Frontline's common share  creating a more prominent tanker company.2 - Fleet status after the Frontline Euronav potential mergerOn June 6  2022  Frontline announced it had completed the acquisition of 3.82% of Euronav.announces that it has agreed to acquire in privately negotiated transactions with certain shareholders of Euronav N.V. (NYSE: EURN & Euronext: EURN) a total of 7 708 908 shares in Euronav  representing 3.82% of the outstanding shares in Euronav  in exchange for a total of 10 753 924 shares in Frontline  which is equivalent to 1.395 Frontline shares for every one share of Euronav. Following completion of the issue of the new Frontline shares  Frontline will have a total of 222 622 889 shares issued and outstanding.John Fredriksen (Hemen) owns nearly 15% of the combined companies. I noticed that the swap above had been completed at a slight discount to the merger agreement from 1.45 FRO to 1.395 FRO.A reminder  on April 7  2022  FRO and EURN indicated:Have signed a term sheet that has been unanimously approved by their Board of Directors and Supervisory Board  respectively  on a potential stock-for-stock combination between the two companies  based on an exchange ratio of 1.45 FRO shares for every EURN share resulting in Euronav and Frontline shareholders owning approximately 59% and 41%  respectively  of the combined group. It is anticipated that Euronav will pay total dividends of up to 12 cents before the closing of the business combination with no impact on the exchange ratio.Negotiations are still ongoing  and if the merger is completed  the new Frontline will own and operate a large and modern fleet that comprises 67 VLCC  56 Suezmax vessels  and 18 LR2/Aframax vessels with a market cap of $4.2 billion.One issue that could stall the merger is that the ""Saverys family  which as the largest shareholder in Euronav has continued to oppose the deal  proposed an alternative merger with Compagnie Maritime Belge.""The company indicated that the new relationship offers significant benefits from a more extensive combined fleet  leading to improved overall utilization and cost synergies. Also  the market cap of the new FRO would be almost 4 times larger than Scorpio Tankers Inc (STNG) at $1.2 billion and Hafnia Ltd (OTCPK:HFIAF) at $1.0 billion.3 - Stock PerformanceFrontline has underperformed its peers below and is now down 6% on a one-year basis.Note: I recommend reading my recent article on SFL published on May 18  2022  by clicking here. Also  my article on TNK was published on July 5  2022.Data by YCharts4 - Investment thesisAssuming that the merger between FRO and EURN is completed  the new Frontline will be considered a global leader in the oil tanker industry. Frontline and Euronav are part of John Fredriksen's group  which already owns about 15% of the combined companies.Frontline will be headed by Mr. Hugo De Stoop as the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors of the combined group is expected to consist of seven members  including three current independent Euronav Supervisory Board members  two nominated by Hemen Holding Limited (""Hemen"") and two additional new independent directorsHowever  I do not see a significant change arising from such a large merger in terms of investment. As always  bigger doesn't necessarily mean better.The tanker market is highly volatile  and investing a considerable amount in this business is not a good idea. I consider FRO an excellent trading tool due to its high volatility.FRO Tanker market Presentation 1Q22 (Frontline)The stock has performed quite well recently  but the outlook for tanker rates has always been unpredictable. 2021 was the worst year in three decades  and after a slow start in 2022  the tankers industry experienced an unusual spike in spot tanker rates late in 1Q22.This increase was driven primarily by the impact of the ongoing Ukraine conflict. The midsize tankers segment benefitted the most due to disruptions in oil trading patterns.Thus  I continue to recommend primarily using FRO as a trading vehicle and keeping a minimal long-term position while waiting for a massive rebound in the sector. The idea is to keep a core position and trade short-term LIFO.Lars Barstad - Interim Chief Executive Officer  said in the conference call:We announced the proposed combination with Euronav early April  and we've since then been working diligently together to finalize and appropriate transaction structure for this combination.Frontline Ltd. - The Raw Numbers: First-Quarter Of 2022 And Financials HistoryFRO 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 FRO 1Q22 EURN Total Revenues in $ Million 193.99 170.02 171.83 213.55 217.44 114.37 Net Income in $ Million 28.90 -26.63 -33.21 19.79 31.15 -43.37 EBITDA $ Million 44.64 -12.0 -17.97 41.25 48.10 38.87 EPS diluted in $/share 0.15 -0.13 -0.17 0.10 0.15 -0.22 Operating cash flow in $ Million 12.00 29.22 -3.53 25.24 17.34 -44.21 CapEx in $ Million 44.33 137.65 36.85 243.57 11.19 62.56 Free Cash Flow in $ Million -32.33 -108.43 -40.38 -218.33 6.15 -106.77 Total cash $ Million 154.13 143.03 124.95 115.51 113.88 169.58 Long-term Debt in $ Million 2 133.0 2 217.9 2 258.2 2 316.2 2 230.8 1 790.54 Shares Outstanding (Diluted) in Million 197.78 197.82 198.03 202.45 203.53/222.62* 201.77Source: Frontline material* Following completion of the issue of the new Frontline shares after the acquisition of 3.82% of Euronav  Frontline will have a total of 222 622 889 shares issued and outstanding.Note: More data are available to subscribers only.Analysis: Total Operating Revenues  Earnings Details  Free Cash Flow1 - Operating Revenues were $217.44 million in 1Q22FRO Quarterly Revenue history (Fun Trading)Frontline announced lower-than-expected revenues of $217.44 million for the first quarter of 2022 (see chart above).The company posted a net income of $31.15 million  or $0.15 per diluted share  for the first quarter of 2022 and an adjusted net loss of $1.61 million  or $0.01 per diluted share. The decrease in adjusted net loss YoY was driven by an increase in time charter equivalent earnings due to the higher TCE rates in the quarter  partly offset by other movements in operating gains and expenses.CEO Lars Barstad said in the conference call:So far  in the first quarter of 2022  we booked 74% of our VLCC days at $22 600 per day. We booked 70% of our Suezmax days at $32 700 per day and 58% of our LR2/Aframax days at $46 300 per day. All numbers in this table are on the load to discharge basis as usual for Frontline.2 - Free cash flow was $6.15 million in 1Q22FRO Quarterly Free cash flow history (Fun Trading)Note: Generic free cash flow is cash from operation minus CapExTrailing 12-month free cash flow is estimated at a loss of $360.99 million  with a gain of $6.15 million in 1Q22.As a reminder  FRO stopped paying dividends starting in 3Q20.3 - Debt analysis: Net debt is estimated at $2.12 billion in 1Q22 (consolidated and including current)FRO Quarterly Cash versus Debt history (Fun Trading)As of March 31  2022  total cash was $113.88 million  and long-term debt  including current  was 2 230.8 million.Technical Analysis And CommentaryFRO TA Chart short-term (Fun Trading)Note: The chart is adjusted from the dividend.FRO forms an ascending channel pattern with resistance at $11.65 and support at $8.25.The short-term trading strategy is to trade LIFO about 60%-70% of your position and keep a core long-term position for a much higher payday.I suggest selling between $11.3 and $11.8 and waiting for a retracement between $8.3 and $8.2 with potential lower support at $7.65.If the market turns bullish  FRO could break out and reach $12  but it is not likely at the moment.Instead  the risk of entering a bear market rises due to stubborn record inflation and the tightening of the Fed. We may be heading toward a recession by the end of 2022  severely affecting the market and FRO. In this case  FRO could drop to $6.25 or even lower.Hence  the priority is to build up a cash position and trade short-term LIFO until a clear trend emerges.Note: The LIFO method is prohibited under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  though it is permitted in the United States to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore  only US traders can apply this method. Those who cannot trade LIFO can use an alternative by setting two different accounts for the same stocks  one for the long term and one for short-term trading.Warning: The TA chart must be updated frequently to be relevant. It is what I am doing in my stock tracker. The chart above has a possible validity of about a week. Remember  the TA chart is a tool only to help you adopt the right strategy. It is not a way to foresee the future. No one and nothing can.Author's note: If you find value in this article and would like to encourage such continued efforts  please click the ""Like"" button below as a vote of support.
