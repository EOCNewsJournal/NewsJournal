7587,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4522517-frontline-euronav-merger-negotiations-ongoing,Frontline Euronav Merger Negotiations Still Ongoing (NYSE:FRO) (NYSE:EURN),The merger between Frontline and Euronav is still ongoing. Read more to see why I recommend buying FRO at or below $8.3 with potential lower support at $7.65.,"HeliRyIntroductionBermuda-based Frontline Ltd. (NYSE:FRO) reported its first-quarter 2022 results on May 24  2022.Important note: This article is an update of my article published on February 22  2022. I have been following FRO on Seeking Alpha since 2015.1 - 1Q22 results snapshotFrontline reported a net income of $31.15 million  or $0.15 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022  compared to $28.90 million or $0.15 per share in 1Q21. The Adjusted net loss was $1.61 million  or $0.01 per diluted share  for the first quarter of 2022.Furthermore  Frontline reported total operating revenues of $217.44 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $193.99 million in 1Q21. Results were in line with analysts' expectations.FRO 1Q22 financial highlights Presentation (Frontline Presentation)However  the most important news is  without a doubt  the private acquisition of 3.82% of Euronav (EURN) using Frontline's common share  creating a more prominent tanker company.2 - Fleet status after the Frontline Euronav potential mergerOn June 6  2022  Frontline announced it had completed the acquisition of 3.82% of Euronav.announces that it has agreed to acquire in privately negotiated transactions with certain shareholders of Euronav N.V. (NYSE: EURN & Euronext: EURN) a total of 7 708 908 shares in Euronav  representing 3.82% of the outstanding shares in Euronav  in exchange for a total of 10 753 924 shares in Frontline  which is equivalent to 1.395 Frontline shares for every one share of Euronav. Following completion of the issue of the new Frontline shares  Frontline will have a total of 222 622 889 shares issued and outstanding.John Fredriksen (Hemen) owns nearly 15% of the combined companies. I noticed that the swap above had been completed at a slight discount to the merger agreement from 1.45 FRO to 1.395 FRO.A reminder  on April 7  2022  FRO and EURN indicated:Have signed a term sheet that has been unanimously approved by their Board of Directors and Supervisory Board  respectively  on a potential stock-for-stock combination between the two companies  based on an exchange ratio of 1.45 FRO shares for every EURN share resulting in Euronav and Frontline shareholders owning approximately 59% and 41%  respectively  of the combined group. It is anticipated that Euronav will pay total dividends of up to 12 cents before the closing of the business combination with no impact on the exchange ratio.Negotiations are still ongoing  and if the merger is completed  the new Frontline will own and operate a large and modern fleet that comprises 67 VLCC  56 Suezmax vessels  and 18 LR2/Aframax vessels with a market cap of $4.2 billion.One issue that could stall the merger is that the ""Saverys family  which as the largest shareholder in Euronav has continued to oppose the deal  proposed an alternative merger with Compagnie Maritime Belge.""The company indicated that the new relationship offers significant benefits from a more extensive combined fleet  leading to improved overall utilization and cost synergies. Also  the market cap of the new FRO would be almost 4 times larger than Scorpio Tankers Inc (STNG) at $1.2 billion and Hafnia Ltd (OTCPK:HFIAF) at $1.0 billion.3 - Stock PerformanceFrontline has underperformed its peers below and is now down 6% on a one-year basis.Note: I recommend reading my recent article on SFL published on May 18  2022  by clicking here. Also  my article on TNK was published on July 5  2022.Data by YCharts4 - Investment thesisAssuming that the merger between FRO and EURN is completed  the new Frontline will be considered a global leader in the oil tanker industry. Frontline and Euronav are part of John Fredriksen's group  which already owns about 15% of the combined companies.Frontline will be headed by Mr. Hugo De Stoop as the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors of the combined group is expected to consist of seven members  including three current independent Euronav Supervisory Board members  two nominated by Hemen Holding Limited (""Hemen"") and two additional new independent directorsHowever  I do not see a significant change arising from such a large merger in terms of investment. As always  bigger doesn't necessarily mean better.The tanker market is highly volatile  and investing a considerable amount in this business is not a good idea. I consider FRO an excellent trading tool due to its high volatility.FRO Tanker market Presentation 1Q22 (Frontline)The stock has performed quite well recently  but the outlook for tanker rates has always been unpredictable. 2021 was the worst year in three decades  and after a slow start in 2022  the tankers industry experienced an unusual spike in spot tanker rates late in 1Q22.This increase was driven primarily by the impact of the ongoing Ukraine conflict. The midsize tankers segment benefitted the most due to disruptions in oil trading patterns.Thus  I continue to recommend primarily using FRO as a trading vehicle and keeping a minimal long-term position while waiting for a massive rebound in the sector. The idea is to keep a core position and trade short-term LIFO.Lars Barstad - Interim Chief Executive Officer  said in the conference call:We announced the proposed combination with Euronav early April  and we've since then been working diligently together to finalize and appropriate transaction structure for this combination.Frontline Ltd. - The Raw Numbers: First-Quarter Of 2022 And Financials HistoryFRO 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 FRO 1Q22 EURN Total Revenues in $ Million 193.99 170.02 171.83 213.55 217.44 114.37 Net Income in $ Million 28.90 -26.63 -33.21 19.79 31.15 -43.37 EBITDA $ Million 44.64 -12.0 -17.97 41.25 48.10 38.87 EPS diluted in $/share 0.15 -0.13 -0.17 0.10 0.15 -0.22 Operating cash flow in $ Million 12.00 29.22 -3.53 25.24 17.34 -44.21 CapEx in $ Million 44.33 137.65 36.85 243.57 11.19 62.56 Free Cash Flow in $ Million -32.33 -108.43 -40.38 -218.33 6.15 -106.77 Total cash $ Million 154.13 143.03 124.95 115.51 113.88 169.58 Long-term Debt in $ Million 2 133.0 2 217.9 2 258.2 2 316.2 2 230.8 1 790.54 Shares Outstanding (Diluted) in Million 197.78 197.82 198.03 202.45 203.53/222.62* 201.77Source: Frontline material* Following completion of the issue of the new Frontline shares after the acquisition of 3.82% of Euronav  Frontline will have a total of 222 622 889 shares issued and outstanding.Note: More data are available to subscribers only.Analysis: Total Operating Revenues  Earnings Details  Free Cash Flow1 - Operating Revenues were $217.44 million in 1Q22FRO Quarterly Revenue history (Fun Trading)Frontline announced lower-than-expected revenues of $217.44 million for the first quarter of 2022 (see chart above).The company posted a net income of $31.15 million  or $0.15 per diluted share  for the first quarter of 2022 and an adjusted net loss of $1.61 million  or $0.01 per diluted share. The decrease in adjusted net loss YoY was driven by an increase in time charter equivalent earnings due to the higher TCE rates in the quarter  partly offset by other movements in operating gains and expenses.CEO Lars Barstad said in the conference call:So far  in the first quarter of 2022  we booked 74% of our VLCC days at $22 600 per day. We booked 70% of our Suezmax days at $32 700 per day and 58% of our LR2/Aframax days at $46 300 per day. All numbers in this table are on the load to discharge basis as usual for Frontline.2 - Free cash flow was $6.15 million in 1Q22FRO Quarterly Free cash flow history (Fun Trading)Note: Generic free cash flow is cash from operation minus CapExTrailing 12-month free cash flow is estimated at a loss of $360.99 million  with a gain of $6.15 million in 1Q22.As a reminder  FRO stopped paying dividends starting in 3Q20.3 - Debt analysis: Net debt is estimated at $2.12 billion in 1Q22 (consolidated and including current)FRO Quarterly Cash versus Debt history (Fun Trading)As of March 31  2022  total cash was $113.88 million  and long-term debt  including current  was 2 230.8 million.Technical Analysis And CommentarySFL TA Chart (Fun Trading)Note: The chart is adjusted from the dividend.FRO forms an ascending channel pattern with resistance at $11.65 and support at $8.25.The short-term trading strategy is to trade LIFO about 60%-70% of your position and keep a core long-term position for a much higher payday.I suggest selling between $11.3 and $11.8 and waiting for a retracement between $8.3 and $8.2 with potential lower support at $7.65.If the market turns bullish  FRO could break out and reach $12  but it is not likely at the moment.Instead  the risk of entering a bear market rises due to stubborn record inflation and the tightening of the Fed. We may be heading toward a recession by the end of 2022  severely affecting the market and FRO. In this case  FRO could drop to $6.25 or even lower.Hence  the priority is to build up a cash position and trade short-term LIFO until a clear trend emerges.Note: The LIFO method is prohibited under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  though it is permitted in the United States to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore  only US traders can apply this method. Those who cannot trade LIFO can use an alternative by setting two different accounts for the same stocks  one for the long term and one for short-term trading.Warning: The TA chart must be updated frequently to be relevant. It is what I am doing in my stock tracker. The chart above has a possible validity of about a week. Remember  the TA chart is a tool only to help you adopt the right strategy. It is not a way to foresee the future.

The study met the primary endpoint and demonstrated fitusiran prophylaxis significantly reduced bleeding episodes compared to prior factor or BPA prophylaxis.Gili Kenet  MDInvestigator  professor of Hematology  Director of the Israeli National Hemophilia Center at Sheba Medical Center and head of the Amalia Biron Thrombosis Research Institute of Tel Aviv University  Tel Aviv  Israel“There is a continued need for transformative therapies that offer people with hemophilia consistent protection while also reducing treatment burden. These phase 3 results are encouraging and support fitusiran’s potential to provide people with hemophilia A or B  regardless of inhibitor status  with a meaningful reduction in bleeding episodes.”Key findings in the Phase 3 ATLAS-PPX study include the following:The overall median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was 0.0 for fitusiran prophylaxis  compared to a median ABR of 4.4 with prior prophylaxis.Fitusiran prophylaxis resulted in a statistically significant reduction in estimated ABR of 61.1% (p= 0.0008) versus factor or BPA prophylaxis.63.1% (n=41) of adults and adolescents treated with fitusiran experienced zero treated bleeds compared to 16.9% (n=11) with prior factor or BPA prophylaxis.Median ABR for treated bleeds was 0.0 with fitusiran prophylaxis for both participants with and without inhibitors compared to 6.5 and 4.4 for participants with and without inhibitors  respectively  on prior prophylaxis.Of the 67 participants exposed to a least one dose of fitusiran  the most common adverse events (≥6 participants) were increased alanine aminotransferase  nasopharyngitis  and upper respiratory tract infection.Consistent with the previously identified risk of fitusiran  suspected or confirmed thromboembolic events were reported in 2 participants (3.0%).Story continuesDietmar Berger MD  PhDGlobal Head of Development and Chief Medical Officer“These positive data support fitusiran’s potential to transform prophylaxis treatment for people with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors  with a median annual bleed rate of zero across all patient populations. Moreover  we are excited to continue to explore fitusiran under an amended protocol that focuses on dose optimization  including lower doses and less frequent dosing regimens  with the potential for as few as six injections per year.”Additional data from the fitusiran clinical program will be shared at the congress including:Collectively  these data add to a growing body of evidence  including results from the ATLAS A/B and ATLAS-INH Phase 3 studies  supporting fitusiran’s potential to transform treatment for all people with hemophilia. Hemophilia A and B are rare congenital bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency of factor VIII and IX  respectively  resulting in insufficient thrombin generation and ineffective clot formation further complicated in patients who develop inhibitors to their factor treatment.Sanofi is currently investigating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran under an amended protocol which includes lower doses and a less frequent dosing regimen maintaining an antithrombin target range of 15-35% in all ongoing studies. Fitusiran has the potential to provide prophylactic treatment for all people with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors  with as few as six subcutaneous injections per year.ATLAS-PPX Phase 3 study design (NCT03549871)ATLAS-PPX is a multinational  open-label  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fitusiran in adult and adolescents aged ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors  who have switched from prior factor or bypassing agent prophylaxis. A total of 80 participants were enrolled. In the study  participants continued their pre-study prophylaxis regimen with factor or bypassing agents for a six-month period followed by a switch to once-monthly fitusiran (80 mg) administered subcutaneously for seven months.The primary endpoint of the study was annualized bleeding rate.About fitusiranFitusiran is an investigational  subcutaneously administered small interference RNA therapeutic in development for the prophylactic treatment of people with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors. Fitusiran is designed to lower antithrombin  a protein that inhibits blood clotting  with the goal of promoting thrombin generation to rebalance hemostasis and prevent bleeds. Fitusiran utilizes Alnylam Pharmaceutical Inc.’s ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology  which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability. Fitusiran is currently under clinical investigation and has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The median and mean annualized bleeding rates (ABR) were 0.00 (IQR: 0.00-1.04) and 0.71 (SD: 1.43) respectively. The study also met the key secondary endpoint  demonstrating superior bleed protection (p<0.0001) over prior factor VIII prophylaxis with an estimated ABR reduction of 77% and a mean ABR of 0.69 compared to 2.96 on prior prophylaxis  based on an intra-patient comparison (n=78). In a subset of participants (n=17) studied at baseline and week 26  mean factor VIII levels remained in the normal to near-normal range (>40 IU/dL) for the majority of the week  and at 15 IU/dL at Day seven post-dose  providing increased factor activity level protection for patients with once-weekly prophylaxis.Story continuesAnnette von Drygalski  MD  PharmDInvestigator  Professor and Director  Hemophilia and Thrombosis Treatment Center  UC San Diego“The phase 3 data demonstrate once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa’s potential to provide superior bleed protection  leading to substantial improvements in physical health  pain and joint health  by sustaining high factor levels for the majority of the week. These unprecedented results may offer people with hemophilia A the possibility to redefine their treatment expectations.”Data show adults and adolescents treated with once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa experienced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in physical health (p=0.0001)  pain intensity (p=0.0276)  and joint health (p=0.0101) when comparing week 52 and baseline measurements.i Moreover  efanesoctocog alfa was effective at treating bleeds  including in target joints; 96.7% of bleeds were resolved with a single 50 IU/kg dose. Efanesoctocog alfa was well tolerated and inhibitor development to factor VIII was not detected. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>5% of participants overall) were headache  arthralgia  fall  and back pain.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Development and Chief Medical Officer  Sanofi“We are committed to advancing innovative medicines that disrupt the status-quo and address the unmet needs that persist for people with rare conditions like hemophilia. These robust data illustrate the promise of efanesoctocog alfa’s efficacy with once-weekly dosing and underscore its potential as a therapy with best-in-disease efficacy.”Anders Ullman  MD  PhDHead of R&D and Chief Medical Officer  Sobi“We believe transforming the treatment paradigm for hemophilia A can only be achieved through elevating standards of care towards normal hemostasis. These data demonstrate the profile of efanesoctocog alfa in significant clinical terms  and further strengthen its potential to ultimately improve the lives of many living with this condition.”The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted efanesoctocog alfa Breakthrough Therapy Designation in May 2022  Fast Track designation in February 2021 and Orphan Drug designation in August 2017. The European Commission also granted efanesoctocog alfa Orphan Drug designation in June 2019. Regulatory submission of the Biologics License Application to the U.S. FDA occurred in June 2022 and submission in the EU will follow availability of data from the ongoing XTEND-Kids pediatric study  expected in 2023.About Phase 3 XTEND-1 Study (NCT04161495)The Phase 3 XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study assessing the safety  efficacy and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa in people 12 years of age or older (n=159) with severe hemophilia A who were previously treated with factor VIII replacement therapy. The study consists of two parallel treatments arms — the prophylaxis Arm A (n=133)  in which patients who had received prior factor VIII prophylaxis began receiving once-weekly intravenous efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks  and the on-demand Arm B (n=26)  in which patients who had received prior on-demand factor VIII therapy began 26 weeks of on-demand efanesoctocog alfa (50 IU/kg)  then switched to once-weekly prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for an additional 26 weeks.The primary efficacy endpoint was the ABR in Arm A  and the key secondary endpoint was an intra-patient comparison of ABR during the efanesoctocog alfa weekly prophylaxis treatment period versus the prior factor VIII prophylaxis ABR for participants in Arm A who had participated in a previous observational study (Study 242HA201/OBS16221).About hemophilia AHemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person’s blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Hemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with hemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage and life-threatening hemorrhages. Factor replacement therapy remains a cornerstone of care and can be used across multiple treatment scenarios.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa  formerly BIVV001  is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for people with hemophilia A. It builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to extend its time in circulation. It is the first investigational factor VIII therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. Efanesoctocogalfa is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialization of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®.The companies also collaborate on the development and commercialization of efanesoctocog alfa  an investigational factor VIII therapy with the potential to provide high sustained factor activity levels with once-weekly dosing for people with hemophilia A.
