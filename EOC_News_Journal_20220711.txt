The study met the primary endpoint and demonstrated fitusiran prophylaxis significantly reduced bleeding episodes compared to prior factor or BPA prophylaxis.Gili Kenet  MDInvestigator  professor of Hematology  Director of the Israeli National Hemophilia Center at Sheba Medical Center and head of the Amalia Biron Thrombosis Research Institute of Tel Aviv University  Tel Aviv  Israel“There is a continued need for transformative therapies that offer people with hemophilia consistent protection while also reducing treatment burden. These phase 3 results are encouraging and support fitusiran’s potential to provide people with hemophilia A or B  regardless of inhibitor status  with a meaningful reduction in bleeding episodes.”Key findings in the Phase 3 ATLAS-PPX study include the following:The overall median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was 0.0 for fitusiran prophylaxis  compared to a median ABR of 4.4 with prior prophylaxis.Fitusiran prophylaxis resulted in a statistically significant reduction in estimated ABR of 61.1% (p= 0.0008) versus factor or BPA prophylaxis.63.1% (n=41) of adults and adolescents treated with fitusiran experienced zero treated bleeds compared to 16.9% (n=11) with prior factor or BPA prophylaxis.Median ABR for treated bleeds was 0.0 with fitusiran prophylaxis for both participants with and without inhibitors compared to 6.5 and 4.4 for participants with and without inhibitors  respectively  on prior prophylaxis.Of the 67 participants exposed to a least one dose of fitusiran  the most common adverse events (≥6 participants) were increased alanine aminotransferase  nasopharyngitis  and upper respiratory tract infection.Consistent with the previously identified risk of fitusiran  suspected or confirmed thromboembolic events were reported in 2 participants (3.0%).Story continuesDietmar Berger MD  PhDGlobal Head of Development and Chief Medical Officer“These positive data support fitusiran’s potential to transform prophylaxis treatment for people with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors  with a median annual bleed rate of zero across all patient populations. Moreover  we are excited to continue to explore fitusiran under an amended protocol that focuses on dose optimization  including lower doses and less frequent dosing regimens  with the potential for as few as six injections per year.”Additional data from the fitusiran clinical program will be shared at the congress including:Collectively  these data add to a growing body of evidence  including results from the ATLAS A/B and ATLAS-INH Phase 3 studies  supporting fitusiran’s potential to transform treatment for all people with hemophilia. Hemophilia A and B are rare congenital bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency of factor VIII and IX  respectively  resulting in insufficient thrombin generation and ineffective clot formation further complicated in patients who develop inhibitors to their factor treatment.Sanofi is currently investigating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran under an amended protocol which includes lower doses and a less frequent dosing regimen maintaining an antithrombin target range of 15-35% in all ongoing studies. Fitusiran has the potential to provide prophylactic treatment for all people with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors  with as few as six subcutaneous injections per year.ATLAS-PPX Phase 3 study design (NCT03549871)ATLAS-PPX is a multinational  open-label  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fitusiran in adult and adolescents aged ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors  who have switched from prior factor or bypassing agent prophylaxis. A total of 80 participants were enrolled. In the study  participants continued their pre-study prophylaxis regimen with factor or bypassing agents for a six-month period followed by a switch to once-monthly fitusiran (80 mg) administered subcutaneously for seven months.The primary endpoint of the study was annualized bleeding rate.About fitusiranFitusiran is an investigational  subcutaneously administered small interference RNA therapeutic in development for the prophylactic treatment of people with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors. Fitusiran is designed to lower antithrombin  a protein that inhibits blood clotting  with the goal of promoting thrombin generation to rebalance hemostasis and prevent bleeds. Fitusiran utilizes Alnylam Pharmaceutical Inc.’s ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology  which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability. Fitusiran is currently under clinical investigation and has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The median and mean annualized bleeding rates (ABR) were 0.00 (IQR: 0.00-1.04) and 0.71 (SD: 1.43) respectively. The study also met the key secondary endpoint  demonstrating superior bleed protection (p<0.0001) over prior factor VIII prophylaxis with an estimated ABR reduction of 77% and a mean ABR of 0.69 compared to 2.96 on prior prophylaxis  based on an intra-patient comparison (n=78). In a subset of participants (n=17) studied at baseline and week 26  mean factor VIII levels remained in the normal to near-normal range (>40 IU/dL) for the majority of the week  and at 15 IU/dL at Day seven post-dose  providing increased factor activity level protection for patients with once-weekly prophylaxis.Story continuesAnnette von Drygalski  MD  PharmDInvestigator  Professor and Director  Hemophilia and Thrombosis Treatment Center  UC San Diego“The phase 3 data demonstrate once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa’s potential to provide superior bleed protection  leading to substantial improvements in physical health  pain and joint health  by sustaining high factor levels for the majority of the week. These unprecedented results may offer people with hemophilia A the possibility to redefine their treatment expectations.”Data show adults and adolescents treated with once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa experienced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in physical health (p=0.0001)  pain intensity (p=0.0276)  and joint health (p=0.0101) when comparing week 52 and baseline measurements.i Moreover  efanesoctocog alfa was effective at treating bleeds  including in target joints; 96.7% of bleeds were resolved with a single 50 IU/kg dose. Efanesoctocog alfa was well tolerated and inhibitor development to factor VIII was not detected. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>5% of participants overall) were headache  arthralgia  fall  and back pain.Dietmar Berger  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Development and Chief Medical Officer  Sanofi“We are committed to advancing innovative medicines that disrupt the status-quo and address the unmet needs that persist for people with rare conditions like hemophilia. These robust data illustrate the promise of efanesoctocog alfa’s efficacy with once-weekly dosing and underscore its potential as a therapy with best-in-disease efficacy.”Anders Ullman  MD  PhDHead of R&D and Chief Medical Officer  Sobi“We believe transforming the treatment paradigm for hemophilia A can only be achieved through elevating standards of care towards normal hemostasis. These data demonstrate the profile of efanesoctocog alfa in significant clinical terms  and further strengthen its potential to ultimately improve the lives of many living with this condition.”The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted efanesoctocog alfa Breakthrough Therapy Designation in May 2022  Fast Track designation in February 2021 and Orphan Drug designation in August 2017. The European Commission also granted efanesoctocog alfa Orphan Drug designation in June 2019. Regulatory submission of the Biologics License Application to the U.S. FDA occurred in June 2022 and submission in the EU will follow availability of data from the ongoing XTEND-Kids pediatric study  expected in 2023.About Phase 3 XTEND-1 Study (NCT04161495)The Phase 3 XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study assessing the safety  efficacy and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa in people 12 years of age or older (n=159) with severe hemophilia A who were previously treated with factor VIII replacement therapy. The study consists of two parallel treatments arms — the prophylaxis Arm A (n=133)  in which patients who had received prior factor VIII prophylaxis began receiving once-weekly intravenous efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks  and the on-demand Arm B (n=26)  in which patients who had received prior on-demand factor VIII therapy began 26 weeks of on-demand efanesoctocog alfa (50 IU/kg)  then switched to once-weekly prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for an additional 26 weeks.The primary efficacy endpoint was the ABR in Arm A  and the key secondary endpoint was an intra-patient comparison of ABR during the efanesoctocog alfa weekly prophylaxis treatment period versus the prior factor VIII prophylaxis ABR for participants in Arm A who had participated in a previous observational study (Study 242HA201/OBS16221).About hemophilia AHemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person’s blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Hemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with hemophilia can experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain  irreversible joint damage and life-threatening hemorrhages. Factor replacement therapy remains a cornerstone of care and can be used across multiple treatment scenarios.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa  formerly BIVV001  is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for people with hemophilia A. It builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to extend its time in circulation. It is the first investigational factor VIII therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. Efanesoctocogalfa is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialization of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®.The companies also collaborate on the development and commercialization of efanesoctocog alfa  an investigational factor VIII therapy with the potential to provide high sustained factor activity levels with once-weekly dosing for people with hemophilia A.

The Group's consolidated revenue stood at €35.5m  vs. €27.6m a year earlier. At constant scope and exchange rates  quarterly growth stood at +24%.Over H1 2022  revenue amounted to €63.3 million  vs. €50.8 million in H1 2021  an increase of €12.5m. This solid level reflects robust growth of +25% relative to H1 2021 and +20% relative to the H2 2021  which traditionally contributes more.At mid-year 2022  the group is therefore well ahead of its full-year target for revenue growth in 2022 to be at least equal to 2021 growth (+12%) and pushing towards +15%.Growth in all business lines  with Software & services up +47%The robust half-year performance was driven by growth in all the Group's business lines (Optical transport  Access and Software & services). In the wake of 2022  the Optical transport activity was particularly buoyant  with robust growth of +31% relative to H1 2021  thanks to the success of 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s WDM systems.Over the period  momentum in Access solution sales was also strong in all regions  with +21% growth compared to H1 2021.Driven by the success of SDN (Software Defined Networks) solutions  network functions virtualization (VNFs – Virtual Network Functions)  Services activity  including the contribution of SixSq's activities  revenue generated by sales of software and services  which constitute a factor for improving profitability  jumped by +47%  representing 15% of H1 revenues.Story continuesRevenues up +29% in France and strong sales momentum in international business  including +48% in North AmericaInternational sales momentum was upbeat over H1 2022  with revenue up +22% and strong growth in all regions. International business accounted for 65% of total revenue over H1 2021 (vs 67% a year earlier).Business volumes totaled €12.8 million in North America  representing strong growth of +48% relative to H1 2021 (+33% in US dollar)  driven by demand for Optical transport equipment. Ekinops reached  for the first time  20% of its revenue in North America in H1 2022 (vs. 17% in the previous year).At mid-year  EMEA (Europe  excl. France  Middle-East and Africa)  which accounts for 38% of business  generated revenue of €24.3 million  up +6% relative to H1 of the previous year.After two years of business severely impacted by the pandemic  Asia-Pacific was able to restore growth in H2 2021. This growth trajectory continued in H1 2022 with a very sustained +80% increase in half-year sales. This performance was driven by strong traction in Access solutions  notably with an Australian Tier 1 operator entering the group's Top 10 customers. Asia-Pacific region accounted for 7% of Ekinops' total business activity in H1 2022 (vs 5% one year prior).After virtually stable revenue in its domestic market in 2021 and until the first quarter of the year  Ekinops restored sharp growth in France in H1 2022. With robust sales momentum in both Optical transport and Access solutions  growth amounted to +29% in France compared to H1 2021. Ekinops recorded 35% of its half-year sales in France.FY 2022 guidance fully confirmed at mid-yearAfter a particularly dynamic Q1 (+20%)  Ekinops continued its sustained growth trajectory in Q2 (+29%) with excellent order intake illustrating the Group's ability to capture investments from operators and enterprises  as well as the relevance of its solutions for their needs in this difficult economic context.However  Ekinops remains vigilant regarding the components' crisis  which is set to continue over 2022 and remain very present in coming quarters. To date  however  it has not caused any major impact on the Group's business  which thanks to its control over its supply chain  is largely outperforming its market and competitors.At mid-year  Ekinops confirms its annual guidance:robust organic growth   at least equal to the 2021 level (+12%) and pushing towards +15%;gross margin of between 52% and 56%  in line with its long-term ambitions and factoring in the potential impact of the supply chain crisis on electronic components;EBITDA margin between 14% and 18%  integrating human and technological investments to execute the new growth plan.At the same time  Ekinops remains particularly active on the external growth front  continuing to explore all acquisitions opportunities that could create value for the company.Didier Brédy  Chairman and CEO of Ekinops  stated:""After a dynamic 2021 for Ekinops  this beginning of 2022 is marked by a clear acceleration in demand growth.Illustrating this dynamism  all our business lines show strong growth  with strong traction in our Optical transport solutions  particularly in North America. This momentum puts us ahead of our target set at the time of the OTN technology acquisition in 2019  namely  to triple our sales over 5 years for this business line.Beyond the excellent growth in sales  my greatest satisfaction is the tremendously positive feedback from our largest customers regarding our ability to deliver on schedule while the unprecedented components crisis is raging. From the beginning of the Covid crisis  we have chosen to use our balance sheet to increase our inventory  to buy certain risky components 12 to 18 months in advance  while we would buy those 6 months ahead before the crisis. These choices have proven to be right ones as they generate goodwill from our customers and allow us to win market share.""2022 financial calendarDate Release July 28  2022 H1 2022 results October 11  2022 Q3 2021 revenue January 11  2023 FY 2022 revenue March 7  2023 2022 annual resultsAll press releases are published after Euronext Paris markets close.EKINOPS ContactDidier BrédyChairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frPressAmaury DugastPress relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 74adugast@actus.frAbout EkinopsEkinops Logo (PRNewsfoto/Ekinops)CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ekinops-delivers-record-h1-revenue-at-63-3-million-up-25-301583910.htmlSOURCE Ekinops",neutral,0.16,0.8,0.03,mixed,0.43,0.27,0.3,True,English,"['record H1 revenue', 'Ekinops', 'Software Defined Networks) solutions', 'network functions virtualization', 'Virtual Network Functions', 'Australian Tier 1 operator', 'excellent order intake', 'difficult economic context', 'Didier Brédy', 'Optical transport equipment', 'external growth front', 'Optical transport activity', 'robust sales momentum', 'supply chain crisis', 'Access solution sales', 'robust organic growth', 'new growth plan', 'International sales momentum', 'strong sales momentum', 'total business activity', 'robust half-year performance', 'sustained growth trajectory', 'record H1 revenue', 'half-year sales', 'new peak', ""components' crisis"", 'robust growth', 'strong traction', 'total revenue', 'telecommunication solutions', 'Access solutions', 'international business', 'strong growth', 'leading supplier', 'audited data', 'Change Change', 'constant scope', 'exchange rates', 'full-year target', 'WDM systems', 'North America', 'US dollar', 'first time', 'two years', 'sustained +80% increase', 'Top 10 customers', 'first quarter', 'FY 2022 guidance', 'dynamic Q1', 'coming quarters', 'major impact', 'annual guidance', 'gross margin', 'long-term ambitions', 'potential impact', 'electronic components', 'EBITDA margin', 'same time', 'acquisitions opportunities', 'Services activity', 'quarterly growth', 'sharp growth', 'business lines', 'Business volumes', 'Q1 revenue', 'consolidated revenue', 'stable revenue', 'previous year', 'revenue growth', 'Q2 growth', 'Euronext Paris', 'telecom operators', 'solid level', 'Asia-Pacific region', 'domestic market', 'technological investments', 'Q2 2022 revenue', 'Q2 revenue', 'The Group', 'H1 revenues', '2021 growth', '+21% growth', '2021 level', 'PRNewswire', 'Ekinops', 'businesses', 'April', '30 June', 'IFRS', 'SixSq', 'November', 'Acceleration', 'H2', 'mid-year', 'wake', 'success', '200 Gb/s', '400 Gb', 'period', 'regions', 'SDN', 'VNFs', 'contribution', 'activities', 'factor', 'profitability', 'Story', 'France', 'demand', 'EMEA', 'Europe', 'Middle-East', 'Africa', 'pandemic', 'enterprises', 'relevance', 'needs', 'control', 'competitors', 'human', 'value', 'company', 'Chairman', 'CEO']",2022-07-11,2022-07-11,finance.yahoo.com

The FDA had previously granted Breakthrough Device Designation to Genio® to treat CCC patients.In the ACCCESS trial  Nyxoah will implant up to 106 patients with co-primary efficacy endpoints of Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) responder rate  per the Sher criteria  and Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) responder rate  both assessed at 12 months post-implant. The first patient is expected to be implanted during the fourth quarter of 2022  in-line with prior guidance.“The ACCCESS IDE approval is an important first step to unlocking an enormous patient population  as more than 30% of OSA patients in the U.S. have CCC. Nyxoah is the only hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) company with a positive CCC clinical trial and CCC approval in Europe  and the ACCCESS study further strengthens our leadership position in addressing the needs of these patients ” commented Olivier Taelman  Nyxoah’s Chief Executive Officer. “CCC patients who are refractory to CPAP are left with no option other than major palate surgery to treat their OSA. Our BETTER SLEEP trial  which enabled Nyxoah to secure a CCC label expansion in Europe and FDA Breakthrough Device Designation  demonstrated that Genio® can provide these patients with a minimally invasive solution for their disorder. Nyxoah is already the only HGNS company with European CCC approval  bilateral stimulation and both 1.5T and 3.0T full-body MRI compatibility  and the ACCCESS trial is further demonstrating Nyxoah’s mission of offering HGNS solutions to all patients suffering from CCC. We are seeing outstanding results in CCC patients treated with Genio® in Europe and are excited to begin the ACCCESS study and make Genio® available to as many patients as possible.”Story continues“Patients with Complete Concentric Collapse at the soft palate  who have failed CPAP  represent a significant unmet need in the treatment of OSA since  currently  the only FDA approved hypoglossal nerve stimulation therapy is contraindicated for these patients ” commented Dr. Maria Suurna  Otolaryngologist and Director of Sleep Surgery at the University of Miami Health. “The ACCCESS study provides hope for these patients  and their treating physicians  that there may soon be a minimally invasive surgical solution to address their OSA. I  along with the entire sleep community  applaud Nyxoah for developing Genio® with bilateral hypoglossal nerve stimulation and for conducting the ACCCESS trial to provide a treatment alternative for this underserved population.”About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

Barstad  current CEO of Frontline  to join the Board of the combined groupListings of combined group to be on Euronext Brussels  NYSE and OSEEnhanced performance through incremental synergies totaling a minimum of USD 60 million on a full annual run-rate basisHAMILTON  Bermuda and ANTWERP  Belgium  11 July 2022 – Frontline Ltd. (“FRO” or “Frontline”) (NYSE: FRO - OSE: FRO) and Euronav NV (“EURN” or “Euronav”) (NYSE: EURN & Euronext: EURN) are pleased to announce that they have entered into a definitive Combination Agreement for a stock-for-stock combination based on an exchange ratio of 1.45 Frontline-shares for every 1.0 Euronav-share (the “Combination”)  which was unanimously approved by all the members of Frontline's Board of Directors and by all members of Euronav's Supervisory Board. The agreement memorialises the principal aspects of the previously announced term sheet that was signed on 7 April 2022.The combined group will create a leading global independent oil tanker owner and operator with the management  capabilities  resources and scale to successfully capitalise on the opportunities presented by the new era in the sustainable shipping industry.Story continuesWith its complementary platforms  financial strength and skills  the combined group will be particularly well placed to provide innovative  clean and sustainable oil shipping solutions in a highly competitive environment. The combination of the two organizations will create a single best-in-class  highly competent and experienced team. The enlarged fleet will enable the combined group to provide better service to customers on a global basis. Additionally  and in view of rapid technological changes  including digitalisation and new “low carbon fuels” adoption  the combined group will be able to mobilise more resources and achieve meaningful scale to meet these challenges and opportunities from the energy transition.Commenting on the transaction  Mr. John Fredriksen said: “This transaction creates a clear market leader in the tanker market and will position the combined group for continued  sustainable shareholder value creation and the realisation of significant synergies. Frontline  with a fleet of 146 vessels  will be able to offer value enhancing services for our customers and increase fleet utilisation and revenues which will benefit all stakeholders. I am very excited and give my full support and commitment to this combined platform.”Mr. Hugo de Stoop  CEO of Euronav said: “The proposed Combination is a huge opportunity to take a leading position in the tanker industry as we seek to master the transition to a world of clean  safe and sustainable shipping. This transaction represents a unique opportunity to deliver substantially better service to our customers  enhanced returns to our shareholders  and to provide a unique platform where people can fully express their talents while advancing our ambitious sustainability strategy towards decarbonisation of the shipping industry.”Mr. Lars H. Barstad  CEO of Frontline said: ""Frontline believes this transaction will form a powerful combination at an exciting point in the cycle. We are amalgamating a strong operational  technical and commercial platform to enhance shareholder value.""Combination StructureThe proposed Combination is structured as a voluntary conditional exchange offer (the “Tender Offer”) by Frontline for all outstanding shares of Euronav at an exchange ratio of 1.45 Frontline shares for 1.0 Euronav share  possibly followed by a (simplified) squeeze out  with the aim to then propose a merger of Euronav into Frontline to Frontline’s and Euronav’s shareholders as soon as possible thereafter (the “Merger”). Based on Frontline share price USD 8.34 per share (as of US close 8 July 2022)  the proposed exchange rate represents a value of USD 12.09 per Euronav share.Frontline and Euronav have  in this respect  published a notice in accordance with article 8§1 of the Royal Decree of 27 April 2007 on Public Takeover Bids regarding Frontline’s intention to make the Tender Offer which can be found here: https://live.euronext.com/en/product/equities/BMG3682E1921-XOSL#CompanyPressRelease-11153198Assuming all Euronav shares are tendered in the Tender Offer  and following the private acquisitions of Euronav shares in exchange for Frontline shares undertaken in May and June  the combined company will be held as follows: approximately 55% by existing Euronav shareholders and approximately 45% by existing Frontline shareholders.The completion of the Tender Offer will be conditioned upon Frontline owning post Tender Offer at least 50% +1 of all the outstanding shares in Euronav (excluding treasury shares unable to be tendered)  the relocation of Frontline to Cyprus  the absence of material adverse change  the receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. Frontline together with its affiliate Famatown Finance Limited currently already own 37 881 478 shares in Euronav or 18.8% of the total outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) i .Prior to the Tender Offer completion  Euronav will be allowed to pay a dividend for a total amount of USD 0.09 per Euronav share and Frontline will be allowed to pay a dividend of USD 0.15  both with no impact on the exchange ratio; for any dividends from Frontline in excess of such amount  the Euronav shareholders accepting the Tender Offer will receive a compensation per Euronav share equal to the dividend amount per Frontline share times 1.45.The combined group will be named Frontline  incorporated and headquartered in Cyprus and will in addition continue to operate from various offices in Europe and Asia including Belgium  Norway  UK  Singapore and Greece.The combined group will be listed on Euronext Brussels  OSE and NYSE upon Tender Offer completion.Following completion of the Tender Offer  the governance and senior leadership of the Group will be as outlined under the header “senior leadership and governance.” Euronav and Frontline will endeavor to complete a full legal merger. Should  after completion of the Tender Offer  a squeeze-out or legal merger of both companies not yet be feasible  then during such interim period to the full merger  Euronav will retain its separate listings on Euronext Brussels and the New York Stock Exchange  and Euronav governance  as well as further integration joint projects and synergies  shall be further organized taking into account legal obligations of Euronext Brussels listed issuers  including article 7:97 of the Belgian Code of companies and associations.Strategic Benefits of the CombinationThe combination will create a leading independent large crude tanker operator with an anticipated market capitalisation of more than USD 4 billion based on market values of the respective companies as of 8 July 2022  adjusted for the shares in Euronav currently held by Frontline.The combined Net Revenue and EBITDA for the two companies in 2021 was approximately USD 668 million and USD 246 million  respectively.The combined group will benefit from a balanced global vessel footprint with highly complementary platforms including 146 vessels consisting of 68 VLCC  56 Suezmaxes  20 LR2/Aframax and 2 FSO vessels. The best-in-class combined expertise of these businesses  supported by a strong balance sheet and access to attractive financing will support industry leading operational break-even levels for the combined fleet.Value Creation & SynergiesThe Combination is anticipated to deliver significant synergies of a minimum of USD 60 million on an annualised basis  including savings in selling  general and administrative expenses and other expenses resulting from (among other things):A larger fleet allowing for a better utilisation through  for example  use of combination voyagesEconomies of scale driven by cost synergies in respect of daily operational expenditures  dry-dock  and special project expensesFinancial savings  primarily owing to a larger and stronger balance sheet improving the cost of debtThe Frontline Board and Euronav Supervisory Board strongly believe the combined group will represent a premier and well-capitalised company through which investors can participate in the tanker market  benefiting from tangible economies of scale via pooling arrangements  procurement opportunities  reduced overhead and enhanced access to capital  as well as a highly liquid stock.Both the Frontline Board and Euronav Supervisory Board consider the transaction to be in the best interests of all shareholders and have each unanimously approved the Combination Agreement  and subject to the absence of a superior bid (as defined in the takeover rules) the Euronav Supervisory Board has undertaken to recommend to its shareholders to tender their Euronav shares in the Tender Offer.Senior Leadership and GovernanceThe combined group will be headed by Mr. Hugo De Stoop as Chief Executive Officer. Hugo De Stoop has a strong track record of sustainable value creation. His experience will support the speed of execution of the Combination  allowing the combined group to manoeuvre with efficiency in a tanker industry undergoing rapid and fundamental changes.The combined group will benefit from an efficient governance structure designed to promote effective performance  with a one-tier Board limited to seven directors  the majority of whom  including the Chair  will be independent.Upon completion of a legal merger or as soon as Frontline holds 75% or more of Euronav’s outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares held by Euronav)  three of the current independent directors of Euronav will be appointed to the combined group’s board. Up to two non-independent directors will be nominated by Frontline’s largest shareholder Hemen Holding Ltd. (""Hemen"")  and two new independent directors will be identified by Euronav and Hemen jointly  including the Chair of the board of the combined group. Frontline CEO  Mr. Lars H. Barstad  will join the Board of the combined group as a representative of Hemen Holding Ltd.Should there be an interim period between completion of the Tender Offer and the completion of a legal merger (or as long as Frontline holds less than 75% of Euronav’s outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares held by Euronav))  then upon completion of the Tender Offer a one-tier board comprising seven directors will be implemented by Frontline  with the following nomination rights to reflect a proper balance of representation within the boardroom: three of the current independent directors of Euronav will be appointed to the combined group’s board as independent directors  up to three non-independent directors will be nominated by Hemen  and one new independent director—the Chair of the combined group—will be identified by Euronav and Hemen jointly.In order to ensure efficient execution of the Combination  an integration committee is preparing the integration plan to be implemented immediately following the closing of the Tender Offer.Creating a Leader in Sustainable ShippingThe combined group will create a leader in sustainable shipping  aiming for the highest Environmental Social and Governance (""ESG"") standards in the industry. This will provide a platform for extending Euronav and Frontline’s leading positions in sustainable shipping and will allow the combined group to further advance industry best-in-class sustainability practices and strategy. Both entities have set ambitious decarbonisation targets that will be further enhanced through this combination.Moreover  the combined group will benefit from an ESG committee composed of executive and board representatives. This committee will allow for proper oversight of the combined group’s sustainability strategy.Indicative Timetable and Next StepsFrontline will be relocated from Bermuda to Cyprus prior to the launch of the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer is expected to be launched in Q4 2022  once the relocation is achieved  and Frontline intends to proceed with a (simplified) squeeze out if the conditions therefore are met.The Merger will be pursued as soon as possible following the Tender Offer  with the aim then being to submit the Merger to the Frontline and Euronav shareholders’ meetings. In the meantime  the parties will pursue all the corporate and other steps necessary for the Combination.AdvisorsLazard is serving as financial advisor to Euronav.

And do it now ” he said in a tweet over the long weekend.To combat rising energy prices  the Biden administration is releasing about one million barrels a day from its Strategic Petroleum Reserves through October. The flow has depleted the reserves to their lowest level since 1986.But according to a recent Reuters report  the U.S. sent more than five million barrels of oil from its SPR to Europe and Asia last month.Reuters reported that Phillips 66 shipped around 470 000 barrels of crude oil from a storage site in Texas to Italy. Meanwhile  Atlantic Trading & Marketing  part of TotalEnergies  exported two cargoes of 560 000 barrels.In fact  Wall Street sees material upside in the two companies just mentioned.Don’t missMitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger demand for these two physical assets — get in now before the super-rich swarmBill Gates just won legal approval to buy 2 100 acres of North Dakota farmland (and people are ‘livid’ about it) — here's how to gain access as a small investorWarren Buffett likes these 2 investment opportunities outside of the stock marketOil stock #1: Phillips 66 (PSX)Phillips66 is a diversified energy company with four operating segments: Midstream  Chemicals  Refining  and Marketing & Specialties.Headquartered in Houston  the company has 12 refineries in the U.S. and Europe with a global refining capacity of 2.2 million barrels of crude oil per day. It also markets gasoline  diesel  and aviation fuel through more than 7 500 independently owned outlets in 48 states.Story continuesPhillips66 is returning cash to investors. The board has restarted the company’s share repurchase program  which had $2.5 billion remaining under its existing authorization as of Mar. 31.The company also announced a 5% dividend increase in May. At the current share price  Phillips66 offers an annual dividend yield of 4.7%.Energy stocks have pulled back over the past month and Phillips66 was caught in the sell-off as well. However  the stock is still up 6% year to date – in stark contrast to the broad market’s double-digit decline.Wells Fargo analyst Michael Blum sees more upside on the horizon. Blum has an ‘overweight’ rating on Phillips66 and recently raised his price target from $114 to $127 — roughly 58% above where the stock sits today.Oil stock #2: TotalEnergies (TTE)TotalEnergies is an integrated energy company with operations in more than 130 countries around the world. While the company is known for being one of the oil supermajors  it also produces and markets biofuels  natural gas and green gases  renewables  and electricity.Business has been booming. In Q1  Total Energies generated $63.94 billion of revenue  representing a 65.5% increase year over year. Adjusted net income came in at $9.0 billion  which tripled the $3.0 billion earned in the year-ago period.TotalEnergies is a French company and its shares are listed on Euronext Paris. However  the company’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) trade on the New York Stock Exchange so it’s very convenient for U.S. investors to get a piece of the action.Analysts are optimistic about what’s in store for the company. Last month  Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint upgraded TotalEnergies from ‘market perform’ to ‘outperform.’ He has set a price target of €70 for the Paris-listed shares — implying a potential upside of 43%.What to read nextSign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.US is only a few days away from an ‘absolute explosion’ on inflation — here are 3 shockproof sectors to help protect your portfolio‘There’s always a bull market somewhere’: Jim Cramer’s famous words suggest you can make money no matter what.

Steady growth of revenue Following record revenues in Q1 2022 of €5.7 million  Median …,"SOPHIA ANTIPOLIS  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Median Technologies (ALMDT:PA) (Paris:ALMDT) today announces its business indicators for the first half of 2022.Steady growth of revenueFollowing record revenues in Q1 2022 of €5.7 million  Median Technologies continued its strong growth with Q2 2022 revenues of €7.0 million  which is a 43% increase versus Q2 2021 (€4.9 million). First half revenue stood at €12.7 million on June 30  2022  up 25% versus the same period year ago (€10.1 million). Revenues are generated entirely from the iCRO1 business  which provides services for image management in oncology trials to the biopharmaceutical industry worldwide.The order backlog totaled €60 million on June 30  2022  up 14.3% relative to June 30  2021 (€52.5 million). Median has overcome operational challenges caused by the lockdown in Shanghai region  especially with regards to handling tenders  which translated in a limited and temporary decrease of €2.2 million of the order backlog versus March 30th  2022. The growth of our business in China remains solid.On June 30  2022  cash and cash equivalents amounted to €28.2 million. The temporary closure of official administrative services in Shanghai delayed the invoicing process and the collection of customer receivables. The group estimates current delayed payments at €2.5 million. Since the end of the Shanghai lockdown  relations between Median Technologies and official administrative services are gradually recovering their normal course and the company expects the payment delays to be caught up during Q3 2022.“The growth momentum of our business continued during the second quarter of 2022  with record quarterly revenues  up 43% versus the same period year ago. Our affiliate in China overcame the challenge of the lockdown in Shanghai region and expectations for the year remain unchanged”  indicated Fredrik Brag  CEO and founder of Median Technologies.Median confirms its objective to obtain marketing approval in Q4 2023 for its Software as Medical Device iBiopsy® LCS CADe/CADxIn March 2022  the company announced outstanding performances for the combined malignant/benign detection and characterization capabilities of its iBiopsy® LCS CADe/CADx2 software as medical device based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies (press release of March 22). The excellent performance of iBiopsy® LCS CADe/CADx in terms of sensitivity and specificity could open new perspectives for the early diagnosis of lung cancer and the implementation of massive screening programs for this cancer  which is currently the most deadly in the world. Moreover  these results come at a time when the pharmaceutical industry is heavily investing to position new drug candidates on early stages of the disease.Simultaneously  Median Technologies has initiated discussions with the FDA in preparation for the launch of the iBiopsy® LCS CADe/CADx pivotal study at the end of 2022: following the FDA's response to its 513(g) filing  Median will proceed with a 510k submission to file for marketing approval with the FDA for its iBiopsy® LCS CADe/CADx software as medical device. Median Technologies also initiated a Q-submission process on May 2  with the aim of obtaining the FDA's opinion on several elements including the pivotal trial protocols and potential predicates. This process will continue through the third quarter of 2022.The significant advancements of the second quarter  allow Median to confirm its objective of obtaining marketing authorization on the US market in Q4 2023 for its Software as Medical Device iBiopsy® LCS CADe/CADx.New synergies between the iCRO and iBiopsy® activitiesDuring ASCO annual conference  Median Technologies announced the creation of Imaging Lab  a new and highly differentiated iCRO entity focused on leveraging AI  data mining and radiomics technologies to exploit imaging data for oncology clinical trials.

(NASDAQ: QCOM) are planning to take 5G out of this world and across a network of Earth-orbiting satellites.After having each conducted detailed research  which included multiple studies and simulations  the parties plan to enter smartphone-use-case-focused testing and validation of 5G non-terrestrial networks (5G NTN).The result could effectively mean that a future 5G smartphone could use 5G connectivity anywhere on Earth and provide complete global coverage for wideband data services  including places normally only covered by legacy satellite phone systems with limited data connectivity capabilities.The benefits of 5G connectivity via low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are expected to include coverage in extreme geographies or remote areas across seas  oceans and other locations where terrestrial coverage is absent.Such widespread connectivity would boost 5G smartphone subscriber roaming service capabilities  as well as enabling global connectivity for transportation  energy and health sector 5G use cases.The space-based network could also be used as back-up support to terrestrial networks in the event of major network outages or disasters.The expected security capabilities of 5G NTNs mean that national government communications may be a main use case  to enhance safe and secure national security and public safety government networks.Erik Ekudden  Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer  Ericsson  says: “This testing and validation cooperation between Ericsson  Thales and Qualcomm Technologies will be a major milestone in the history of communications as the ultimate result could effectively mean that no matter where you are on Earth – in the middle of an ocean or the remotest forest – high-end  secure and cost-effective connectivity will be available through collaborative 5G satellite and terrestrial connectivity.”John Smee  senior vice president of engineering  Qualcomm Technologies  Inc.  says: “For 5G to fulfill on the promise of ubiquitous connectivity  it is imperative that it can also deliver network coverage in areas where terrestrial cellular networks do not exist  whether that be over oceans or in remote areas. Our planned research with Ericsson and Thales will kick off an important step in making this vital technology a reality. We are looking forward to what this collaboration can accomplish.”Philippe Keryer  Executive Vice-President  Strategy  Research and Technology  Thales  says:“The deployment of 5G networks marks a step change for the telecoms industry. It is a game changer  not only in terms of business opportunities but also in the skills required to connect and protect billions of people and things. Thales is deeply involved in it through the different activities of the Group. The research collaboration with Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies will demonstrate the belief of our companies that 5G non-terrestrial Networks will contribute to this revolution and will take network resiliency and security to the next level. “The CooperationThe testing and validation by Ericsson  Thales and Qualcomm Technologies following the March 2022 go-ahead by 3GPP – the global telecommunications standards’ body – is intended to support non-terrestrial networks for the first time.The goal of the testing will be to validate various technology components needed to enable 5G non-terrestrial networks  including a 5G smartphone  satellite payload and 5G network pieces on the ground.This work also aims to validate that 5G NTN can be supported in a smartphone form factor allowing tomorrow’s 5G smartphone to effectively become a satellite-phone. Initial tests will take place in an emulated space environment in France  where the majority of European space-focused industry is based.Ericsson plans to verify a 5G virtual RAN (vRAN) stack  modified to handle radio signals propagating (what happens to 5G radio waves travelling through the vacuum of space and the Earth’s atmosphere) via the fast-moving LEO satellites.Thales plans to verify a 5G radio satellite payload suitable for deployment on LEO satellites  while Qualcomm Technologies plans to provide test phones verifying that 5G NTN can be accessed by future 5G smartphones.Experts will use ground-based equipment to emulate the 5G radio propagation and time delays between an equipped satellite in orbit and connecting a 5G smartphone with the 5G radio access network at different places on the Earth’s surface.Ekudden adds: “While it is too early to say when any resulting 5G equipped prototype satellite could be launched into orbit for real operational use  the highly technical ground-based testing and validation work planned between Ericsson  Thales and Qualcomm Technologies is key to making it happen.”As a 3GPP-backed technology  5G NTNs will be able to capitalize on a large ecosystem of standardized products and components. The new specification also enables the inclusion of NTN technologies in 5G devices  providing opportunities for technology vendors to easily and quickly scale 5G NTN compatibility across devices.NOTES TO EDITORS:FOLLOW US:Subscribe to Ericsson press releases hereSubscribe to Ericsson blog posts herehttps://www.twitter.com/ericssonhttps://www.facebook.com/ericssonhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/ericssonMORE INFORMATION AT:Ericsson Newsroommedia.relations@ericsson.com (+46 10 719 69 92)investor.relations@ericsson.com (+46 10 719 00 00)ABOUT ERICSSON:Ericsson enables communications service providers to capture the full value of connectivity.

7621,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2022/07/11/irish-lobbyist-emerges-as-whistleblower-behind-leaked-uber-files/,Irish lobbyist Mark MacGann emerges as whistleblower behind leaked Uber files,Longford-born Mark MacGann says he is speaking out as firm knowingly flouted laws in some countries,Irishman Mark MacGann  who has turned whistleblower over the Uber's failure to act over threats to his safety when he worked for US cab-hailing firm between 2014 and 2016. Photograph David Levene/The GuardianIrish lobbyist Mark MacGann has emerged as the whistleblower behind the leaking of internal files at US cab-hailing firm Uber  which reveal details of high-level lobbying of Irish and other EU governments.MacGann  a 52-year-old career lobbyist who was born in Longford and raised in Roscommon  worked for the California-based technology company between 2014 and 2016  serving as its chief lobbyist for Europe  the Middle East and Africa.The former Uber executive left Ireland in the late 1980s and has worked as a lobbyist for technology  telecoms  stock market companies and PR firms for the past three decades. He oversaw Uber’s government relations and lobbying in more than 40 countries  managing the firm’s global expansion as it moved its business into Europe and sought to force local laws to be rewritten and to break down entry barriers to challenge local taxi industries.Known as The Uber Files  the 124 000 records were leaked by MacGann to The Guardian  the UK newspaper  and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and 40 media partners  including The Irish Times  the BBC and the Washington Post.The leaked records show that MacGann was heavily involved in Uber’s efforts to put pressure on Irish government ministers  senior officials and State agencies between 2014 and 2016 as it tried but ultimately failed to push the National Transport Authority  the regulator for the taxi industry  to loosen regulations to permit the company’s car-sharing business model.As the public face of Uber in Europe  MacGann  who was based in Brussels when he worked for Uber  became a target of anti-Uber campaigns and at times violent protests by the established taxi industry. The threats were so significant that Uber assigned him a team of bodyguards in 2015 to accompany him around Belgium and security on foreign trips.[ Fine Gael used Uber text in 2016 election manifesto  US firm claimed in leaked files ][ The Uber Files: How the US multinational tried to squeeze the Irish government ]He says he has chosen to become a whistleblower and disclose Uber’s practices because he claims Uber’s senior executives knowingly flouted laws in dozens of countries and “sold people a lie” about the economic benefits to drivers of the company’s gig economy model.MacGann has acknowledged that he was part of Uber’s senior management team at the time of the activities and shared some responsibility for the practices. His decision to go public with details of the practices he was involved in within Uber is partly driven by remorse.The Irishman has revealed the motivations behind his decision to turn whistleblower in an interview with The Guardian newspaper. MacGann said he held Uber responsible for the threats he faced from taxi protesters across Europe because “the company didn’t change the way it behaved”.“Its response to violence against one of its senior executives was to give the guy bodyguards. There was no change in behaviour. No change in tactics. No change in tone. It was  keep the fight  keep the fire burning ” he told The Guardian.He condemned the strategy pursued by Uber’s former chief executive Travis Kalanick who responded to strikes by taxi drivers by ordering counter-protests in European cities. In internal emails  he dismissed concerns from Uber executives that this could result in attacks on Uber drivers  saying: “I think it’s worth it. Violence guarantee[s] success.”MacGann said that he thought Kalanick meant that “the only way to get governments to change the rules and legalise Uber and allow Uber to grow  as Uber wishes  would be to keep the right  to keep the controversy burning.”The Irishman said he ultimately resigned because he could have no effect on changing the culture of the company and was worried about his safety and that of his family and friends.“This was not a culture where you could actually stand up and question the company’s decisions or the company’s strategy  or the company’s practices ” he said. “So ultimately I realised that I was having no impact  that I was wasting my time with the company and that feeling.”MacGann said he could not have a clear conscience if he did not “stand up and own” his role at Uber in telling governments and officials that they should change the rules because drivers and others were going to benefit when  in fact  Uber had “actually sold people a lie”.“It’s about making amends. It’s about doing the right thing ” he said.“Look I own what I did  but if it turns out that what I was trying to persuade governments  ministers  prime ministers  presidents and drivers turned out to be horribly  horribly wrong and untrue  then it’s incumbent upon me to go back and say: ‘I think we made a mistake’.“And I think  to the extent that people want me to help  I want to play a role in trying to correct that mistake.”MacGann experienced first-hand the angry reaction that Uber’s entry into long-established taxi markets could bring. In Rome  after meeting an adviser to the Italian prime minister  he said he and a colleague were blocked in their limousine and treated like “the enemy”.“This is something I’d never encountered. And the anger and hatred that I witnessed first-hand  I don’t hold it against those people who were doing it ” he said. “Here’s a company that was willing to destroy their livelihoods  so they needed somebody to be angry at. They needed someone to shout at it. They needed someone to shout at. They needed someone to intimidate  somebody to threaten. I became that person.”[ The Uber Files timeline: How the company lobbied the Irish government to approve its business model ][ How Uber lobbied the world’s political elite to try and get its way ]During the unrest over Uber’s entry into the Belgian market  MacGann found himself cornered by angry taxi drivers while in an Uber car in 2017 at a Brussels train station.For MacGann  the frenetic period of lobbying for Uber  from 2015 to 2017  marked a rare return to Ireland in what was a high-profile international career for the Irishman.MacGann was born on April 1st  1970 in Longford but grew up on the other side of the river Shannon in Ballyleague  Co Roscommon. He was one of five sons born to Harry and Patricia McGann (the rest of his family spells their surname “McGann”). He told an Irish business journalist in 2016 that he left Ireland “with the last exodus of geese in 1987 ” departing the country in the last big wave of emigration before the boom years of the Celtic Tiger.He studied economics and politics at Kingston University in London and the Institut d’Etudes Politiques in Grenoble  France from 1987 to 1993.He began his career as an adviser to the president of the Rhone-Alpes region in southeast France where he was responsible for attracting European structuring funding and private investment to the region. He later worked as a consultant for advertising agency Euro RSCG in Paris focusing on communications and media aspects of privatisation in France.In the late 1990s  he worked for French telecoms company Alcatel where he was director of European affairs during the deregulation of telecoms in Europe.He worked for lobbying and public relations firms Brunswick  out of the firm’s offices in London  Paris and New York  and later for Weber Shandwick in the 2000s.During that decade  he was also director general of Digital Europe  a trade association that lobbied for companies such as Apple  Microsoft and Sony.In 2010  he joined NYSE Euronext  the world’s largest stock exchange operator that runs the New York Stock Exchange  as its chief European lobbyist  leading its government affairs and public advocacy team out of Brussels. He spent four years with the company.He joined Uber in 2014  taking a significant pay cut to €160 000 a year but was lured to the company with the promise of stock options that were potentially worth millions of euro.He officially left his staff role at Uber on February 12th  2016  but remained with the company as senior adviser to its board until August 2016 and was paid €40 000 a month.MacGann reached an out-of-court settlement with Uber in recent months relating to a legal dispute over pay  the terms of which prevent him speaking about it publicly.Since leaving Uber  he has set up a consultancy business  Moonshot Strategies  near his home in Longford  with older brother  Tom  an engineer  serving as a fellow director.MacGann’s high-profile role at Uber brought into close contact with high-ranking political figures. He grew to know Emmanuel Macron  a close ally of Uber  during his time as France’s economy minister before he became French president in 2017. He helped Macron with his campaign and made contributions of €15 000 to his presidential campaign in 2016 and 2017.He was a regular at the World Economic Forum in Davos  mixing with prominent figures from the corporate  political and celebrity worlds  often acting as a minder for Kalanick.MacGann told the Guardian that it was “unprecedented” during his career to have “such easy access” to heads and members of governments and heads of state.“It was intoxicating ” he said. At the time  Uber was “the hottest ticket in town” in the tech world and in the wider business world  he said. “Both on the investor side and also on the political side  people were almost falling over themselves in order to meet with Uber and to hear what we had to offer.”,negative,0.03,0.25,0.72,mixed,0.05,0.09,0.86,True,English,"['Irish lobbyist', 'Mark MacGann', 'Uber files', 'whistleblower', 'Photograph David Levene', 'stock market companies', 'past three decades', 'National Transport Authority', 'gig economy model', 'former chief executive', '52-year-old career lobbyist', 'car-sharing business model', 'US cab-hailing firm', 'local taxi industries', 'other EU governments', 'former Uber executive', 'senior management team', 'The Guardian newspaper', 'The Irish Times', 'Irish government ministers', 'California-based technology company', 'Irishman Mark MacGann', 'The Uber Files', 'The Irishman', 'US firm', 'chief lobbyist', 'UK newspaper', 'US multinational', 'government relations', 'internal files', 'senior executives', 'Irish lobbyist', 'taxi industry', 'taxi protesters', 'Middle East', 'late 1980s', 'PR firms', 'global expansion', 'local laws', 'entry barriers', 'International Consortium', 'Investigative Journalists', '40 media partners', 'Washington Post', 'State agencies', 'public face', 'anti-Uber campaigns', 'violent protests', 'foreign trips', 'Fine Gael', '2016 election manifesto', 'economic benefits', 'European cities', 'internal emails', 'clear conscience', 'right thing', 'prime ministers', 'hand t', 'senior officials', 'taxi drivers', 'high-level lobbying', 'guy bodyguards', 'Travis Kalanick', 'Uber text', 'Uber executives', 'Uber drivers', 'whistleblower', 'failure', 'threats', 'safety', 'leaking', 'details', 'Longford', 'Roscommon', 'Africa', 'Ireland', 'telecoms', '40 countries', '124,000 records', 'BBC', 'efforts', 'pressure', 'regulator', 'regulations', 'Brussels', 'target', 'Belgium', 'security', 'practices', 'dozens', 'people', 'lie', 'activities', 'responsibility', 'decision', 'remorse', 'motivations', 'interview', 'way', 'response', 'violence', 'change', 'behaviour', 'tactics', 'tone', 'fight', 'fire', 'strategy', 'strikes', 'counter-protests', 'concerns', 'attacks', 'success', 'rules', 'controversy', 'effect', 'culture', 'family', 'friends', 'impact', 'feeling', 'role', 'others', 'fact', 'amends', 'presidents', 'mistake', 'extent']",2022-07-11,2022-07-11,irishtimes.com

The Group's consolidated revenue stood at €35.5m  vs. €27.6m a year earlier. At constant scope and exchange rates  quarterly growth stood at +24%.Over H1 2022  revenue amounted to €63.3 million  vs. €50.8 million in H1 2021  an increase of €12.5m. This solid level reflects robust growth of +25% relative to H1 2021 and +20% relative to the H2 2021  which traditionally contributes more.At mid-year 2022  the group is therefore well ahead of its full-year target for revenue growth in 2022 to be at least equal to 2021 growth (+12%) and pushing towards +15%.Growth in all business lines  with Software & services up +47%The robust half-year performance was driven by growth in all the Group's business lines (Optical transport  Access and Software & services). In the wake of 2022  the Optical transport activity was particularly buoyant  with robust growth of +31% relative to H1 2021  thanks to the success of 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s WDM systems.Over the period  momentum in Access solution sales was also strong in all regions  with +21% growth compared to H1 2021.Driven by the success of SDN (Software Defined Networks) solutions  network functions virtualization (VNFs – Virtual Network Functions)  Services activity  including the contribution of SixSq's activities  revenue generated by sales of software and services  which constitute a factor for improving profitability  jumped by +47%  representing 15% of H1 revenues.Revenues up +29% in France and strong sales momentum in international business  including +48% in North AmericaInternational sales momentum was upbeat over H1 2022  with revenue up +22% and strong growth in all regions. International business accounted for 65% of total revenue over H1 2021 (vs 67% a year earlier).Business volumes totaled €12.8 million in North America  representing strong growth of +48% relative to H1 2021 (+33% in US dollar)  driven by demand for Optical transport equipment. Ekinops reached  for the first time  20% of its revenue in North America in H1 2022 (vs. 17% in the previous year).At mid-year  EMEA (Europe  excl. France  Middle-East and Africa)  which accounts for 38% of business  generated revenue of €24.3 million  up +6% relative to H1 of the previous year.After two years of business severely impacted by the pandemic  Asia-Pacific was able to restore growth in H2 2021. This growth trajectory continued in H1 2022 with a very sustained +80% increase in half-year sales. This performance was driven by strong traction in Access solutions  notably with an Australian Tier 1 operator entering the group's Top 10 customers. Asia-Pacific region accounted for 7% of Ekinops' total business activity in H1 2022 (vs 5% one year prior).After virtually stable revenue in its domestic market in 2021 and until the first quarter of the year  Ekinops restored sharp growth in France in H1 2022. With robust sales momentum in both Optical transport and Access solutions  growth amounted to +29% in France compared to H1 2021. Ekinops recorded 35% of its half-year sales in France.FY 2022 guidance fully confirmed at mid-yearAfter a particularly dynamic Q1 (+20%)  Ekinops continued its sustained growth trajectory in Q2 (+29%) with excellent order intake illustrating the Group's ability to capture investments from operators and enterprises  as well as the relevance of its solutions for their needs in this difficult economic context.However  Ekinops remains vigilant regarding the components' crisis  which is set to continue over 2022 and remain very present in coming quarters. To date  however  it has not caused any major impact on the Group's business  which thanks to its control over its supply chain  is largely outperforming its market and competitors.At mid-year  Ekinops confirms its annual guidance:robust organic growth   at least equal to the 2021 level (+12%) and pushing towards +15%;  at least equal to the 2021 level (+12%) and pushing towards +15%; gross margin of between 52% and 56%  in line with its long-term ambitions and factoring in the potential impact of the supply chain crisis on electronic components;in line with its long-term ambitions and factoring in the potential impact of the supply chain crisis on electronic components; EBITDA margin between 14% and 18%  integrating human and technological investments to execute the new growth plan.At the same time  Ekinops remains particularly active on the external growth front  continuing to explore all acquisitions opportunities that could create value for the company.Didier Brédy  Chairman and CEO of Ekinops  stated:""After a dynamic 2021 for Ekinops  this beginning of 2022 is marked by a clear acceleration in demand growth.Illustrating this dynamism  all our business lines show strong growth  with strong traction in our Optical transport solutions  particularly in North America. This momentum puts us ahead of our target set at the time of the OTN technology acquisition in 2019  namely  to triple our sales over 5 years for this business line.Beyond the excellent growth in sales  my greatest satisfaction is the tremendously positive feedback from our largest customers regarding our ability to deliver on schedule while the unprecedented components crisis is raging. From the beginning of the Covid crisis  we have chosen to use our balance sheet to increase our inventory  to buy certain risky components 12 to 18 months in advance  while we would buy those 6 months ahead before the crisis. These choices have proven to be right ones as they generate goodwill from our customers and allow us to win market share.""2022 financial calendarDate Release July 28  2022 H1 2022 results October 11  2022 Q3 2021 revenue January 11  2023 FY 2022 revenue March 7  2023 2022 annual resultsAll press releases are published after Euronext Paris markets close.EKINOPS ContactDidier BrédyChairman and CEO[email protected]InvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92[email protected]PressAmaury DugastPress relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 74[email protected]About EkinopsSOURCE Ekinops",neutral,0.16,0.8,0.03,mixed,0.43,0.28,0.29,True,English,"['record H1 revenue', 'Ekinops', 'Software Defined Networks) solutions', 'network functions virtualization', 'Virtual Network Functions', 'Australian Tier 1 operator', 'excellent order intake', 'difficult economic context', 'Didier Brédy', 'Optical transport equipment', 'supply chain crisis', 'Optical transport activity', 'external growth front', 'Optical transport solutions', 'Access solution sales', 'robust organic growth', 'new growth plan', 'robust sales momentum', 'total business activity', 'International sales momentum', 'robust half-year performance', 'sustained growth trajectory', 'strong sales momentum', 'half-year sales', ""components' crisis"", 'new peak', 'robust growth', 'Access solutions', 'strong traction', 'international business', 'constant scope', 'exchange rates', 'full-year target', 'WDM systems', 'North America', 'total revenue', 'US dollar', 'two years', 'sustained +80% increase', 'Top 10 customers', 'first quarter', 'FY 2022 guidance', 'coming quarters', 'major impact', 'annual guidance', 'gross margin', 'long-term ambitions', 'potential impact', 'electronic components', 'EBITDA margin', 'acquisitions opportunities', 'target set', 'OTN techno', 'strong growth', 'Services activity', 'quarterly growth', 'sharp growth', 'business lines', 'Business volumes', 'first time', 'previous year', 'same time', 'consolidated revenue', 'Asia-Pacific region', 'stable revenue', 'domestic market', 'dynamic Q1', 'technological investments', 'clear acceleration', 'solid level', 'revenue growth', 'demand growth', 'The Group', 'Q2 2022 revenue', 'H1 revenues', '2021 growth', '+21% growth', '2021 level', 'SixSq', 'November', 'Ekinops', 'H2', 'mid-year', 'wake', 'success', '200 Gb/s', '400 Gb', 'period', 'regions', 'SDN', 'VNFs', 'contribution', 'activities', 'factor', 'profitability', 'France', 'EMEA', 'Europe', 'Middle-East', 'Africa', 'pandemic', 'operators', 'enterprises', 'relevance', 'needs', 'control', 'competitors', 'human', 'value', 'company', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'beginning', 'dynamism']",2022-07-11,2022-07-11,prnewswire.com

(NASDAQ: QCOM) are planning to take 5G out of this world and across a network of Earth-orbiting satellites.After having each conducted detailed research  which included multiple studies and simulations  the parties plan to enter smartphone-use-case-focused testing and validation of 5G non-terrestrial networks (5G NTN).The result could effectively mean that a future 5G smartphone could use 5G connectivity anywhere on Earth and provide complete global coverage for wideband data services  including places normally only covered by legacy satellite phone systems with limited data connectivity capabilities.The benefits of 5G connectivity via low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are expected to include coverage in extreme geographies or remote areas across seas  oceans and other locations where terrestrial coverage is absent.Such widespread connectivity would boost 5G smartphone subscriber roaming service capabilities  as well as enabling global connectivity for transportation  energy and health sector 5G use cases.The space-based network could also be used as back-up support to terrestrial networks in the event of major network outages or disasters.The expected security capabilities of 5G NTNs mean that national government communications may be a main use case  to enhance safe and secure national security and public safety government networks.Erik Ekudden  Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer  Ericsson  says: ""This testing and validation cooperation between Ericsson  Thales and Qualcomm Technologies will be a major milestone in the history of communications as the ultimate result could effectively mean that no matter where you are on Earth - in the middle of an ocean or the remotest forest - high-end  secure and cost-effective connectivity will be available through collaborative 5G satellite and terrestrial connectivity.""John Smee  senior vice president of engineering  Qualcomm Technologies  Inc.  says: ""For 5G to fulfill on the promise of ubiquitous connectivity  it is imperative that it can also deliver network coverage in areas where terrestrial cellular networks do not exist  whether that be over oceans or in remote areas. Our planned research with Ericsson and Thales will kick off an important step in making this vital technology a reality. We are looking forward to what this collaboration can accomplish.""Philippe Keryer  Executive Vice-President  Strategy  Research and Technology  Thales  says:""The deployment of 5G networks marks a step change for the telecoms industry. It is a game changer  not only in terms of business opportunities but also in the skills required to connect and protect billions of people and things. Thales is deeply involved in it through the different activities of the Group. The research collaboration with Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies will demonstrate the belief of our companies that 5G non-terrestrial Networks will contribute to this revolution and will take network resiliency and security to the next level. ""The CooperationThe testing and validation by Ericsson  Thales and Qualcomm Technologies following the March 2022 go-ahead by 3GPP - the global telecommunications standards' body - is intended to support non-terrestrial networks for the first time.The goal of the testing will be to validate various technology components needed to enable 5G non-terrestrial networks  including a 5G smartphone  satellite payload and 5G network pieces on the ground.This work also aims to validate that 5G NTN can be supported in a smartphone form factor allowing tomorrow's 5G smartphone to effectively become a satellite-phone. Initial tests will take place in an emulated space environment in France  where the majority of European space-focused industry is based.Ericsson plans to verify a 5G virtual RAN (vRAN) stack  modified to handle radio signals propagating (what happens to 5G radio waves travelling through the vacuum of space and the Earth's atmosphere) via the fast-moving LEO satellites.Thales plans to verify a 5G radio satellite payload suitable for deployment on LEO satellites  while Qualcomm Technologies plans to provide test phones verifying that 5G NTN can be accessed by future 5G smartphones.Experts will use ground-based equipment to emulate the 5G radio propagation and time delays between an equipped satellite in orbit and connecting a 5G smartphone with the 5G radio access network at different places on the Earth's surface.Ekudden adds: ""While it is too early to say when any resulting 5G equipped prototype satellite could be launched into orbit for real operational use  the highly technical ground-based testing and validation work planned between Ericsson  Thales and Qualcomm Technologies is key to making it happen.""As a 3GPP-backed technology  5G NTNs will be able to capitalize on a large ecosystem of standardized products and components. The new specification also enables the inclusion of NTN technologies in 5G devices  providing opportunities for technology vendors to easily and quickly scale 5G NTN compatibility across devices.FOLLOW US:Subscribe to Ericsson press releases hereSubscribe to Ericsson blog posts herehttps://www.twitter.com/ericssonhttps://www.facebook.com/ericssonhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/ericssonMORE INFORMATION AT:Ericsson Newsroom[email protected] (+46 10 719 69 92)[email protected] (+46 10 719 00 00)ABOUT ERICSSON:Ericsson enables communications service providers to capture the full value of connectivity.

(NASDAQ: QCOM) are planning to take 5G out of this world and across a network of Earth-orbiting satellites.After having each conducted detailed research  which included multiple studies and simulations  the parties plan to enter smartphone-use-case-focused testing and validation of 5G non-terrestrial networks (5G NTN).The result could effectively mean that a future 5G smartphone could use 5G connectivity anywhere on Earth and provide complete global coverage for wideband data services  including places normally only covered by legacy satellite phone systems with limited data connectivity capabilities.The benefits of 5G connectivity via low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are expected to include coverage in extreme geographies or remote areas across seas  oceans and other locations where terrestrial coverage is absent.Such widespread connectivity would boost 5G smartphone subscriber roaming service capabilities  as well as enabling global connectivity for transportation  energy and health sector 5G use cases.The space-based network could also be used as back-up support to terrestrial networks in the event of major network outages or disasters.The expected security capabilities of 5G NTNs mean that national government communications may be a main use case  to enhance safe and secure national security and public safety government networks.Erik Ekudden  Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer  Ericsson  says: ""This testing and validation cooperation between Ericsson  Thales and Qualcomm Technologies will be a major milestone in the history of communications as the ultimate result could effectively mean that no matter where you are on Earth - in the middle of an ocean or the remotest forest - high-end  secure and cost-effective connectivity will be available through collaborative 5G satellite and terrestrial connectivity.""John Smee  senior vice president of engineering  Qualcomm Technologies  Inc.  says: ""For 5G to fulfill on the promise of ubiquitous connectivity  it is imperative that it can also deliver network coverage in areas where terrestrial cellular networks do not exist  whether that be over oceans or in remote areas. Our planned research with Ericsson and Thales will kick off an important step in making this vital technology a reality. We are looking forward to what this collaboration can accomplish.""Philippe Keryer  Executive Vice-President  Strategy  Research and Technology  Thales  says:""The deployment of 5G networks marks a step change for the telecoms industry. It is a game changer  not only in terms of business opportunities but also in the skills required to connect and protect billions of people and things. Thales is deeply involved in it through the different activities of the Group. The research collaboration with Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies will demonstrate the belief of our companies that 5G non-terrestrial Networks will contribute to this revolution and will take network resiliency and security to the next level. ""The CooperationThe testing and validation by Ericsson  Thales and Qualcomm Technologies following the March 2022 go-ahead by 3GPP - the global telecommunications standards' body - is intended to support non-terrestrial networks for the first time.The goal of the testing will be to validate various technology components needed to enable 5G non-terrestrial networks  including a 5G smartphone  satellite payload and 5G network pieces on the ground.This work also aims to validate that 5G NTN can be supported in a smartphone form factor allowing tomorrow's 5G smartphone to effectively become a satellite-phone. Initial tests will take place in an emulated space environment in France  where the majority of European space-focused industry is based.Ericsson plans to verify a 5G virtual RAN (vRAN) stack  modified to handle radio signals propagating (what happens to 5G radio waves travelling through the vacuum of space and the Earth's atmosphere) via the fast-moving LEO satellites.Thales plans to verify a 5G radio satellite payload suitable for deployment on LEO satellites  while Qualcomm Technologies plans to provide test phones verifying that 5G NTN can be accessed by future 5G smartphones.Experts will use ground-based equipment to emulate the 5G radio propagation and time delays between an equipped satellite in orbit and connecting a 5G smartphone with the 5G radio access network at different places on the Earth's surface.Ekudden adds: ""While it is too early to say when any resulting 5G equipped prototype satellite could be launched into orbit for real operational use  the highly technical ground-based testing and validation work planned between Ericsson  Thales and Qualcomm Technologies is key to making it happen.""As a 3GPP-backed technology  5G NTNs will be able to capitalize on a large ecosystem of standardized products and components. The new specification also enables the inclusion of NTN technologies in 5G devices  providing opportunities for technology vendors to easily and quickly scale 5G NTN compatibility across devices.FOLLOW US:Subscribe to Ericsson press releases hereSubscribe to Ericsson blog posts herehttps://www.twitter.com/ericssonhttps://www.facebook.com/ericssonhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/ericssonMORE INFORMATION AT:Ericsson Newsroommedia.relations@ericsson.com (+46 10 719 69 92)investor.relations@ericsson.com (+46 10 719 00 00)ABOUT ERICSSON:Ericsson enables communications service providers to capture the full value of connectivity.

The Group's consolidated revenue stood at €35.5m  vs. €27.6m a year earlier. At constant scope and exchange rates  quarterly growth stood at +24%.Over H1 2022  revenue amounted to €63.3 million  vs. €50.8 million in H1 2021  an increase of €12.5m. This solid level reflects robust growth of +25% relative to H1 2021 and +20% relative to the H2 2021  which traditionally contributes more.At mid-year 2022  the group is therefore well ahead of its full-year target for revenue growth in 2022 to be at least equal to 2021 growth (+12%) and pushing towards +15%.Growth in all business lines  with Software & services up +47%The robust half-year performance was driven by growth in all the Group's business lines (Optical transport  Access and Software & services). In the wake of 2022  the Optical transport activity was particularly buoyant  with robust growth of +31% relative to H1 2021  thanks to the success of 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s WDM systems.Over the period  momentum in Access solution sales was also strong in all regions  with +21% growth compared to H1 2021.Driven by the success of SDN (Software Defined Networks) solutions  network functions virtualization (VNFs – Virtual Network Functions)  Services activity  including the contribution of SixSq's activities  revenue generated by sales of software and services  which constitute a factor for improving profitability  jumped by +47%  representing 15% of H1 revenues.Revenues up +29% in France and strong sales momentum in international business  including +48% in North AmericaInternational sales momentum was upbeat over H1 2022  with revenue up +22% and strong growth in all regions. International business accounted for 65% of total revenue over H1 2021 (vs 67% a year earlier).Business volumes totaled €12.8 million in North America  representing strong growth of +48% relative to H1 2021 (+33% in US dollar)  driven by demand for Optical transport equipment. Ekinops reached  for the first time  20% of its revenue in North America in H1 2022 (vs. 17% in the previous year).At mid-year  EMEA (Europe  excl. France  Middle-East and Africa)  which accounts for 38% of business  generated revenue of €24.3 million  up +6% relative to H1 of the previous year.After two years of business severely impacted by the pandemic  Asia-Pacific was able to restore growth in H2 2021. This growth trajectory continued in H1 2022 with a very sustained +80% increase in half-year sales. This performance was driven by strong traction in Access solutions  notably with an Australian Tier 1 operator entering the group's Top 10 customers. Asia-Pacific region accounted for 7% of Ekinops' total business activity in H1 2022 (vs 5% one year prior).After virtually stable revenue in its domestic market in 2021 and until the first quarter of the year  Ekinops restored sharp growth in France in H1 2022. With robust sales momentum in both Optical transport and Access solutions  growth amounted to +29% in France compared to H1 2021. Ekinops recorded 35% of its half-year sales in France.FY 2022 guidance fully confirmed at mid-yearAfter a particularly dynamic Q1 (+20%)  Ekinops continued its sustained growth trajectory in Q2 (+29%) with excellent order intake illustrating the Group's ability to capture investments from operators and enterprises  as well as the relevance of its solutions for their needs in this difficult economic context.However  Ekinops remains vigilant regarding the components' crisis  which is set to continue over 2022 and remain very present in coming quarters. To date  however  it has not caused any major impact on the Group's business  which thanks to its control over its supply chain  is largely outperforming its market and competitors.At mid-year  Ekinops confirms its annual guidance:robust organic growth   at least equal to the 2021 level (+12%) and pushing towards +15%;gross margin of between 52% and 56%  in line with its long-term ambitions and factoring in the potential impact of the supply chain crisis on electronic components;EBITDA margin between 14% and 18%  integrating human and technological investments to execute the new growth plan.At the same time  Ekinops remains particularly active on the external growth front  continuing to explore all acquisitions opportunities that could create value for the company.Didier Brédy  Chairman and CEO of Ekinops  stated:""After a dynamic 2021 for Ekinops  this beginning of 2022 is marked by a clear acceleration in demand growth.Illustrating this dynamism  all our business lines show strong growth  with strong traction in our Optical transport solutions  particularly in North America. This momentum puts us ahead of our target set at the time of the OTN technology acquisition in 2019  namely  to triple our sales over 5 years for this business line.Beyond the excellent growth in sales  my greatest satisfaction is the tremendously positive feedback from our largest customers regarding our ability to deliver on schedule while the unprecedented components crisis is raging. From the beginning of the Covid crisis  we have chosen to use our balance sheet to increase our inventory  to buy certain risky components 12 to 18 months in advance  while we would buy those 6 months ahead before the crisis. These choices have proven to be right ones as they generate goodwill from our customers and allow us to win market share.""2022 financial calendarDate Release July 28  2022 H1 2022 results October 11  2022 Q3 2021 revenue January 11  2023 FY 2022 revenue March 7  2023 2022 annual resultsAll press releases are published after Euronext Paris markets close.EKINOPS ContactDidier BrédyChairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frPressAmaury DugastPress relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 74adugast@actus.frEkinops Logo (PRNewsfoto/Ekinops) (PRNewswire)View original content to download multimedia:SOURCE Ekinops",neutral,0.16,0.8,0.03,mixed,0.42,0.26,0.32,True,English,"['record H1 revenue', 'Ekinops', 'Software Defined Networks) solutions', ""Ekinops' total business activity"", 'network functions virtualization', 'Virtual Network Functions', 'Australian Tier 1 operator', 'excellent order intake', 'difficult economic context', 'Didier Brédy', 'Optical transport activity', 'Optical transport equipment', 'external growth front', 'robust sales momentum', 'supply chain crisis', 'Access solution sales', 'robust organic growth', 'new growth plan', 'International sales momentum', 'strong sales momentum', 'robust half-year performance', 'sustained growth trajectory', 'record H1 revenue', 'half-year sales', 'total revenue', 'new peak', ""components' crisis"", 'robust growth', 'Services activity', 'strong traction', 'international business', 'telecommunication solutions', 'Access solutions', 'strong growth', 'leading supplier', 'audited data', 'Change Change', 'constant scope', 'exchange rates', 'full-year target', 'WDM systems', 'North America', 'US dollar', 'first time', 'two years', 'sustained +80% increase', 'Top 10 customers', 'first quarter', 'FY 2022 guidance', 'dynamic Q1', 'coming quarters', 'major impact', 'annual guidance', 'gross margin', 'long-term ambitions', 'potential impact', 'electronic components', 'EBITDA margin', 'same time', 'acquisitions opportunities', 'business lines', 'Business volumes', 'quarterly growth', 'sharp growth', 'Q1 revenue', 'consolidated revenue', 'stable revenue', 'previous year', 'revenue growth', 'Q2 growth', 'Euronext Paris', 'telecom operators', 'solid level', 'Asia-Pacific region', 'domestic market', 'technological investments', 'Q2 2022 revenue', 'Q2 revenue', 'The Group', 'H1 revenues', '2021 growth', '+21% growth', '2021 level', 'H1 2021', 'PRNewswire', 'businesses', 'April', '30 June', 'IFRS', 'SixSq', 'November', 'Acceleration', 'H2', 'mid-year', 'wake', 'success', '200 Gb/s', '400 Gb', 'period', 'regions', 'SDN', 'VNFs', 'contribution', 'activities', 'factor', 'profitability', 'France', 'demand', 'EMEA', 'Europe', 'Middle-East', 'Africa', 'pandemic', 'enterprises', 'relevance', 'needs', 'control', 'competitors', 'human', 'value', 'company', 'Chairman', 'CEO']",2022-07-11,2022-07-11,uppermichiganssource.com

Maiz,"PARIS  July 11 (Reuters) - Euronext wheat turned lower on Monday after a near three-week high as Chicago futures retreated and traders awaited U.S. government crop forecasts.Maize on Euronext stayed in positive territory as a heatwave expected in southern France this week raised concerns about damage to pollinating maize crops.September wheat BL2U2 on Paris-based Euronext settled down 1.3% at 352.50 euros ($354.76) a tonne  after earlier rising to its highest since June 22 at 371.25 euros.Euronext wheat like other grain futures has rebounded sharply from multi-month lows struck last week  with brisk export demand helping counter supply pressure from harvesting and recession fears among investors. GRA/EUParis prices came under pressure as Chicago wheat Wv1 fell in U.S. trading  with participants partly adjusting ahead of monthly U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts on Tuesday. GRA/However  a 20-year low for the euro against the dollar underpinned Euronext by reinforcing early-season export prospects for European wheat.

GRAIN/SHP/FRIn barley  three vessels were scheduled to load for China  the first of the 2022/23 season that started this month.In Germany  traders remained optimistic about exports despite expectations that dry weather may curb harvest volumes.“I think there is still export demand for German and other EU wheat which still needs to be met for October-December shipment ” one German trader said.Sluggish Russian exports  attributed to logistics and difficulties in applying a modified export tax  were also favouring EU sales  traders said.However  the start of the Eid holiday in Muslim countries is likely to limit tender activity this week  traders added.Sellers of standard 12% protein wheat for September delivery in Hamburg were offering around 21 euros a tonne over the Euronext December contract BL2Z2 against 18 euros last week.In maize  new-crop November EMAX2 on Euronext settled up 2.1% at 313.25 euros a tonne  after earlier jumping to 320.25 euros.Intense heat is forecast to spread from Spain to part of France this week  including the key southwestern French maize belt where the absence of rain is expected to add to crop stress.""Flowering maize is going to be hurt by the heatwave "" a French trader said.
