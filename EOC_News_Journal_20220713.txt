The previously announced combination has now been unanimously approved by all the boards of both companies.The combined company will be named Frontline with Hugo De Stoop  the current CEO of Euronav  leading the group as its CEO. Lars H. Barstad  current CEO of Frontline  will hold a seat on the Board. The company will be incorporated and headquartered in Cyprus and will continue to operate from offices in Europe and Asia  including Belgium  Norway  UK  Singapore and Greece  and its shares will be listed on the Euronext Brussels  OSE and NYSE.The combined group will create a leading global independent oil tanker owner and operator “with the management  capabilities  resources and scale to successfully capitalise on the opportunities presented by the new era in the sustainable shipping industry ” the companies said in a joint press release. It’s fleet will consist of 146 vessels consisting of 68 VLCC  56 Suezmaxes  20 LR2/Aframax and 2 FSO vessels Norwegian billionaire John Fredriksen  the largest shareholder in Frontline and second biggest in Euronav  has offered his full support for the merger.“This transaction creates a clear market leader in the tanker market and will position the combined group for continued  sustainable shareholder value creation and the realisation of significant synergies ” said Fredriksen. “Frontline  with a fleet of 146 vessels  will be able to offer value enhancing services for our customers and increase fleet utilisation and revenues which will benefit all stakeholders.

Plus  there have been quite a few announcements during Q2 so let’s get started.In Belgium  the government there has drafted legislation to establish a framework to screen foreign direct investments. Part of that framework will be a new central body (the Screening Committee) that will deal with foreign investments representing more than 10% or 25% of the company's shares  depending on the area of investment. While no draft text is available  a 2023 effective date is expected. And if you’re following the UEFA tournament  Belgium tied with Iceland earning 1 point.ESMA published its Final Report on its review of the Short Selling Regulation (SSR).ESMA's proposals in the Final Report include:establish a centralized notification and publication system;publication of aggregated NSPs per issuer;publish the issued share capital of companies that are admitted to trading or traded in the EU and not included in the list of exempted shares;introduce a five-year record keeping obligation for persons entering a short sale;changes to the provisions which govern emergency measures  to facilitate the streamlining of issuing bans and standardizing the format of bans; andharmonizing the sanctions for breaches imposed across Member States.In Group D with the Belgians  the French have secured a win  earning them 3 points. On the regulatory front in May  the following French order (arrêté ministériel) came into effect lowering the disclosure threshold (in share capital or/and voting rights) to 90% from 95% when crossing (upwards or downwards) in a French issuer with shares admitted to trading on Euronext Growth.The government of Iceland is seeking comments regarding the enactment of a law on the review of foreign direct investment  particularly with regard to national security and public order. Coming on the heels of that consultation being issued  Iceland tied with Belgium in the Group D first round games.The Netherlands sit in Group C; the only Group that does not have a clear leader with all 4 teams earning 1 point in first round of play. While the Netherlands’ parliament adopted a framework (Dutch) for national security investment screening. The regime encompasses acquisitions of control related to 'critical infrastructure companies' (e.g. energy  ports  banking)  'managers of corporate campuses' (where public-private collaboration occurs involving technology of strategic importance) and 'sensitive technology' (military and dual-use). In the case of 'sensitive technology'  the regime also extends to acquiring significant influence and minority shareholdings of 10%  20% and 25% of the relevant entity.In April  Norway’s Ministry of Finance (MoF) proposed a draft bill (Norwegian only) amending the substantial shareholding disclosure rules in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act (STA). The draft is a step towards harmonizing Norway’s rules with the TDA adopted in 2015 by EU. It’s not clear when the Parliament will take up the draft  but we anticipate this to be in Q3 or Q4 this year with an effective date sometime later. Norway is currently at 1-1 in Group A sitting at 3rd place after the 2nd round of play.Recently  Poland’s government extended the temporary FDI measures first put in place during Covid-19 to now 60 months. These measures are now due to end on 25 July 2025.Earlier in June  the threshold for the mandatory offer requirement in Poland under the Act on Public Offerings was amended to 50% of voting rights with effect from 30 May 2022. If the 50% threshold is exceeded  a shareholder or an entity who acquired the shares indirectly is obliged to launch a mandatory offer for the sale or exchange of all the remaining shares in the public company.Fielding a strong side in Group B  Spain currently has 3 points and will play Germany today in 2nd round play to decide the Group’s leader. Circular 2/2022 was published in Spain’s Official Gazette on 8 June. The Circular provides an updated substantial shareholder notification form that has been modified to consider loyalty shares that grant double voting rights. While the forms have not taken effect yet  they are available in English and Spanish in the Circular along with explanatory notes. The Circular will enter into force on 6 August 2022 at which time we believe that the new disclosure forms will be available on the CNMV website.Switzerland may follow other EU nations by screening for foreign direct investment in Swiss companies on public policy or national security grounds. The Swiss government has opened a consultation for such matter and will run until 9 September 2022. While that is being decided  the Swiss women’s team will play Sweden tomorrow to see who will get the first 3 points in Group C.The host nation England has shown a strong performance through two rounds of play securing the leader position in Group A. They play Northern Ireland tomorrow who unfortunately will exit the tournament afterwards. Leaving the football world for a minute  there were several changes out of the United Kingdom starting with the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill introduced in the UK became an Act in April; as a result a new Register of Overseas Entities will be created. Any overseas entity must take reasonable steps to  amongst other things  identify any registrable beneficial owners (including persons holding 25% or more of the shares or voting rights  see also Schedule 2 of Act) in relation to the entity.Overseas entities who already own land in the UK will be given six months to register their beneficial owners or managing officers. This 6-month period will not begin until the new register has been launched.Also in the UK  Guernsey  Isle of Man  and Jersey the Takeover Panel released its response paper to its Consultation from 2021 which set out to codify its well-established practice that a custodian or depository is not treated as interested in relevant securities for the purposes of the Code. A new Note was introduced on the definition of “interests in securities” in the Code to make this clear. The amendments to the Code set out in the Response Statement came effective on 13 June 2022.Rounding out this quarter’s coverage is the release of PCP 2022/2 by the Takeover Panel for public comment. This consultation paper sets out several proposed amendments to the presumptions of the definition of ""acting in concert"" in the Takeover Code. Among the proposed changes is raising the threshold in what is currently presumption (1) of the definition of ""acting in concert"" (which relates to companies) from 20% to 30%  so as to align it with the threshold in the Code’s definition of ""control"". The comment period is open through 23 September 2022.That’s it for this Q2 foreign direct investment roundup but the UEFA Women’s Euro Tournament goes through to 31 July - so enjoy the games!",neutral,0.05,0.91,0.04,negative,0.01,0.21,0.77,True,English,"['Foreign Direct Investment Roundup', 'Anna Monteiro', 'Europe', 'Group D first round games', 'five-year record keeping obligation', 'arrêté ministériel', 'substantial shareholding disclosure rules', 'substantial shareholder notification form', 'foreign direct investment roundup', 'Norwegian Securities Trading Act', 'national security investment screening', 'new central body', 'national security grounds', 'foreign direct investments', 'Short Selling Regulation', 'critical infrastructure companies', 'temporary FDI measures', 'mandatory offer requirement', 'new disclosure forms', 'double voting rights', 'other EU nations', '2nd round play', 'foreign investments', 'Screening Committee', 'centralized notification', 'disclosure threshold', 'first 3 points', 'Group C', 'Group A', 'Group B', 'UEFA Women', '2023 effective date', 'Final Report', 'aggregated NSPs', 'share capital', 'short sale', 'emergency measures', 'Member States', 'regulatory front', 'Euronext Growth', 'public order', 'The Netherlands', 'corporate campuses', 'public-private collaboration', 'strategic importance', 'significant influence', 'minority shareholdings', 'Public Offerings', 'strong side', 'Official Gazette', 'explanatory notes', 'CNMV website', 'Swiss companies', 'public policy', 'Swiss women', 'host nation', 'strong performance', 'two rounds', 'Northern Ireland', 'Euro 2022 tournament', 'UEFA tournament', 'French order', 'clear leader', 'sensitive technology', 'leader position', 'draft text', 'publication system', 'Netherlands’ parliament', 'relevant entity', 'draft bill', '3rd place', 'public company', 'The Circular', 'remaining shares', 'loyalty shares', 'Swiss government', 'French issuer', '50% threshold', 'Wimbledon', 'region', 'announcements', 'Q2', 'Belgium', 'legislation', 'framework', 'Part', 'area', 'Iceland', '1 point', 'ESMA', 'review', 'SSR', 'proposals', 'list', 'persons', 'changes', 'provisions', 'streamlining', 'bans', 'format', 'sanctions', 'breaches', 'Belgians', 'win', 'May', 'comments', 'enactment', 'law', 'regard', 'heels', 'consultation', '4 teams', 'Dutch', 'regime', 'acquisitions', 'control', 'energy', 'ports', 'banking', 'managers', 'military', 'dual-use', 'case', 'April', 'Norway', 'Ministry', 'Finance', 'MoF', 'step', 'TDA', 'Q3', 'Q4', 'Poland', 'Covid-19', '60 months', '25 July', 'June', 'exchange', 'Spain', 'Germany', 'English', 'Spanish', 'force', '6 August', 'time', 'Switzerland', 'matter', '9 September', 'Sweden', 'England']",2022-07-12,2022-07-13,finextra.com
7681,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4522816-stellantis-superb-car-company-somewhat-problematic,Stellantis: Superb Car Company  Somewhat Problematic (NYSE:STLA),Stellantis (STLA) is the sixth-largest automotive maker in the entire world. Check out why I think there is an upside of nearly 50% in STLA stock at this price.,"Anthony Devlin/Getty Images EntertainmentAuthor's Note: This is the public version of an article posted on iREIT on Alpha on May 27th 2022.In this article  we'll take a look at Stellantis (NYSE:STLA). If you've never heard of the company and are wondering just what the heck it is - don't worry  you've not been living under a rock. This is a multinational automotive company that's less than 2 years old at the time of writing this article.However  it has bones almost as old as the industrial revolution - and its brands are known across the entire world.Let's get going.Stellantis - What is It?Stellantis N.V is the multinational automotive corporation founded in 2021  based on a 50/50 cross-border complete merger between what was once the Fiat Chrysler Automobile Conglomeratem and the French PSA Group.The company ultimately decided to become an N.V  meaning it's headquartered in the Netherlands  Amsterdam.The merger of these companies means that Stellantis is the sixth-largest automotive maker in the entire world.The list goes:Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY)Toyota (TM)Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi AllianceGeneral Motors (GM)Hyundai MotorsStellantisThe company has revenues of €150B+  a market cap of close to $50Bm and a high  well-covered sort of yield - though at this time  it's relatively complex to forecast and estimate how things will develop over the next couple of years. The company is BBB-rated  making it one of the lower-rated large automotive out there.The coupled operations of Stellantis contain the following car brands:AbarthAlfa RomeoChryslerCitroenDodgeDSFiatFiat ProfessionalJeepLanciaMaseratiMoparOpelPeugeotRamVauxhall/OpelThe company also now has 300 000 employees represented in 130 countries  with manufacturing in 30 countries  not including its suppliers. The company became through plans beginning in 2019  to create the fourth-largest automotive company on earth. The merger of FCA and PSA was approved in very early January and completed on the 16th of January 2021. The common shares of the company began trading natively on Milan and Euronext 2 days later  and on the NYSE a day after that  under the symbol STLA.Stellantis will never be seen on any of the cars. It's merely a corporate identifier  while group names and logos will remain unchanged. Stellantis went out of the gates running  with the CEO issuing a challenge for all brands to prove themselves within 10 years (2031) in order to justify new investments and technology. What will happen to the brands that do not prove themselves  as the company has said  is unclear at this time. We can speculate that they will be divested or chopped up  though.The company's lineup contains both brands with massive issues (i would argue like Alfa Romeo/Abarth) and brands that are natural  positive brands such as Opel/Vauxhall  Peugeot and Fiat. The company has some of the best professional vehicles in the world with Fiat Professional  Dodge  Ram  and others - and also contains luxury vehicles  like Maserati.So  viewing the company as a whole  it's an Italian-heavy car company with some very appealing French and American (and one German) brands.The owners of Stellantis are as follows:Exor N.V  holding 14.4% (privately-held  family company  owns things like Ferrari (RACE)  Iveco  and other things as well)(privately-held  family company  owns things like Ferrari (RACE)  Iveco  and other things as well) Peugeot Family  (Etablissements Peugeot Frères  EPF) at 7.19%Bpifrance  holding 6.18% (A French  publically-held investment bank)(A French  publically-held investment bank) Dongfeng Motor Corp.  at 4.5%BlackRock (BLK) at 2.52%The company's assembly plants are found in every continent on earth.Stellantis has been an analyst favorite for some time now  since its inception in 2021. The company's returns have not echoed this confidence  and for the past year  the company is down 12%. YTD  the stock has lost 22%. Stellantis hasn't exactly had an easy time of it since early 2021. The pandemic and the supply chain disruptions have wreaked havoc with the company  as they have with other businesses  both in the sector and other sectors.Now  despite this  the company actually posted pretty good 2021 results  showcasing how the business immediately started to tighten things up. Revenues were up 14% pro forma  just south of €150B with some adjustments.Stellantis 2021 Results (Stellantis)The company close to doubled its overall profitability  bringing in some of the truly profitable brands and operations to weigh up the not-so profitable operations. An adjusted pro forma 2020 OI of €9.2B at 6.9% OM became $€18B ex-adjustments  with a close to 12% operating margin. These annual results were well ahead of the company's overall strategic plan. They also beat most expectations set by analysts  including my own.However  a big reason for Stellantis outperformance was the stellar performance of its American brands  even if outperformance was seen across all regions. The other reasons for the outperformance was simple positive pricing and mix lifting revenues  coupled with very high demands. Again  NA margins were superb  especially in pick-up trucks and SUVs  which really outperformed.Stellantis NA segment (Stellantis IR)A lot of investors ask where Stellantis differs from the competition - and given the company's structure  that's a question that's now something clearly answerable. The company is able to extract very impressive margins out of those higher-priced and semi-luxury vehicles  including US SUVs and pickup trucks. The 16.3% OM in 2021 puts the American segment of Stellantis on pair with Daimler (OTCPK:DDAIF) as well as Porsche (OTCPK:POAHY). And the company seeks to keep this rolling through new models and new customer options.Stellantis American Brands (Stellantis IR)So  the difference? Cash flows well above expectations. Industrial FCF was at €6.1B  which is well above my own €4.5B FY21 estimate  deriving from very impressive synergy executions. The company may  based on €3.2B net cash effects  reach the promised €5B run rate well before the promised 2024 time period.The company's CEO  a very  very solid automotive background from Renault  and in the automotive industry for almost 40 years  said that this performance primarily came from addressing what were considered ""low-hanging fruits"" in terms of overall efficiencies.Stellantis FY21 results show that the company is able to weather a tough operating environment and deliver strong results  and appears confident that it will continue to deliver in 2022 in spite of the current industry headwinds  aiming for double-digit operating margins in the year. My expectation for the 2022 result is around €16B  increasing to €17.5B by 2023 once the operating environments and supply chain issues start winding down. The company will likely be able to weather increased input costs and labor inflation through efficiencies and price actions - at the very least  I don't see the company massively being impacted by inflation to a degree that hurts the company's bottom line.Stellantis Presentation (Stellantis IR)This positive view on 2021 was further cemented by a positive 1Q22. Despite a 12% shipping decline YoY  the company reported higher revenues with continued sales increases from North And South America. The company reiterated guidance for 2022. The noteworthy fact is that this beat was despite supply chain bottlenecks caused by continued semi shortages.Stellantis 2022 Guidance (Stellantis IR)NA was the star in 1Q22 as it was in FY21. Given the constrained production situation given the tight supply of semis  Stellantis inventories remain at very low levels. This continues to support my view that inflationary/cost pressures and macroeconomic headwinds won’t threaten the strong underlying consumer demand. The car market should remain supply-constrained  which facilitates strong pricing trends shown across all OEMs that are unlikely to disappear.The company also has big news in acquisitions  buying the SHARE NOW company. Share Now is the child of the 2019 merger of BMW’s Drive Now car-sharing service and its Daimler counterpart Car2Go. For Stellantis  the Share Now acquisition will grow their Free2move service enormously  adding 14 new European cities to Free2move’s seven existing mobility hubs in the United States and Europe.Free2move comprises a fleet of more than 450 000 cars  500 000 parking places and a network of 250 000 charging stations. This includes B2B and rental or leasing services. The company runs 2 500 vehicles for car-sharing  with Share Now adding another 10 000 cars to Free2move’s existing car-sharing fleet. It is unclear how many of these are electric. Share Now  at the last count in 2021  ran 2 900 BMW  Mini  Smart and Fiat electric cars. (Source: Electrive)The company views the asset as an interesting opportunity to improve its mobility efforts. In Stellantis 2030 strategic plan  the company targets €2.8B in net revenues from its mobility services  including a mid-term objective of €700M to be reached by 2025. This acquisition should allow the company to be well on its way to reaching these strategic objectives.Stellantis has several upsides. A swift turnaround of former FCA in the hand of Carlos Tavares  such as Opel  will greatly improve this company's future prospects. The economies of scale Stellantis now operates under put it in a prime position to absorb not only investments for electrification and battery tech  but also the impacts of the shortage. PSA modular electric platforms are another massive upside here.The two complementary geographical exposures of the merging companies are made for synergies  which are currently being captured to the target of €5B  I view these as very achievable.This means the company is  as far as automotive go  a potential winner at the right price.Let's look at some risks.Stellantis - The risksStill  Stellantis comes with high-level risks. Here are some of them.To the first  Stellantis now owns a portfolio of 14 different  wildly varied brands from separate continents. As management has indicated  these brands will need to prove themselves. The implication is that the brands won't be able to do this - at least not all of them. The company could face sizeable write-downs and impairments  not to mention that Stellantis can face the necessity of having to sell off some of those assets.To the second  unlike almost every other car company out there  Stellantis' exposure to China is extremely weak. German OEMs are strong in China - both BMW and Mercedes - Stellantis is among the weaker ones. This may be a missed growth opportunity going forward.To the third  when the company was formed  the company management made clear that they will avoid plant closures at all costs  keeping its 300 000-strong staff. This is akin to putting a ball and chain to your leg. I believe it will only be a matter of time before this needs to be reconsidered. Saying this in the first place was not a good idea.There's also the fact that Stellantis is one of the weaker businesses in terms of credit rating. I'm also not counting the extraordinary dividend paid in 2021 and focusing on ordinary distributions  payable in April. For this year  the payout in 2022  was at €1.04  which comes to 7.6%.This is massively high  but can also pose a risk - though not necessarily in the near term  given an EPS of between €3-€4 for this and the coming years.Stellantis ValuationEvaluating Stellantis is very difficult. On a straight-line valuation  this company currently is valued at less than 5X P/E on a 2022E basis. Comparing the company to either peers  constructing a DCF  and looking at NAV still contains a lot of uncertainty even in the best of scenarios.Nonetheless  we'll give it a shot.From a peer perspective  this company is at a severe discount to any of its peers. VW  Daimler  and BMW all trade between 5-7X P/E - Stellantis is currently at below 4X. Its yield is far higher  its P/B is more favorable  and overall  the company is  based on a peer perspective  implied to be worth at least 50% more than we're currently seeing today.I assign a discount to Stellantis  being a new player and things uncertain  at around 10-15% from a peer perspective.For NAV/SOTP  we assign EBIT multiples between 2-5X  depending on the geography. Automotive companies trade at significant discounts to EBIT. I give NA the highest multiple  given solid sales and profit margins of 4.5-5X on a range. I give the Middle East and Africa the lowest  given the volatility - around half that. This comes to total net assets  including net cash  of around €81B for the company. Based on 3.3M shares  this comes to an average NAV/share of €24.4/share. Do you see how high that implied discount is  even though I use some of the most conservative multiples out there?We'll look at DCF as well. I refuse to assign more than a 1.3% growth estimate in Sales as well as a 1.5% in EBITDA  given the characteristics of automotive. But even assigning that low a growth ratio  and calculating a 10% WACC from a cost of debt of 3.36% (still extremely cheap)  we still get an implied EV/share of €24.No matter how much we impair or discount the company  staying within any sort of realistic range  many of these valuations call for a price target of above €20/share.I've tried various approaches to get below these targets  but most of those approaches include discounting the company at unrealistic levels. There's simply a lot of value in the business  and the market is severely discounting that value.That's obviously a problem for me.Í can go to €20/share. The peer valuations support such an approach  given a slight EV/EBITDA premium - but going below  and you're essentially saying 1+1 isn't two  or that Stellantis should be viewed with wildly different approaches to other automotive businesses.I disagree with that notion.S&P Global considers Stellantis a ""BUY"" with €21.74 on average  with a target range of €13-€34/share. 20 out of 23 analysts are at a ""BUY"" or ""Outperform"" here. (Source: S&P Global)There is undoubtable value here.Based on these valuations  I view Stellantis as a ""BUY"" with a PT of €20/share.ThesisStellantis of course has a very liquid NYSE listing. It's not an ADR either  and it's STLA  which currently trades at an implied 3X P/E. How exactly we should consider this company going forward is a hard question  but I would say at least 5X P/E is a ""fair"" view here.Even just at a 6.3X forward P/E  you're looking at more than doubling your money until 2024.Stellantis Upside (F.A.S.T graphs)And that's conservative. Even trading entirely flat from today's levels  you're still seeing an upside of over 15% annually  and that's if Stellantis doesn't go above 3.3X P/E for the next few years. It can still  easily  pay out the current dividend  meaning that this is actually a 7%-yielding company with a covered dividend.The arguments against  and why I don't yet own a large position in the company are fairly simple. Stellantis is very volatile - and it's likely to remain volatile for years at this point  if not forever  given the company's sector - and I don't like that sort of volatility going into this market situation.However  how likely is it that an automotive business of this size actually goes down or sees a fundamental threat? The risk is low. It's all about value.And the value today is convincing - perhaps the most convincing valuation in the entire automotive sector  basically giving us an upside of nearly 50% at this price.",negative,0.01,0.0,0.99,mixed,0.18,0.1,0.72,True,English,"['Superb Car Company', 'Stellantis', 'NYSE', 'STLA', 'Etablissements Peugeot Frères', '50/50 cross-border complete merger', 'Fiat Chrysler Automobile Conglomeratem', 'Getty Images Entertainment', 'multinational automotive corporation', 'largest automotive maker', 'rated large automotive', 'Dongfeng Motor Corp.', 'supply chain disruptions', 'Alfa Romeo Chrysler', 'overall strategic plan', 'Exor N.V', 'Lancia Maserati Mopar', 'best professional vehicles', 'following car brands', 'natural, positive brands', 'one German) brands', 'Opel Peugeot Ram', 'multinational automotive company', 'fourth-largest automotive company', 'Italian-heavy car company', 'French PSA Group', 'Stellantis N.V', 'group names', 'luxury vehicles', 'Peugeot Family', 'overall profitability', 'Fiat Professional', 'appealing French', 'A French', 'Anthony Devlin', 'public version', 'May 27th', 'industrial revolution', 'Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance', 'General Motors', 'Hyundai Motors', 'market cap', 'next couple', 'common shares', 'corporate identifier', 'new investments', 'massive issues', 'investment bank', 'assembly plants', 'past year', 'other businesses', 'other sectors', 'good 2021 results', '12% operating margin', 'annual results', 'most expectations', 'big reason', 'stellar performance', 'other reasons', 'profitable brands', 'entire world', 'coupled operations', 'profitable operations', 'early January', 'pro forma', 'family company', 'other things', 'American brands', 'Stellantis 2021 Results', 'easy time', 'Stellantis outperformance', 'Author', 'Note', 'article', 'iREIT', 'Alpha', 'look', 'NYSE', 'STLA', 'heck', 'rock', 'bones', 'Netherlands', 'Amsterdam', 'companies', 'list', 'Volkswagen', 'OTCPK', 'VWAGY', 'Toyota', 'GM', 'revenues', 'yield', 'years', 'Abarth', 'Citroen', 'Dodge', 'Jeep', 'Vauxhall/Opel', '300,000 employees', '130 countries', 'manufacturing', 'suppliers', 'plans', 'earth', 'FCA', '16th', 'Milan', 'Euronext', 'symbol', 'cars', 'logos', 'gates', 'CEO', 'challenge', 'technology', 'lineup', 'Opel/Vauxhall', 'others', 'owners', 'Ferrari', 'RACE', 'Iveco', 'held', 'EPF', 'Bpifrance', 'BLK', 'continent', 'analyst', 'inception', 'returns', 'confidence', 'YTD', 'stock', 'pandemic', 'havoc', 'adjustments', 'OI', '6.9% OM', 'close', 'regions', '2.52']",2022-07-12,2022-07-13,seekingalpha.com

Significant upside potential due to the well diversified portfolio. Successful partial divestments and financing rounds confirm the Group's investment approach. Advanced blockchain AG is a blockchain venture builder focused on investing  developing  and scaling in disruptive technologies including token investments. Their main market is therefore the venture capital market for companies active in blockchain technology  with a particular focus on the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and infrastructure projects enabling Web 3.0. Advanced Blockchain AG is an innovation center with a diversified portfolio consisting of internal projects  incubations as well as early-stage investments. The venture builder arm of Advanced Blockchain AG acts as a leading incubator of projects such as for Composable Finance. Advanced Blockchain AG is not only incubating highly promising projects  but the company also has a diversified portfolio of investments which will be further expanded. Extensive expertise  resources and networks provide the company with early-stage access to exclusive investment opportunities in projects with significant potential. The company's investment strategy has two objectives: maximizing return on investment and identifying synergies in the ecosystem. Supporting the most promising projects with smart capital enables them to fulfill their mission  which in turn provides the company with a good return on investment. Moreover  the company's synergies enable it to exponentially increase the potential and capabilities of its portfolio companies through shared growth and integration  as illustrated by the example of Composable Finance (an incubation project)  which secured the eighth parachain in the Polkadot network by raising more than USD 160 million through a crowd-loan. This resulted in an implied combined valuation of USD 400 million for the LAYR and PICA token  adding nearly USD 20 million to Advanced Blockchain's USD 2 million initial investment alone. Advanced blockchain AG is listed in the Scale segment of Deutsche Börse  as well as in the primary market of Börse Düsseldorf. In total  we have calculated an enterprise value of around EUR 83 million (previously: EUR 88 million) according to NAV. With 3.77 million shares outstanding  this corresponds to a value per share of EUR 21.99 (previously: EUR 23.32). Due to the sharp decline in crypto markets and the current 'crypto winter'  we have applied an additional discount to the calculated fair value. We currently calculate this at around 55%. This corresponds to the average decline of the two leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum since the publication of our initial valuation (21.04.21). Therefore  we calculated the fair value at EUR 37.75 million or EUR 10.00 per share. Thus  our price target of EUR 10.00 is currently significantly below the calculated fair intrinsic value. With a calming of the crypto markets and a 'crypto spring'  we will then also reduce our 'market discount' accordingly.

7713,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4522938-mintra-smart-play-on-shipping-and-energy-exploration-boom,Mintra – Smart Play On Shipping And Energy Exploration Boom,Product and LNG tankers have the best year in decades. Energy exploration is booming. Mintra is a high beta play on these sectors. Mintra was hammered in Covid.,alvarezIntroduction to MintraMintra Holding (MNTR.OL) is a Norway based parent company of several operating entities from Norway  the United Kingdom and Singapore. The company provides on-demand digital learning training and certification courses for safety critical industries worldwide. Mintra is listed in Norway on Euronext Growth. The stock can be traded on Interactive Brokers as well as other trading platforms.(Multimedia INteractive TRAining) was founded in Oslo Norway  in 1997 by Research Engineer Ivar Viktil to develop interactive safety training for the energy and maritime industries. The headquarters are now in Bergen and offices in Oslo  Stavanger  Aberdeen  Limassol  and Singapore. Mintra provides services to over 4 000 companies  including 4 out of the top 5 largest energy companies in the world. Mintra has approximately 50% market share in its segment.The Mintra team consists of over 140 designers  developers  industry consultants  and supporting functions working to the highest standards.Mintra currently provides 2340 courses mainly for safety critical industries worldwide. 30% of courses are from Mintra library  the remainder is from its 67 eLearning partners.Introduction to Mintra (Mintra)Training courses to Maritime and Energy crews represent 80% of Mintra business. Mintra is therefore highly correlated with Gas and Oil markets as well as with the Maritime industry.Source: Mintra (Mintra)Mintra was a COVID victimMintra business is heavily dependent on frequency of rotation of maritime and shipping crews. Low degree of crew rotation during COVID meant low need for crew certifications and therefore lower need for crew courses.... continuing inability of ship operators to conduct crew changes has been the single greatest operation challenge confronting the global shipping industry since the Second World War... ICS Shipping on the crew change crises during CovidThe significant decrease in crew rotations led to revenue and profitability declines  resulting in share underperformance since the IPO.Source: Pareto Securities (pareto)Mintra - great way to play the Shipping and Energy Boom2022 is the year of Shipping and Energy. Product tankers and LNG tankers are flying up due to the Russian war on Ukraine. Container ships are rising higher on supply chain congestion. Oil and Gas markets have been booming. Rig operators are announcing the best rates in a decade. But mainly  all the Mintra clients are making a lot of money. Crews are rotating  so there is an increased need for Mintra training courses and online certifications. Mintra is the beneficiary of the shipping and energy turnaround.Mintra's 1Q22 was its best quarter ever  2Q22 should be even betterThe turnaround in shipping and energy is already showing in Mintra's numbers. 1Q22 was Mintra's best quarter ever – Mintra generated a 10% FCF yield in the quarter. That is 40% annualized FCF! They can generate CF equal to their market capitalization in 2.5 years. 2Q22 will most likely be even better.Broker consensus still assumes only 10% growth for 2022Last year Mintra guided 10% revenue growth for 2022. That was well before the energy and shipping growth started. The guidance was not revised yet. It could happen during the Q2 report. We could easily see doubling of the growth guidance.Mintra is still one of the cheapest Nordic tech companies despite being up 70% since March lowsAs the share price graph above shows  Mintra is up 70% in three months. But it is still 60% below its 2020 IPO price of 9.7 NOK per share. Despite the strong share price performance this quarter  Mintra is still one of the cheapest tech stocks in the Nordics according to Pareto Securities.Source: Pareto Securities (Pareto)Mintra is net cash positive  has a strong balance sheet and healthy marginsAs of the end of Q1  Mintra has a net cash position of 110 million NOK (cash balance has exceeded its small leverage). Based on the 2022 guidance  Mintra should be generating 28% EBITDA margins and 13% EBIT margins.Mintra should at least double this yearOur base case is for Mintra to double this year. That would bring Mintra from the current 4 NOK to about 8 NOK  still well below its IPO price of 9.7 NOK. In this scenario  Mintra would remain one of the cheapest tech stocks in the Nordics.CatalystsThe main catalyst is the Q2 report scheduled for 11 August 2022. The Q2 report should be the best quarter the company ever reported. In addition  the Q2 report may include new full-year guidance.Conclusion2022 should be the year of Energy and Shipping. Mintra should be the beneficiary of the boom. Mintra has a strong balance sheet  no debt  and strong cash generation. In the current environment  Mintra should generate cash equal to its capitalization in under three years. Mintra is still one of its peers' cheapest stocks while reporting the best quarterly results ever.

D…,DevicesDiagnosticsOncologyNews Release - July 13  2022Mauna Kea Technologies Announces Publication of a Meta-Analysis Demonstrating Cellvizios Significant Role in Detection of Esophageal Dysplasia and CancerResults demonstrate a significant increase in the detection rate of neoplasia when Cellvizio is used as an adjunct to the standard of care  underscoring the key role of advanced imaging in slowing the rapid growth of esophageal cancerMeta-analysis builds on recent data demonstrating that the use of Cellvizio is also associated with lower health services utilization and fewer overall endoscopy proceduresParis and Boston  July 6  2022 -- (Healthcare Sales & Marketing Network) -- Mauna Kea Technologies (Euronext: MKEA  Mauna Kea) inventor of Cellvizio®  the multidisciplinary probe and needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (p/nCLE) platform today announced the peer-reviewed publication of a new meta-analysis in Techniques and Innovations in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (TIGE) entitled High definition probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy review and meta-analysis for neoplasia detection in Barretts esophagus1. The study demonstrates that the addition of Cellvizio as an adjunct to guide biopsies provides a significantly higher diagnostic yield for dysplasia and cancer and reduces sampling error compared to random four-quadrant biopsies alone  the standard of care.Existing endoscopic screening and surveillance methods are insufficient in detecting Barretts Esophagus or esophageal cancer  as using the Seattle Protocol standard of care alone is prone to sampling error and poor sensitivity and specificity. At Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) in May 2022  Dr. Bashar Qumseya presented data2 based on roughly 5 million people and showing that  among those ages 45 to 64  esophageal cancer (EAC) rate nearly doubled from 2012 to 2019. Moreover  the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus  the only known precursor to EAC  rose by about 50% in this age group in the same period.In the TIGE meta-analysis  the authors included 9 studies for a total of 688 patients and 1 299 lesions and assessed the benefits of probe-based CLE (pCLE) as an adjunct to random 4-quadrant biopsies in the surveillance of patients with Barrett's esophagus for dysplasia and early EAC detection. Per-patient pCLE pooled sensitivity  specificity  and negative predictive value were 96%  93%  and 98%  respectively. Compared to random biopsies  the per-patient pooled absolute and relative detection rate increases of neoplasia with pCLE were significant and equal to 5% and 243%  respectively.Separately  at the ENDO 2022 World Congress of GI Endoscopy in May 2022  the results of a retrospective multi-center chart review3 of 60 patients with Barretts esophagus who were referred for endoscopic surveillance or treatment were presented. The authors were examining differences in gastroenterology health services utilization for eight items/services among patients treated using Cellvizio as an adjunct versus standard of care alone. The Cellvizio cohort had 1.04 fewer endoscopies and anesthesia services  7.49 less biopsy bottles  1.30 fewer ablations  and 1.46 less brush cytology services. Therefore  the researchers concluded that Cellvizio is associated with an overall lower burden to the healthcare system.The results from these studies demonstrate that there are better tools that are easily accessible to physicians who are working to improve the detection rate of screening and surveillance programs  and ultimately reverse the alarming rise in prevalence of esophageal cancer  said Nicolas Bouvier  Interim Chief Executive Officer of Mauna Kea Technologies. Better detection rates and a lower utilization of healthcare services make Cellvizio a valuable adjunct to the standard of care in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers alike.About Barretts Esophagus and Esophageal CancerBarretts Esophagus  often abbreviated as BE  is a condition that results from chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)  where the lining of the esophagus at the junction of the stomach undergoes significant physiological changes that can often be detected only with thorough screening and surveillance. Chronic GERD affects approximately 5-10% of the population globally  and if left unmanaged can progress to BE without proper surveillance. BE is the only known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)  one of the fastest growing causes of cancer deaths with very poor 5-year survival rates.About Mauna Kea TechnologiesMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company that manufactures and sells Cellvizio®  the real- time in vivo cellular imaging platform.

As we work to combat inflation  I applaud Ontex's investment in our state  which takes advantage of North Carolina's prime location on the eastern seaboard and will help shorten shipping times and lower costs for consumers. This is yet another reason why North Carolina is a great place for businesses to grow and thrive.""Kevin Berger  Chair  Rockingham County Board of Commissioners  said ""Rockingham County is proud to support the expansion of Ontex to our area  which not only supports the needs of individuals around the world  but creates jobs for our residents here at home.
