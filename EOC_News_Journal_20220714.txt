Mintra was hammered in Covid.,alvarezIntroduction to MintraMintra Holding (MNTR.OL) is a Norway based parent company of several operating entities from Norway  the United Kingdom and Singapore. The company provides on-demand digital learning training and certification courses for safety critical industries worldwide. Mintra is listed in Norway on Euronext Growth. The stock can be traded on Interactive Brokers as well as other trading platforms.(Multimedia INteractive TRAining) was founded in Oslo Norway  in 1997 by Research Engineer Ivar Viktil to develop interactive safety training for the energy and maritime industries. The headquarters are now in Bergen and offices in Oslo  Stavanger  Aberdeen  Limassol  and Singapore. Mintra provides services to over 4 000 companies  including 4 out of the top 5 largest energy companies in the world. Mintra has approximately 50% market share in its segment.The Mintra team consists of over 140 designers  developers  industry consultants  and supporting functions working to the highest standards.Mintra currently provides 2340 courses mainly for safety critical industries worldwide. 30% of courses are from Mintra library  the remainder is from its 67 eLearning partners.Introduction to Mintra (Mintra)Training courses to Maritime and Energy crews represent 80% of Mintra business. Mintra is therefore highly correlated with Gas and Oil markets as well as with the Maritime industry.Source: Mintra (Mintra)Mintra was a COVID victimMintra business is heavily dependent on frequency of rotation of maritime and shipping crews. Low degree of crew rotation during COVID meant low need for crew certifications and therefore lower need for crew courses.... continuing inability of ship operators to conduct crew changes has been the single greatest operation challenge confronting the global shipping industry since the Second World War... ICS Shipping on the crew change crises during CovidThe significant decrease in crew rotations led to revenue and profitability declines  resulting in share underperformance since the IPO.Source: Pareto Securities (pareto)Mintra - great way to play the Shipping and Energy Boom2022 is the year of Shipping and Energy. Product tankers and LNG tankers are flying up due to the Russian war on Ukraine. Container ships are rising higher on supply chain congestion. Oil and Gas markets have been booming. Rig operators are announcing the best rates in a decade. But mainly  all the Mintra clients are making a lot of money. Crews are rotating  so there is an increased need for Mintra training courses and online certifications. Mintra is the beneficiary of the shipping and energy turnaround.Mintra's 1Q22 was its best quarter ever  2Q22 should be even betterThe turnaround in shipping and energy is already showing in Mintra's numbers. 1Q22 was Mintra's best quarter ever – Mintra generated a 10% FCF yield in the quarter. That is 40% annualized FCF! They can generate CF equal to their market capitalization in 2.5 years. 2Q22 will most likely be even better.Broker consensus still assumes only 10% growth for 2022Last year Mintra guided 10% revenue growth for 2022. That was well before the energy and shipping growth started. The guidance was not revised yet. It could happen during the Q2 report. We could easily see doubling of the growth guidance.Mintra is still one of the cheapest Nordic tech companies despite being up 70% since March lowsAs the share price graph above shows  Mintra is up 70% in three months. But it is still 60% below its 2020 IPO price of 9.7 NOK per share. Despite the strong share price performance this quarter  Mintra is still one of the cheapest tech stocks in the Nordics according to Pareto Securities.Source: Pareto Securities (Pareto)Mintra is net cash positive  has a strong balance sheet and healthy marginsAs of the end of Q1  Mintra has a net cash position of 110 million NOK (cash balance has exceeded its small leverage). Based on the 2022 guidance  Mintra should be generating 28% EBITDA margins and 13% EBIT margins.Mintra should at least double this yearOur base case is for Mintra to double this year. That would bring Mintra from the current 4 NOK to about 8 NOK  still well below its IPO price of 9.7 NOK. In this scenario  Mintra would remain one of the cheapest tech stocks in the Nordics.CatalystsThe main catalyst is the Q2 report scheduled for 11 August 2022. The Q2 report should be the best quarter the company ever reported. In addition  the Q2 report may include new full-year guidance.Conclusion2022 should be the year of Energy and Shipping. Mintra should be the beneficiary of the boom. Mintra has a strong balance sheet  no debt  and strong cash generation. In the current environment  Mintra should generate cash equal to its capitalization in under three years. Mintra is still one of its peers' cheapest stocks while reporting the best quarterly results ever.

At the end of 2024  a new décor and interior inspired by the Roman domus and the riches of the “Eternal City” will be revealed with a new touch of contemporary elegance.Orient Express  artisan of travel since 1883 and brand of Accor  and Italian group Arsenale S.p.A  experts in luxury hotels and hospitality  have entrusted the interior design and artistic direction of the hotel to architect and designer Hugo Toro.HUGO TORO IN ROME“Orient Express has found its ideal stopover in Rome "" says Hugo Toro  adding: “It is a symbolic city that evokes emotion and amazement in everyone who visits. It is a place that feels like magic  imprinted by marks of history and a rich palette of textures  materials and colours. All of this is in perfect harmony with the mysterious and travel-focused identity of Orient Express.”In his Promenades à Rome (Walks through Rome)  the architect travelled to the heart of the city’s historic centre  found treasures in bookstores  discovered the Pantheon  and brought his notebooks and watercolours to the famous Piazza de la Minerva  whose name derives from the goddess of artisans and eternal Protector of Rome. He sketched the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy  and Bernini’s obelisk with its elephant high on the pedestal. He passed by the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva – the only gothic church in Rome – and then saw Michelangelo’s Pietà  all before stopping in front of the façade of the anticipated Orient Express La Minerva.“The former Palazzo Fonseca is a sumptuous palace from the 17th century  with a huge and majestic facade "" Toro explains  adding: “It is a heritage site still adorned with Roman columns  sculptures by Rinaldi Rinaldo  a disciple of Canova  and the fascinating Minerva. It is a secret spot where you can go to think and admire the wonders of the Sant'Ivo dome  the roof of the Quirinal Palace and the Pantheon from its panoramic terrace.”A TALE OF TRAVELBorn on the French-German border to a Mexican mother and a French father  architect and designer Hugo Toro shares a love of culture  encounters and travel with Orient Express.

Having made his first foray into Orient Express designing our pop-up scenography at La Samaritaine  this remarkable designer continues his journey with us into Rome. His passion for history  sensitivity and skill at elevating historic surroundings with a new contemporaneity will help us to create in Orient Express La Minerva one of the most enchanting destinations in the world ” says Stephen Alden  CEO Raffles & Orient Express.""The history of La Minerva will be revived in Hugo Toro’s hands  during this period of renaissance in the city of Rome.

D…,DevicesDiagnosticsOncologyNews Release - July 13  2022Mauna Kea Technologies Announces Publication of a Meta-Analysis Demonstrating Cellvizios Significant Role in Detection of Esophageal Dysplasia and CancerResults demonstrate a significant increase in the detection rate of neoplasia when Cellvizio is used as an adjunct to the standard of care  underscoring the key role of advanced imaging in slowing the rapid growth of esophageal cancerMeta-analysis builds on recent data demonstrating that the use of Cellvizio is also associated with lower health services utilization and fewer overall endoscopy proceduresParis and Boston  July 6  2022 -- (Healthcare Sales & Marketing Network) -- Mauna Kea Technologies (Euronext: MKEA  Mauna Kea) inventor of Cellvizio®  the multidisciplinary probe and needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (p/nCLE) platform today announced the peer-reviewed publication of a new meta-analysis in Techniques and Innovations in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (TIGE) entitled High definition probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy review and meta-analysis for neoplasia detection in Barretts esophagus1. The study demonstrates that the addition of Cellvizio as an adjunct to guide biopsies provides a significantly higher diagnostic yield for dysplasia and cancer and reduces sampling error compared to random four-quadrant biopsies alone  the standard of care.Existing endoscopic screening and surveillance methods are insufficient in detecting Barretts Esophagus or esophageal cancer  as using the Seattle Protocol standard of care alone is prone to sampling error and poor sensitivity and specificity. At Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) in May 2022  Dr. Bashar Qumseya presented data2 based on roughly 5 million people and showing that  among those ages 45 to 64  esophageal cancer (EAC) rate nearly doubled from 2012 to 2019. Moreover  the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus  the only known precursor to EAC  rose by about 50% in this age group in the same period.In the TIGE meta-analysis  the authors included 9 studies for a total of 688 patients and 1 299 lesions and assessed the benefits of probe-based CLE (pCLE) as an adjunct to random 4-quadrant biopsies in the surveillance of patients with Barrett's esophagus for dysplasia and early EAC detection. Per-patient pCLE pooled sensitivity  specificity  and negative predictive value were 96%  93%  and 98%  respectively. Compared to random biopsies  the per-patient pooled absolute and relative detection rate increases of neoplasia with pCLE were significant and equal to 5% and 243%  respectively.Separately  at the ENDO 2022 World Congress of GI Endoscopy in May 2022  the results of a retrospective multi-center chart review3 of 60 patients with Barretts esophagus who were referred for endoscopic surveillance or treatment were presented. The authors were examining differences in gastroenterology health services utilization for eight items/services among patients treated using Cellvizio as an adjunct versus standard of care alone. The Cellvizio cohort had 1.04 fewer endoscopies and anesthesia services  7.49 less biopsy bottles  1.30 fewer ablations  and 1.46 less brush cytology services. Therefore  the researchers concluded that Cellvizio is associated with an overall lower burden to the healthcare system.The results from these studies demonstrate that there are better tools that are easily accessible to physicians who are working to improve the detection rate of screening and surveillance programs  and ultimately reverse the alarming rise in prevalence of esophageal cancer  said Nicolas Bouvier  Interim Chief Executive Officer of Mauna Kea Technologies. Better detection rates and a lower utilization of healthcare services make Cellvizio a valuable adjunct to the standard of care in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers alike.About Barretts Esophagus and Esophageal CancerBarretts Esophagus  often abbreviated as BE  is a condition that results from chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)  where the lining of the esophagus at the junction of the stomach undergoes significant physiological changes that can often be detected only with thorough screening and surveillance. Chronic GERD affects approximately 5-10% of the population globally  and if left unmanaged can progress to BE without proper surveillance. BE is the only known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)  one of the fastest growing causes of cancer deaths with very poor 5-year survival rates.About Mauna Kea TechnologiesMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company that manufactures and sells Cellvizio®  the real- time in vivo cellular imaging platform.

The Election Committee comprises Chairman of the Board Jörgen Wigh  Anders Börjesson (Chairman of the Election Committee)  Henrik Hedelius  Johan Lannebo (representing Lannebo Fonder) and Caroline Sjösten (representing Swedbank Robur Fonder).The Election Committee  whose members represent approximately 50 percent of the total number of votes  has announced that it will propose that the Annual General Meeting on 24 August 2022  in accordance with the items above  resolve on:Item 2 Election of the Chairman to preside over the MeetingThe Election Committee proposes Chairman of the Board Jörgen Wigh to be elected Chairman of the 2022 Annual General Meeting.Item 11 Determining the number of directorsThe Election Committee proposes that the Board shall consist of six regular directors.Item 12 Adoption of fees to the Board and auditorsThe Election Committee proposes that the total directors’ fees of SEK 2 725 000 (preceding year: SEK 2 550 000) are to be allocated as follows:Chairman of the Board: SEK 850 000 (preceding year: SEK 800 000).Other members of the Board: SEK 375 000 per director (preceding year: SEK 350 000).The following additional fees will be paid for committee work:Compensation Committee: SEK 80 000 (preceding year: SEK 75 000) to each committee member (two members).Audit Committee: SEK 80 000 (preceding year: SEK 75 000) to the Chairman.Provided that the necessary tax prerequisites for invoicing exist and that doing so would not entail a cost for Bergman & Beving  directors shall be offered the opportunity to invoice their directors’ fees through a Swedish wholly owned company or private business. If a director invoices his/her directors’ fee through a wholly owned company or private business  the fee is to be increased by an amount corresponding to the social security contributions and value added tax stipulated by law.Auditors’ fees are  as in previous years  to be paid in return for approved invoices.Item 13 Election of directors and Chairman of the BoardThe Election Committee proposes re-election of directors Fredrik Börjesson  Charlotte Hansson  Henrik Hedelius  Malin Nordesjö  Niklas Stenberg and Jörgen Wigh.The Election Committee proposes re-election of Jörgen Wigh as Chairman of the Board.A presentation of the current members of the Board is available from the Company’s website www.bergmanbeving.com.Item 14 Election of auditorThe Election Committee proposes re-election of the registered accounting firm KPMG AB as the Company’s auditor until the end of the next Annual General Meeting. The Election Committee’s proposal follows the Audit Committee’s recommendation.PROPOSAL BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR RESOLUTION ON ITEMS 9b AND 15–17 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ABOVEItem 9b Resolution concerning the appropriation of the Company’s profit or loss as shown in the balance sheet adopted by the MeetingThe Board proposes that the Company’s profits be disposed of so that MSEK 90 (80) is distributed to the shareholders and the remaining MSEK 945 (992) of the Company’s profits be brought forward. This means that the Board proposes to shareholders the distribution of SEK 3.40 (3.00) per share and 26 August 2022 as the record date for receiving dividends. If the Annual General Meeting adopts the proposal  dividends are expected to be disbursed through Euroclear Sweden AB on 31 August 2022 to the shareholders recorded in the shareholders’ register as of the record date.Item 15 Resolution on approval of remuneration reportThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Boards’ report on remuneration pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 16 Resolution regarding the authorisation of the Board to decide on the acquisition and conveyance of treasury sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to authorise the Board  prior to the next Annual General Meeting  to acquire a maximum number of Class B shares so that the Company’s holding of treasury shares at no time exceeds 10 percent of the total number of shares in the Company. Acquisitions are to be carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with the stock exchange rules at a price that is within the registered price range at any given time  meaning the range between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price. Acquisitions are to be paid for in cash and may be carried out on one or more occasions.The Board also proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorise the Board  prior to the next Annual General Meeting  to divest Class B shares held in treasury by the Company in a manner other than on Nasdaq Stockholm. This authorisation may be utilised on one or more occasions and encompasses all shares held in treasury by the Company at the time of the Board’s decision. The authorisation also entitles the Board to decide to deviate from the shareholders’ preferential rights and stipulates that payment may be made by other means than money.The purpose of this authorisation is to be able to adapt the Group’s capital structure and to pay for future acquisitions of businesses and operations using treasury shares. Holdings of treasury shares may also be used to secure the Company’s obligations under the proposed share-based incentive programme and previous incentive programmes.In accordance with the above  a resolution on the Board’s proposal requires the support of shareholders representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and the shares represented at the Meeting.Item 17 Resolution on the issuance of call options on repurchased shares and the conveyance of repurchased shares to executives (“2022 Share-based incentive programme”).The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to adopt a long-term incentive programme  2022 Share-based incentive programme (the “Programme”). The Programme  which is proposed to include a total of 25 executives in the Bergman & Beving Group  means participants are offered an opportunity to acquire call options at market price for Bergman & Beving’s repurchased Class B shares in the Company and that participants will  after a two-year period  receive a certain subsidy on the paid premium for the options.The Board’s proposal also entails the Annual General Meeting approving that the Company  in deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  transfers up to 210 000 of the Company’s repurchased Class B shares to option holders at the established redemption price in connection with any exercise of call options (subject to any recalculations). Finally  the Board’s proposal means the Annual General Meeting approves that Class B shares acquired by the Company in line with earlier authorisation can also be conveyed to guarantee the supply of shares in accordance with the proposed Programme.The Company currently holds a total of 868 677 Class B shares in the Company.The proposal was prepared by the Company’s Compensation Committee in consultation with the Company’s Board.The decision to propose the Programme to the Annual General Meeting was taken by the Board. The Company’s directors are not covered by the Programme.The Programme has the following key conditions:a) The number of call options issued should not exceed 210 000  corresponding to approximately 0.8 percent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.6 percent of the total number of votes in the Company (including Class B shares owned by the Company). Each call option entitles its holder to acquire one (1) repurchased Class B share in the Company during the period starting 9 September 2025 until 5 June 2026. Repurchases of call options cannot  however  take place during such periods when trading in shares in the Company is prohibited by Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 (“Market Abuse Regulation”) or any other applicable legislation in force.b) The acquisition price of shares when exercising call options is to correspond to 120 percent of the volume-weighted average price for the Company’s Class B shares on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange during the period from 25 August 2022 through 7 September 2022. This redemption price may be recalculated during the maturity of the call option programme under certain conditions.c) The right to acquire call options shall apply to Group management and another 17 executives of the Bergman & Beving Group with the direct possibility to influence the Group’s earnings. The President & CEO will be offered a maximum of 30 000 call options  four individuals will be offered a maximum of 20 000 call options and the others a maximum of 5 000 call options.d) If an individual entitled to receive an allotment refrains  in whole or in part  from acquiring the offered call options then such unacquired call options will be distributed pro rata between the individuals entitled to receive call options who have presented a written application stating that they are interested in acquiring additional call options.e) The Board is to decide on the final distribution in accordance with the principles presented in Items c) and d) above.f) A notification to acquire call options must be made not later than 8 September 2022.g) The premium for call options shall correspond to the market value of the call options using an external independent assessment in accordance with the Black & Scholes model. The measurement period for the assessment of the option premium is to be based on the volume-weighted average price for the Company’s Class B shares on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange during the period from 25 August 2022 through 7 September 2022.h) Based on a price for the Company’s share of SEK 107.00 and on other market conditions existing on 30 June 2022 and the Board’s proposal for a dividend for the 2021/2022 operating year  the value per option  according to an external independent assessment  has been calculated to SEK 11.70. The total value for all options is approximately MSEK 2.5.i) Issuing call options to employees outside of Sweden is dependent on tax effects  that there are no legal obstacles and that the Board deems that such an issue can take place with reasonable administrative and economic resources. The Board shall have the right to make minor adjustments to the Programme brought about by applicable foreign laws and rules.j) Call options are freely transferable taking into account pre-emption agreements with the Company. Pre-emption of call options shall be at market value. The Company is entitled to repurchase issued call options.k) The number of shares that the call options entitle holders to acquire  and the redemption price  may be recalculated due to stock dividends  the consolidation or split of shares  new share issues or a reduction in share capital or similar measures. The time for the conveyance of shares may be brought forward due to a merger or similar measures.l) To encourage participation in the Programme  a subsidy in the form of a cash gross salary will be made to the holder of the option corresponding to the paid premium for each call option. The subsidy will be paid in September 2024 provided the holder of the option has not been terminated from the Group or that the call options acquired from the Company were not divested before this date.m) The Company has a right to repurchase the call options from the holder if the option holder does not wish to use all acquired call options and reports this to the Company during the redemption period. Acquisitions of options shall be at a price that at any given time corresponds to the highest market value. Repurchases of call options cannot  however  take place during such periods when trading in shares in the Company is prohibited by Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 (“Market Abuse Regulation”) (or any other applicable legislation in force).n) Within the framework of the conditions and guidelines stated above  the Board is responsible for preparing and managing the details of the Programme.o) The complete terms and conditions for the options are presented in an appendix on the Company’s website at www.bergmanbeving.comThe costs of the Programme mainly comprise the subsidy to be paid in September 2024 as above  and the social security fees that will accrue on this subsidy as well as administrative costs for recruiting external consultants and providers of administrative services in connection with the design of the call option programme. The total cost of the subsidy  including social security fees  is estimated at approximately MSEK 2.5 after corporate tax (based on the market conditions on 30 June 2022). The option premium totalling approximately MSEK 2.5  which the Company will receive upon the conveyance of the call options  corresponds to the subsidy  which is why the Programme does not entail any net cost to the Company’s equity.The grounds for deviating from the shareholders’ preferential rights and the Board’s motives for implementing the Programme are that executives of the Bergman & Beving Group through their own investment can participate and strive for a positive value performance for the Company’s shares and thereby more closely align the interests of these executives with those of the Company’s shareholders. The purpose of the Programme is also to contribute to a long-term increase in share ownership by executives in Bergman & Beving. In addition  the Programme is expected to create the conditions to retain and recruit qualified personnel to the Bergman & Beving Group  provide competitive remuneration and unite the interests of shareholders and executives. The executives included in the Programme are a group that  in an otherwise decentralised organisation  have the opportunity to create a positive impact on earnings through cooperation and efficiency enhancements. Against this background  the Board deems that the implementation of the Programme will have a positive impact on the continued development of the Bergman & Beving Group and that the Programme benefits both shareholders and the Company.The Company already has three share-based incentive programmes: “2019 Share-based incentive programme ” “2020 Share-based incentive programme” and “2021 Share-based incentive programme.”As part of the 2019 programme  20 executives acquired a total of 270 000 call options  which entitle the holders to acquire an equal number of Class B shares in the Company.

China's most valuable tech enterprise made just 32 investments and acquisitions in the first half of this year  which accounted for about a quarter of its 129 total transactions in the same period in 2021  according to data from ITjuzi  a market research firm that tracks deals in China's internet industry.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge  our new platform of curated content with explainers  FAQs  analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Shenzhen-based Tencent  which was once thought of as ""owning half of the mountains and rivers"" in China's tech industry because of its aggressive investment strategy  declined to comment.Internet giant Tencent Holdings recorded a sharp decline in the number of its investment and acquisition deals during the first half of this year. Photo: Shutterstock alt=Internet giant Tencent Holdings recorded a sharp decline in the number of its investment and acquisition deals during the first half of this year. Photo: Shutterstock>Investments have been more financially important for Tencent  according to Arete Research. It indicated that Tencent's pre-tax profit from investment  for example  contributed to 63 per cent of its overall income in 2021  compared to 36 and 15 per cent in 2020 and 2019.Story continues""With the collapse in both public and private valuations  investment gains are unlikely to provide a further boost to Tencent's earnings "" said Richard Kramer  founder of Arete Research and a long-time analyst covering Tencent. ""We have long argued that investors should value China's internet [industry] only on operational parts of businesses  not one-off gains  especially from opaque private stakes.""Tencent's shares in Hong Kong closed down 0.71 per cent to HK$335.40 on Wednesday  after the company was once again not granted any new video game licence by regulators  continuing a year-long drought.With a tech empire that touches the digital lives of nearly all of China's more than 1 billion internet users  Tencent has been actively investing in a wide variety of companies. These holdings amount to US$130 billion  27 per cent higher than the year before  according to the company's 2021 annual report.In June  Tencent lost US$7.4 billion of its market value in Hong Kong trading after major shareholder Prosus  which is listed in Euronext Amsterdam  announced a plan to trim its stake in the WeChat operator to fund a stock repurchase programme.Tencent has also cut its shareholdings in various firms. Earlier in June  the company reduced its stake in Hong Kong-listed Koolearn Technology  which is 55.7 per cent owned by China's biggest private tutoring group New Oriental Education & Technology.In January  Tencent raised US$3 billion from selling some of its shares in Sea  the Singapore-based tech conglomerate known as Southeast Asia's most valuable company. In response to Beijing's antitrust demands  Tencent in December announced that it would offload its US$16 billion stake in JD.com  the country's second-largest e-commerce services provider  and distribute those shares as a special dividend to investors.While there are no explicit regulatory restrictions on most Chinese firms' external investments  there is a general understanding that Beijing is wary of Big Tech companies' expansion initiatives  according to another industry source  who also declined to be identified.That reflects the dilemma that Tencent - along with its other major internet peers on the mainland - face  as they consider pursuing fewer acquisitions and more divestments to abide by Beijing's stance on Big Tech.In May  Beijing unveiled a 33-point package of policy items to help get the country's flagging economy back on track. There are no guarantees  however  that regulators would totally ease up on their crackdowns  especially those targeting Big Tech firms.A man walks by an entrance at TikTok owner ByteDance's headquarters in Beijing on July 7  2020.

Photo: Reuters>Tencent's latest cutbacks at its investment department comes months after Beijing-based tech unicorn ByteDance dissolved its strategic investment unit  which involved the reassignment of about 100 employees  in response to Beijing's stand against ""irrational expansion of capital""  part of its increased scrutiny of China's Big Tech companies.The number of investments and acquisitions by ByteDance dropped to only nine in the first half of this year  compared with 27 deals in the same period in 2021  according to data from ITjuzi.The market tracker also estimated that investment and acquisition deals made by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding  owner of the South China Morning Post  declined to 14 in the first half from 19 a year ago. Baidu  meanwhile  recorded 22 external investment and acquisition deals in the first half  a modest fall from 24 a year earlier.Regulators  meanwhile  have remained vigilant for potential violations by Big Tech firms. The State Administration for Market Regulation  for example  announced last Sunday that it had punished Tencent  Alibaba and Didi Chuxing  among others  for failing to report past merger deals for antitrust review.While the Cyberspace Administration of China has denied issuing guidelines for vetting major investment deals by the country's Big Tech firms  the Post reported in January that the regulator has a mandate to enhance its supervision of internet firms  and that the agency is exploring how to perform its new role in an effective way.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP)  the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

As a result  we now expect production to be at the bottom of 2022 guidance. Increased pricing has more than offset production and supported revenues.Our balance sheet continued to strengthen  with a $17.3 million reduction in net debt at the end of the first half  after paying the $24.1 million 2021 final dividend. We are targeting a dividend payout ratio of 25% profit after tax for 2022.”Q2 2022 overviewRecord Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.00 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 30 June 2022 (30 June 2021: 0.14)  with zero Lost Time Injuries recorded during the quarterHeavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 353 600 tonnes in Q2 2022  a 19% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (436 600 tonnes)  due to higher slimes levels  leading to a 10% reduction in ore grades and an 8% reduction in excavated ore tonnesIlmenite production of 242 900 tonnes in Q2 2022  a 14% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (283 900 tonnes)  broadly in line with the reduction in HMC processedPrimary zircon production of 13 600 tonnes  a 9% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (14 900 tonnes)  also due to reduced HMC processed but partially offset by increased recoveriesTotal shipments of finished products of 192 800 tonnes  a 23% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (249 700 tonnes) due to reduced transshipment capacity  as one of Kenmare’s two vessels began its five-yearly dry dock in May 2022  exacerbated by poor weather conditionsKenmare expects production of all finished products to be at the bottom of its 2022 guidance rangesStrong ilmenite pricing in Q2 2022 and demand looks to remain robust in Q3  supported by low inventories and continued supply constraintsGlobal zircon market tightened further in Q2 2022  as global inventories were drawn down in 2021  and the market is expected to remain tight in Q3Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (“RUPS”) project became fully operational in May 2022 and has proved successful at mitigating a number of electrical supply disruptionsAt the end of H1 2022  net debt reduced to $65.5 million (31 December 2021: $82.8 million)  as a result of continuing strong free-cashflow generation reflecting higher prices  which more than offset lower sales volumesStory continuesOperations updateProduction from the Moma Mine in Q2 and H1 2022 was as follows:Q2 2022 Q2 2021 Q1 2022 H1 2022 H1 2021 tonnes % variance % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 10 070 000 -8% 7% 19 461 000 -2% Grade1 4.23% -10% -6% 4.35% -7% Production HMC production 353 600 -19% -8% 738 300 -8% HMC processed 367 300 -13% -2% 740 600 -9% Ilmenite 242 900 -14% -5% 499 700 -11% Primary zircon 13 600 -9% 5% 26 500 -6% Rutile 2 100 -5% 5% 4 000 -5% Concentrates2 9 800 -17% -8% 20 500 -1% Shipments 192 800 -23% -17% 424 300 -29%Excavated ore tonnage and grade prior to any floor losses. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.Kenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 30 June 2022 was 0.00 per 200 000 hours worked (Q2 2021: 0.14)  with zero Lost Time Injuries recorded during the quarter. In late June 2022  Kenmare achieved the milestone of 10 million hours worked without a Lost Time Injury and the Company remains focused on maintaining its strongest ever safety performance.HMC production was 353 600 tonnes in Q2 2022  representing a 19% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (436 600 tonnes). This was a result of a 10% decrease in ore grades to 4.23% (Q2 2021: 4.70%) and an 8% decrease in excavated ore volumes to 10.1 million tonnes (Q2 2021: 10.9 million tonnes).HMC production was impacted by increased slimes levels during the quarter  primarily at Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A. WCP capacity was limited due to higher levels of slimes recirculation from the mining pond  which necessitated a reduction in supplemental dry mining  lowering the grade mined. Higher slimes also led to poorer recoveries and reduced HMC quality. Kenmare expects slimes in the ore to remain at similar levels in H2 2022  but slimes management controls have been improved during the quarter  reducing recirculation. This should allow for increased excavated ore and improved recoveries  leading to higher levels of production in H2 2022.Ilmenite production was 242 900 tonnes  a 14% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (283 900 tonnes)  falling broadly in line with decreased HMC processed  however also impacted slightly by the lower HMC quality.Primary zircon production was 13 600 tonnes in Q2 2022  a 9% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (Q2 2021: 14 900 tonnes)  and rutile production was 2 100 tonnes  down 5% (Q2 2021: 2 200 tonnes)  reflecting lower HMC processed (and lower HMC quality) but partially offset by increased recoveries. Concentrates production was 9 800 tonnes  down 17% (Q2 2021: 11 800 tonnes) due to reduced HMC processed and quality  and stronger primary zircon recoveries reducing zircon available for concentrates.As a result of the reduced production in H1 2022  Kenmare expects production of all finished products to be at the bottom of its 2022 guidance ranges  as published on 13 January 2022.As previously announced  one of Kenmare’s two transshipment vessels  the Bronagh J  left site in early May 2022 for its five-yearly dry dock maintenance work  reducing Kenmare’s shipping capacity significantly for the quarter. This reduction will continue during Q3 until the Bronagh J returns to site  which is expected in mid-August. However  there will be sufficient capacity to catch up when both vessels are operating  with finished product inventories expected to return to normal levels during H1 2023.Total shipments in Q2 2022 were 192 800 tonnes  a 23% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (249 600 tonnes)  due to reduced shipping capacity and compounded by poor weather conditions and the arrival of some customer-chartered vessels being delayed. Shipments comprised 179 300 tonnes of ilmenite  8 700 tonnes of primary zircon  and 4 800 tonnes of concentrates. No rutile was shipped during the period.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q2 2022 was 9 200 tonnes  compared to 22 900 tonnes at the end of Q1 2022  due to a drawdown of HMC stockpiles during the period to compensate for reduced HMC production. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q2 2022 was 214 900 tonnes  compared to 139 300 tonnes at the end of Q1 2022  reflecting the lower shipping capacity.Capital projects updateIn May 2022  the Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply project became fully operational. The objective of the RUPS is to improve power stability at the Mineral Separation Plant and make a significant contribution to Kenmare’s goal of further reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Since becoming operational  the RUPS has proved successful at mitigating a number of electrical supply disruptions in accordance with this objective.Work is continuing on the Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) for Nataka  where WCP A is expected to commence mining in 2025. Kenmare intends to provide an update on the progress of the PFS with its results for the six months ended 30 June 2022. As part of the PFS  WCP A is expected to have a desliming circuit installed to more efficiently mine the Nataka ore zone. A cost-benefit analysis is being conducted to investigate the acceleration of the installation of the desliming circuit ahead of the move. This has the potential to increase the effective WCP capacity and better mitigate against the slimes levels at the end of the Namalope mine path.Market updateKenmare achieved higher prices for its ilmenite and zircon products in Q2 2022 and this represented the seventh consecutive quarter of ilmenite price increases.Global demand for ilmenite grew further during the quarter due to robust downstream demand for titanium pigment  with pigment producers continuing to operate at high utilisation rates  particularly outside of China. Economic activity in China has been impacted by several city-wide COVID-19 related lockdowns  which reduced demand for titanium pigment and therefore ilmenite. Despite this  chloride pigment production continues to increase in China  resulting in growing demand for ilmenite of Kenmare’s quality.Production of ilmenite concentrates from Chinese companies in Mozambique continued to expand in Q2  while ilmenite production also increased from the United States  Malaysia  and Indonesia. However  global supply of titanium feedstocks remained insufficient to meet demand and pigment production was therefore constrained by feedstock availability and low inventories.Moving into Q3 2022  lower anticipated global growth is expected to reduce demand for titanium pigment. Despite this  Kenmare continues to experience demand for its ilmenite in excess of its ability to supply  as high-quality ilmenite remains in short supply.The zircon market tightened further in Q2 2022 as inventories in the global supply chain were largely drawn down in 2021. Demand has been strong in all major regions except China  which was also impacted by severe COVID-19-related lockdowns. With no significant new supply entering the market  zircon remains in short supply and prices increased throughout H1 2022. The positive fundamentals for zircon are expected to continue into Q3 2022.Finance updateOn 1 June 2022  Kenmare paid its 2021 final dividend of USc25.42 per share. This was the balancing payment of a 2021 full year dividend of USc32.71 per share  representing a dividend payout ratio of 25% of profit after tax and up 227% from 2020. For 2022  Kenmare is targeting the same dividend payout ratio.Following the 2021 final dividend distribution of $24.1 million and debt principal repayments of $55.7 million  cash and cash equivalents were $30.7 million as at 30 June 2022 (31 December 2021: $69.1 million)  while gross bank loans  including accrued interest  were $96.2 million (31 December 2021: $151.9 million). Gross debt has reduced following the commencement of semi-annual repayments of the Term Loan in March 2022 and the repayment in full of the $40 million Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”). The RCF continues to be available for redraw.Accordingly  as at 30 June 2022  Kenmare’s net debt had reduced by $17.3 million to $65.5 million  compared to $82.8 million net debt at 31 December 2021.Kenmare will announce its results for the six months ended 30 June 2022 on 17 August 2022.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Doug Keatingedkeatinge@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 037 4163About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

July 14  2022 A Phase 3 trial assessing the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) met its primary endpoint of histological disease remission at 16 weeks with both higher and lower dose weight-tiered regimens. There are no approved treatments for children with EoE under 12 years of age.Naimish Patel  M.D.Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation  Sanofi“We are incredibly excited to share results from this Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating Dupixent in young children suffering from eosinophilic esophagitis – the first ever to show positive results across a variety of primary and secondary endpoints. The lack of treatment options for children living with eosinophilic esophagitis leaves many caregivers with the stress and burden of adapting their child’s meals and their entire family’s daily schedules to ensure healthy growth and development. In some cases  they must resort to off-label use of poorly studied treatments like steroids that can pose serious health risks when used long term. The faster and larger than anticipated enrollment in this trial further emphasizes the unmet treatment needs for children with EoE and underscores the significance of these first-ever positive results.”Story continuesEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. In children  common symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to the unapproved therapies they have been treated with and potentially require advanced therapy.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer  Regeneron“Dupixent is the first medicine to alleviate key signs of eosinophilic esophagitis in children as young as 1 year of age in a Phase 3 trial. The efficacy of Dupixent demonstrates that  in this age group  as in adults  IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this debilitating disease. Eosinophilic esophagitis can turn the basic and life-sustaining act of eating into a painful experience at a point in children’s lives when proper nutrition and achieving a healthy weight is critical to ensuring they grow and thrive. The positive results from this Phase 3 pediatric trial show Dupixent has the potential to improve signs of eosinophilic esophagitis and support healthy weight gain in children from their first birthday.”In the Phase 3 trial  102 children aged 1 to 11 were randomized to receive Dupixent  in either a higher dose (n=37) or lower dose (n=31) regimen based on body weight  or placebo (n=34). At 16 weeks  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose Dupixent achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) compared to 3% of children on placebo (p<0.0001 for both). Additionally  children receiving higher dose Dupixent experienced the following changes at week 16:86% reduction in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count from baseline compared to a 21% increase for placebo (p<0.0001).0.88 and 0.84 reduction from baseline in disease severity and extent  respectively  as measured at the microscopic level in biopsy specimens compared to a 0.02 and 0.05 increase for placebo (both p<0.0001).3.5-point reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline compared to a 0.3-point increase for placebo (p<0.0001).A numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced symptoms of EoE from baseline  as reported by caregivers (Pediatric EOE signs/symptoms questionnaire [PESQ-C])  compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Sanofi and Regeneron used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves.As part of a prespecified exploratory analysis a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline compared to 0.29 for placebo.Histological  anatomic and cellular secondary endpoints were also analyzed for the lower dose group  with all being nominally significant and generally comparable with the higher dose. More detailed results will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting  including additional data for the endpoints in the lower dose group.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% for Dupixent and 91% for placebo. AEs more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included COVID-19 (21% Dupixent  0% placebo; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (9% Dupixent  6% placebo)  headache (8% Dupixent  3% placebo)  viral gastroenteritis (6% Dupixent  3% placebo)  diarrhea (6% Dupixent  3% placebo) and nausea (6% Dupixent  0% placebo). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% for Dupixent and 6% for placebo.In May 2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent 300 mg weekly to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg after granting the medicine Priority Review.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. These data will be discussed with regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ≥5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission. Secondary endpoints included histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of tissue scarring in the esophagus (EoE-HSS grade and stage scores  which measure changes in eight cellular and tissue features on 0-3 scales  respectively)  and abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g. stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period to evaluate long-term outcomes.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and EoE  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 400 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that a Phase 3 trial assessing the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in ...,"First and only investigational Phase 3 trial to show positive results in these young children; results follow recent approval of Dupixent in people with eosinophilic esophagitis aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kilogramsTrial met its primary endpoint  with 68% of patients on higher dose Dupixent and 58% on lower dose Dupixent achieving histological disease remission at 16 weeksFifth pediatric pivotal trial across three type 2 inflammatory diseases to reinforce the well-established efficacy and safety profile of DupixentTARRYTOWN  N.Y. and PARIS  July 14  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that a Phase 3 trial assessing the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) met its primary endpoint of histological disease remission at 16 weeks with both higher and lower dose weight-tiered regimens. There are no approved treatments for children with EoE under 12 years of age.""Dupixent is the first medicine to alleviate key signs of eosinophilic esophagitis in children as young as 1 year of age in a Phase 3 trial. The efficacy of Dupixent demonstrates that in this age group  as in adults  IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this debilitating disease "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Eosinophilic esophagitis can turn the basic and life-sustaining act of eating into a painful experience at a point in children's lives when proper nutrition and achieving a healthy weight is critical to ensuring they grow and thrive. The positive results from this Phase 3 pediatric trial show Dupixent has the potential to improve signs of eosinophilic esophagitis and support healthy weight gain in children from their first birthday.""EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. In children  common symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to the unapproved therapies they have been treated with and potentially require advanced therapy.Story continues""We are incredibly excited to share results from this Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating Dupixent in young children suffering from eosinophilic esophagitis – the first ever to show positive results across a variety of primary and secondary endpoints. The lack of treatment options for children living with eosinophilic esophagitis leaves many caregivers with the stress and burden of adapting their child's meals and their entire family's daily schedules to ensure healthy growth and development. In some cases  they must resort to off-label use of poorly studied treatments like steroids that can pose serious health risks when used long term "" said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""The faster and larger than anticipated enrollment in this trial further emphasizes the unmet treatment needs for children with EoE and underscores the significance of these first-ever positive results.""In the Phase 3 trial  102 children aged 1 to 11 were randomized to receive Dupixent  in either a higher dose (n=37) or lower dose (n=31) regimen based on body weight  or placebo (n=34). At 16 weeks  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose Dupixent achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) compared to 3% of children on placebo (p<0.0001 for both). Additionally  children receiving higher dose Dupixent experienced the following changes at week 16:86% reduction in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count from baseline compared to a 21% increase for placebo (p<0.0001).0.88 and 0.84 reduction from baseline in disease severity and extent  respectively  as measured at the microscopic level in biopsy specimens compared to a 0.02 and 0.05 increase for placebo (both p<0.0001).3.5-point reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline compared to a 0.3-point increase for placebo (p<0.0001).A numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced symptoms of EoE from baseline  as reported by caregivers (Pediatric EOE signs/symptoms questionnaire [PESQ-C])  compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves.As part of a prespecified exploratory analysis  a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline compared to 0.29 for placebo.Histological  anatomic and cellular secondary endpoints were also analyzed for the lower dose group  with all being nominally significant and generally comparable with the higher dose. More detailed results will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting  including additional data for the endpoints in the lower dose group.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% for Dupixent and 91% for placebo. AEs more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included COVID-19 (21% Dupixent  0% placebo; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (9% Dupixent  6% placebo)  headache (8% Dupixent  3% placebo)  viral gastroenteritis (6% Dupixent  3% placebo)  diarrhea (6% Dupixent  3% placebo) and nausea (6% Dupixent  0% placebo). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% for Dupixent and 6% for placebo.In May 2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent 300 mg weekly to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg after granting the medicine Priority Review.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. These data will be discussed with regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ≥5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission. Secondary endpoints included histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of tissue scarring in the esophagus (EoE-HSS grade and stage scores  which measure changes in eight cellular and tissue features on 0-3 scales  respectively)  and abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g. stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period to evaluate long-term outcomes.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and EoE  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 400 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Oaktree was one of several private equity houses that began acquiring distressed property debt and real estate assets in Ireland after the financial crisis.Mr Bickle stayed at Glenveagh just two years after its initial public offering before returning to the UK where he founded another investment firm  Eagle Street  which has been active in the Irish build-to-rent market  acquiring several assets from Glenveagh.“Even after departing as CEO  Justin remained a committed shareholder and supporter of our business ” Glenveagh said in a statement.“We know that he took great satisfaction from the progress which Glenveagh has made on the journey which the three of us mapped all those years ago. We are deeply saddened that he will not be here to see his dreams realised.”Eagle Street co-founder Shane Scully said the company’s main priority was providing comfort and support to Mr Bickle’s family.""A trusted colleague and close friend to all at Eagle Street  Justin brought immense energy to the table and will be sorely missed ” Mr Scully said.Mr Bickle was also a founder and managing partner of Postbridge Capital  a private investment and capital advisory firm  and he served on the board of Nordic Aviation Capital  the largest lessor of regional aircraft in the world.He began his career as a UK solicitor in 1995 and moved up to partner in the Wall Street restructuring firm of Cadwalader  Wickersham and Taft before committing fully to the world of private equity.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that a Phase 3 trial assessing the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) met its primary endpoint of histological disease remission at 16 weeks with both higher and lower dose weight-tiered regimens. There are no approved treatments for children with EoE under 12 years of age.""Dupixent is the first medicine to alleviate key signs of eosinophilic esophagitis in children as young as 1 year of age in a Phase 3 trial. The efficacy of Dupixent demonstrates that in this age group  as in adults  IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this debilitating disease "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Eosinophilic esophagitis can turn the basic and life-sustaining act of eating into a painful experience at a point in children's lives when proper nutrition and achieving a healthy weight is critical to ensuring they grow and thrive. The positive results from this Phase 3 pediatric trial show Dupixent has the potential to improve signs of eosinophilic esophagitis and support healthy weight gain in children from their first birthday.""EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. In children  common symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to the unapproved therapies they have been treated with and potentially require advanced therapy.""We are incredibly excited to share results from this Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating Dupixent in young children suffering from eosinophilic esophagitis – the first ever to show positive results across a variety of primary and secondary endpoints. The lack of treatment options for children living with eosinophilic esophagitis leaves many caregivers with the stress and burden of adapting their child's meals and their entire family's daily schedules to ensure healthy growth and development. In some cases  they must resort to off-label use of poorly studied treatments like steroids that can pose serious health risks when used long term "" said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""The faster and larger than anticipated enrollment in this trial further emphasizes the unmet treatment needs for children with EoE and underscores the significance of these first-ever positive results.""In the Phase 3 trial  102 children aged 1 to 11 were randomized to receive Dupixent  in either a higher dose (n=37) or lower dose (n=31) regimen based on body weight  or placebo (n=34). At 16 weeks  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose Dupixent achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) compared to 3% of children on placebo (p<0.0001 for both). Additionally  children receiving higher dose Dupixent experienced the following changes at week 16:86% reduction in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count from baseline compared to a 21% increase for placebo (p<0.0001).0.88 and 0.84 reduction from baseline in disease severity and extent  respectively  as measured at the microscopic level in biopsy specimens compared to a 0.02 and 0.05 increase for placebo (both p<0.0001).3.5-point reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline compared to a 0.3-point increase for placebo (p<0.0001).A numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced symptoms of EoE from baseline  as reported by caregivers (Pediatric EOE signs/symptoms questionnaire [PESQ-C])  compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves.As part of a prespecified exploratory analysis  a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline compared to 0.29 for placebo.Histological  anatomic and cellular secondary endpoints were also analyzed for the lower dose group  with all being nominally significant and generally comparable with the higher dose. More detailed results will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting  including additional data for the endpoints in the lower dose group.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% for Dupixent and 91% for placebo. AEs more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included COVID-19 (21% Dupixent  0% placebo; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (9% Dupixent  6% placebo)  headache (8% Dupixent  3% placebo)  viral gastroenteritis (6% Dupixent  3% placebo)  diarrhea (6% Dupixent  3% placebo) and nausea (6% Dupixent  0% placebo). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% for Dupixent and 6% for placebo.In May 2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent 300 mg weekly to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg after granting the medicine Priority Review.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. These data will be discussed with regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ≥5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission. Secondary endpoints included histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of tissue scarring in the esophagus (EoE-HSS grade and stage scores  which measure changes in eight cellular and tissue features on 0-3 scales  respectively)  and abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g. stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period to evaluate long-term outcomes.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and EoE  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 400 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that a Phase 3 trial assessing the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) met its primary endpoint of histological disease remission at 16 weeks with both higher and lower dose weight-tiered regimens. There are no approved treatments for children with EoE under 12 years of age.""Dupixent is the first medicine to alleviate key signs of eosinophilic esophagitis in children as young as 1 year of age in a Phase 3 trial. The efficacy of Dupixent demonstrates that in this age group  as in adults  IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this debilitating disease "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Eosinophilic esophagitis can turn the basic and life-sustaining act of eating into a painful experience at a point in children's lives when proper nutrition and achieving a healthy weight is critical to ensuring they grow and thrive. The positive results from this Phase 3 pediatric trial show Dupixent has the potential to improve signs of eosinophilic esophagitis and support healthy weight gain in children from their first birthday.""EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. In children  common symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to the unapproved therapies they have been treated with and potentially require advanced therapy.""We are incredibly excited to share results from this Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating Dupixent in young children suffering from eosinophilic esophagitis – the first ever to show positive results across a variety of primary and secondary endpoints. The lack of treatment options for children living with eosinophilic esophagitis leaves many caregivers with the stress and burden of adapting their child's meals and their entire family's daily schedules to ensure healthy growth and development. In some cases  they must resort to off-label use of poorly studied treatments like steroids that can pose serious health risks when used long term "" said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""The faster and larger than anticipated enrollment in this trial further emphasizes the unmet treatment needs for children with EoE and underscores the significance of these first-ever positive results.""In the Phase 3 trial  102 children aged 1 to 11 were randomized to receive Dupixent  in either a higher dose (n=37) or lower dose (n=31) regimen based on body weight  or placebo (n=34). At 16 weeks  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose Dupixent achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) compared to 3% of children on placebo (p<0.0001 for both). Additionally  children receiving higher dose Dupixent experienced the following changes at week 16:86% reduction in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count from baseline compared to a 21% increase for placebo (p<0.0001).0.88 and 0.84 reduction from baseline in disease severity and extent  respectively  as measured at the microscopic level in biopsy specimens compared to a 0.02 and 0.05 increase for placebo (both p<0.0001).3.5-point reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline compared to a 0.3-point increase for placebo (p<0.0001).A numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced symptoms of EoE from baseline  as reported by caregivers (Pediatric EOE signs/symptoms questionnaire [PESQ-C])  compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves.As part of a prespecified exploratory analysis  a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline compared to 0.29 for placebo.Histological  anatomic and cellular secondary endpoints were also analyzed for the lower dose group  with all being nominally significant and generally comparable with the higher dose. More detailed results will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting  including additional data for the endpoints in the lower dose group.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% for Dupixent and 91% for placebo. AEs more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included COVID-19 (21% Dupixent  0% placebo; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (9% Dupixent  6% placebo)  headache (8% Dupixent  3% placebo)  viral gastroenteritis (6% Dupixent  3% placebo)  diarrhea (6% Dupixent  3% placebo) and nausea (6% Dupixent  0% placebo). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% for Dupixent and 6% for placebo.In May 2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent 300 mg weekly to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg after granting the medicine Priority Review.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. These data will be discussed with regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ≥5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission. Secondary endpoints included histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of tissue scarring in the esophagus (EoE-HSS grade and stage scores  which measure changes in eight cellular and tissue features on 0-3 scales  respectively)  and abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g. stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period to evaluate long-term outcomes.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and EoE  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 400 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. These statements include projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions  statements regarding plans  objectives  intentions and expectations with respect to future financial results  events  operations  services  product development and potential  and statements regarding future performance. Forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words ""expects""  ""anticipates""  ""believes""  ""intends""  ""estimates""  ""plans"" and similar expressions. Although Sanofi's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable  investors are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Sanofi  that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied or projected by  the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include among other things  the uncertainties inherent in research and development  future clinical data and analysis  including post marketing  decisions by regulatory authorities  such as the FDA or the EMA  regarding whether and when to approve any drug  device or biological application that may be filed for any such product candidates as well as their decisions regarding labelling and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of such product candidates  the fact that product candidates if approved may not be commercially successful  the future approval and commercial success of therapeutic alternatives  Sanofi's ability to benefit from external growth opportunities  to complete related transactions and/or obtain regulatory clearances  risks associated with intellectual property and any related pending or future litigation and the ultimate outcome of such litigation  trends in exchange rates and prevailing interest rates  volatile economic and market conditions  cost containment initiatives and subsequent changes thereto  and the impact that COVID-19 will have on us  our customers  suppliers  vendors  and other business partners  and the financial condition of any one of them  as well as on our employees and on the global economy as a whole. Any material effect of COVID-19 on any of the foregoing could also adversely impact us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise of which we are not currently aware and may exacerbate other previously identified risks. The risks and uncertainties also include the uncertainties discussed or identified in the public filings with the SEC and the AMF made by Sanofi  including those listed under ""Risk Factors"" and ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in Sanofi's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021.
