If a director invoices his/her directors’ fee through a wholly owned company or private business  the fee is to be increased by an amount corresponding to the social security contributions and value added tax stipulated by law.Auditors’ fees are  as in previous years  to be paid in return for approved invoices.Item 13 Election of directors and Chairman of the BoardThe Election Committee proposes re-election of directors Fredrik Börjesson  Charlotte Hansson  Henrik Hedelius  Malin Nordesjö  Niklas Stenberg and Jörgen Wigh.The Election Committee proposes re-election of Jörgen Wigh as Chairman of the Board.A presentation of the current members of the Board is available from the Company’s website www.bergmanbeving.com.Item 14 Election of auditorThe Election Committee proposes re-election of the registered accounting firm KPMG AB as the Company’s auditor until the end of the next Annual General Meeting. The Election Committee’s proposal follows the Audit Committee’s recommendation.PROPOSAL BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR RESOLUTION ON ITEMS 9b AND 15–17 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ABOVEItem 9b Resolution concerning the appropriation of the Company’s profit or loss as shown in the balance sheet adopted by the MeetingThe Board proposes that the Company’s profits be disposed of so that MSEK 90 (80) is distributed to the shareholders and the remaining MSEK 945 (992) of the Company’s profits be brought forward. This means that the Board proposes to shareholders the distribution of SEK 3.40 (3.00) per share and 26 August 2022 as the record date for receiving dividends. If the Annual General Meeting adopts the proposal  dividends are expected to be disbursed through Euroclear Sweden AB on 31 August 2022 to the shareholders recorded in the shareholders’ register as of the record date.Item 15 Resolution on approval of remuneration reportThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Boards’ report on remuneration pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 16 Resolution regarding the authorisation of the Board to decide on the acquisition and conveyance of treasury sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to authorise the Board  prior to the next Annual General Meeting  to acquire a maximum number of Class B shares so that the Company’s holding of treasury shares at no time exceeds 10 percent of the total number of shares in the Company. Acquisitions are to be carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with the stock exchange rules at a price that is within the registered price range at any given time  meaning the range between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price. Acquisitions are to be paid for in cash and may be carried out on one or more occasions.The Board also proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorise the Board  prior to the next Annual General Meeting  to divest Class B shares held in treasury by the Company in a manner other than on Nasdaq Stockholm. This authorisation may be utilised on one or more occasions and encompasses all shares held in treasury by the Company at the time of the Board’s decision. The authorisation also entitles the Board to decide to deviate from the shareholders’ preferential rights and stipulates that payment may be made by other means than money.The purpose of this authorisation is to be able to adapt the Group’s capital structure and to pay for future acquisitions of businesses and operations using treasury shares. Holdings of treasury shares may also be used to secure the Company’s obligations under the proposed share-based incentive programme and previous incentive programmes.In accordance with the above  a resolution on the Board’s proposal requires the support of shareholders representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and the shares represented at the Meeting.Item 17 Resolution on the issuance of call options on repurchased shares and the conveyance of repurchased shares to executives (“2022 Share-based incentive programme”).The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to adopt a long-term incentive programme  2022 Share-based incentive programme (the “Programme”). The Programme  which is proposed to include a total of 25 executives in the Bergman & Beving Group  means participants are offered an opportunity to acquire call options at market price for Bergman & Beving’s repurchased Class B shares in the Company and that participants will  after a two-year period  receive a certain subsidy on the paid premium for the options.The Board’s proposal also entails the Annual General Meeting approving that the Company  in deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  transfers up to 210 000 of the Company’s repurchased Class B shares to option holders at the established redemption price in connection with any exercise of call options (subject to any recalculations). Finally  the Board’s proposal means the Annual General Meeting approves that Class B shares acquired by the Company in line with earlier authorisation can also be conveyed to guarantee the supply of shares in accordance with the proposed Programme.The Company currently holds a total of 868 677 Class B shares in the Company.The proposal was prepared by the Company’s Compensation Committee in consultation with the Company’s Board.The decision to propose the Programme to the Annual General Meeting was taken by the Board. The Company’s directors are not covered by the Programme.The Programme has the following key conditions:a) The number of call options issued should not exceed 210 000  corresponding to approximately 0.8 percent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.6 percent of the total number of votes in the Company (including Class B shares owned by the Company). Each call option entitles its holder to acquire one (1) repurchased Class B share in the Company during the period starting 9 September 2025 until 5 June 2026. Repurchases of call options cannot  however  take place during such periods when trading in shares in the Company is prohibited by Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 (“Market Abuse Regulation”) or any other applicable legislation in force.b) The acquisition price of shares when exercising call options is to correspond to 120 percent of the volume-weighted average price for the Company’s Class B shares on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange during the period from 25 August 2022 through 7 September 2022. This redemption price may be recalculated during the maturity of the call option programme under certain conditions.c) The right to acquire call options shall apply to Group management and another 17 executives of the Bergman & Beving Group with the direct possibility to influence the Group’s earnings. The President & CEO will be offered a maximum of 30 000 call options  four individuals will be offered a maximum of 20 000 call options and the others a maximum of 5 000 call options.d) If an individual entitled to receive an allotment refrains  in whole or in part  from acquiring the offered call options then such unacquired call options will be distributed pro rata between the individuals entitled to receive call options who have presented a written application stating that they are interested in acquiring additional call options.e) The Board is to decide on the final distribution in accordance with the principles presented in Items c) and d) above.f) A notification to acquire call options must be made not later than 8 September 2022.g) The premium for call options shall correspond to the market value of the call options using an external independent assessment in accordance with the Black & Scholes model. The measurement period for the assessment of the option premium is to be based on the volume-weighted average price for the Company’s Class B shares on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange during the period from 25 August 2022 through 7 September 2022.h) Based on a price for the Company’s share of SEK 107.00 and on other market conditions existing on 30 June 2022 and the Board’s proposal for a dividend for the 2021/2022 operating year  the value per option  according to an external independent assessment  has been calculated to SEK 11.70. The total value for all options is approximately MSEK 2.5.i) Issuing call options to employees outside of Sweden is dependent on tax effects  that there are no legal obstacles and that the Board deems that such an issue can take place with reasonable administrative and economic resources. The Board shall have the right to make minor adjustments to the Programme brought about by applicable foreign laws and rules.j) Call options are freely transferable taking into account pre-emption agreements with the Company. Pre-emption of call options shall be at market value. The Company is entitled to repurchase issued call options.k) The number of shares that the call options entitle holders to acquire  and the redemption price  may be recalculated due to stock dividends  the consolidation or split of shares  new share issues or a reduction in share capital or similar measures. The time for the conveyance of shares may be brought forward due to a merger or similar measures.l) To encourage participation in the Programme  a subsidy in the form of a cash gross salary will be made to the holder of the option corresponding to the paid premium for each call option. The subsidy will be paid in September 2024 provided the holder of the option has not been terminated from the Group or that the call options acquired from the Company were not divested before this date.m) The Company has a right to repurchase the call options from the holder if the option holder does not wish to use all acquired call options and reports this to the Company during the redemption period. Acquisitions of options shall be at a price that at any given time corresponds to the highest market value. Repurchases of call options cannot  however  take place during such periods when trading in shares in the Company is prohibited by Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 (“Market Abuse Regulation”) (or any other applicable legislation in force).n) Within the framework of the conditions and guidelines stated above  the Board is responsible for preparing and managing the details of the Programme.o) The complete terms and conditions for the options are presented in an appendix on the Company’s website at www.bergmanbeving.comThe costs of the Programme mainly comprise the subsidy to be paid in September 2024 as above  and the social security fees that will accrue on this subsidy as well as administrative costs for recruiting external consultants and providers of administrative services in connection with the design of the call option programme. The total cost of the subsidy  including social security fees  is estimated at approximately MSEK 2.5 after corporate tax (based on the market conditions on 30 June 2022). The option premium totalling approximately MSEK 2.5  which the Company will receive upon the conveyance of the call options  corresponds to the subsidy  which is why the Programme does not entail any net cost to the Company’s equity.The grounds for deviating from the shareholders’ preferential rights and the Board’s motives for implementing the Programme are that executives of the Bergman & Beving Group through their own investment can participate and strive for a positive value performance for the Company’s shares and thereby more closely align the interests of these executives with those of the Company’s shareholders. The purpose of the Programme is also to contribute to a long-term increase in share ownership by executives in Bergman & Beving. In addition  the Programme is expected to create the conditions to retain and recruit qualified personnel to the Bergman & Beving Group  provide competitive remuneration and unite the interests of shareholders and executives. The executives included in the Programme are a group that  in an otherwise decentralised organisation  have the opportunity to create a positive impact on earnings through cooperation and efficiency enhancements. Against this background  the Board deems that the implementation of the Programme will have a positive impact on the continued development of the Bergman & Beving Group and that the Programme benefits both shareholders and the Company.The Company already has three share-based incentive programmes: “2019 Share-based incentive programme ” “2020 Share-based incentive programme” and “2021 Share-based incentive programme.”As part of the 2019 programme  20 executives acquired a total of 270 000 call options  which entitle the holders to acquire an equal number of Class B shares in the Company. The redemption price for these call options is set at SEK 107.50 per share and the redemption period is from 12 September 2022 until 9 June 2023. When these 270 000 call options are fully exercised  the number of outstanding Class B shares will increase by 270 000 shares. These 270 000 shares correspond in full to previously repurchased Class B shares in the Company.As part of the 2020 programme  20 executives acquired a total of 244 000 call options  which entitle the holders to acquire an equal number of Class B shares in the Company. The redemption price for these call options is set at SEK 99.50 per share and the redemption period is from 11 September 2023 until 7 June 2024. When these 244 000 call options are fully exercised  the number of outstanding Class B shares will increase by 244 000 shares. These 244 000 shares correspond in full to previously repurchased Class B shares in the Company.As part of the 2021 programme  20 executives acquired a total of 178 000 call options  which entitle the holders to acquire an equal number of Class B shares in the Company. The redemption price for these call options is set at SEK 197.30 per share and the redemption period is from 16 September 2024 until 12 June 2025. When these 178 000 call options are fully exercised  the number of outstanding Class B shares will increase by 178 000 shares. These 178 000 shares correspond in full to previously repurchased Class B shares in the Company.The resolution at the General Meeting of Shareholders as proposed by the Board above is only valid if it is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast and the shares represented at the Meeting.SHARES AND VOTESThe Company has issued a total of 27 436 416 shares  of which 1 062 436 are Class A shares and 26 373 980 are Class B shares  of which 868 677 are held in treasury by the Company.

China's most valuable tech enterprise made just 32 investments and acquisitions in the first half of this year  which accounted for about a quarter of its 129 total transactions in the same period in 2021  according to data from ITjuzi  a market research firm that tracks deals in China's internet industry.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge  our new platform of curated content with explainers  FAQs  analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Shenzhen-based Tencent  which was once thought of as ""owning half of the mountains and rivers"" in China's tech industry because of its aggressive investment strategy  declined to comment.Internet giant Tencent Holdings recorded a sharp decline in the number of its investment and acquisition deals during the first half of this year. Photo: Shutterstock alt=Internet giant Tencent Holdings recorded a sharp decline in the number of its investment and acquisition deals during the first half of this year. Photo: Shutterstock>Investments have been more financially important for Tencent  according to Arete Research. It indicated that Tencent's pre-tax profit from investment  for example  contributed to 63 per cent of its overall income in 2021  compared to 36 and 15 per cent in 2020 and 2019.Story continues""With the collapse in both public and private valuations  investment gains are unlikely to provide a further boost to Tencent's earnings "" said Richard Kramer  founder of Arete Research and a long-time analyst covering Tencent. ""We have long argued that investors should value China's internet [industry] only on operational parts of businesses  not one-off gains  especially from opaque private stakes.""Tencent's shares in Hong Kong closed down 0.71 per cent to HK$335.40 on Wednesday  after the company was once again not granted any new video game licence by regulators  continuing a year-long drought.With a tech empire that touches the digital lives of nearly all of China's more than 1 billion internet users  Tencent has been actively investing in a wide variety of companies. These holdings amount to US$130 billion  27 per cent higher than the year before  according to the company's 2021 annual report.In June  Tencent lost US$7.4 billion of its market value in Hong Kong trading after major shareholder Prosus  which is listed in Euronext Amsterdam  announced a plan to trim its stake in the WeChat operator to fund a stock repurchase programme.Tencent has also cut its shareholdings in various firms. Earlier in June  the company reduced its stake in Hong Kong-listed Koolearn Technology  which is 55.7 per cent owned by China's biggest private tutoring group New Oriental Education & Technology.In January  Tencent raised US$3 billion from selling some of its shares in Sea  the Singapore-based tech conglomerate known as Southeast Asia's most valuable company. In response to Beijing's antitrust demands  Tencent in December announced that it would offload its US$16 billion stake in JD.com  the country's second-largest e-commerce services provider  and distribute those shares as a special dividend to investors.While there are no explicit regulatory restrictions on most Chinese firms' external investments  there is a general understanding that Beijing is wary of Big Tech companies' expansion initiatives  according to another industry source  who also declined to be identified.That reflects the dilemma that Tencent - along with its other major internet peers on the mainland - face  as they consider pursuing fewer acquisitions and more divestments to abide by Beijing's stance on Big Tech.In May  Beijing unveiled a 33-point package of policy items to help get the country's flagging economy back on track. There are no guarantees  however  that regulators would totally ease up on their crackdowns  especially those targeting Big Tech firms.A man walks by an entrance at TikTok owner ByteDance's headquarters in Beijing on July 7  2020. Photo: Reuters alt=A man walks by an entrance at TikTok owner ByteDance's headquarters in Beijing on July 7  2020. Photo: Reuters>Tencent's latest cutbacks at its investment department comes months after Beijing-based tech unicorn ByteDance dissolved its strategic investment unit  which involved the reassignment of about 100 employees  in response to Beijing's stand against ""irrational expansion of capital""  part of its increased scrutiny of China's Big Tech companies.The number of investments and acquisitions by ByteDance dropped to only nine in the first half of this year  compared with 27 deals in the same period in 2021  according to data from ITjuzi.The market tracker also estimated that investment and acquisition deals made by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding  owner of the South China Morning Post  declined to 14 in the first half from 19 a year ago. Baidu  meanwhile  recorded 22 external investment and acquisition deals in the first half  a modest fall from 24 a year earlier.Regulators  meanwhile  have remained vigilant for potential violations by Big Tech firms. The State Administration for Market Regulation  for example  announced last Sunday that it had punished Tencent  Alibaba and Didi Chuxing  among others  for failing to report past merger deals for antitrust review.While the Cyberspace Administration of China has denied issuing guidelines for vetting major investment deals by the country's Big Tech firms  the Post reported in January that the regulator has a mandate to enhance its supervision of internet firms  and that the agency is exploring how to perform its new role in an effective way.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP)  the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

This is a new Company record and testament to the commitment of our team at site to risk management and strong employee engagement on safety.The market for all of Kenmare’s products continued to improve  with realised ilmenite prices increasing for the seventh consecutive quarter. Although global growth expectations have reduced for H2 2022  inventories remain low throughout the value chain and demand for Kenmare’s ilmenite is anticipated to be robust.Q2 production was weaker than anticipated due to higher slimes recirculation  impacting excavated ore volumes and grades. As a result  we now expect production to be at the bottom of 2022 guidance. Increased pricing has more than offset production and supported revenues.Our balance sheet continued to strengthen  with a $17.3 million reduction in net debt at the end of the first half  after paying the $24.1 million 2021 final dividend. We are targeting a dividend payout ratio of 25% profit after tax for 2022.”Q2 2022 overviewRecord Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.00 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 30 June 2022 (30 June 2021: 0.14)  with zero Lost Time Injuries recorded during the quarterHeavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 353 600 tonnes in Q2 2022  a 19% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (436 600 tonnes)  due to higher slimes levels  leading to a 10% reduction in ore grades and an 8% reduction in excavated ore tonnesIlmenite production of 242 900 tonnes in Q2 2022  a 14% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (283 900 tonnes)  broadly in line with the reduction in HMC processedPrimary zircon production of 13 600 tonnes  a 9% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (14 900 tonnes)  also due to reduced HMC processed but partially offset by increased recoveriesTotal shipments of finished products of 192 800 tonnes  a 23% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (249 700 tonnes) due to reduced transshipment capacity  as one of Kenmare’s two vessels began its five-yearly dry dock in May 2022  exacerbated by poor weather conditionsKenmare expects production of all finished products to be at the bottom of its 2022 guidance rangesStrong ilmenite pricing in Q2 2022 and demand looks to remain robust in Q3  supported by low inventories and continued supply constraintsGlobal zircon market tightened further in Q2 2022  as global inventories were drawn down in 2021  and the market is expected to remain tight in Q3Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (“RUPS”) project became fully operational in May 2022 and has proved successful at mitigating a number of electrical supply disruptionsAt the end of H1 2022  net debt reduced to $65.5 million (31 December 2021: $82.8 million)  as a result of continuing strong free-cashflow generation reflecting higher prices  which more than offset lower sales volumesStory continuesOperations updateProduction from the Moma Mine in Q2 and H1 2022 was as follows:Q2 2022 Q2 2021 Q1 2022 H1 2022 H1 2021 tonnes % variance % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 10 070 000 -8% 7% 19 461 000 -2% Grade1 4.23% -10% -6% 4.35% -7% Production HMC production 353 600 -19% -8% 738 300 -8% HMC processed 367 300 -13% -2% 740 600 -9% Ilmenite 242 900 -14% -5% 499 700 -11% Primary zircon 13 600 -9% 5% 26 500 -6% Rutile 2 100 -5% 5% 4 000 -5% Concentrates2 9 800 -17% -8% 20 500 -1% Shipments 192 800 -23% -17% 424 300 -29%Excavated ore tonnage and grade prior to any floor losses. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.Kenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 30 June 2022 was 0.00 per 200 000 hours worked (Q2 2021: 0.14)  with zero Lost Time Injuries recorded during the quarter. In late June 2022  Kenmare achieved the milestone of 10 million hours worked without a Lost Time Injury and the Company remains focused on maintaining its strongest ever safety performance.HMC production was 353 600 tonnes in Q2 2022  representing a 19% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (436 600 tonnes). This was a result of a 10% decrease in ore grades to 4.23% (Q2 2021: 4.70%) and an 8% decrease in excavated ore volumes to 10.1 million tonnes (Q2 2021: 10.9 million tonnes).HMC production was impacted by increased slimes levels during the quarter  primarily at Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A. WCP capacity was limited due to higher levels of slimes recirculation from the mining pond  which necessitated a reduction in supplemental dry mining  lowering the grade mined. Higher slimes also led to poorer recoveries and reduced HMC quality. Kenmare expects slimes in the ore to remain at similar levels in H2 2022  but slimes management controls have been improved during the quarter  reducing recirculation. This should allow for increased excavated ore and improved recoveries  leading to higher levels of production in H2 2022.Ilmenite production was 242 900 tonnes  a 14% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (283 900 tonnes)  falling broadly in line with decreased HMC processed  however also impacted slightly by the lower HMC quality.Primary zircon production was 13 600 tonnes in Q2 2022  a 9% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (Q2 2021: 14 900 tonnes)  and rutile production was 2 100 tonnes  down 5% (Q2 2021: 2 200 tonnes)  reflecting lower HMC processed (and lower HMC quality) but partially offset by increased recoveries. Concentrates production was 9 800 tonnes  down 17% (Q2 2021: 11 800 tonnes) due to reduced HMC processed and quality  and stronger primary zircon recoveries reducing zircon available for concentrates.As a result of the reduced production in H1 2022  Kenmare expects production of all finished products to be at the bottom of its 2022 guidance ranges  as published on 13 January 2022.As previously announced  one of Kenmare’s two transshipment vessels  the Bronagh J  left site in early May 2022 for its five-yearly dry dock maintenance work  reducing Kenmare’s shipping capacity significantly for the quarter. This reduction will continue during Q3 until the Bronagh J returns to site  which is expected in mid-August. However  there will be sufficient capacity to catch up when both vessels are operating  with finished product inventories expected to return to normal levels during H1 2023.Total shipments in Q2 2022 were 192 800 tonnes  a 23% decrease compared to Q2 2021 (249 600 tonnes)  due to reduced shipping capacity and compounded by poor weather conditions and the arrival of some customer-chartered vessels being delayed. Shipments comprised 179 300 tonnes of ilmenite  8 700 tonnes of primary zircon  and 4 800 tonnes of concentrates. No rutile was shipped during the period.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q2 2022 was 9 200 tonnes  compared to 22 900 tonnes at the end of Q1 2022  due to a drawdown of HMC stockpiles during the period to compensate for reduced HMC production. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q2 2022 was 214 900 tonnes  compared to 139 300 tonnes at the end of Q1 2022  reflecting the lower shipping capacity.Capital projects updateIn May 2022  the Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply project became fully operational. The objective of the RUPS is to improve power stability at the Mineral Separation Plant and make a significant contribution to Kenmare’s goal of further reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Since becoming operational  the RUPS has proved successful at mitigating a number of electrical supply disruptions in accordance with this objective.Work is continuing on the Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) for Nataka  where WCP A is expected to commence mining in 2025. Kenmare intends to provide an update on the progress of the PFS with its results for the six months ended 30 June 2022. As part of the PFS  WCP A is expected to have a desliming circuit installed to more efficiently mine the Nataka ore zone. A cost-benefit analysis is being conducted to investigate the acceleration of the installation of the desliming circuit ahead of the move. This has the potential to increase the effective WCP capacity and better mitigate against the slimes levels at the end of the Namalope mine path.Market updateKenmare achieved higher prices for its ilmenite and zircon products in Q2 2022 and this represented the seventh consecutive quarter of ilmenite price increases.Global demand for ilmenite grew further during the quarter due to robust downstream demand for titanium pigment  with pigment producers continuing to operate at high utilisation rates  particularly outside of China. Economic activity in China has been impacted by several city-wide COVID-19 related lockdowns  which reduced demand for titanium pigment and therefore ilmenite. Despite this  chloride pigment production continues to increase in China  resulting in growing demand for ilmenite of Kenmare’s quality.Production of ilmenite concentrates from Chinese companies in Mozambique continued to expand in Q2  while ilmenite production also increased from the United States  Malaysia  and Indonesia. However  global supply of titanium feedstocks remained insufficient to meet demand and pigment production was therefore constrained by feedstock availability and low inventories.Moving into Q3 2022  lower anticipated global growth is expected to reduce demand for titanium pigment. Despite this  Kenmare continues to experience demand for its ilmenite in excess of its ability to supply  as high-quality ilmenite remains in short supply.The zircon market tightened further in Q2 2022 as inventories in the global supply chain were largely drawn down in 2021. Demand has been strong in all major regions except China  which was also impacted by severe COVID-19-related lockdowns. With no significant new supply entering the market  zircon remains in short supply and prices increased throughout H1 2022. The positive fundamentals for zircon are expected to continue into Q3 2022.Finance updateOn 1 June 2022  Kenmare paid its 2021 final dividend of USc25.42 per share. This was the balancing payment of a 2021 full year dividend of USc32.71 per share  representing a dividend payout ratio of 25% of profit after tax and up 227% from 2020. For 2022  Kenmare is targeting the same dividend payout ratio.Following the 2021 final dividend distribution of $24.1 million and debt principal repayments of $55.7 million  cash and cash equivalents were $30.7 million as at 30 June 2022 (31 December 2021: $69.1 million)  while gross bank loans  including accrued interest  were $96.2 million (31 December 2021: $151.9 million). Gross debt has reduced following the commencement of semi-annual repayments of the Term Loan in March 2022 and the repayment in full of the $40 million Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”). The RCF continues to be available for redraw.Accordingly  as at 30 June 2022  Kenmare’s net debt had reduced by $17.3 million to $65.5 million  compared to $82.8 million net debt at 31 December 2021.Kenmare will announce its results for the six months ended 30 June 2022 on 17 August 2022.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Doug Keatingedkeatinge@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 037 4163About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

July 14  2022 A Phase 3 trial assessing the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) met its primary endpoint of histological disease remission at 16 weeks with both higher and lower dose weight-tiered regimens. There are no approved treatments for children with EoE under 12 years of age.Naimish Patel  M.D.Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation  Sanofi“We are incredibly excited to share results from this Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating Dupixent in young children suffering from eosinophilic esophagitis – the first ever to show positive results across a variety of primary and secondary endpoints. The lack of treatment options for children living with eosinophilic esophagitis leaves many caregivers with the stress and burden of adapting their child’s meals and their entire family’s daily schedules to ensure healthy growth and development. In some cases  they must resort to off-label use of poorly studied treatments like steroids that can pose serious health risks when used long term. The faster and larger than anticipated enrollment in this trial further emphasizes the unmet treatment needs for children with EoE and underscores the significance of these first-ever positive results.”Story continuesEoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. In children  common symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to the unapproved therapies they have been treated with and potentially require advanced therapy.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer  Regeneron“Dupixent is the first medicine to alleviate key signs of eosinophilic esophagitis in children as young as 1 year of age in a Phase 3 trial. The efficacy of Dupixent demonstrates that  in this age group  as in adults  IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this debilitating disease. Eosinophilic esophagitis can turn the basic and life-sustaining act of eating into a painful experience at a point in children’s lives when proper nutrition and achieving a healthy weight is critical to ensuring they grow and thrive. The positive results from this Phase 3 pediatric trial show Dupixent has the potential to improve signs of eosinophilic esophagitis and support healthy weight gain in children from their first birthday.”In the Phase 3 trial  102 children aged 1 to 11 were randomized to receive Dupixent  in either a higher dose (n=37) or lower dose (n=31) regimen based on body weight  or placebo (n=34). At 16 weeks  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose Dupixent achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) compared to 3% of children on placebo (p<0.0001 for both). Additionally  children receiving higher dose Dupixent experienced the following changes at week 16:86% reduction in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count from baseline compared to a 21% increase for placebo (p<0.0001).0.88 and 0.84 reduction from baseline in disease severity and extent  respectively  as measured at the microscopic level in biopsy specimens compared to a 0.02 and 0.05 increase for placebo (both p<0.0001).3.5-point reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline compared to a 0.3-point increase for placebo (p<0.0001).A numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced symptoms of EoE from baseline  as reported by caregivers (Pediatric EOE signs/symptoms questionnaire [PESQ-C])  compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Sanofi and Regeneron used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves.As part of a prespecified exploratory analysis a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline compared to 0.29 for placebo.Histological  anatomic and cellular secondary endpoints were also analyzed for the lower dose group  with all being nominally significant and generally comparable with the higher dose. More detailed results will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting  including additional data for the endpoints in the lower dose group.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% for Dupixent and 91% for placebo. AEs more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included COVID-19 (21% Dupixent  0% placebo; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (9% Dupixent  6% placebo)  headache (8% Dupixent  3% placebo)  viral gastroenteritis (6% Dupixent  3% placebo)  diarrhea (6% Dupixent  3% placebo) and nausea (6% Dupixent  0% placebo). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% for Dupixent and 6% for placebo.In May 2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent 300 mg weekly to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg after granting the medicine Priority Review.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. These data will be discussed with regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ≥5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission. Secondary endpoints included histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of tissue scarring in the esophagus (EoE-HSS grade and stage scores  which measure changes in eight cellular and tissue features on 0-3 scales  respectively)  and abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g. stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period to evaluate long-term outcomes.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and EoE  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 400 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Eosinophilic esophagitis can turn the basic and life-sustaining act of eating into a painful experience at a point in children's lives when proper nutrition and achieving a healthy weight is critical to ensuring they grow and thrive. The positive results from this Phase 3 pediatric trial show Dupixent has the potential to improve signs of eosinophilic esophagitis and support healthy weight gain in children from their first birthday.""EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. In children  common symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to the unapproved therapies they have been treated with and potentially require advanced therapy.Story continues""We are incredibly excited to share results from this Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating Dupixent in young children suffering from eosinophilic esophagitis – the first ever to show positive results across a variety of primary and secondary endpoints. The lack of treatment options for children living with eosinophilic esophagitis leaves many caregivers with the stress and burden of adapting their child's meals and their entire family's daily schedules to ensure healthy growth and development. In some cases  they must resort to off-label use of poorly studied treatments like steroids that can pose serious health risks when used long term "" said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""The faster and larger than anticipated enrollment in this trial further emphasizes the unmet treatment needs for children with EoE and underscores the significance of these first-ever positive results.""In the Phase 3 trial  102 children aged 1 to 11 were randomized to receive Dupixent  in either a higher dose (n=37) or lower dose (n=31) regimen based on body weight  or placebo (n=34). At 16 weeks  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose Dupixent achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) compared to 3% of children on placebo (p<0.0001 for both). Additionally  children receiving higher dose Dupixent experienced the following changes at week 16:86% reduction in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count from baseline compared to a 21% increase for placebo (p<0.0001).0.88 and 0.84 reduction from baseline in disease severity and extent  respectively  as measured at the microscopic level in biopsy specimens compared to a 0.02 and 0.05 increase for placebo (both p<0.0001).3.5-point reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline compared to a 0.3-point increase for placebo (p<0.0001).A numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced symptoms of EoE from baseline  as reported by caregivers (Pediatric EOE signs/symptoms questionnaire [PESQ-C])  compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves.As part of a prespecified exploratory analysis  a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline compared to 0.29 for placebo.Histological  anatomic and cellular secondary endpoints were also analyzed for the lower dose group  with all being nominally significant and generally comparable with the higher dose. More detailed results will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting  including additional data for the endpoints in the lower dose group.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% for Dupixent and 91% for placebo. AEs more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included COVID-19 (21% Dupixent  0% placebo; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (9% Dupixent  6% placebo)  headache (8% Dupixent  3% placebo)  viral gastroenteritis (6% Dupixent  3% placebo)  diarrhea (6% Dupixent  3% placebo) and nausea (6% Dupixent  0% placebo). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% for Dupixent and 6% for placebo.In May 2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent 300 mg weekly to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg after granting the medicine Priority Review.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. These data will be discussed with regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ≥5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission. Secondary endpoints included histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of tissue scarring in the esophagus (EoE-HSS grade and stage scores  which measure changes in eight cellular and tissue features on 0-3 scales  respectively)  and abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g. stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period to evaluate long-term outcomes.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and EoE  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 400 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that a Phase 3 trial assessing the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) met its primary endpoint of histological disease remission at 16 weeks with both higher and lower dose weight-tiered regimens. There are no approved treatments for children with EoE under 12 years of age.""Dupixent is the first medicine to alleviate key signs of eosinophilic esophagitis in children as young as 1 year of age in a Phase 3 trial. The efficacy of Dupixent demonstrates that in this age group  as in adults  IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this debilitating disease "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Eosinophilic esophagitis can turn the basic and life-sustaining act of eating into a painful experience at a point in children's lives when proper nutrition and achieving a healthy weight is critical to ensuring they grow and thrive. The positive results from this Phase 3 pediatric trial show Dupixent has the potential to improve signs of eosinophilic esophagitis and support healthy weight gain in children from their first birthday.""EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. In children  common symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to the unapproved therapies they have been treated with and potentially require advanced therapy.""We are incredibly excited to share results from this Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating Dupixent in young children suffering from eosinophilic esophagitis – the first ever to show positive results across a variety of primary and secondary endpoints. The lack of treatment options for children living with eosinophilic esophagitis leaves many caregivers with the stress and burden of adapting their child's meals and their entire family's daily schedules to ensure healthy growth and development. In some cases  they must resort to off-label use of poorly studied treatments like steroids that can pose serious health risks when used long term "" said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""The faster and larger than anticipated enrollment in this trial further emphasizes the unmet treatment needs for children with EoE and underscores the significance of these first-ever positive results.""In the Phase 3 trial  102 children aged 1 to 11 were randomized to receive Dupixent  in either a higher dose (n=37) or lower dose (n=31) regimen based on body weight  or placebo (n=34). At 16 weeks  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose Dupixent achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) compared to 3% of children on placebo (p<0.0001 for both). Additionally  children receiving higher dose Dupixent experienced the following changes at week 16:86% reduction in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count from baseline compared to a 21% increase for placebo (p<0.0001).0.88 and 0.84 reduction from baseline in disease severity and extent  respectively  as measured at the microscopic level in biopsy specimens compared to a 0.02 and 0.05 increase for placebo (both p<0.0001).3.5-point reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline compared to a 0.3-point increase for placebo (p<0.0001).A numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced symptoms of EoE from baseline  as reported by caregivers (Pediatric EOE signs/symptoms questionnaire [PESQ-C])  compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves.As part of a prespecified exploratory analysis  a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline compared to 0.29 for placebo.Histological  anatomic and cellular secondary endpoints were also analyzed for the lower dose group  with all being nominally significant and generally comparable with the higher dose. More detailed results will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting  including additional data for the endpoints in the lower dose group.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% for Dupixent and 91% for placebo. AEs more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included COVID-19 (21% Dupixent  0% placebo; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (9% Dupixent  6% placebo)  headache (8% Dupixent  3% placebo)  viral gastroenteritis (6% Dupixent  3% placebo)  diarrhea (6% Dupixent  3% placebo) and nausea (6% Dupixent  0% placebo). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% for Dupixent and 6% for placebo.In May 2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent 300 mg weekly to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg after granting the medicine Priority Review.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. These data will be discussed with regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ≥5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission. Secondary endpoints included histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of tissue scarring in the esophagus (EoE-HSS grade and stage scores  which measure changes in eight cellular and tissue features on 0-3 scales  respectively)  and abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g. stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period to evaluate long-term outcomes.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and EoE  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 400 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

If the chairman of the Board of Directors is the CEO or another member of the Company's management  he or she may not be a part of the nomination committee. In such cases  another director shall replace the chairman of the Board of Directors in the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall meet the requirements of composition set out in the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (the ""Code""). If the larger shareholders who have the right to appoint members of the nomination committee wish to appoint persons with the consequence that the requirements of composition provided in the Code are not met  the first choice of the larger shareholder shall have precedence over a smaller shareholder. When appointing a new member  the shareholder who shall appoint the new member shall consider the composition of the current nomination committee in terms of the Code.Should any of the three largest shareholders abstain from their right to appoint a member of the nomination committee  the right to appoint a member shall pass to the next shareholder in line that does not already have the right to appoint a member of the nomination committee. However  the procedure shall only continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.The names of the members of the nomination committee and of the shareholders they represent shall normally be made public on the Company's website at the latest six months prior to the annual general meeting. At this convening  the nomination committee shall appoint a chair amongst its members. The mandate period of the nomination committee shall extend until the next nomination committee is appointed. Changes in the composition of the nomination committee shall be made public on the website of the Company as soon as they have occurred.If a change in the Company's ownership structure occurs after the last trading day in August but before the date which occurs six months ahead of the forthcoming annual general meeting  and if a shareholder  due to or after this change  becomes one of the three largest shareholders in terms of voting rights  who are registered in the share register of the Company or when applicable  other central securities depositories or other evidence of such shareholding which is acceptable to the nomination committee  makes a request to the chair of the nomination committee to be part of the nomination committee  the shareholder shall have the right  in the discretion of the nomination committee  either to appoint an additional member of the nomination committee or to appoint a member who shall replace the member appointed by the shareholder representing the least number of votes in the nomination committee following the changes in the Company's ownership structure.A shareholder who has appointed a member of the nomination committee has the right to dismiss the member and appoint a new member. If such an exchange takes place  the shareholder shall without delay give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who shall be exchanged  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). The notification shall contain the name of the dismissed member and the person who shall replace him as member of the nomination committee.A member who prematurely resigns from his task shall give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who resigns  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). In such case  the nomination committee shall without delay call upon the shareholder who has appointed the member to appoint a new member. If a new member is not appointed by the shareholder  the nomination committee shall offer other larger shareholders with respect to votes  to appoint members of the nomination committee. Such offer shall be made in order of priority to the largest shareholders with respect to voting rights (that is  first to the largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so  thereafter to the second largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so etc.). The procedure shall continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.No remuneration is to be paid to members of the nomination committee. The company shall  however  defray all reasonable expenses that are required for the work of the nomination committee.Instructions for the nomination committeeThe members of the nomination committee are to promote the common interests of all the shareholders of the Company and are not to reveal the content or details of any discussion held during the nomination committee meetings unduly. Each member of the nomination committee is to consider carefully whether there are any conflicts of interest or other circumstances that make their service on the nomination committee inappropriate before accepting the assignment to form part of the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall fulfil the tasks set out in the Code and shall  when applicable  present proposals to an upcoming general meeting for:the election of the chairman of the meeting; the number of directors elected by the general meeting; the election of the chairman and members of the Board of Directors; the fees and other remuneration of elected members of the Board of Directors and of the members of the committees of the Board of Directors; the election of the auditor(s); the remuneration of the auditor(s); and principles for the composition of the nomination committee including any changes to the instructions to the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall apply item 4.1 in the Code regarding the diversity policy  whereby the nomination committee shall take into account that the Board of Directors  with regard to the Company's operations  development stage and other conditions  shall have an appropriate composition  characterised by versatility in respect to the competence  experience  geographic coverage and background of the members elected a general meeting. Furthermore  the nomination committee shall work with the goal of achieving an even gender distribution on the Board of Directors.The nomination committee has the right  at the Company's reasonable expense  to engage external consultants whom the nomination committee considers necessary to fulfil its task.Agenda item 13; Resolution on the number of members of the Board of DirectorsThe nomination committee proposes that the Meeting resolves that the board of directors shall consist of six (6) directors and no deputy directors.Agenda item 14; Election of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of DirectorsThe nomination committee proposes that the Meeting resolves on the election/re-election (as applicable) of:Members of the Board of Directors:Remco Westermann (re-election) for a period until the end of the first annual general meeting after the resolution  Tobias M.

In order to facilitate the ESOP  MGI has resolved to grant to Bodhivas GmbH  which is owned by the largest shareholder of MGI (""Bodhivas"") the right to subscribe for up to 15 million Ordinary A Shares. Under the ESOP  Bodhivas has corresponding obligations towards the participants to deliver Ordinary A Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESOP (the right to receive Ordinary A Shares from Bodhivas is referred to as ""phantom stock""). Bodhivas has further (i) undertaken towards the participants to pay out the upside value between strike price and exercise value at the moment of exercise and to deliver this value either in Ordinary A Shares or in cash and (ii) undertaken towards MGI to manage the ESOP program and (iii) formally agreed that in relation to this ESOP program  any profit by Bodhivas is for the benefit of MGI and any loss incurred by Bodhivas is to be borne by MGI (i.e.  Bodhivas only facilitates the implementation of the ESOP program but does not have any economic interest in the ESOP program).Options under the ESOP can be exercised from May 1  2024  at the earliest  until December 31  2030. There are currently two different programs which differ primarily in terms of start date and strike price. The first started on May 1  2020 and has a strike price of EUR 1.30 (in total approx. 9.2m options). The second started on January 2021 and has a strike price of EUR 2.60 (approx. 3.3m options). For employees participating in the second program but starting at a later date  the strike price is at a premium of 20% above the average share price of 10 trading days prior to the grant date  however always with a minimum of EUR 2.60 (please see below for a proposed amendment of the strike price). Both programs under the ESOP have an end date of December 31  2030.No employee has been granted more than 2 550 000 options under the ESOP. The options under the ESOP are subject to vesting periods  meaning that participants who leave their employment during the programs will lose any unvested shares. The vesting period to become entitled to 100% of the options is 60 months in total and occurs in several partial steps over the entire vesting period.If a participant in the program leaves the Company (voluntarily or due to termination by employer for breach by employee) within two years after the start date of the phantom stock program  all phantom stock is lost. If a participant in the program leaves after more than two years after the start of the phantom stock program the participant loses 50% of the two most recent years of vested phantom stock.The ESOP does not contain any performance criteria in addition to the strike price  due to MGI wanting to incentivize participants  encourage long-term shareholding in the company and local market practice in Malta and the jurisdictions where the group is active.The maximum cumulative amount of options which can be granted under the ESOP to existing and future participants (and consequently the maximum number of Ordinary A Shares which can be issued under the ESOP  except in the event of recalculation) is 15 000 000  of which approx. 12.5 million options have been granted. If all granted options under the ESOP were to be exercised  the dilution would be 7.85 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares) and if all options were to be granted and exercised  the dilution would be 9.41 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares).MGI has not had  and is not expected to have  any material (cash relevant) costs for the ESOP programs. For additional information on the ESOP  please also refer to MGI's annual reports.Following the relocation to Sweden  due to differences between Swedish and Maltese corporate law  the board of directors intends to exercise its authorization (as proposed under item 19 below) to issue warrants to Bodhivas  MGI or a group company in order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the ESOP. MGI may also require that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a MGI group company.Further  due to prevailing market conditions and the Company's share price development  for certain participants in the second program (where the strike price has been determined based on a premium (plus 20%) compared to the average share price prior to the grant date  as described above) the current strike price is too high in comparison to the current market value  which leads to a loss of the incentivizing effect of such program. The board of directors therefore proposes that the second program is adjusted so that the maximum and minimum strike price is the same for all participants (i.e.  EUR 2.60)The board of directors therefore proposes that the Meeting approves (i) the ESOP  (ii) that MGI shall be entitled to grant Bodhivas or MGI or a group company of MGI the right to subscribe for warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares)  to (iii) entitle MGI to ensure that warrants or shares or the cash value can be delivered to the participants in the ESOP program on the same terms and conditions that now apply for the ESOP contracts with Bodhivas  (iv) entitle MGI to request that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a group company  (v) approve the adjustment of the strike price for all participants that were granted options before this AGM -in the second program to be EUR 2.60  and (vi) entitle the Board of MGI to take all steps required to execute measures (i) - (v).Approval of transfer of shares to participants in the ESOP programThe board of director proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the intended exercise of the authorisation to issue Ordinary A shares or warrants and that not more than 15 000 000 Ordinary A Shares or warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares) are transferred to existing and future participants in the ESOP program in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESOP  including the above proposed amendments of the program.Agenda item 17 Extraordinary Resolution to approve the change in name of the Company from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE and to approve the new Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company to effect this changeWhile preparing the relocation from Malta to Sweden the Company was notified that the relevant Swedish rules do not permit the registration of Media and Games Invest under its current name in Sweden due to the name being too generic.Based on that requirement  the Company wishes to change its name from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE after this AGM and in advance of the Proposed Transfer (as defined and described below in under item 18)  which name will also be retained after completion of the Proposed Transfer.The change in the name of the Company will require an amendment to the current memorandum and articles of association of the Company (the ""Current M&A"") to include the new name  which change will become effective once the amended memorandum and articles of association with the new name (the ""Interim M&A"") are filed with and registered by the Malta Business Registry following the Meeting.The Interim M&A (reflecting the limited amendments to the Current M&A for the purpose of the name change) are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's name be changed from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE; that the Current M&A be replaced by the Interim M&A to be adopted following this Meeting; and to authorize the Company Secretary and/or any one (1) Director of the Company to register a copy of the Interim M&A with the Malta Business Registry (the ""MBR"").Agenda item 18; Extraordinary resolution to approve a transfer proposal for the re-domiciliation of the Company from Malta to Sweden and to approve the new statutes of the Company to be adopted following its re-domiciliation and upon registration as a Swedish companyFollowing an evaluation by the Board of Directors and management of the Company  in light of Malta's grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in mid-2021  the Company believes that having the Company's registered office in Malta may result in an increased risk premium on the Company's shares and may preclude further investment from prospective investors.Given that the Company's core business is in North America and Continental Europe  and that its operations are not tied to Malta  the Board of Directors has chosen Sweden as the new registered office and headquarter of the Company. The Board of Director's decision was motivated by the fact that the Company; (i) has been listed in Sweden since 2020  (ii) is already familiar with the local capital markets  and (iii) has a very strong local network on the ground  as well as several operating subsidiaries and employees in Stockholm. Furthermore  a large part of the Company's shareholders hail from the Nordics and the Swedish regulatory framework is globally recognized. While MGI's listing structure currently covers three jurisdictions - Malta (registered office)  Germany (listing) and Sweden (listing) - the administrative complexity will be significantly reduced as a result of the relocation.Due to the above  the Board of Directors is proposing that the general meeting resolves that the Company transfers its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden (the ""Proposed Transfer"") pursuant to Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European Company (SE) (the ""SE Regulation"") and in terms of Article 6 (1) of Subsidiary Legislation 386.17 - Transfer of Registered Office of a European Company (SE) Regulations (the ""Subsidiary Legislation"").To this end and in connection with the obligation set out under Article 8 of the SE Regulation  the Board of Directors has prepared and submitted a transfer proposal (""Transfer Proposal"") and a transfer report (""Transfer Report"") to the MBR  which provide explanations of the legal and economic aspects of the Proposed Transfer  including a description of any implications for the Company's shareholders  creditors and employees as a result of the Proposed Transfer.Shareholders are hereby being notified of their right to examine the Transfer Proposal and the Transfer Report  copies of which are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/The Proposed Transfer will also require the substitution of the Interim M&A with new statutes of the Company (the ""New Statutes""). The New Statutes are to enter into force following the Proposed Transfer and upon registration of MGI as a Swedish company.The New Statutes are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposed that the Meeting resolves on the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's transfer of its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden in terms of the SE Regulation and the Subsidiary Legislation be  and hereby is  approved; that the Transfer Proposal and Transfer Report be  and hereby are  approved; and that the Interim M&A be replaced by the New Statutes upon the Company's registration as a Swedish company. That the Board of MGI is entitled to do all that is required to execute the above measures and actionsAgenda item 19 Authorisation for the Board of Directors to issue shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the CompanyWith reference to the proposal under item 18 for the re-domiciliation of the Company's registered office from Malta to Sweden. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that it would be beneficial for the Company for the Board of Directors to be authorised to (a) issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions and (b) restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue.The purpose of this authorization would be to finance acquisitions  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).Accordingly  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolution:Without prejudice to the existing authorisation to the Board of Directors  in terms of article 3 of the Company's articles of association  to issue shares of any class  options which may be convertible into shares  and other rights and/or securities (by whatever name referred to) which may entitle the holder thereof to subscribe to shares in the Company  in each case up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the Company  which authorisation shall remain valid and in effect  to authorize the Board of Directors to - at one or several occasions and for the time period until the next annual general meeting of the Company - issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions  and with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights (i.e. have the right to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue) and in each case within the limits of the company's articles of association. The purpose of the authorisation and the possibility to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be to enable the use of securities as consideration for or as financing of acquisitions of companies or businesses (including for payments of earn-outs and other deferred payments)  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).(Swedish translation: […] att bemyndiga styrelsen att efter bytet av bolagets registrerade säte - vid ett eller flera tillfällen intill slutet av nästkommande årsstämma - emittera nya aktier  optioner  teckningsoptioner och konvertibler i bolaget  med eller utan bestämmelser om apport  kvittning eller andra villkor  och med eller utan avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt (dvs. en rättighet att inskränka eller begränsa företrädesrätten hos befintliga aktieägare med avseende på sådana emissioner) inom ramen för de gränser som sätts av bolagets bolagsordning.

Closing of the meeting.Resolution proposalsItem 1: Election of chairman of the meetingThe board of directors proposes that attorney Ola Grahn is elected as chairman of the meeting.Item 6: Resolution on (A) employee option program; and (B) directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants.The board of directors of Saniona AB (the “Company”)  proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves to adopt an employee option program for the CEO and the CFO in accordance with what is set out under A below.The purpose of the proposed employee option program (the “Employee Option Program 2022”) is to secure a long-term commitment for the CEO and the CFO through a compensation system which is linked to the Company’s future value growth. Through the implementation of a share based incentive program  the future value growth in the Company is encouraged  which implies common interests and goals for the shareholders of the Company and the participants. Such share based incentive program is also expected to increase the Company’s possibilities to retain competent persons. Further details of the Employee Option Program 2022 are set out under Section A below.In order to secure the Company’s undertakings under the Employee Option Program 2022  the board of directors also proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and an approval of transfer of warrants in accordance with Section B below.A. The board of directors’ proposal on implementation of Employee Option Program 2022The board of directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves to implement the Employee Option Program 2022 in accordance with the following substantial guidelines:1. The Employee Option Program 2022 shall comprise a maximum of 2 129 821 options.2. Each employee option entitles the holders a right to acquire one new share in the Company against cash consideration at an exercise price amounting to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average share price of the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the 10 trading days immediately prior to the extraordinary general meeting on 18 August 2022. The thus calculated exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest whole öre  whereupon 0.5 öre shall be rounded upwards. The exercise price can however not be lower than the share’s quotient value. The exercise price and the number of shares that each option entitles right to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue etc.  wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied.3. The Employee Option Program 2022 shall comprise the CEO and the CFO. The CEO shall be allotted 1 661 928 employee options and the CFO shall be allotted 467 893 employee options.4. Allotment shall take place no later than 31 December 2022.5. The allotted employee options will vest with 1/3 each on the date that falls 12  24 and 36 months  respectively  following the date of allotment. If the number of allotted employee options is not evenly divisible with 1/3  the number of vested employee options shall be rounded downwards to the nearest whole number and any excess employee options shall be considered vested on the last vesting date.6. Vesting is conditional upon that the participant continues to be employed within the Saniona group (the “Group”) and has not terminated the employment as of the date when the respective vesting occurs. If the participant ceases to be employed or terminates its employment within the Group before a vesting date  the already vested employee options may be exercised on the ordinary date of exercise in accordance with the below  but further vesting will not occur. However  if the participant's employment is terminated due to dismissal or due to personal reasons/breach of contract  vested employee options shall also lapse.7. The employee options shall not constitute securities and shall not be possible to transfer or pledge. However  in the event of death  the rights to vested employee options shall accrue to the beneficiaries of the holder of the employee options.8. The employee options shall be allotted without consideration.9. The holders can exercise allotted and vested employee options during the period starting on the date that falls 3 years after the allotment date and ending on 31 December 2028. The board of directors has the right to limit the number of occasions during the exercise period when the employee options can be exercised10. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting the Company  the employee options will vest in their entirety and be exercisable in connection with the relevant transaction.11. Participation in Employee Option Program 2022 is conditional upon that such participation can legally take place  and that such participation in the Company’s assessment can take place with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts.12. The employee options shall be governed by separate agreements with the participants. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of Employee Option Program 2022 in accordance with the above-mentioned substantial terms and guidelines.B. Proposal to resolution on directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrantsIn order to enable the Company’s delivery of shares under the Employee Option Program 2022  the board of directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants. The board of directors thus proposes that the extraordinary general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants in accordance with the following terms and conditions:1. A maximum of 2 129 821 warrants shall be issued.2. With deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the warrants may only be subscribed for by the Company or a subsidiary in the Group. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is that the warrants are issued as part of the implementation of the Employee Option Program 2022. In the light of what has been stated above  the board of directors considers that it is for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders that employees are offered to participate in the Employee Option Program 2022.3. Subscription shall be made no later than 31 December 2022.4. Over subscription cannot occur.5. The warrants shall be issued without consideration. The reason hereof is due to that the warrants shall be issued as part of the implementation of the Employee Option Program 2022.6. The warrants and the exercise of the subscription rights are subject to the terms and conditions for the warrants 2022/2028 (the “Warrant Terms and Conditions”). The Warrant Terms and Conditions state among others:(a) that each warrant entitles to subscription of one share in the Company at a subscription price amounting to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average share price of the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the 10 trading days immediately prior to the extraordinary general meeting on 18 August 2022. The thus calculated subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest whole öre  whereupon 0.5 öre shall be rounded upwards. The subscription price can however not be lower than the share’s quotient value and the part of the subscription price exceeding the share’s quotient value shall be added to the free share premium reserve;(b) that subscription of shares by virtue of the warrants may be made from registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 31 December 2028;(c) that the subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles right to subscribe for are subject to customary recalculation in connection with a split-up or consolidation of shares  rights issues and similar events;(d) that the period when the subscription right may be utilized may be brought forward or postponed; and(e) that the shares issued upon utilization of a warrant shall confer right to dividends from the first record date for dividends that occurs following effectuation of the subscription to such extent that the share has been recorded as an interim share in the Company’s share ledger.7. If all warrants are exercised for subscription of new shares  the share capital will increase with SEK 106 491.05.8. The chairman of the Company’s board of directors shall be entitled to make such minor adjustments of the issue resolution that might be necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Further  the board of directors proposes that the extraordinary general meeting shall resolve to approve that the Company or another company in the Group  may transfer warrants to the participants in the Employee Option Program 2022 (or to a financial intermediary assisting with the delivery of shares to participants in Employee Option Program 2022) without consideration in connection with the exercise of employee options in accordance with the terms and conditions under Section A above.Other information in relation to Employee Option Program 2022The Employee Option Program 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with “IFRS 2 – Share based payments”. IFRS 2 stipulates that the options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company’s cash flow. The board of directors has made the assessment that the Employee Option Program 2022 will not trigger any social costs for the Company.The employee options do not have a market value since they are not transferable. However  the board of directors has calculated a theoretical value of the employee options using the “Black Scholes” formula. Assuming that all options are allotted and assuming a share price at the time of allotment of the options of SEK 5.03  a strike price of SEK 6.54  a volatility of 113 per cent  a risk free interest of 1.6 per cent and that 100 per cent of the employee options are vested  the value of an employee option has been calculated to SEK 3.95 and the total personnel cost for the Employee Option Program 2022 in accordance with IFRS 2 is estimated to be approximately SEK 8.4 million before tax during the period 2022–2025. Under the same conditions  but assuming that only 50 per cent of the employee options are vested  the total personnel cost for the Employee Option Program 2022 in accordance with IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 4.2 million before tax during the same period.It shall be noted that the calculations are based on preliminary assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of the outcome.As per the date hereof  the number of shares in the Company amounts to 62 385 677.In case all warrants issued in relation to Employee Option Program 2022 are exercised for subscription of new shares  a total of 2 129 821 new shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.30 per cent of the Company’s share capital and votes after full dilution  calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full exercise of all warrants issued in relation to Employee Option Program 2022. The dilution would have meant that the key figure earnings per share for the full year 2021 had changed from SEK -6.59 to – SEK -6.37.The Company currently has several outstanding option programs. For a description of these programs  please see note 12 in the annual report for 2021 as well as note 5 in the interim report for the period January – March 2022. As a result of terminations of employees during March and April 2022  certain options previously granted have forfeited after 31 March 2022. As of 31 July 2022  options entitling to subscription of in the aggregate 1 961 614 new shares will be outstanding in the previous programs.In case all warrants issued in relation to Employee Option Program 2022 as well as all warrants issued in relation to options in existing incentive programs that will still be outstanding as of 31 July 2022 are exercised for subscription of new shares  a total of 4 091 435 new shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 6.15 per cent of the Company’s share capital and votes after full dilution  calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full exercise of all outstanding and proposed warrants.The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are subject to recalculation of the warrants in accordance with the customary recalculation terms set out in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants.The resolutions in accordance with Section A and B above shall be resolved upon as one resolution. The resolutions are subject to the provisions in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act. A valid resolution requires that the resolution is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the general meeting.Information at the meetingThe board of directors and the CEO shall at the meeting  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without significant harm to the company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of items on the agenda.Meeting documentsThe complete proposal and relating documents according to the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)) and other documents for the meeting  will be kept available at the company’s office at Smedeland 26B  DK-2600 Glostrup  Denmark and at the company’s website ( www.saniona.com ) as from no later than three weeks prior to the meeting  and will also be sent to shareholders who request it and provide their address. Copies of the documents will also be available at the meeting.Number of shares and votes in the companyThe total number of shares and votes in the company amounts to 62 385 677.

Extraordinary Resolution to approve a transfer proposal for the re-domiciliation of the Company from Malta to Sweden and to approve the new statutes of the Company to be adopted following its re-domiciliation and upon its registration as a Swedish company Extraordinary Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to issue shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company Information on Certain Proposed Resolutions Agenda item 12; Resolution to adopt principles and instructions for the nomination committee It is proposed that the following principles for the appointment of the nomination committee and the following instruction for the nomination committee are adopted. Principles for the appointment of the nomination committee The nomination committee shall prior to an annual general meeting be composed of (i) representatives of the three largest shareholders of the Company in terms of voting rights  who are registered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB  or when applicable  other central securities depositories or other evidence of such shareholding which is acceptable to the Company  as of the last trading day in August each year  and (ii) the chairman of the Board of Directors  who shall also convene the nomination committee to its first meeting. If the chairman of the Board of Directors is the CEO or another member of the Companys management  he or she may not be a part of the nomination committee. In such cases  another director shall replace the chairman of the Board of Directors in the nomination committee. The nomination committee shall meet the requirements of composition set out in the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (the Code). If the larger shareholders who have the right to appoint members of the nomination committee wish to appoint persons with the consequence that the requirements of composition provided in the Code are not met  the first choice of the larger shareholder shall have precedence over a smaller shareholder. When appointing a new member  the shareholder who shall appoint the new member shall consider the composition of the current nomination committee in terms of the Code. Should any of the three largest shareholders abstain from their right to appoint a member of the nomination committee  the right to appoint a member shall pass to the next shareholder in line that does not already have the right to appoint a member of the nomination committee. However  the procedure shall only continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete. The names of the members of the nomination committee and of the shareholders they represent shall normally be made public on the Companys website at the latest six months prior to the annual general meeting. At this convening  the nomination committee shall appoint a chair amongst its members. The mandate period of the nomination committee shall extend until the next nomination committee is appointed. Changes in the composition of the nomination committee shall be made public on the website of the Company as soon as they have occurred. If a change in the Companys ownership structure occurs after the last trading day in August but before the date which occurs six months ahead of the forthcoming annual general meeting  and if a shareholder  due to or after this change  becomes one of the three largest shareholders in terms of voting rights  who are registered in the share register of the Company or when applicable  other central securities depositories or other evidence of such shareholding which is acceptable to the nomination committee  makes a request to the chair of the nomination committee to be part of the nomination committee  the shareholder shall have the right  in the discretion of the nomination committee  either to appoint an additional member of the nomination committee or to appoint a member who shall replace the member appointed by the shareholder representing the least number of votes in the nomination committee following the changes in the Companys ownership structure. A shareholder who has appointed a member of the nomination committee has the right to dismiss the member and appoint a new member. If such an exchange takes place  the shareholder shall without delay give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who shall be exchanged  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). The notification shall contain the name of the dismissed member and the person who shall replace him as member of the nomination committee. A member who prematurely resigns from his task shall give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who resigns  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). In such case  the nomination committee shall without delay call upon the shareholder who has appointed the member to appoint a new member. If a new member is not appointed by the shareholder  the nomination committee shall offer other larger shareholders with respect to votes  to appoint members of the nomination committee. Such offer shall be made in order of priority to the largest shareholders with respect to voting rights (that is  first to the largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so  thereafter to the second largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so etc.). The procedure shall continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete. No remuneration is to be paid to members of the nomination committee. The company shall  however  defray all reasonable expenses that are required for the work of the nomination committee. Instructions for the nomination committee The members of the nomination committee are to promote the common interests of all the shareholders of the Company and are not to reveal the content or details of any discussion held during the nomination committee meetings unduly. Each member of the nomination committee is to consider carefully whether there are any conflicts of interest or other circumstances that make their service on the nomination committee inappropriate before accepting the assignment to form part of the nomination committee. The nomination committee shall fulfil the tasks set out in the Code and shall  when applicable  present proposals to an upcoming general meeting for: the election of the chairman of the meeting; the number of directors elected by the general meeting; the election of the chairman and members of the Board of Directors; the fees and other remuneration of elected members of the Board of Directors and of the members of the committees of the Board of Directors; the election of the auditor(s); the remuneration of the auditor(s); and principles for the composition of the nomination committee including any changes to the instructions to the nomination committee. The nomination committee shall apply item 4.1 in the Code regarding the diversity policy  whereby the nomination committee shall take into account that the Board of Directors  with regard to the Companys operations  development stage and other conditions  shall have an appropriate composition  characterised by versatility in respect to the competence  experience  geographic coverage and background of the members elected a general meeting. Furthermore  the nomination committee shall work with the goal of achieving an even gender distribution on the Board of Directors. The nomination committee has the right  at the Companys reasonable expense  to engage external consultants whom the nomination committee considers necessary to fulfil its task. Agenda item 13; Resolution on the number of members of the Board of Directors The nomination committee proposes that the Meeting resolves that the board of directors shall consist of six (6) directors and no deputy directors. Agenda item 14; Election of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors The nomination committee proposes that the Meeting resolves on the election/re-election (as applicable) of: Members of the Board of Directors: Remco Westermann (re-election) for a period until the end of the first annual general meeting after the resolution  Tobias M.

Agenda item 16; Resolution to approve MGIs ESOP program The ESOP program in short MGI has  through resolutions by the Board of Directors  in April 2020  January 2021 and February 2022 adopted an employee stock option program directed to approximately 50 key employees of MGI (ESOP). In order to facilitate the ESOP  MGI has resolved to grant to Bodhivas GmbH  which is owned by the largest shareholder of MGI (Bodhivas) the right to subscribe for up to 15 million Ordinary A Shares. Under the ESOP  Bodhivas has corresponding obligations towards the participants to deliver Ordinary A Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESOP (the right to receive Ordinary A Shares from Bodhivas is referred to as phantom stock). Bodhivas has further (i) undertaken towards the participants to pay out the upside value between strike price and exercise value at the moment of exercise and to deliver this value either in Ordinary A Shares or in cash and (ii) undertaken towards MGI to manage the ESOP program and (iii) formally agreed that in relation to this ESOP program  any profit by Bodhivas is for the benefit of MGI and any loss incurred by Bodhivas is to be borne by MGI (i.e.  Bodhivas only facilitates the implementation of the ESOP program but does not have any economic interest in the ESOP program). Options under the ESOP can be exercised from May 1  2024  at the earliest  until December 31  2030. There are currently two different programs which differ primarily in terms of start date and strike price. The first started on May 1  2020 and has a strike price of EUR 1.30 (in total approx. 9.2m options). The second started on January 2021 and has a strike price of EUR 2.60 (approx. 3.3m options). For employees participating in the second program but starting at a later date  the strike price is at a premium of 20% above the average share price of 10 trading days prior to the grant date  however always with a minimum of EUR 2.60 (please see below for a proposed amendment of the strike price). Both programs under the ESOP have an end date of December 31  2030. No employee has been granted more than 2 550 000 options under the ESOP. The options under the ESOP are subject to vesting periods  meaning that participants who leave their employment during the programs will lose any unvested shares. The vesting period to become entitled to 100% of the options is 60 months in total and occurs in several partial steps over the entire vesting period. If a participant in the program leaves the Company (voluntarily or due to termination by employer for breach by employee) within two years after the start date of the phantom stock program  all phantom stock is lost. If a participant in the program leaves after more than two years after the start of the phantom stock program the participant loses 50% of the two most recent years of vested phantom stock. The ESOP does not contain any performance criteria in addition to the strike price  due to MGI wanting to incentivize participants  encourage long-term shareholding in the company and local market practice in Malta and the jurisdictions where the group is active. The maximum cumulative amount of options which can be granted under the ESOP to existing and future participants (and consequently the maximum number of Ordinary A Shares which can be issued under the ESOP  except in the event of recalculation) is 15 000 000  of which approx. 12.5 million options have been granted. If all granted options under the ESOP were to be exercised  the dilution would be 7.85 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares) and if all options were to be granted and exercised  the dilution would be 9.41 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares). MGI has not had  and is not expected to have  any material (cash relevant) costs for the ESOP programs. For additional information on the ESOP  please also refer to MGIs annual reports. Following the relocation to Sweden  due to differences between Swedish and Maltese corporate law  the board of directors intends to exercise its authorization (as proposed under item 19 below) to issue warrants to Bodhivas  MGI or a group company in order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the ESOP. MGI may also require that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a MGI group company. Further  due to prevailing market conditions and the Companys share price development  for certain participants in the second program (where the strike price has been determined based on a premium (plus 20%) compared to the average share price prior to the grant date  as described above) the current strike price is too high in comparison to the current market value  which leads to a loss of the incentivizing effect of such program. The board of directors therefore proposes that the second program is adjusted so that the maximum and minimum strike price is the same for all participants (i.e.  EUR 2.60) The board of directors therefore proposes that the Meeting approves (i) the ESOP  (ii) that MGI shall be entitled to grant Bodhivas or MGI or a group company of MGI the right to subscribe for warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares)  to (iii) entitle MGI to ensure that warrants or shares or the cash value can be delivered to the participants in the ESOP program on the same terms and conditions that now apply for the ESOP contracts with Bodhivas  (iv) entitle MGI to request that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a group company  (v) approve the adjustment of the strike price for all participants that were granted options before this AGM -in the second program to be EUR 2.60  and (vi) entitle the Board of MGI to take all steps required to execute measures (i) (v). Approval of transfer of shares to participants in the ESOP program The board of director proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the intended exercise of the authorisation to issue Ordinary A shares or warrants and that not more than 15 000 000 Ordinary A Shares or warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares) are transferred to existing and future participants in the ESOP program in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESOP  including the above proposed amendments of the program. Agenda item 17 Extraordinary Resolution to approve the change in name of the Company from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE and to approve the new Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company to effect this change While preparing the relocation from Malta to Sweden the Company was notified that the relevant Swedish rules do not permit the registration of Media and Games Invest under its current name in Sweden due to the name being too generic. Based on that requirement  the Company wishes to change its name from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE after this AGM and in advance of the Proposed Transfer (as defined and described below in under item 18)  which name will also be retained after completion of the Proposed Transfer. The change in the name of the Company will require an amendment to the current memorandum and articles of association of the Company (the Current M&A) to include the new name  which change will become effective once the amended memorandum and articles of association with the new name (the Interim M&A) are filed with and registered by the Malta Business Registry following the Meeting. The Interim M&A (reflecting the limited amendments to the Current M&A for the purpose of the name change) are available on the Companys website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/. The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolutions: that the Companys name be changed from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE; that the Current M&A be replaced by the Interim M&A to be adopted following this Meeting; and to authorize the Company Secretary and/or any one (1) Director of the Company to register a copy of the Interim M&A with the Malta Business Registry (the MBR). Agenda item 18; Extraordinary resolution to approve a transfer proposal for the re-domiciliation of the Company from Malta to Sweden and to approve the new statutes of the Company to be adopted following its re-domiciliation and upon registration as a Swedish company Following an evaluation by the Board of Directors and management of the Company  in light of Maltas grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in mid-2021  the Company believes that having the Companys registered office in Malta may result in an increased risk premium on the Companys shares and may preclude further investment from prospective investors. Given that the Companys core business is in North America and Continental Europe  and that its operations are not tied to Malta  the Board of Directors has chosen Sweden as the new registered office and headquarter of the Company. The Board of Directors decision was motivated by the fact that the Company; (i) has been listed in Sweden since 2020  (ii) is already familiar with the local capital markets  and (iii) has a very strong local network on the ground  as well as several operating subsidiaries and employees in Stockholm. Furthermore  a large part of the Companys shareholders hail from the Nordics and the Swedish regulatory framework is globally recognized. While MGIs listing structure currently covers three jurisdictions Malta (registered office)  Germany (listing) and Sweden (listing) the administrative complexity will be significantly reduced as a result of the relocation. Due to the above  the Board of Directors is proposing that the general meeting resolves that the Company transfers its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden (the Proposed Transfer) pursuant to Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European Company (SE) (the SE Regulation) and in terms of Article 6 (1) of Subsidiary Legislation 386.17 Transfer of Registered Office of a European Company (SE) Regulations (the Subsidiary Legislation). To this end and in connection with the obligation set out under Article 8 of the SE Regulation  the Board of Directors has prepared and submitted a transfer proposal (Transfer Proposal) and a transfer report (Transfer Report) to the MBR  which provide explanations of the legal and economic aspects of the Proposed Transfer  including a description of any implications for the Companys shareholders  creditors and employees as a result of the Proposed Transfer. Shareholders are hereby being notified of their right to examine the Transfer Proposal and the Transfer Report  copies of which are available on the Companys website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/ The Proposed Transfer will also require the substitution of the Interim M&A with new statutes of the Company (the New Statutes). The New Statutes are to enter into force following the Proposed Transfer and upon registration of MGI as a Swedish company. The New Statutes are available on the Companys website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.

If the chairman of the Board of Directors is the CEO or another member of the Company's management  he or she may not be a part of the nomination committee. In such cases  another director shall replace the chairman of the Board of Directors in the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall meet the requirements of composition set out in the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (the ""Code""). If the larger shareholders who have the right to appoint members of the nomination committee wish to appoint persons with the consequence that the requirements of composition provided in the Code are not met  the first choice of the larger shareholder shall have precedence over a smaller shareholder. When appointing a new member  the shareholder who shall appoint the new member shall consider the composition of the current nomination committee in terms of the Code.Should any of the three largest shareholders abstain from their right to appoint a member of the nomination committee  the right to appoint a member shall pass to the next shareholder in line that does not already have the right to appoint a member of the nomination committee. However  the procedure shall only continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.The names of the members of the nomination committee and of the shareholders they represent shall normally be made public on the Company's website at the latest six months prior to the annual general meeting. At this convening  the nomination committee shall appoint a chair amongst its members. The mandate period of the nomination committee shall extend until the next nomination committee is appointed. Changes in the composition of the nomination committee shall be made public on the website of the Company as soon as they have occurred.If a change in the Company's ownership structure occurs after the last trading day in August but before the date which occurs six months ahead of the forthcoming annual general meeting  and if a shareholder  due to or after this change  becomes one of the three largest shareholders in terms of voting rights  who are registered in the share register of the Company or when applicable  other central securities depositories or other evidence of such shareholding which is acceptable to the nomination committee  makes a request to the chair of the nomination committee to be part of the nomination committee  the shareholder shall have the right  in the discretion of the nomination committee  either to appoint an additional member of the nomination committee or to appoint a member who shall replace the member appointed by the shareholder representing the least number of votes in the nomination committee following the changes in the Company's ownership structure.A shareholder who has appointed a member of the nomination committee has the right to dismiss the member and appoint a new member. If such an exchange takes place  the shareholder shall without delay give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who shall be exchanged  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). The notification shall contain the name of the dismissed member and the person who shall replace him as member of the nomination committee.A member who prematurely resigns from his task shall give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who resigns  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). In such case  the nomination committee shall without delay call upon the shareholder who has appointed the member to appoint a new member. If a new member is not appointed by the shareholder  the nomination committee shall offer other larger shareholders with respect to votes  to appoint members of the nomination committee. Such offer shall be made in order of priority to the largest shareholders with respect to voting rights (that is  first to the largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so  thereafter to the second largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so etc.). The procedure shall continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.No remuneration is to be paid to members of the nomination committee. The company shall  however  defray all reasonable expenses that are required for the work of the nomination committee.Instructions for the nomination committeeThe members of the nomination committee are to promote the common interests of all the shareholders of the Company and are not to reveal the content or details of any discussion held during the nomination committee meetings unduly. Each member of the nomination committee is to consider carefully whether there are any conflicts of interest or other circumstances that make their service on the nomination committee inappropriate before accepting the assignment to form part of the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall fulfil the tasks set out in the Code and shall  when applicable  present proposals to an upcoming general meeting for:the election of the chairman of the meeting; the number of directors elected by the general meeting; the election of the chairman and members of the Board of Directors; the fees and other remuneration of elected members of the Board of Directors and of the members of the committees of the Board of Directors; the election of the auditor(s); the remuneration of the auditor(s); and principles for the composition of the nomination committee including any changes to the instructions to the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall apply item 4.1 in the Code regarding the diversity policy  whereby the nomination committee shall take into account that the Board of Directors  with regard to the Company's operations  development stage and other conditions  shall have an appropriate composition  characterised by versatility in respect to the competence  experience  geographic coverage and background of the members elected a general meeting. Furthermore  the nomination committee shall work with the goal of achieving an even gender distribution on the Board of Directors.The nomination committee has the right  at the Company's reasonable expense  to engage external consultants whom the nomination committee considers necessary to fulfil its task.Agenda item 13; Resolution on the number of members of the Board of DirectorsThe nomination committee proposes that the Meeting resolves that the board of directors shall consist of six (6) directors and no deputy directors.Agenda item 14; Election of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of DirectorsThe nomination committee proposes that the Meeting resolves on the election/re-election (as applicable) of:Members of the Board of Directors:Remco Westermann (re-election) for a period until the end of the first annual general meeting after the resolution  Tobias M.

In order to facilitate the ESOP  MGI has resolved to grant to Bodhivas GmbH  which is owned by the largest shareholder of MGI (""Bodhivas"") the right to subscribe for up to 15 million Ordinary A Shares. Under the ESOP  Bodhivas has corresponding obligations towards the participants to deliver Ordinary A Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESOP (the right to receive Ordinary A Shares from Bodhivas is referred to as ""phantom stock""). Bodhivas has further (i) undertaken towards the participants to pay out the upside value between strike price and exercise value at the moment of exercise and to deliver this value either in Ordinary A Shares or in cash and (ii) undertaken towards MGI to manage the ESOP program and (iii) formally agreed that in relation to this ESOP program  any profit by Bodhivas is for the benefit of MGI and any loss incurred by Bodhivas is to be borne by MGI (i.e.  Bodhivas only facilitates the implementation of the ESOP program but does not have any economic interest in the ESOP program).Options under the ESOP can be exercised from May 1  2024  at the earliest  until December 31  2030. There are currently two different programs which differ primarily in terms of start date and strike price. The first started on May 1  2020 and has a strike price of EUR 1.30 (in total approx. 9.2m options). The second started on January 2021 and has a strike price of EUR 2.60 (approx. 3.3m options). For employees participating in the second program but starting at a later date  the strike price is at a premium of 20% above the average share price of 10 trading days prior to the grant date  however always with a minimum of EUR 2.60 (please see below for a proposed amendment of the strike price). Both programs under the ESOP have an end date of December 31  2030.No employee has been granted more than 2 550 000 options under the ESOP. The options under the ESOP are subject to vesting periods  meaning that participants who leave their employment during the programs will lose any unvested shares. The vesting period to become entitled to 100% of the options is 60 months in total and occurs in several partial steps over the entire vesting period.If a participant in the program leaves the Company (voluntarily or due to termination by employer for breach by employee) within two years after the start date of the phantom stock program  all phantom stock is lost. If a participant in the program leaves after more than two years after the start of the phantom stock program the participant loses 50% of the two most recent years of vested phantom stock.The ESOP does not contain any performance criteria in addition to the strike price  due to MGI wanting to incentivize participants  encourage long-term shareholding in the company and local market practice in Malta and the jurisdictions where the group is active.The maximum cumulative amount of options which can be granted under the ESOP to existing and future participants (and consequently the maximum number of Ordinary A Shares which can be issued under the ESOP  except in the event of recalculation) is 15 000 000  of which approx. 12.5 million options have been granted. If all granted options under the ESOP were to be exercised  the dilution would be 7.85 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares) and if all options were to be granted and exercised  the dilution would be 9.41 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares).MGI has not had  and is not expected to have  any material (cash relevant) costs for the ESOP programs. For additional information on the ESOP  please also refer to MGI's annual reports.Following the relocation to Sweden  due to differences between Swedish and Maltese corporate law  the board of directors intends to exercise its authorization (as proposed under item 19 below) to issue warrants to Bodhivas  MGI or a group company in order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the ESOP. MGI may also require that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a MGI group company.Further  due to prevailing market conditions and the Company's share price development  for certain participants in the second program (where the strike price has been determined based on a premium (plus 20%) compared to the average share price prior to the grant date  as described above) the current strike price is too high in comparison to the current market value  which leads to a loss of the incentivizing effect of such program. The board of directors therefore proposes that the second program is adjusted so that the maximum and minimum strike price is the same for all participants (i.e.  EUR 2.60)The board of directors therefore proposes that the Meeting approves (i) the ESOP  (ii) that MGI shall be entitled to grant Bodhivas or MGI or a group company of MGI the right to subscribe for warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares)  to (iii) entitle MGI to ensure that warrants or shares or the cash value can be delivered to the participants in the ESOP program on the same terms and conditions that now apply for the ESOP contracts with Bodhivas  (iv) entitle MGI to request that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a group company  (v) approve the adjustment of the strike price for all participants that were granted options before this AGM -in the second program to be EUR 2.60  and (vi) entitle the Board of MGI to take all steps required to execute measures (i) - (v).Approval of transfer of shares to participants in the ESOP programThe board of director proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the intended exercise of the authorisation to issue Ordinary A shares or warrants and that not more than 15 000 000 Ordinary A Shares or warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares) are transferred to existing and future participants in the ESOP program in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESOP  including the above proposed amendments of the program.Agenda item 17 Extraordinary Resolution to approve the change in name of the Company from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE and to approve the new Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company to effect this changeWhile preparing the relocation from Malta to Sweden the Company was notified that the relevant Swedish rules do not permit the registration of Media and Games Invest under its current name in Sweden due to the name being too generic.Based on that requirement  the Company wishes to change its name from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE after this AGM and in advance of the Proposed Transfer (as defined and described below in under item 18)  which name will also be retained after completion of the Proposed Transfer.The change in the name of the Company will require an amendment to the current memorandum and articles of association of the Company (the ""Current M&A"") to include the new name  which change will become effective once the amended memorandum and articles of association with the new name (the ""Interim M&A"") are filed with and registered by the Malta Business Registry following the Meeting.The Interim M&A (reflecting the limited amendments to the Current M&A for the purpose of the name change) are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's name be changed from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE; that the Current M&A be replaced by the Interim M&A to be adopted following this Meeting; and to authorize the Company Secretary and/or any one (1) Director of the Company to register a copy of the Interim M&A with the Malta Business Registry (the ""MBR"").Agenda item 18; Extraordinary resolution to approve a transfer proposal for the re-domiciliation of the Company from Malta to Sweden and to approve the new statutes of the Company to be adopted following its re-domiciliation and upon registration as a Swedish companyFollowing an evaluation by the Board of Directors and management of the Company  in light of Malta's grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in mid-2021  the Company believes that having the Company's registered office in Malta may result in an increased risk premium on the Company's shares and may preclude further investment from prospective investors.Given that the Company's core business is in North America and Continental Europe  and that its operations are not tied to Malta  the Board of Directors has chosen Sweden as the new registered office and headquarter of the Company. The Board of Director's decision was motivated by the fact that the Company; (i) has been listed in Sweden since 2020  (ii) is already familiar with the local capital markets  and (iii) has a very strong local network on the ground  as well as several operating subsidiaries and employees in Stockholm. Furthermore  a large part of the Company's shareholders hail from the Nordics and the Swedish regulatory framework is globally recognized. While MGI's listing structure currently covers three jurisdictions - Malta (registered office)  Germany (listing) and Sweden (listing) - the administrative complexity will be significantly reduced as a result of the relocation.Due to the above  the Board of Directors is proposing that the general meeting resolves that the Company transfers its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden (the ""Proposed Transfer"") pursuant to Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European Company (SE) (the ""SE Regulation"") and in terms of Article 6 (1) of Subsidiary Legislation 386.17 - Transfer of Registered Office of a European Company (SE) Regulations (the ""Subsidiary Legislation"").To this end and in connection with the obligation set out under Article 8 of the SE Regulation  the Board of Directors has prepared and submitted a transfer proposal (""Transfer Proposal"") and a transfer report (""Transfer Report"") to the MBR  which provide explanations of the legal and economic aspects of the Proposed Transfer  including a description of any implications for the Company's shareholders  creditors and employees as a result of the Proposed Transfer.Shareholders are hereby being notified of their right to examine the Transfer Proposal and the Transfer Report  copies of which are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/The Proposed Transfer will also require the substitution of the Interim M&A with new statutes of the Company (the ""New Statutes""). The New Statutes are to enter into force following the Proposed Transfer and upon registration of MGI as a Swedish company.The New Statutes are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposed that the Meeting resolves on the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's transfer of its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden in terms of the SE Regulation and the Subsidiary Legislation be  and hereby is  approved; that the Transfer Proposal and Transfer Report be  and hereby are  approved; and that the Interim M&A be replaced by the New Statutes upon the Company's registration as a Swedish company. That the Board of MGI is entitled to do all that is required to execute the above measures and actionsAgenda item 19 Authorisation for the Board of Directors to issue shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the CompanyWith reference to the proposal under item 18 for the re-domiciliation of the Company's registered office from Malta to Sweden. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that it would be beneficial for the Company for the Board of Directors to be authorised to (a) issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions and (b) restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue.The purpose of this authorization would be to finance acquisitions  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).Accordingly  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolution:Without prejudice to the existing authorisation to the Board of Directors  in terms of article 3 of the Company's articles of association  to issue shares of any class  options which may be convertible into shares  and other rights and/or securities (by whatever name referred to) which may entitle the holder thereof to subscribe to shares in the Company  in each case up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the Company  which authorisation shall remain valid and in effect  to authorize the Board of Directors to - at one or several occasions and for the time period until the next annual general meeting of the Company - issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions  and with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights (i.e. have the right to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue) and in each case within the limits of the company's articles of association. The purpose of the authorisation and the possibility to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be to enable the use of securities as consideration for or as financing of acquisitions of companies or businesses (including for payments of earn-outs and other deferred payments)  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).(Swedish translation: […] att bemyndiga styrelsen att efter bytet av bolagets registrerade säte - vid ett eller flera tillfällen intill slutet av nästkommande årsstämma - emittera nya aktier  optioner  teckningsoptioner och konvertibler i bolaget  med eller utan bestämmelser om apport  kvittning eller andra villkor  och med eller utan avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt (dvs. en rättighet att inskränka eller begränsa företrädesrätten hos befintliga aktieägare med avseende på sådana emissioner) inom ramen för de gränser som sätts av bolagets bolagsordning.

7782,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-tokenization-revolution-is-here%3A-exploring-enterprise-adoption,The Tokenization Revolution is Here: Exploring Enterprise Adoption,Tokenization is the process of converting an asset into a digital token that can be stored on a blockchain. This token can then be traded or used to represent the underlying asset. Notably  financial security is enhanced through tokenization ,By Rob ViglioneAmid all the disruptions this decade has handed us  it's evident blockchain technology is here to stay. With its potential to transform many industries  it's no wonder that enterprises are taking notice of blockchain's potential and exploring ways to adopt this innovative technology. One such way is through tokenization  which offers many benefits for enterprises.Tokenization is the process of converting an asset into a digital token that can be stored on a blockchain. This token can then be traded or used to represent the underlying asset. Notably  financial security is enhanced through tokenization  as tokens are stored on a decentralized ledger that is extremely difficult to hack.Transactions made using tokens are also transparent  meaning that all parties involved can see what has happened at each stage of the transaction. Additionally  tokens cannot be altered or tampered with once they have been created. This ensures complete immutability.All these factors make tokenization an attractive option for enterprises looking to adopt blockchain technology. By tokenizing assets  enterprises can enjoy increased security  transparency and immutability – all of which are essential in today's evolving  fast-paced business world.With its many advantages  tokenization is ripe for enterprise adoption and some frontrunners are already making headway in making it part of the business ecosystem.Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs is one of the big names in financial services that is taking notice of tokenization. Namely  the investment bank is exploring the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for tokenizing real-world portfolio assets. This is an exciting development  as it shows even traditional enterprises are recognizing the potential of blockchain technology and exploring ways to harness its power.Goldman Sachs’ interest in tokenization is likely to continue for years to come  as it sees the metaverse  a virtual world where assets can be bought and sold as NFTs  as a potential $8 trillion opportunity. With its ability to tokenize real-world assets  the metaverse holds great promise for promoting enterprise adoption of blockchain technology.Unilever and SAPUnilever and SAP are now teaming up to explore enterprise adoption of tokenization  with a focus on supply chains. Legacy supply chains are often opaque  making it difficult to track the journey of a product from start to finish. This can lead to a number of issues  including waste  fraud and human rights abuses.The partnership between the two companies aims to create a more sustainable supply chain by applying digital twin tokens. These tokens will allow actors within the supply chain  as well as customers  to better see the materials and processes behind a product.SWIFT: Clearstream  Northern Trust and SETLAnother example of enterprises exploring the use of tokenization is a pilot program conducted by SWIFT. The global provider of secure financial messaging services is exploring interoperability in the asset tokenization market. This pilot was conducted with Clearstream  Northern Trust and SETL  a blockchain company backed by Citi.With its network of over 11 000 institutions in 200 countries  SWIFT is uniquely positioned to engage with the future of tokenized securities. This pilot program is an important step in exploring the use of tokenization for enterprise adoption of blockchain technology.AdobeAdobe  the company behind Photoshop and the ubiquitous PDF format  is another enterprise exploring the application of tokenization. In October 2021  Adobe launched its content attribution feature  which lets creators export their images directly to certain NFT exchanges. This service lets artists protect their work against fraudulent claims by irrefutably proving their provenance before minting them as NFTs.With its expansive network of Creative Cloud subscribers  Adobe has the potential to significantly increase the adoption of NFTs. This new service is a great example of how tokenization can be used to combat fraud and increase trust in digital assets.ICBCThe Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is the largest bank in the world  boasting more than $5.6 trillion in assets. The bank also has 40 blockchain applications that last year handled a total of more than $48 billion worth of transactions.As part of the company’s tokenization initiative  carbon credits issued by the transit commission as non-fungible tokens can be redeemed for China’s new central-bank digital currency. This system is already being used in the city of Qingdao  where it has removed 99 000 kilograms of carbon. The program is set to expand to other cities in China  which will help increase the adoption of NFTs.KakaoKakao  the company behind South Korea’s dominant mobile messenger app KakaoTalk  has also entered the NFT space. In May 2021  Kakao launched KrafterSpace  an NFT marketplace integrated with OpenSea.Users can buy tokenized artwork directly through KakaoTalk with Klip Drops  the platform’s accompanying digital wallet. With its large user base and integration with OpenSea  Kakao is well-positioned to increase the adoption of NFTs by enterprises.NornickelNornickel  the world’s largest producer of palladium and refined nickel  has issued $1.3 billion worth of tokenized contracts for its precious and base metals. These contracts are stored on the Atomyze blockchain and can help industrial firms track the origin and environmental integrity of their metals.Enterprise adoption of tokenization is on the riseAs we can see  there are a number of enterprises exploring the use of tokenization. From traditional institutions like Goldman Sachs to tech giants like Adobe  businesses are recognizing the potential of tokenization and its benefits for enterprise adoption of blockchain technology.The barrier between tokenization and the masses is also being broken. New options are emerging to help widen the accessibility of tokenization  including recently launched Horizen’s TokenMint. This automated drag-and-drop platform allows anyone  with or without programming knowledge  to create their own token with customized tokenomics.With its ability to increase security  transparency and immutability  tokenization is a powerful tool that can be used by enterprises to streamline their operations and create more trust with customers  investors and employees. Those who adopt tokenization will enjoy the advantages of greater efficiency  automation  fractional ownership options and increased liquidity – all of which can help businesses thrive in Web 3.0.Rob Viglione is the co-founder and team lead of the public blockchain Horizen  as well as the co-founder and CEO of Horizen Labs.

The Executive Board looked back on the successful year 2021  in which the company had once again reached important milestones on the way to the commercial development of its pyrolysis technology and achieved a total output of 3.7 million euros. The shareholders present approved all agenda items with a large majority. Renata Bandov was elected as a new member of the Supervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting. The lawyer is Head of Capital Markets at Deutsche Börse AG and takes over the vacant position after Jürgen Fischer resigned from office in January 2022. The Annual General Meeting also resolved to amend the object of the company in the Articles of Association. This is intended to enable the company to research not only plastic polymers but also other input materials as well as starting materials and the resulting products  and thus to further develop the company's business areas in the interests of its shareholders. The voting results of the Annual General Meeting are published in addition to the presentation on the Annual General Meeting on the homepage under https://www.pyrum.net/en/investors/general-shareholders-meeting/. About Pyrum Innovations AG Pyrum Innovations AG is active in the attractive recycling market for end-of-life-tyres with its patented pyrolysis technology. Pyrum's pyrolysis process is energy self-sufficient  saves a large portion of the CO 2 emissions normally generated during the disposal of end-of-life-tyres in a cement plant and produces new raw materials such as pyrolysis oil  gas and recovered carbon black from the waste used as input materials. In this way  Pyrum closes the recyclable material loop and pursues a completely sustainable business model. As a pioneer  Pyrum Innovations AG was the first company in the end-of-life-tyre recycling sector to receive REACH registration from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the pyrolysis oil it produces. This means that the oil is recognised as an official raw material that can be used in production processes. In addition  Pyrum has received ISCC PLUS certification for the pyrolysis oil and the recovered carbon black. Both products are thus considered sustainable and renewable raw materials. These achievements have also been recognised by international experts in the tyre industry. For example  Pyrum won the Best Tyre Recycling Innovation category at the inaugural Recircle Awards and has been nominated for the “Grand Prix Mittelstand” (""Großer Preis des Mittelstandes"") from the German state of Saarland.

The setup also includes Vesca  a leading local provider of payment solutions and network service provider (NSP)  and is targeted to mass market  mainly SME merchants across Japan. In this unique partnership  Worldline provides transaction processing and leverages the footprint  scale and technology of its global payment processing facilities  while Casio is the trusted and reliable front-end for merchants  having led the cash register market in Japan for 19 years  with cashless services part of its offering; and Vesca is the technical enabler that acts as the acceptance layer in Japan.This arrangement benefits merchants in Japan  particularly SMEs and small chains  and their customers. Credit card acceptance will no longer be a strain for these retail and service businesses who will benefit from speedy onboarding and more competitive costs  while keeping Casio as their trusted single point of contact for all check-out topics. Therefore  Worldline  Casio and Vesca will be able to successfully address the challenges posed by the Japanese ecosystem when it comes to card payments - cash dominated consumer behaviours and cumbersome lengthy onboarding processes.As a team  the three companies are ideally placed to address the requirements of the Japanese market and its strong and distinctive local characteristics. For example  a strong relationship typically binds together local merchants and their electronic cash register (ECR) provider or integrator  which in Japan  gatekeeps the checkout and payments process.Vincent Roland  Head of Merchant Services at Worldline  said: “We are extremely proud to be working with a prestigious brand such as Casio and we are confident this partnership is the right choice for our presence in the Japanese market. Our offering will booster card payments in a market with huge potential.”Shigenori Fujii  Senior General Manager  System Business Unit at Casio  added: “Worldline is the leading payments solutions provider in Europe  and it only made sense to collaborate with them as we aim to enlarge our offering for checkout payments and cashless services in Japan. Their professionalism and expertise are unparalleled. We want to develop this partnership further.”Building relationships with key local actors and delivering offerings using the latest payment technology are two core components of Worldline’s growth strategy when it comes to penetrate new markets. In this instance  the partnership brings together Worldline and Casio  both leading and highly respected operators in their respective fields  with shared values and objectives.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.54,0.28,0.17,True,English,"['Casio partner', 'cashless shopping', 'Worldline', 'Japan', 'global payment processing facilities', 'cumbersome payment acceptance ecosystem', 'leading payments solutions provider', 'strategic business alliance', 'electronic cash register', 'Senior General Manager', 'System Business Unit', 'two core components', 'distinctive local characteristics', 'key local actors', 'network service provider', 'leading local provider', 'Credit card acceptance', 'conservative retail landscape', 'latest payment technology', 'cash register market', 'cashless services part', 'payment solutions', 'payment services', 'global leader', 'transaction processing', 'acceptance layer', 'Japanese ecosystem', 'ECR) provider', 'card payments', 'service businesses', 'cashless shopping', 'payments process', 'local merchants', 'Merchant Services', 'huge potential', 'reliable front-end', 'technical enabler', 'small chains', 'speedy onboarding', 'competitive costs', 'single point', 'consumer behaviours', 'onboarding processes', 'three companies', 'Vincent Roland', 'prestigious brand', 'right choice', 'Shigenori Fujii', 'growth strategy', 'new markets', 'respected operators', 'respective fields', 'checkout payments', 'mass market', 'Japanese market', 'SME merchants', 'strong relationship', 'unique partnership', 'Casio Computer', 'Source', 'Worldline', 'Euronext', 'WLN', 'setup', 'Vesca', 'NSP', 'footprint', 'scale', 'trusted', '19 years', 'offering', 'arrangement', 'SMEs', 'customers', 'strain', 'contact', 'topics', 'challenges', 'team', 'requirements', 'example', 'integrator', 'Head', 'presence', 'Europe', 'sense', 'professionalism', 'expertise', 'relationships', 'instance', 'values', 'objectives']",2022-07-15,2022-07-15,finextra.com

Demand for rental homes has picked up after the COVID-19 pandemic  and the higher occupancy rate is mainly attributable to growth in service consumption and the consequent improvement in service-sector employment rate. Economic uncertainty and higher consumer prices and interest rates are also in part reflected in the rising demand for rental homes.Story continues- During the period under review  we at SATO focused on developing our customer service and rental operations to align them even better with customer needs.- SATO sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyväskylä and Oulu regions to Heimstaden. The divestment implements the SATO strategy to focus housing investments on the Helsinki Metropolitan area and its commuter area along the main railway line as well as on Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.- May saw the commencement of the construction of a rental homes property in Rykmentinpuisto  Tuusula. The project is SATO’s first new housing investment in Tuusula in more than 15 years.- May also saw the completion of a timber apartment building in Lupajantie in the Mellunmäki district of Helsinki. The two-storey timber-structure low-rise apartment buildings feature 112 non-subsidised rental homes. The design solutions employed pay attention to energy efficiency as well as construction solutions and materials that will last for decades.- I would like to thank SATO employees for their great work to develop customer satisfaction and the housing comfort of our residents.Operating environmentOver the reporting period  SATO’s operating environment was affected by the war in Ukraine  high inflation  and the continued high level of rental housing supply  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area.The first months of the year saw rapid economic growth as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted  resulting in growing service consumption and  consequently  improved employment rate. Russia’s attack on Ukraine in late February made the economic outlook increasingly uncertain. The biggest impacts are related to the surge in prices of energy and materials  and challenges in supply chains  which could already be seen in late 2021. Cost increases remained at a high level throughout the reporting period  and central banks had to make interest rate hikes to curb the increases in costs. Several forecasting institutions have lowered their growth projections for the current and coming year. The uncertainty has resulted in a major decline in consumer confidence. According to the consumer confidence indicator published by Statistics Finland on 27 June 2022  consumers’ expectations concerning their own finances and the Finnish economy were very pessimistic in June.Inflation remained high in early 2022. According to preliminary Eurostat data  the rate of inflation in June was expected to be 8.6% in the euro area and 8.1% in Finland. The main component pushing up prices was the surge in energy and food prices. The accelerating inflation rate has raised overall interest rate levels  and central banks have tightened their monetary policy to curb price increases. The European Central Bank (ECB) intends to raise the key ECB interest rates in July and again in September. Inflation is  however  anticipated to slow during 2023.There are signs of slowing in the record-high rate of construction that has been seen for a long period time. The May economic forecast of the Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries (RT) estimates that rental housing starts will decline by around a fifth to around 39 000 homes this year  with the figure for next year projected to settle at the long-term level of housing production demand at 35 000 homes.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental homes and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban housing with good access to public transport is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while at the same time Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the proportion of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services.The demographic change and the price development of owner-occupied homes create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Outside growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes acquiring an owner-occupied home in a growth centre even more challenging for people coming from those areas.REVIEW PERIOD 1 January to 30 June 2022 (1 January to 30 June 2021)Net sales and profitIn January–June 2022  SATO Corporation’s consolidated net sales totalled EUR 147.2 million (148.2).Operating profit was EUR 166.8 million (194.0).

The reporting period saw the completion of 191 rental homes (41). The number of divested rental apartments and part-ownership apartments redeemed by residents totalled 2 018.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. Its housing stock is concentrated in areas and apartment sizes which are expected to be the focus  in the long term  of increasing rental apartment demand. The allocation of building repairs is based on lifecycle plans and repair need specifications.At the end of June  the fair value of investment properties came to a total of EUR 4 976.7 million (4 916.4). The change in the value of investment properties  including the rental apartments acquired and divested during the reporting period  was EUR -56.0 million (162.9).At the end of June  the commuting zone of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area accounted for around 87%  Tampere and Turku together made up around 11% and St Petersburg around 2% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments  and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth.

Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in rental apartments stood at EUR 68.5 million (59.6).

The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.The war in Ukraine is a short-term risk affecting the operating environment  the duration and impacts of which on the Finnish economy are difficult to estimate. The war’s biggest impacts have been seen in the prices of energy  food  and materials as well as in supply chains. An increase in energy  food  and consumer goods prices may slow economic growth  considerably increase the interest rate level  and have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to perform their obligations. Such decline in the economy or economic activity may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for rents to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO’s housing stock. In line with its refined strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other financing commitments. In 2019  the company issued an EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme  under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 1 050.0 million.The means for managing liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 700 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans represent an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by fixed rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio.SATO currently has 522 apartments in St Petersburg. Investments in Russia commenced in 2007. The last investment decision was made in 2013 and the property was completed in 2016. There are risks related to the business environment in our St. Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk  with related hedging options examined in accordance with our treasury policy. SATO will refrain from making new investments in Russia. Following the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has looked into opportunities to exit the business in Russia. According to the explorations  a speedy exit is not possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent out the homes in St Petersburg for the time being. It is expected that the operating environment in Russia will be highly uncertain for a long period of time and could result in disruptions to SATO's business activities in Russia and with parties related to business in Russia and also impact the ability of SATO to make payments to its suppliers  employees and authorities as well as receive payments from its customers  which could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on SATO's business in Russia and even result in SATO limiting or ceasing its operations in Russia and with parties related to Russia for a long period of time. Should the war in Ukraine be prolonged  carrying out business in Russia may have negative impacts on the company’s reputation and may hamper business in Finland or have adverse effects on the company’s ability to access finance in the market  which may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  financial costs or value of SATO-owned properties.For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group’s website and Annual Report for 2021 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  competitive situation  and interest rate level.The first months of the year saw rapid economic growth as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted  resulting in growing service consumption and  consequently  improved employment rate. Russia’s attack on Ukraine in late February made the economic outlook increasingly uncertain. The biggest impacts are related to the surge in the prices of energy and materials and to challenges in supply chains  which could already be seen in late 2021. Cost increases remained at a high level throughout the reporting period. Higher construction costs may postpone some of SATO’s future investment decisions.There are slight signs of slowing in the record-high rate of construction that has been seen for a long period time. The May economic forecast of the Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries (RT) estimates that rental housing starts will decline by around a fifth to around 39 000 homes this year  with the figure for next year projected to settle at the long-term level of housing production demand at 35 000 homes. This will be reflected in the supply of rental homes over the long term.Several forecasting institutions have lowered their growth projections for the current and coming year. The uncertainty has resulted in a major decline in consumer confidence. According to the consumer confidence indicator published by Statistics Finland on 27 June 2022  consumers’ expectations concerning their own finances and the Finnish economy were very pessimistic in April.The accelerating inflation rate has raised overall interest rate levels  and central banks have tightened their monetary policy to curb price increases. The European Central Bank (ECB) intends to raise the key ECB interest rates in July and again in September. Inflation is  however  anticipated to slow during 2023. High inflation increases  in addition to higher property maintenance expenses  the interest rate level and  and consequently  SATO’s finance costs. The ample supply of rental homes prevents the transfer of higher costs caused by inflation fully to rents.However  with COVID-19 restrictions lifted and service-sector employment improving  demand for centrally located homes has started to grow  which is reflected in the improved occupancy rate. The economic uncertainty  pressure for interest rate hikes and increases in consumer prices have also been in part reflected in increased demand for rental homes.The continued high level of housing supply particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area has maintained intense competition for good tenants and was reflected over the period under review in SATO’s business as a slight decrease in average rents year on year. With greater choice available for those looking for a home  the role of a successful customer experience has become even more important. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its presence close to customers and in digital services.SATO Corporation’s shareholders on 30 June 2022Largest shareholders and their holdingsnumber%• Balder Finska Otas AB (Fastighets AB Balder) 31 854 535 56.1% • Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool 12 811 647 22.6% • Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company 7 233 081 12.7% • State Pension Fund of Finland 2 796 200 4.9% • Valkila Erkka 385 000 0.7% • Research Foundation of Pulmonary Diseases 227 000 0.4% • SATO Corporation 166 000 0.3% • Entelä Tuula 159 000 0.3% • Heinonen Erkki 156 684 0.3% • Tradeka-invest Ltd 126 500 0.2% • Others (117 shareholders) 867 420 1.5%On 30 June 2022  SATO had 56 783 067 shares and 127 shareholders registered in the book-entry system.

Photograph: Billy Stickland/InphoLast weekend’s stunning victory over New Zealand was Ireland’s most significant result since Jackie Kyle’s team of 1948 won the Grand Slam. That wonderful team re-established the future of rugby unity on the island  both North and South  after the second World War.When the inspirational players of Kyle’s generation graced our fields winning a Grand Slam was rugby’s pinnacle. There was no greater prize. In 1987  when the northern hemisphere teams reluctantly competed in the first Rugby World Cup  all that changed.The true Holy Grail of rugby is now global. A Grand Slam is an extraordinary achievement but the William Webb Ellis trophy is rugby’s ultimate prize.Shamefully  Ireland have lost nine World Cup quarter-finals in a row. Ireland’s coach Andy Farrells mission is to drastically change that situation.In a truly astonishing achievement  Farrell and his staff have reconstructed this Irish team from the rubble of the 2019 World Cup to empower Johnny Sexton’s team to smash through a century-old barrier and catapult Ireland into the elite club of rugby nations who have defeated New Zealand on Kiwi soil.In winning a Test and then defeating the New Zealand Maori this has become Ireland’s most successful tour of all time. Ireland now hope to emulate England (2003)  South Africa (2019) and Australia (1991 and 1999 ) who all defeated New Zealand in Aotearoa in the years immediately prior to their World Cup successes.The true gravitas of the victory in Dunedin is that Ireland can now rightfully aspire to emulate those feats. One of the three World Cup campaigns I was privileged to observe at very close quarters was that of the 1999 winning Wallabies. Their coach Rod McQueen was a highly detailed long-term planner. The Wallabies draw suggested that they should face New Zealand in the 1999 final. No one could have foreseen the French producing one of rugby’s greatest ever matches and knock the Kiwis out at the semi-final stage.So a major goal in preparing for 1999 World Cup was to slay the myth of the black jersey on their home soil and place doubt in Kiwi minds before the tournament. In 1998  a year out from the World Cup  the Wallabies defeated New Zealand 27-23 at Lancaster Park  Christchurch.I attended that match on a cold  clear New Zealand winter day. At full-time the shift of momentum towards the Wallabies was something that you could physically feel.Farrell’s planning is that Ireland may have to defeat New Zealand at the quarter-final stage in next year’s World Cup. Last Saturday in Dunedin that same feeling from 1999  of momentum swinging from the ancient champion to the upstart contender  could be physically felt. The pendulum swung drastically towards the men in green.Read morePrior to the last two World Cups in England (2015) and Japan (2019)  Ireland did not have an attacking game plan that could score enough points to defeat great teams away from home. Critically  they also did not possess a mindset with enough power for success. Defeats to the far lesser talented teams of Argentina in 2015 and Japan in 2019 support this as fact.Mentally  spiritually and tactically Ireland did not have what it takes to compete at the elite end of World Cups. Always transfixed with the annual Six Nations  Ireland could never look far enough ahead for World Cup success.Crucially  Irish preparations for past World Cups have been built on foundations of sand because they did not have a game plan capable of scoring enough tries against the great teams to win.In its essence  this meant that Irish teams had not done the level of work required to win in the years prior to World Cups. As the sign over the door of the USA Olympic Training Centre at Colorado Springs states  “It’s not every four years  it’s every day”.But that was in the past. The two victories over the past seven days are the result of two years of hard work by Farrell and his staff. The team mirrors Farrell’s own journey to find his own voice as a coach.One of Andy Farrell’s strengths is that he understands that failing is not failure. Photograph: Billy Stickland/InphoIn the beginning  Farrell was trying to be a loyal Joe Schmidt clone. This failed to the point that termination of his contract was a real possibility. One of Farrell’s strengths is that he understands that failing is not failure. After a series of very poor Irish performances  he read the tea leaves. There was a deep and honest evaluation that led to the creation of a new innovative plan. This has resulted in a massive change within the philosophy of play  selection policies  game plans and culture.In finding his own voice Farrell has moved from being a coach close to dismissal to becoming a transformational leader and more power to him. The performance of the Irish team since November 2021 has been nothing short of astonishing.Perhaps Farrell’s greatest achievement has been the growth of Ireland’s mental capabilities to take on the world’s best away from the support of Lansdowne Road.The former New Zealand captain Todd Blackadder said in 2002 that “Test match rugby is a mental exercise; you can be the most gifted team in the world but that counts for nothing if your mind isn’t totally focused and that can only come with experience. We have to acquire the mental toughness to bring the World Cup back to where it belongs.”Todd’s wise words are totally accurate. Defeat at Eden Park was the experience that forced the Irish team to grow their mindset to the point capable of winning in Dunedin. Growing the mental strength required for success at World Cups can only be achieved by performing against great opponents before the World Cup.Ireland are gaining the vital experiences of performing and winning in rugby’s most ferocious environment.The Irish players have proved to themselves that if they play to the optimum level of their abilities  their game plan can beat the best the world can offer  in the toughest of environmentsThat is the reason why the third Test in Wellington is close to irrelevant. With two wins on this tour Ireland are already successful. New Zealand need to save face and win the series  Ireland do not.No matter what the result brings  Ireland will take away from this tour buckets of belief in their coaches and themselves. Along with confidence in their game plan and their mental strength to cope with any environment.Everything in Irish rugby must now be totally focused on what has real value before the 2023 World Cup. Australia  South Africa  France and England are all at home next season. That is a super preparation for Ireland.When Ireland defeated New Zealand in Dunedin  their stock exchange  the NZX  dropped. The Kiwis lost confidence. If the market theories hold any truth of being not only logical but also emotional  then the Euronext Dublin should have a rather bullish session come Monday morning.,positive,0.63,0.33,0.04,mixed,0.3,0.12,0.58,True,English,"['Matt Williams', 'successful tour', 'Wellington', 'Ireland', 'cold, clear New Zealand winter day', 'William Webb Ellis trophy', 'USA Olympic Training Centre', 'loyal Joe Schmidt clone', 'nine World Cup quarter-finals', 'three World Cup campaigns', 'last two World Cups', 'first Rugby World Cup', ""Karl Tu'inukuafe"", 'detailed long-term planner', 'Colorado Springs states', 'World Cup successes', 'true Holy Grail', 'Andy Farrells mission', 'annual Six Nations', 'northern hemisphere teams', 'lesser talented teams', 'past seven days', 'new innovative plan', 'second World War', 'poor Irish performances', 'New Zealand Maori', 'attacking game plan', 'past World Cups', 'A Grand Slam', 'The Wallabies draw', '2019 World Cup', '1999 World Cup', 'two victories', 'Irish teams', 'true gravitas', 'great teams', 'game plans', 'rugby nations', 'Irish preparations', 'Tadhg Furlong', 'second Test', 'Billy Stickland', 'inspirational players', 'greater prize', 'extraordinary achievement', 'ultimate prize', 'astonishing achievement', 'Johnny Sexton', 'century-old barrier', 'elite club', 'Kiwi soil', 'successful tour', 'close quarters', 'Rod McQueen', 'semi-final stage', 'major goal', 'black jersey', 'Kiwi minds', 'Lancaster Park', 'quarter-final stage', 'next year', 'same feeling', 'ancient champion', 'upstart contender', 'enough points', 'elite end', 'enough tries', 'real possibility', 'tea leaves', 'honest evaluation', 'massive change', 'selection policies', 'transformational leader', 'mental capabilities', 'two years', '1999 winning Wallabies', 'rugby unity', 'stunning victory', 'significant result', 'Jackie Kyle', 'wonderful team', 'South Africa', 'home soil', 'enough power', 'hard work', 'greatest achievement', 'Ireland', 'Dunedin', 'Photograph', 'Inpho', 'future', 'island', 'generation', 'fields', 'pinnacle', 'row', 'coach', 'situation', 'staff', 'rubble', 'time', 'England', 'Australia', 'Aotearoa', 'feats', 'French', 'matches', 'Kiwis', 'myth', 'doubt', 'tournament', 'Christchurch', 'shift', 'momentum', 'something', 'planning', 'pendulum', 'green', 'Japan', 'mindset', 'Argentina', 'fact', 'foundations', 'sand', 'essence', 'level', 'door', 'journey', 'voice', 'strengths', 'failure', 'beginning', 'termination', 'contract', 'series', 'deep', 'creation', 'philosophy', 'culture', 'dismissal', 'November']",2022-07-15,2022-07-15,irishtimes.com

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that a Phase 3 trial assessing the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in children aged 1 to 11 years with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) met its primary endpoint of histological disease remission at 16 weeks with both higher and lower dose weight-tiered regimens. There are no approved treatments for children with EoE under 12 years of age.""Dupixent is the first medicine to alleviate key signs of eosinophilic esophagitis in children as young as 1 year of age in a Phase 3 trial. The efficacy of Dupixent demonstrates that in this age group  as in adults  IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this debilitating disease "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Eosinophilic esophagitis can turn the basic and life-sustaining act of eating into a painful experience at a point in children's lives when proper nutrition and achieving a healthy weight is critical to ensuring they grow and thrive. The positive results from this Phase 3 pediatric trial show Dupixent has the potential to improve signs of eosinophilic esophagitis and support healthy weight gain in children from their first birthday.""EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and children with EoE demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. In children  common symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis include acid reflux  vomiting  abdominal discomfort  trouble swallowing  and a failure to thrive. These symptoms can impact growth and development  and can cause food-related fear and anxiety which can persist through adulthood. Diet adjustments  which oftentimes include the elimination of many foods  is the standard treatment for EoE  as well as the use of treatments not approved for the disease. These include proton pump inhibitors  swallowed topical corticosteroids  or in severe cases  a feeding tube  which may be used to ensure proper caloric intake and weight gain. Of the approximately 21 000 children under the age of 12 in the U.S. currently being treated for EoE  about 9 000 do not satisfactorily respond to the unapproved therapies they have been treated with and potentially require advanced therapy.""We are incredibly excited to share results from this Phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating Dupixent in young children suffering from eosinophilic esophagitis – the first ever to show positive results across a variety of primary and secondary endpoints. The lack of treatment options for children living with eosinophilic esophagitis leaves many caregivers with the stress and burden of adapting their child's meals and their entire family's daily schedules to ensure healthy growth and development. In some cases  they must resort to off-label use of poorly studied treatments like steroids that can pose serious health risks when used long term "" said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Senior Vice President  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""The faster and larger than anticipated enrollment in this trial further emphasizes the unmet treatment needs for children with EoE and underscores the significance of these first-ever positive results.""In the Phase 3 trial  102 children aged 1 to 11 were randomized to receive Dupixent  in either a higher dose (n=37) or lower dose (n=31) regimen based on body weight  or placebo (n=34). At 16 weeks  68% of children on higher dose and 58% of patients on lower dose Dupixent achieved the primary endpoint of significant histological disease remission (peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤6 eosinophils [eos]/high power field [hpf]) compared to 3% of children on placebo (p<0.0001 for both). Additionally  children receiving higher dose Dupixent experienced the following changes at week 16:86% reduction in peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count from baseline compared to a 21% increase for placebo (p<0.0001).0.88 and 0.84 reduction from baseline in disease severity and extent  respectively  as measured at the microscopic level in biopsy specimens compared to a 0.02 and 0.05 increase for placebo (both p<0.0001).3.5-point reduction in abnormal endoscopic findings from baseline compared to a 0.3-point increase for placebo (p<0.0001).A numerical improvement in the proportion of days children experienced symptoms of EoE from baseline  as reported by caregivers (Pediatric EOE signs/symptoms questionnaire [PESQ-C])  compared to placebo  though not statistically significant. The PESQ-C is a novel endpoint developed by Regeneron and Sanofi used for the first time in this trial  designed to assess symptoms in young children through their caregivers (as signs)  as children may have difficulty verbalizing their symptoms themselves.As part of a prespecified exploratory analysis  a 3.09 percentile increase in body weight for age percentile from baseline compared to 0.29 for placebo.Histological  anatomic and cellular secondary endpoints were also analyzed for the lower dose group  with all being nominally significant and generally comparable with the higher dose. More detailed results will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting  including additional data for the endpoints in the lower dose group.Safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved EoE indication for children and adults aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg. For the 16-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 79% for Dupixent and 91% for placebo. AEs more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included COVID-19 (21% Dupixent  0% placebo; all cases were mild or moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation)  rash (9% Dupixent  6% placebo)  headache (8% Dupixent  3% placebo)  viral gastroenteritis (6% Dupixent  3% placebo)  diarrhea (6% Dupixent  3% placebo) and nausea (6% Dupixent  0% placebo). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs prior to week 16 were 0% for Dupixent and 6% for placebo.In May 2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent 300 mg weekly to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg after granting the medicine Priority Review.The potential use of Dupixent in children with EoE aged 1 to 11 years is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority. These data will be discussed with regulatory authorities around the world  starting with the U.S. later this year.About the Dupixent Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis TrialThe Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in young children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE  as determined by histological and patient- or caregiver-reported measures. At baseline  98% of these patients had at least one co-existing type 2 inflammatory disease such as food allergy  allergic rhinitis  asthma and atopic dermatitis.Patients received Dupixent subcutaneously at either a higher dose or lower dose regimen based on their weight (ranging from ≥5 kg to <60 kg) over a 16-week period  at which point all endpoints were assessed. The dosing frequency ranged between every two weeks and every four weeks  based on weight.The primary endpoint was histological disease remission. Secondary endpoints included histopathologic measures of the severity and extent of tissue scarring in the esophagus (EoE-HSS grade and stage scores  which measure changes in eight cellular and tissue features on 0-3 scales  respectively)  and abnormal endoscopic findings (EoE Endoscopic Reference Score [EoE-EREFS] on a 0-18 scale)  as well as changes in caregiver-reported symptoms (proportion of days with 1 or more EoE signs [e.g. stomach pain  vomiting  food refusal] by the Pediatric EoE Sign/Symptom Questionnaire-caregiver version [PESQ-C]). An exploratory endpoint assessed change from baseline in body weight for age percentile.The trial is ongoing with a 36-week extended active treatment period to evaluate long-term outcomes.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and EoE  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan. More than 400 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis under 18 years of age.to treat adults and children 12 years of age and older  who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg)  with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with eosinophilic esophagitis under 12 years of age and who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT®.Before using DUPIXENT  tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions  including if you:have eye problems.have a parasitic (helminth) infection.are scheduled to receive any vaccinations.
