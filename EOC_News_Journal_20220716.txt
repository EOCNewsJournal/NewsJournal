If the chairman of the Board of Directors is the CEO or another member of the Company's management  he or she may not be a part of the nomination committee. In such cases  another director shall replace the chairman of the Board of Directors in the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall meet the requirements of composition set out in the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (the ""Code""). If the larger shareholders who have the right to appoint members of the nomination committee wish to appoint persons with the consequence that the requirements of composition provided in the Code are not met  the first choice of the larger shareholder shall have precedence over a smaller shareholder. When appointing a new member  the shareholder who shall appoint the new member shall consider the composition of the current nomination committee in terms of the Code.Should any of the three largest shareholders abstain from their right to appoint a member of the nomination committee  the right to appoint a member shall pass to the next shareholder in line that does not already have the right to appoint a member of the nomination committee. However  the procedure shall only continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.The names of the members of the nomination committee and of the shareholders they represent shall normally be made public on the Company's website at the latest six months prior to the annual general meeting. At this convening  the nomination committee shall appoint a chair amongst its members. The mandate period of the nomination committee shall extend until the next nomination committee is appointed. Changes in the composition of the nomination committee shall be made public on the website of the Company as soon as they have occurred.If a change in the Company's ownership structure occurs after the last trading day in August but before the date which occurs six months ahead of the forthcoming annual general meeting  and if a shareholder  due to or after this change  becomes one of the three largest shareholders in terms of voting rights  who are registered in the share register of the Company or when applicable  other central securities depositories or other evidence of such shareholding which is acceptable to the nomination committee  makes a request to the chair of the nomination committee to be part of the nomination committee  the shareholder shall have the right  in the discretion of the nomination committee  either to appoint an additional member of the nomination committee or to appoint a member who shall replace the member appointed by the shareholder representing the least number of votes in the nomination committee following the changes in the Company's ownership structure.A shareholder who has appointed a member of the nomination committee has the right to dismiss the member and appoint a new member. If such an exchange takes place  the shareholder shall without delay give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who shall be exchanged  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). The notification shall contain the name of the dismissed member and the person who shall replace him as member of the nomination committee.A member who prematurely resigns from his task shall give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who resigns  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). In such case  the nomination committee shall without delay call upon the shareholder who has appointed the member to appoint a new member. If a new member is not appointed by the shareholder  the nomination committee shall offer other larger shareholders with respect to votes  to appoint members of the nomination committee. Such offer shall be made in order of priority to the largest shareholders with respect to voting rights (that is  first to the largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so  thereafter to the second largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so etc.). The procedure shall continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.No remuneration is to be paid to members of the nomination committee. The company shall  however  defray all reasonable expenses that are required for the work of the nomination committee.Instructions for the nomination committeeThe members of the nomination committee are to promote the common interests of all the shareholders of the Company and are not to reveal the content or details of any discussion held during the nomination committee meetings unduly. Each member of the nomination committee is to consider carefully whether there are any conflicts of interest or other circumstances that make their service on the nomination committee inappropriate before accepting the assignment to form part of the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall fulfil the tasks set out in the Code and shall  when applicable  present proposals to an upcoming general meeting for:the election of the chairman of the meeting; the number of directors elected by the general meeting; the election of the chairman and members of the Board of Directors; the fees and other remuneration of elected members of the Board of Directors and of the members of the committees of the Board of Directors; the election of the auditor(s); the remuneration of the auditor(s); and principles for the composition of the nomination committee including any changes to the instructions to the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall apply item 4.1 in the Code regarding the diversity policy  whereby the nomination committee shall take into account that the Board of Directors  with regard to the Company's operations  development stage and other conditions  shall have an appropriate composition  characterised by versatility in respect to the competence  experience  geographic coverage and background of the members elected a general meeting. Furthermore  the nomination committee shall work with the goal of achieving an even gender distribution on the Board of Directors.The nomination committee has the right  at the Company's reasonable expense  to engage external consultants whom the nomination committee considers necessary to fulfil its task.Agenda item 13; Resolution on the number of members of the Board of DirectorsThe nomination committee proposes that the Meeting resolves that the board of directors shall consist of six (6) directors and no deputy directors.Agenda item 14; Election of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of DirectorsThe nomination committee proposes that the Meeting resolves on the election/re-election (as applicable) of:Members of the Board of Directors:Remco Westermann (re-election) for a period until the end of the first annual general meeting after the resolution  Tobias M.

Mary Ann Halford is independent of the Company and its major shareholders.A presentation of the board members that are proposed to be re-elected can be found on the company's website  www.mgi-se.com.Agenda item 15; Resolution on the remuneration to the Board of DirectorsThe nomination committee proposes that the Meeting resolves on remuneration to the board of directors  for the time until the next annual general meeting  as follows:EUR 100 000 shall be paid to the chairman of the board; EUR 50 000 shall be paid to the other board members elected by the annual general meeting that are not employed by the company; An additional EUR 25 000 shall be paid to the chairman of the audit committee; and An additional EUR 25 000 shall be paid to the chairman of the remuneration committee.Agenda item 16; Resolution to approve MGI's ESOP programThe ESOP program in shortMGI has  through resolutions by the Board of Directors  in April 2020  January 2021 and February 2022 adopted an employee stock option program directed to approximately 50 key employees of MGI (""ESOP""). In order to facilitate the ESOP  MGI has resolved to grant to Bodhivas GmbH  which is owned by the largest shareholder of MGI (""Bodhivas"") the right to subscribe for up to 15 million Ordinary A Shares. Under the ESOP  Bodhivas has corresponding obligations towards the participants to deliver Ordinary A Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESOP (the right to receive Ordinary A Shares from Bodhivas is referred to as ""phantom stock""). Bodhivas has further (i) undertaken towards the participants to pay out the upside value between strike price and exercise value at the moment of exercise and to deliver this value either in Ordinary A Shares or in cash and (ii) undertaken towards MGI to manage the ESOP program and (iii) formally agreed that in relation to this ESOP program  any profit by Bodhivas is for the benefit of MGI and any loss incurred by Bodhivas is to be borne by MGI (i.e.  Bodhivas only facilitates the implementation of the ESOP program but does not have any economic interest in the ESOP program).Options under the ESOP can be exercised from May 1  2024  at the earliest  until December 31  2030. There are currently two different programs which differ primarily in terms of start date and strike price. The first started on May 1  2020 and has a strike price of EUR 1.30 (in total approx. 9.2m options). The second started on January 2021 and has a strike price of EUR 2.60 (approx. 3.3m options). For employees participating in the second program but starting at a later date  the strike price is at a premium of 20% above the average share price of 10 trading days prior to the grant date  however always with a minimum of EUR 2.60 (please see below for a proposed amendment of the strike price). Both programs under the ESOP have an end date of December 31  2030.No employee has been granted more than 2 550 000 options under the ESOP. The options under the ESOP are subject to vesting periods  meaning that participants who leave their employment during the programs will lose any unvested shares. The vesting period to become entitled to 100% of the options is 60 months in total and occurs in several partial steps over the entire vesting period.If a participant in the program leaves the Company (voluntarily or due to termination by employer for breach by employee) within two years after the start date of the phantom stock program  all phantom stock is lost. If a participant in the program leaves after more than two years after the start of the phantom stock program the participant loses 50% of the two most recent years of vested phantom stock.The ESOP does not contain any performance criteria in addition to the strike price  due to MGI wanting to incentivize participants  encourage long-term shareholding in the company and local market practice in Malta and the jurisdictions where the group is active.The maximum cumulative amount of options which can be granted under the ESOP to existing and future participants (and consequently the maximum number of Ordinary A Shares which can be issued under the ESOP  except in the event of recalculation) is 15 000 000  of which approx. 12.5 million options have been granted. If all granted options under the ESOP were to be exercised  the dilution would be 7.85 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares) and if all options were to be granted and exercised  the dilution would be 9.41 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares).MGI has not had  and is not expected to have  any material (cash relevant) costs for the ESOP programs. For additional information on the ESOP  please also refer to MGI's annual reports.Following the relocation to Sweden  due to differences between Swedish and Maltese corporate law  the board of directors intends to exercise its authorization (as proposed under item 19 below) to issue warrants to Bodhivas  MGI or a group company in order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the ESOP. MGI may also require that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a MGI group company.Further  due to prevailing market conditions and the Company's share price development  for certain participants in the second program (where the strike price has been determined based on a premium (plus 20%) compared to the average share price prior to the grant date  as described above) the current strike price is too high in comparison to the current market value  which leads to a loss of the incentivizing effect of such program. The board of directors therefore proposes that the second program is adjusted so that the maximum and minimum strike price is the same for all participants (i.e.  EUR 2.60)The board of directors therefore proposes that the Meeting approves (i) the ESOP  (ii) that MGI shall be entitled to grant Bodhivas or MGI or a group company of MGI the right to subscribe for warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares)  to (iii) entitle MGI to ensure that warrants or shares or the cash value can be delivered to the participants in the ESOP program on the same terms and conditions that now apply for the ESOP contracts with Bodhivas  (iv) entitle MGI to request that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a group company  (v) approve the adjustment of the strike price for all participants that were granted options before this AGM -in the second program to be EUR 2.60  and (vi) entitle the Board of MGI to take all steps required to execute measures (i) - (v).Approval of transfer of shares to participants in the ESOP programThe board of director proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the intended exercise of the authorisation to issue Ordinary A shares or warrants and that not more than 15 000 000 Ordinary A Shares or warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares) are transferred to existing and future participants in the ESOP program in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESOP  including the above proposed amendments of the program.Agenda item 17 Extraordinary Resolution to approve the change in name of the Company from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE and to approve the new Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company to effect this changeWhile preparing the relocation from Malta to Sweden the Company was notified that the relevant Swedish rules do not permit the registration of Media and Games Invest under its current name in Sweden due to the name being too generic.Based on that requirement  the Company wishes to change its name from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE after this AGM and in advance of the Proposed Transfer (as defined and described below in under item 18)  which name will also be retained after completion of the Proposed Transfer.The change in the name of the Company will require an amendment to the current memorandum and articles of association of the Company (the ""Current M&A"") to include the new name  which change will become effective once the amended memorandum and articles of association with the new name (the ""Interim M&A"") are filed with and registered by the Malta Business Registry following the Meeting.The Interim M&A (reflecting the limited amendments to the Current M&A for the purpose of the name change) are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's name be changed from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE; that the Current M&A be replaced by the Interim M&A to be adopted following this Meeting; and to authorize the Company Secretary and/or any one (1) Director of the Company to register a copy of the Interim M&A with the Malta Business Registry (the ""MBR"").Agenda item 18; Extraordinary resolution to approve a transfer proposal for the re-domiciliation of the Company from Malta to Sweden and to approve the new statutes of the Company to be adopted following its re-domiciliation and upon registration as a Swedish companyFollowing an evaluation by the Board of Directors and management of the Company  in light of Malta's grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in mid-2021  the Company believes that having the Company's registered office in Malta may result in an increased risk premium on the Company's shares and may preclude further investment from prospective investors.Given that the Company's core business is in North America and Continental Europe  and that its operations are not tied to Malta  the Board of Directors has chosen Sweden as the new registered office and headquarter of the Company. The Board of Director's decision was motivated by the fact that the Company; (i) has been listed in Sweden since 2020  (ii) is already familiar with the local capital markets  and (iii) has a very strong local network on the ground  as well as several operating subsidiaries and employees in Stockholm. Furthermore  a large part of the Company's shareholders hail from the Nordics and the Swedish regulatory framework is globally recognized. While MGI's listing structure currently covers three jurisdictions - Malta (registered office)  Germany (listing) and Sweden (listing) - the administrative complexity will be significantly reduced as a result of the relocation.Due to the above  the Board of Directors is proposing that the general meeting resolves that the Company transfers its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden (the ""Proposed Transfer"") pursuant to Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European Company (SE) (the ""SE Regulation"") and in terms of Article 6 (1) of Subsidiary Legislation 386.17 - Transfer of Registered Office of a European Company (SE) Regulations (the ""Subsidiary Legislation"").To this end and in connection with the obligation set out under Article 8 of the SE Regulation  the Board of Directors has prepared and submitted a transfer proposal (""Transfer Proposal"") and a transfer report (""Transfer Report"") to the MBR  which provide explanations of the legal and economic aspects of the Proposed Transfer  including a description of any implications for the Company's shareholders  creditors and employees as a result of the Proposed Transfer.Shareholders are hereby being notified of their right to examine the Transfer Proposal and the Transfer Report  copies of which are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/The Proposed Transfer will also require the substitution of the Interim M&A with new statutes of the Company (the ""New Statutes""). The New Statutes are to enter into force following the Proposed Transfer and upon registration of MGI as a Swedish company.The New Statutes are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposed that the Meeting resolves on the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's transfer of its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden in terms of the SE Regulation and the Subsidiary Legislation be  and hereby is  approved; that the Transfer Proposal and Transfer Report be  and hereby are  approved; and that the Interim M&A be replaced by the New Statutes upon the Company's registration as a Swedish company. That the Board of MGI is entitled to do all that is required to execute the above measures and actionsAgenda item 19 Authorisation for the Board of Directors to issue shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the CompanyWith reference to the proposal under item 18 for the re-domiciliation of the Company's registered office from Malta to Sweden. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that it would be beneficial for the Company for the Board of Directors to be authorised to (a) issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions and (b) restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue.The purpose of this authorization would be to finance acquisitions  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).Accordingly  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolution:Without prejudice to the existing authorisation to the Board of Directors  in terms of article 3 of the Company's articles of association  to issue shares of any class  options which may be convertible into shares  and other rights and/or securities (by whatever name referred to) which may entitle the holder thereof to subscribe to shares in the Company  in each case up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the Company  which authorisation shall remain valid and in effect  to authorize the Board of Directors to - at one or several occasions and for the time period until the next annual general meeting of the Company - issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions  and with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights (i.e. have the right to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue) and in each case within the limits of the company's articles of association. The purpose of the authorisation and the possibility to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be to enable the use of securities as consideration for or as financing of acquisitions of companies or businesses (including for payments of earn-outs and other deferred payments)  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).(Swedish translation: […] att bemyndiga styrelsen att efter bytet av bolagets registrerade säte - vid ett eller flera tillfällen intill slutet av nästkommande årsstämma - emittera nya aktier  optioner  teckningsoptioner och konvertibler i bolaget  med eller utan bestämmelser om apport  kvittning eller andra villkor  och med eller utan avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt (dvs. en rättighet att inskränka eller begränsa företrädesrätten hos befintliga aktieägare med avseende på sådana emissioner) inom ramen för de gränser som sätts av bolagets bolagsordning.

When appointing a new member  the shareholder who shall appoint the new member shall consider the composition of the current nomination committee in terms of the Code.Should any of the three largest shareholders abstain from their right to appoint a member of the nomination committee  the right to appoint a member shall pass to the next shareholder in line that does not already have the right to appoint a member of the nomination committee. However  the procedure shall only continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.The names of the members of the nomination committee and of the shareholders they represent shall normally be made public on the Company's website at the latest six months prior to the annual general meeting. At this convening  the nomination committee shall appoint a chair amongst its members. The mandate period of the nomination committee shall extend until the next nomination committee is appointed. Changes in the composition of the nomination committee shall be made public on the website of the Company as soon as they have occurred.If a change in the Company's ownership structure occurs after the last trading day in August but before the date which occurs six months ahead of the forthcoming annual general meeting  and if a shareholder  due to or after this change  becomes one of the three largest shareholders in terms of voting rights  who are registered in the share register of the Company or when applicable  other central securities depositories or other evidence of such shareholding which is acceptable to the nomination committee  makes a request to the chair of the nomination committee to be part of the nomination committee  the shareholder shall have the right  in the discretion of the nomination committee  either to appoint an additional member of the nomination committee or to appoint a member who shall replace the member appointed by the shareholder representing the least number of votes in the nomination committee following the changes in the Company's ownership structure.A shareholder who has appointed a member of the nomination committee has the right to dismiss the member and appoint a new member. If such an exchange takes place  the shareholder shall without delay give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who shall be exchanged  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). The notification shall contain the name of the dismissed member and the person who shall replace him as member of the nomination committee.A member who prematurely resigns from his task shall give notice of this to the chair of the nomination committee (or  if it is the chair of the nomination committee who resigns  to the chairman of the Board of Directors). In such case  the nomination committee shall without delay call upon the shareholder who has appointed the member to appoint a new member. If a new member is not appointed by the shareholder  the nomination committee shall offer other larger shareholders with respect to votes  to appoint members of the nomination committee. Such offer shall be made in order of priority to the largest shareholders with respect to voting rights (that is  first to the largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so  thereafter to the second largest shareholder with respect to voting rights who has not already appointed a member of the nomination committee or previously abstained from the right to do so etc.). The procedure shall continue until the earlier of (i) five additional shareholders have been asked or (ii) the nomination committee is complete.No remuneration is to be paid to members of the nomination committee. The company shall  however  defray all reasonable expenses that are required for the work of the nomination committee.Instructions for the nomination committeeThe members of the nomination committee are to promote the common interests of all the shareholders of the Company and are not to reveal the content or details of any discussion held during the nomination committee meetings unduly. Each member of the nomination committee is to consider carefully whether there are any conflicts of interest or other circumstances that make their service on the nomination committee inappropriate before accepting the assignment to form part of the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall fulfil the tasks set out in the Code and shall  when applicable  present proposals to an upcoming general meeting for:the election of the chairman of the meeting; the number of directors elected by the general meeting; the election of the chairman and members of the Board of Directors; the fees and other remuneration of elected members of the Board of Directors and of the members of the committees of the Board of Directors; the election of the auditor(s); the remuneration of the auditor(s); and principles for the composition of the nomination committee including any changes to the instructions to the nomination committee.The nomination committee shall apply item 4.1 in the Code regarding the diversity policy  whereby the nomination committee shall take into account that the Board of Directors  with regard to the Company's operations  development stage and other conditions  shall have an appropriate composition  characterised by versatility in respect to the competence  experience  geographic coverage and background of the members elected a general meeting. Furthermore  the nomination committee shall work with the goal of achieving an even gender distribution on the Board of Directors.The nomination committee has the right  at the Company's reasonable expense  to engage external consultants whom the nomination committee considers necessary to fulfil its task.Agenda item 13; Resolution on the number of members of the Board of DirectorsThe nomination committee proposes that the Meeting resolves that the board of directors shall consist of six (6) directors and no deputy directors.Agenda item 14; Election of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of DirectorsThe nomination committee proposes that the Meeting resolves on the election/re-election (as applicable) of:Members of the Board of Directors:Remco Westermann (re-election) for a period until the end of the first annual general meeting after the resolution  Tobias M.

In order to facilitate the ESOP  MGI has resolved to grant to Bodhivas GmbH  which is owned by the largest shareholder of MGI (""Bodhivas"") the right to subscribe for up to 15 million Ordinary A Shares. Under the ESOP  Bodhivas has corresponding obligations towards the participants to deliver Ordinary A Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESOP (the right to receive Ordinary A Shares from Bodhivas is referred to as ""phantom stock""). Bodhivas has further (i) undertaken towards the participants to pay out the upside value between strike price and exercise value at the moment of exercise and to deliver this value either in Ordinary A Shares or in cash and (ii) undertaken towards MGI to manage the ESOP program and (iii) formally agreed that in relation to this ESOP program  any profit by Bodhivas is for the benefit of MGI and any loss incurred by Bodhivas is to be borne by MGI (i.e.  Bodhivas only facilitates the implementation of the ESOP program but does not have any economic interest in the ESOP program).Options under the ESOP can be exercised from May 1  2024  at the earliest  until December 31  2030. There are currently two different programs which differ primarily in terms of start date and strike price. The first started on May 1  2020 and has a strike price of EUR 1.30 (in total approx. 9.2m options). The second started on January 2021 and has a strike price of EUR 2.60 (approx. 3.3m options). For employees participating in the second program but starting at a later date  the strike price is at a premium of 20% above the average share price of 10 trading days prior to the grant date  however always with a minimum of EUR 2.60 (please see below for a proposed amendment of the strike price). Both programs under the ESOP have an end date of December 31  2030.No employee has been granted more than 2 550 000 options under the ESOP. The options under the ESOP are subject to vesting periods  meaning that participants who leave their employment during the programs will lose any unvested shares. The vesting period to become entitled to 100% of the options is 60 months in total and occurs in several partial steps over the entire vesting period.If a participant in the program leaves the Company (voluntarily or due to termination by employer for breach by employee) within two years after the start date of the phantom stock program  all phantom stock is lost. If a participant in the program leaves after more than two years after the start of the phantom stock program the participant loses 50% of the two most recent years of vested phantom stock.The ESOP does not contain any performance criteria in addition to the strike price  due to MGI wanting to incentivize participants  encourage long-term shareholding in the company and local market practice in Malta and the jurisdictions where the group is active.The maximum cumulative amount of options which can be granted under the ESOP to existing and future participants (and consequently the maximum number of Ordinary A Shares which can be issued under the ESOP  except in the event of recalculation) is 15 000 000  of which approx. 12.5 million options have been granted. If all granted options under the ESOP were to be exercised  the dilution would be 7.85 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares) and if all options were to be granted and exercised  the dilution would be 9.41 % (based on the current number of 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares).MGI has not had  and is not expected to have  any material (cash relevant) costs for the ESOP programs. For additional information on the ESOP  please also refer to MGI's annual reports.Following the relocation to Sweden  due to differences between Swedish and Maltese corporate law  the board of directors intends to exercise its authorization (as proposed under item 19 below) to issue warrants to Bodhivas  MGI or a group company in order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the ESOP. MGI may also require that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a MGI group company.Further  due to prevailing market conditions and the Company's share price development  for certain participants in the second program (where the strike price has been determined based on a premium (plus 20%) compared to the average share price prior to the grant date  as described above) the current strike price is too high in comparison to the current market value  which leads to a loss of the incentivizing effect of such program. The board of directors therefore proposes that the second program is adjusted so that the maximum and minimum strike price is the same for all participants (i.e.  EUR 2.60)The board of directors therefore proposes that the Meeting approves (i) the ESOP  (ii) that MGI shall be entitled to grant Bodhivas or MGI or a group company of MGI the right to subscribe for warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares)  to (iii) entitle MGI to ensure that warrants or shares or the cash value can be delivered to the participants in the ESOP program on the same terms and conditions that now apply for the ESOP contracts with Bodhivas  (iv) entitle MGI to request that Bodhivas assigns its rights and obligations under the ESOP agreements to MGI or a group company  (v) approve the adjustment of the strike price for all participants that were granted options before this AGM -in the second program to be EUR 2.60  and (vi) entitle the Board of MGI to take all steps required to execute measures (i) - (v).Approval of transfer of shares to participants in the ESOP programThe board of director proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the intended exercise of the authorisation to issue Ordinary A shares or warrants and that not more than 15 000 000 Ordinary A Shares or warrants (which are to be exercised for Ordinary A Shares) are transferred to existing and future participants in the ESOP program in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESOP  including the above proposed amendments of the program.Agenda item 17 Extraordinary Resolution to approve the change in name of the Company from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE and to approve the new Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company to effect this changeWhile preparing the relocation from Malta to Sweden the Company was notified that the relevant Swedish rules do not permit the registration of Media and Games Invest under its current name in Sweden due to the name being too generic.Based on that requirement  the Company wishes to change its name from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE after this AGM and in advance of the Proposed Transfer (as defined and described below in under item 18)  which name will also be retained after completion of the Proposed Transfer.The change in the name of the Company will require an amendment to the current memorandum and articles of association of the Company (the ""Current M&A"") to include the new name  which change will become effective once the amended memorandum and articles of association with the new name (the ""Interim M&A"") are filed with and registered by the Malta Business Registry following the Meeting.The Interim M&A (reflecting the limited amendments to the Current M&A for the purpose of the name change) are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's name be changed from Media and Games Invest SE to MGI - Media and Games Invest SE; that the Current M&A be replaced by the Interim M&A to be adopted following this Meeting; and to authorize the Company Secretary and/or any one (1) Director of the Company to register a copy of the Interim M&A with the Malta Business Registry (the ""MBR"").Agenda item 18; Extraordinary resolution to approve a transfer proposal for the re-domiciliation of the Company from Malta to Sweden and to approve the new statutes of the Company to be adopted following its re-domiciliation and upon registration as a Swedish companyFollowing an evaluation by the Board of Directors and management of the Company  in light of Malta's grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in mid-2021  the Company believes that having the Company's registered office in Malta may result in an increased risk premium on the Company's shares and may preclude further investment from prospective investors.Given that the Company's core business is in North America and Continental Europe  and that its operations are not tied to Malta  the Board of Directors has chosen Sweden as the new registered office and headquarter of the Company. The Board of Director's decision was motivated by the fact that the Company; (i) has been listed in Sweden since 2020  (ii) is already familiar with the local capital markets  and (iii) has a very strong local network on the ground  as well as several operating subsidiaries and employees in Stockholm. Furthermore  a large part of the Company's shareholders hail from the Nordics and the Swedish regulatory framework is globally recognized. While MGI's listing structure currently covers three jurisdictions - Malta (registered office)  Germany (listing) and Sweden (listing) - the administrative complexity will be significantly reduced as a result of the relocation.Due to the above  the Board of Directors is proposing that the general meeting resolves that the Company transfers its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden (the ""Proposed Transfer"") pursuant to Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European Company (SE) (the ""SE Regulation"") and in terms of Article 6 (1) of Subsidiary Legislation 386.17 - Transfer of Registered Office of a European Company (SE) Regulations (the ""Subsidiary Legislation"").To this end and in connection with the obligation set out under Article 8 of the SE Regulation  the Board of Directors has prepared and submitted a transfer proposal (""Transfer Proposal"") and a transfer report (""Transfer Report"") to the MBR  which provide explanations of the legal and economic aspects of the Proposed Transfer  including a description of any implications for the Company's shareholders  creditors and employees as a result of the Proposed Transfer.Shareholders are hereby being notified of their right to examine the Transfer Proposal and the Transfer Report  copies of which are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/The Proposed Transfer will also require the substitution of the Interim M&A with new statutes of the Company (the ""New Statutes""). The New Statutes are to enter into force following the Proposed Transfer and upon registration of MGI as a Swedish company.The New Statutes are available on the Company's website at https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/.The Board of Directors therefore proposed that the Meeting resolves on the following Extraordinary Resolutions:that the Company's transfer of its registered office and headquarters from Malta to Sweden in terms of the SE Regulation and the Subsidiary Legislation be  and hereby is  approved; that the Transfer Proposal and Transfer Report be  and hereby are  approved; and that the Interim M&A be replaced by the New Statutes upon the Company's registration as a Swedish company. That the Board of MGI is entitled to do all that is required to execute the above measures and actionsAgenda item 19 Authorisation for the Board of Directors to issue shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the CompanyWith reference to the proposal under item 18 for the re-domiciliation of the Company's registered office from Malta to Sweden. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that it would be beneficial for the Company for the Board of Directors to be authorised to (a) issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions and (b) restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue.The purpose of this authorization would be to finance acquisitions  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).Accordingly  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves upon the following Extraordinary Resolution:Without prejudice to the existing authorisation to the Board of Directors  in terms of article 3 of the Company's articles of association  to issue shares of any class  options which may be convertible into shares  and other rights and/or securities (by whatever name referred to) which may entitle the holder thereof to subscribe to shares in the Company  in each case up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the Company  which authorisation shall remain valid and in effect  to authorize the Board of Directors to - at one or several occasions and for the time period until the next annual general meeting of the Company - issue  following the re-domiciliation  new shares  options  warrants and convertibles in the Company  with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions  and with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights (i.e. have the right to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption of existing shareholders in respect of any such issue) and in each case within the limits of the company's articles of association. The purpose of the authorisation and the possibility to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be to enable the use of securities as consideration for or as financing of acquisitions of companies or businesses (including for payments of earn-outs and other deferred payments)  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the Company's incentive programs (including the ESOP).(Swedish translation: […] att bemyndiga styrelsen att efter bytet av bolagets registrerade säte - vid ett eller flera tillfällen intill slutet av nästkommande årsstämma - emittera nya aktier  optioner  teckningsoptioner och konvertibler i bolaget  med eller utan bestämmelser om apport  kvittning eller andra villkor  och med eller utan avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt (dvs. en rättighet att inskränka eller begränsa företrädesrätten hos befintliga aktieägare med avseende på sådana emissioner) inom ramen för de gränser som sätts av bolagets bolagsordning. Syftet med bemyndigandet och möjligheten att avvika från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt ska vara att möjliggöra för bolaget att använda värdepapper som likvid vid eller finansiering av förvärv av företag eller rörelser (inklusive för betalning av earn-outs och andra uppskjutna betalningar)  anskaffa kapital för att främja tillväxt och utveckling av bolaget eller att säkra  främja och fullfölja bolagets incitamentsprogram  inklusive ESOP-programmet.)The Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves that the Board of Directors  the CEO or such person as the Board of Directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.(Swedish translation: Styrelsen  den verkställande direktören eller den person som styrelsen utser ska bemyndigas att göra sådana smärre justeringar i årsstämmans beslut som kan visa sig erforderliga i samband med registrering av beslutet hos Bolagsverket.)OtherThe Company has 159 249 358 Ordinary A Shares in issue as of the date of this notice (one vote per share).The Auditor's Report and the Audited Financial Statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2021  the Interim M&A  the Transfer Proposal  the Transfer Report  and the New Statutes  are available on the Company's website (https://mgi-se.com/annual-general-meeting-2022/).* * *15  July 2022MEDIA AND GAMES INVEST SEThe Board of DirectorsFor further information  please contact:Sören BarzHead of Investor Relations Phone: +491703769571Email: info@mgi.groupAbout Media and Games Invest SEMedia and Games Invest SE (""MGI"") is an advertising software platform with strong first party games content.

The setup also includes Vesca  a leading local provider of payment solutions and network service provider (NSP)  and is targeted to mass market  mainly SME merchants across Japan. In this unique partnership  Worldline provides transaction processing and leverages the footprint  scale and technology of its global payment processing facilities  while Casio is the trusted and reliable front-end for merchants  having led the cash register market in Japan for 19 years  with cashless services part of its offering; and Vesca is the technical enabler that acts as the acceptance layer in Japan.This arrangement benefits merchants in Japan  particularly SMEs and small chains  and their customers. Credit card acceptance will no longer be a strain for these retail and service businesses who will benefit from speedy onboarding and more competitive costs  while keeping Casio as their trusted single point of contact for all check-out topics. Therefore  Worldline  Casio and Vesca will be able to successfully address the challenges posed by the Japanese ecosystem when it comes to card payments - cash dominated consumer behaviours and cumbersome lengthy onboarding processes.As a team  the three companies are ideally placed to address the requirements of the Japanese market and its strong and distinctive local characteristics. For example  a strong relationship typically binds together local merchants and their electronic cash register (ECR) provider or integrator  which in Japan  gatekeeps the checkout and payments process.Vincent Roland  Head of Merchant Services at Worldline  said: “We are extremely proud to be working with a prestigious brand such as Casio and we are confident this partnership is the right choice for our presence in the Japanese market. Our offering will booster card payments in a market with huge potential.”Shigenori Fujii  Senior General Manager  System Business Unit at Casio  added: “Worldline is the leading payments solutions provider in Europe  and it only made sense to collaborate with them as we aim to enlarge our offering for checkout payments and cashless services in Japan. Their professionalism and expertise are unparalleled.

Demand for rental homes has picked up after the COVID-19 pandemic  and the higher occupancy rate is mainly attributable to growth in service consumption and the consequent improvement in service-sector employment rate. Economic uncertainty and higher consumer prices and interest rates are also in part reflected in the rising demand for rental homes.Story continues- During the period under review  we at SATO focused on developing our customer service and rental operations to align them even better with customer needs.- SATO sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in the Lahti  Jyväskylä and Oulu regions to Heimstaden. The divestment implements the SATO strategy to focus housing investments on the Helsinki Metropolitan area and its commuter area along the main railway line as well as on Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.- May saw the commencement of the construction of a rental homes property in Rykmentinpuisto  Tuusula. The project is SATO’s first new housing investment in Tuusula in more than 15 years.- May also saw the completion of a timber apartment building in Lupajantie in the Mellunmäki district of Helsinki. The two-storey timber-structure low-rise apartment buildings feature 112 non-subsidised rental homes. The design solutions employed pay attention to energy efficiency as well as construction solutions and materials that will last for decades.- I would like to thank SATO employees for their great work to develop customer satisfaction and the housing comfort of our residents.Operating environmentOver the reporting period  SATO’s operating environment was affected by the war in Ukraine  high inflation  and the continued high level of rental housing supply  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area.The first months of the year saw rapid economic growth as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted  resulting in growing service consumption and  consequently  improved employment rate. Russia’s attack on Ukraine in late February made the economic outlook increasingly uncertain. The biggest impacts are related to the surge in prices of energy and materials  and challenges in supply chains  which could already be seen in late 2021. Cost increases remained at a high level throughout the reporting period  and central banks had to make interest rate hikes to curb the increases in costs. Several forecasting institutions have lowered their growth projections for the current and coming year. The uncertainty has resulted in a major decline in consumer confidence. According to the consumer confidence indicator published by Statistics Finland on 27 June 2022  consumers’ expectations concerning their own finances and the Finnish economy were very pessimistic in June.Inflation remained high in early 2022. According to preliminary Eurostat data  the rate of inflation in June was expected to be 8.6% in the euro area and 8.1% in Finland. The main component pushing up prices was the surge in energy and food prices. The accelerating inflation rate has raised overall interest rate levels  and central banks have tightened their monetary policy to curb price increases. The European Central Bank (ECB) intends to raise the key ECB interest rates in July and again in September. Inflation is  however  anticipated to slow during 2023.There are signs of slowing in the record-high rate of construction that has been seen for a long period time. The May economic forecast of the Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries (RT) estimates that rental housing starts will decline by around a fifth to around 39 000 homes this year  with the figure for next year projected to settle at the long-term level of housing production demand at 35 000 homes.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental homes and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban housing with good access to public transport is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while at the same time Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the proportion of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services.The demographic change and the price development of owner-occupied homes create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Outside growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes acquiring an owner-occupied home in a growth centre even more challenging for people coming from those areas.REVIEW PERIOD 1 January to 30 June 2022 (1 January to 30 June 2021)Net sales and profitIn January–June 2022  SATO Corporation’s consolidated net sales totalled EUR 147.2 million (148.2).Operating profit was EUR 166.8 million (194.0).

The project is implemented in cooperation between multiple actors and the area will feature a variety of housing types. SATO is having 92 non-subsidised rental homes constructed on the site. The Pataljoonantie  Rykmentinpuisto project is SATO’s first new residential investment in Tuusula in more than 15 years. The design of the buildings caters for energy efficiency and sustainable building solutions that will last for decades to come. The property will be rated energy class A. The buildings will be equipped with district heating because they are located in a groundwater area where geothermal heating is not possible. The buildings will also feature solar panels and an intake air cooling system.May also saw the completion of a timber apartment building in Lupajantie  Mellunmäki  Helsinki. The two-storey timber-structure low-rise apartment buildings feature 112 non-subsidised rental homes. The design solutions employed pay attention to energy efficiency as well as construction solutions and materials that will last for decades. The homes and common areas feature efficient design  which helps to reduce the building’s energy consumption as well as its carbon footprint. The heat source for the buildings is geothermal heat  which makes use of thermal energy stored in the ground.During the reporting period  2 015 (11) rental homes were divested in Finland.

The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.The war in Ukraine is a short-term risk affecting the operating environment  the duration and impacts of which on the Finnish economy are difficult to estimate. The war’s biggest impacts have been seen in the prices of energy  food  and materials as well as in supply chains. An increase in energy  food  and consumer goods prices may slow economic growth  considerably increase the interest rate level  and have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to perform their obligations. Such decline in the economy or economic activity may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for rents to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO’s housing stock. In line with its refined strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other financing commitments. In 2019  the company issued an EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme  under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 1 050.0 million.The means for managing liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 700 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans represent an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by fixed rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio.SATO currently has 522 apartments in St Petersburg. Investments in Russia commenced in 2007. The last investment decision was made in 2013 and the property was completed in 2016. There are risks related to the business environment in our St. Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk  with related hedging options examined in accordance with our treasury policy. SATO will refrain from making new investments in Russia. Following the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has looked into opportunities to exit the business in Russia. According to the explorations  a speedy exit is not possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent out the homes in St Petersburg for the time being. It is expected that the operating environment in Russia will be highly uncertain for a long period of time and could result in disruptions to SATO's business activities in Russia and with parties related to business in Russia and also impact the ability of SATO to make payments to its suppliers  employees and authorities as well as receive payments from its customers  which could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on SATO's business in Russia and even result in SATO limiting or ceasing its operations in Russia and with parties related to Russia for a long period of time. Should the war in Ukraine be prolonged  carrying out business in Russia may have negative impacts on the company’s reputation and may hamper business in Finland or have adverse effects on the company’s ability to access finance in the market  which may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  financial costs or value of SATO-owned properties.For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group’s website and Annual Report for 2021 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  competitive situation  and interest rate level.The first months of the year saw rapid economic growth as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted  resulting in growing service consumption and  consequently  improved employment rate. Russia’s attack on Ukraine in late February made the economic outlook increasingly uncertain. The biggest impacts are related to the surge in the prices of energy and materials and to challenges in supply chains  which could already be seen in late 2021. Cost increases remained at a high level throughout the reporting period. Higher construction costs may postpone some of SATO’s future investment decisions.There are slight signs of slowing in the record-high rate of construction that has been seen for a long period time. The May economic forecast of the Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries (RT) estimates that rental housing starts will decline by around a fifth to around 39 000 homes this year  with the figure for next year projected to settle at the long-term level of housing production demand at 35 000 homes. This will be reflected in the supply of rental homes over the long term.Several forecasting institutions have lowered their growth projections for the current and coming year. The uncertainty has resulted in a major decline in consumer confidence. According to the consumer confidence indicator published by Statistics Finland on 27 June 2022  consumers’ expectations concerning their own finances and the Finnish economy were very pessimistic in April.The accelerating inflation rate has raised overall interest rate levels  and central banks have tightened their monetary policy to curb price increases. The European Central Bank (ECB) intends to raise the key ECB interest rates in July and again in September. Inflation is  however  anticipated to slow during 2023. High inflation increases  in addition to higher property maintenance expenses  the interest rate level and  and consequently  SATO’s finance costs. The ample supply of rental homes prevents the transfer of higher costs caused by inflation fully to rents.However  with COVID-19 restrictions lifted and service-sector employment improving  demand for centrally located homes has started to grow  which is reflected in the improved occupancy rate. The economic uncertainty  pressure for interest rate hikes and increases in consumer prices have also been in part reflected in increased demand for rental homes.The continued high level of housing supply particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area has maintained intense competition for good tenants and was reflected over the period under review in SATO’s business as a slight decrease in average rents year on year.

7807,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2022/07/15/matt-williams-whatever-happens-in-wellington-this-is-irelands-most-successful-tour/,Matt Williams: Whatever happens in Wellington  this is Ireland’s most successful tour,The win in Dunedin saw the momentum swing from ancient champion to upstart contender,Ireland’s Tadhg Furlong is tackled by New Zealand's Karl Tu'inukuafe during the second Test in Dunedin. Photograph: Billy Stickland/InphoLast weekend’s stunning victory over New Zealand was Ireland’s most significant result since Jackie Kyle’s team of 1948 won the Grand Slam. That wonderful team re-established the future of rugby unity on the island  both North and South  after the second World War.When the inspirational players of Kyle’s generation graced our fields winning a Grand Slam was rugby’s pinnacle. There was no greater prize. In 1987  when the northern hemisphere teams reluctantly competed in the first Rugby World Cup  all that changed.The true Holy Grail of rugby is now global. A Grand Slam is an extraordinary achievement but the William Webb Ellis trophy is rugby’s ultimate prize.Shamefully  Ireland have lost nine World Cup quarter-finals in a row. Ireland’s coach Andy Farrells mission is to drastically change that situation.In a truly astonishing achievement  Farrell and his staff have reconstructed this Irish team from the rubble of the 2019 World Cup to empower Johnny Sexton’s team to smash through a century-old barrier and catapult Ireland into the elite club of rugby nations who have defeated New Zealand on Kiwi soil.In winning a Test and then defeating the New Zealand Maori this has become Ireland’s most successful tour of all time. Ireland now hope to emulate England (2003)  South Africa (2019) and Australia (1991 and 1999 ) who all defeated New Zealand in Aotearoa in the years immediately prior to their World Cup successes.The true gravitas of the victory in Dunedin is that Ireland can now rightfully aspire to emulate those feats. One of the three World Cup campaigns I was privileged to observe at very close quarters was that of the 1999 winning Wallabies. Their coach Rod McQueen was a highly detailed long-term planner. The Wallabies draw suggested that they should face New Zealand in the 1999 final. No one could have foreseen the French producing one of rugby’s greatest ever matches and knock the Kiwis out at the semi-final stage.So a major goal in preparing for 1999 World Cup was to slay the myth of the black jersey on their home soil and place doubt in Kiwi minds before the tournament. In 1998  a year out from the World Cup  the Wallabies defeated New Zealand 27-23 at Lancaster Park  Christchurch.I attended that match on a cold  clear New Zealand winter day. At full-time the shift of momentum towards the Wallabies was something that you could physically feel.Farrell’s planning is that Ireland may have to defeat New Zealand at the quarter-final stage in next year’s World Cup. Last Saturday in Dunedin that same feeling from 1999  of momentum swinging from the ancient champion to the upstart contender  could be physically felt. The pendulum swung drastically towards the men in green.Read morePrior to the last two World Cups in England (2015) and Japan (2019)  Ireland did not have an attacking game plan that could score enough points to defeat great teams away from home. Critically  they also did not possess a mindset with enough power for success. Defeats to the far lesser talented teams of Argentina in 2015 and Japan in 2019 support this as fact.Mentally  spiritually and tactically Ireland did not have what it takes to compete at the elite end of World Cups. Always transfixed with the annual Six Nations  Ireland could never look far enough ahead for World Cup success.Crucially  Irish preparations for past World Cups have been built on foundations of sand because they did not have a game plan capable of scoring enough tries against the great teams to win.In its essence  this meant that Irish teams had not done the level of work required to win in the years prior to World Cups. As the sign over the door of the USA Olympic Training Centre at Colorado Springs states  “It’s not every four years  it’s every day”.But that was in the past. The two victories over the past seven days are the result of two years of hard work by Farrell and his staff. The team mirrors Farrell’s own journey to find his own voice as a coach.One of Andy Farrell’s strengths is that he understands that failing is not failure. Photograph: Billy Stickland/InphoIn the beginning  Farrell was trying to be a loyal Joe Schmidt clone. This failed to the point that termination of his contract was a real possibility. One of Farrell’s strengths is that he understands that failing is not failure. After a series of very poor Irish performances  he read the tea leaves. There was a deep and honest evaluation that led to the creation of a new innovative plan. This has resulted in a massive change within the philosophy of play  selection policies  game plans and culture.In finding his own voice Farrell has moved from being a coach close to dismissal to becoming a transformational leader and more power to him. The performance of the Irish team since November 2021 has been nothing short of astonishing.Perhaps Farrell’s greatest achievement has been the growth of Ireland’s mental capabilities to take on the world’s best away from the support of Lansdowne Road.The former New Zealand captain Todd Blackadder said in 2002 that “Test match rugby is a mental exercise; you can be the most gifted team in the world but that counts for nothing if your mind isn’t totally focused and that can only come with experience. We have to acquire the mental toughness to bring the World Cup back to where it belongs.”Todd’s wise words are totally accurate. Defeat at Eden Park was the experience that forced the Irish team to grow their mindset to the point capable of winning in Dunedin. Growing the mental strength required for success at World Cups can only be achieved by performing against great opponents before the World Cup.Ireland are gaining the vital experiences of performing and winning in rugby’s most ferocious environment.The Irish players have proved to themselves that if they play to the optimum level of their abilities  their game plan can beat the best the world can offer  in the toughest of environmentsThat is the reason why the third Test in Wellington is close to irrelevant. With two wins on this tour Ireland are already successful. New Zealand need to save face and win the series  Ireland do not.No matter what the result brings  Ireland will take away from this tour buckets of belief in their coaches and themselves. Along with confidence in their game plan and their mental strength to cope with any environment.Everything in Irish rugby must now be totally focused on what has real value before the 2023 World Cup. Australia  South Africa  France and England are all at home next season. That is a super preparation for Ireland.When Ireland defeated New Zealand in Dunedin  their stock exchange  the NZX  dropped. The Kiwis lost confidence.

7811,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4523507-kbc-group-strong-capital-ratios-make-eastern-european-exposure-manageable,KBC Group: Strong Capital Ratios Make Eastern European Exposure Manageable (OTCMKTS:KBCSF),KBC is one of the largest banks in Belgium but has exposure to some Eastern European and Central European countries. KBCSF's underlying performance is very strong.,noel bennett/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionKBC Group (OTCPK:KBCSF) (OTCPK:KBCSY) is a Belgian bank and insurance company with activities in several Central European and Eastern European countries. Although the bank continues to look out for bolt-on acquisitions like the 1B EUR acquisition of Raiffeisen's (RAIFFY) (OTCPK:RAIFF) Bulgarian subsidiary which closed last week and now makes KBC the largest bank in Bulgaria  I think the bank will now focus on keeping its balance sheet in good shape until we see how the Ukrainian-Russian war will actually play out.Yahoo FinanceConsidering the bank's main listing is on Euronext Brussels  I'd strongly recommend you to effectively use the Brussels listing to trade in KBC Group's securities. The average daily volume is 670 000 shares and is generally pretty stable considering this is a large cap with a market capitalization just under 22B EUR. The ticker symbol in Belgium is KBC.2022 was expected to be a decent transition yearIn the past few quarters  I have been discussing the situation of some of the 'overcapitalized' banks in Western Europe. While I certainly appreciate an additional buffer in CET1 capital on top of the minimum required capital level as requested by the regulators  there's a big difference between how big of a safety net one should maintain. I mentioned this 'issue' in the ING article  but ABN AMRO has the same 'issue': it's just overcapitalized.KBC Group also is one of those over-capitalized banks. The bank got away with a big scare in the 2008 Global Financial Crisis but pledged to do things differently. The state support was repaid as fast as practically possible and KBC has been running a safe balance sheet and capital allocation program. A substantial portion of the earnings was retained on the balance sheet as equity  and this has helped to keep the CET1 ratio at a very high level despite pursuing some bolt-on acquisitions in Eastern Europe of banks and insurance companies with weaker capital ratios.KBC Group Investor RelationsThe CET1 ratio was 16.4% as of the end of September  and the 15.5% mentioned above already takes the proposed special dividends into account which were paid out earlier this year. The CET1 ratio fell to 15.3% as of the end of Q1.So what did KBC do earlier this year? It announced a 10.6 EUR dividend of which 3 EUR has already been distributed in 2021. The remaining dividend of 7.6 EUR per share was payable in May and consisted of a final dividend of 3 EUR/share related to the FY 2021 results (which brings the full-year dividend attributable to 2021 at 4 EUR/share) and a special dividend of 4.6 EUR per share. So long story short  a total of 7.6 EUR was paid out in May. The shareholders were quite happy with this unexpected bonus  but it also looks like some of them called it a day and sold after the stock went ex-dividend.KBC Group Investor Relations2022 was not expected to be a special year for any of the banks in the Eurozone. 2020 was a bad year due to the loan loss provisions and subsequently 2021 was an exceptionally good year because most banks were able to take back some of those provisions. 2022 was expected to be a 'normal' year  the first normal year since 2019 really.Unfortunately  the Russian-Ukrainian war has decided otherwise. Suddenly European banks need to rethink their exposure to certain countries and sectors as the upcoming recession will have a nasty impact. And although KBC does not have any activities in Ukraine or Russia and despite the bank confirming its total exposure to Russia  Ukraine and Belarus combined is just 55M EUR (which is 0.015% of the balance sheet total  so the exposure is completely negligible)  it has been thrown on the pile of 'riskier' banks despite its superior CET1 ratio (15.3% as of the end of March).The main exposure of the bank to Ukraine and Russia is an indirect exposure: KBC has lent money to clients that do have exposure to Russia. Although the absolute numbers of the indirect exposure appears to be high  KBC thinks it can keep the P&L charge limited to 223M EUR.KBC Group Investor RelationsThe Q1 income result was also strong. That's remarkable considering the first quarter of the year is always the weakest. Not because of 'seasonal' effects  but because European countries are still punishing banks for the 2008 Global Financial Crisis by levying a high 'bank tax'. As you can see below  the bank tax is payable in Q1 and this year  KBC had to pay 514M EUR in additional taxes.KBC Group Investor RelationsThe bank records these taxes as an operating expense and that's why the first quarter has a high total amount of operating expenses and a relatively low net income.KBC Group Investor RelationsDespite this tax  the net income was still 458M EUR thanks to a very low loan loss provision of 22M EUR. That loan loss provision will likely continue to increase in the next few quarters but that's fine as KBC will save half a billion euros in operating expenses considering it paid the majority of the bank tax in Q1.Investment thesisWhile we will see an increasing cost of risk resulting in higher loan loss provisions  the bank's 'earnings engine' is very solid. The LTM pre-tax and pre loan loss provision earnings of KBC was approximately 3.75B EUR  which means the bank has a very solid earnings profile that should be able to weather most storms. This doesn't mean 2022 will be a painless experience for the bank  but KBC should be able to get through it without compromising its strong capital ratios.I'm also intrigued by the bank's projections of what an increasing interest rate could mean. The image below shows the impact of a 100 bp parallel rate hike across the portfolio on the net interest income. The impact will remain somewhat limited in the first year but by the end of Y3  KBC should see its NII expand by 17%.KBC Group Investor RelationsBased on the LTM NII of approximately 4.6B EUR  the positive impact of a 100 bp rate hike would be 782M EUR (representing about 575M EUR after tax) by the end of Y3. A 150 bp rate hike would increase the net income by almost 900M EUR per year or in excess of 2 EUR per share. Combine this with the 15.3% CET1 ratio and the average LTV value of just around 55% across the entire mortgage portfolio on the balance sheet  and I think KBC is well-armed to navigate through these difficult times.I currently have no direct position in KBC Group but I have an indirect long position.
