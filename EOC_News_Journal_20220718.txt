The global auto industry is investing significantly in chips made from silicon carbide. Because of its wide bandgap  SiC is highly efficient at high voltages offering higher power efficiency  increased power density resulting in reduced component weight and size  as well as faster battery charging times. Consequently  demand for SiC epitaxy equipment is forecasted (based on ASM internal estimates) to grow at a CAGR in excess of 25% from 2021 to 2025.‚ÄúLPE with its strong culture of innovation and traction with silicon carbide device makers  both for 150mm and 200mm substrates  is well positioned to serve the needs of global automotive customers and their decarbonization drive ‚Äù said Benjamin Loh  President and CEO of ASM.‚ÄúNext to ASM‚Äôs expanding position in advanced Epi applications for the logic/foundry and memory markets  ASM is also a leader in silicon epitaxy solutions for the power electronics  analog and wafer markets. LPE‚Äôs offering of advanced SiC epitaxy tools complements ASM‚Äôs offering. I‚Äôm confident that the combination of LPE and ASM will help our customers accelerate their roadmaps towards next-generation more efficient power electronics  which will enable the further electrification of the automotive industry. The acquisition of LPE adds another high-growth business to our portfolio of differentiated deposition technologies and presents meaningful opportunities to create value by leveraging our innovative epitaxy technologies to further differentiate the product offering of LPE  by building upon our significant customer base in the power electronics market segment  and by utilizing our global field service network to address customer needs.‚ÄùStory continuesFranco Preti  CEO of LPE  said: ‚ÄúWe believe the acquisition by ASM will be attractive for LPE‚Äôs and ASM‚Äôs customers as well as for employees. The acquisition will additionally enable LPE to gain access to world-class R&D resources  as well as leverage on ASM‚Äôs global operations  sales and customer support network.‚ÄùFollowing the close of the transaction  LPE will operate as a product unit under ASM‚Äôs Global Products organization. LPE will continue to be based in Italy  with technology and manufacturing centers in Milan and Catania.

Reduction of Jyske Bank‚Äôs nominal share capital by DKK 47 279 050 (corresponding to 4 727 905 shares at a nominal value of DKK 10) from DKK 690 000 000 to DKK 642 720 950. With reference to S.188(1) of the Danish Companies Act we point out that the capital reduction takes place through cancellation of previously acquired own shares acquired by Jyske Bank in accordance with authorisation from members in general meeting. Hence  the capital reduction is spent on payment of capital owners.If the motion is adopted  Jyske Bank's holding of own shares will be reduced by 4 727 905 shares of a nominal value of DKK 10. These shares have been bought back at a total amount of DKK 1 699 780 525 which implies that  apart from the nominal capital reduction  a total amount of DKK 1 652 501 475 has been paid to the capital owners in connection with the buy-backs. The capital reduction takes place at a share premium since it will be at DKK 359.52 for each share of a nominal amount of DKK 10  corresponding to the average price at which the shares have been bought back.In consequence of the above  the following amendment to the Articles of Association is proposed:Art. 2 to be amended to the effect that Jyske Bank‚Äôs nominal share capital be DKK 642 720 950 distributed on 64 272 095 shares.b.

Art. 12 of the Articles of Association. Where less than 90 per cent of the voting share capital is represented at the extraordinary general meeting  but the said motion obtains both three fourth of the votes cast and three fourth of the voting share capital represented at the extraordinary general meeting  the said motion may be adopted at a new general meeting by the said qualified majority irrespective of the proportion of the share capital represented.Story continuesSize of the share capital  voting rights of the shareholders and registration dateJyske Bank's share capital is DKK 690 000 000  comprising shares at a face value of DKK 10.

With this certification  GeoJunxion provides an above-average contribution in the field of social entrepreneurship in a sustainable way.Ivo Vleeschouwers  GeoJunxion‚Äôs CEO and CFO says: ‚ÄúWe are proud to have reached the Level 2 certification as we support the aim to help more people with difficulty accessing the labor market finding work in a sustainable and high-quality way.

What they have in common is that they are autonomous  that means they do not require human intervention to operate  without the presence of operators for their installation and supervision  in particular for safety reasons.These systems are all protected by patents. They are sold to customers or operated as part of services. In the case of a sale  a set of associated services is offered: analysis of the regulatory and technical environment  prevention plans  site mapping  user training  maintenance in operational condition  after-sales service  etc. The unit price of these systems is always higher than 100 K‚Ç¨ (excluding associated services).For the security industry  professional solutions are a range of systems marketed under the ISS Spotter brand. The month of June was rich in events: a mission was successfully carried out as part of the Roland-Garros tennis tournament. A few days later  during the Eurosatory show  many demonstrations were organized  allowing several official foreign delegations visiting the Delta Drone stand to operate themselves an ISS Spotter system physically located in Nantes  more than 400 km away. Thanks to a ground station entirely designed and developed by Delta Drone  they could access in real time all the functions to direct the camera  manage the zoom  or focus on points of interest using the ""click and go"" function. It should be noted that the robustness and operational quality of the system also made it possible to carry out this same type of remote management of the system from Perth in Australia (distance of 15 000 km) and from a site located in the Gulf of Guinea in Africa (distance of 5 000 km).Story continuesFor the logistics sector  the professional solution is more specifically dedicated to warehouse inventory  marketed under the Countbot brand. After several successful assignments in recent months  a first major transaction has been concluded with L'Or√©al  as presented in the press release dated June 27  2022.2 - Delta Drone Human Tech and its operational subsidiaries ATMDelta Drone Human Tech - DDHT (a company 100% owned by Delta Drone SA) represents thegroup's ""private security "" division. Present in Auvergne-Rh√¥ne Alpes  PACA and Champagne and acting under the ATM brand  the DDHT sub-group specializes in two types of services: the permanent security of large public or private industrial and institutional sites  and security during major cultural and sporting events.Regarding permanent security  most contracts are multi-year  thus ensuring a very strong recurrence of turnover. Among many references  DDHT enjoys the trust of customers such as: the Technical and Scientific Police  Soitec  Avery Dennison  the CEA  etc.In terms of event security  the references are also numerous: Roland Garros Tournament  Meeting of la Fert√©-Alais  Cannes Film Festival  NRJ Music Awards  Crit√©o seminar (Croatia)  municipality of Reims  Beaucroissant fair  etc.DDHT is a key element of the Delta Drone Group's strategy: at a time when the shortage of human resources is becoming structural in the private security sector  and while 3 successive years of major events in France are looming (Rugby World Cup 2023  Olympic Games 2024 and World Expo 2025)  there is no doubt that the use of technological means  in addition to security guards becomes an absolute necessity.In preparation for these tremendous opportunities  DDHT adapts its offers: from now on  systematically  for all calls for tenders concerning the security of both industrial sites and events  DDHT integrates ISS Spotter systems and teams trained in their use into its system.In order to better mark the combinatorial and non-disruptive effect of this offer  the systems are considered as ""cyber agents"" complementary to traditional agents and are offered painlessly for the customer within the traditional framework of an hourly cost / agent. Similarly  for any event  mixed teams  composed of security guards and ISS Spotter systems (most often wired) are now systematically marketed.Last important point to emphasize  the synergies between DDHT and Delta Drone are not limited to the security sector alone. Indeed  it is essentially DDHT staff  previously trained  who are delegated and commissioned to be operators during Countbot inventory missions in warehouses.3 - Delta Drone International and its operational subsidiaries RocketmineDelta Drone International is a company listed in Australia on the Sydney ASX Stock Exchange  a 60% subsidiary of Delta Drone SA (the balance of the capital is held by the public). It is the holding company of several operating companies located in South Africa  Ghana and Australia. Delta Drone International's activity concerns exclusively the provision of drone services  dedicated to the mining and agriculture sectors.These service activities are mainly based on mapping to assess in real time the operating conditions of the sites and thus improve their management. Increasingly  Delta Drone International is using Lidar technology to improve the performance of services rendered.In most cases  after a first phase of experimentation  contracts are signed for several years and for significant amounts  up to or even exceeding AU$ 1 million.Delta Drone International's activities have been firmly established for several years in Southern Africa and Ghana (Delta Drone International is the leading operator of drone services in Africa)  in the commercial development phase in Australia where Delta Drone International has been established since the end of 2020.4 ‚Äì UDT ‚Äì United Drone TechnologyUDT is the investment company (100% subsidiary) of the Delta Drone Group. Far from being an exclusively financial company  UDT aims to build a relevant ecosystem in the drone sector  by taking minority stakes in start-ups with high potential and with which Delta Drone SA is able to develop industrial synergies.UDT's portfolio is now composed of 5 holdings: three French companies (Elistair  Donecle and Diodon Drone Technologies)  a Swiss company (Aero41) and an Israeli company (Sightec).In terms of synergies  two examples illustrate Delta Drone's approach: the wired ISS Spotter system uses Elistair technology  and it is Donecle's imaging know-how that has enabled the final development of the Countbot solution.Synthesis: three of the four branches are positive or close to equilibriumThe two divisions Delta Drone Human Tech and Delta Drone International together represent an annual consolidated revenue base of approximately ‚Ç¨16 million  more than 80% of which is made up of multi-year contracts. These branches experience a minimum annual growth of more than 10% in their respective turnover  they generate a positive operating result or very close to balance  they are now autonomous in terms of financing.The UDT division holds a portfolio of assets whose cumulative value in 2021 was around ‚Ç¨8 million  a value doubled compared to the amounts initially invested. As a company whose only activity is to hold minority stakes in the drone sector  UDT does not generate revenue or operating expenses  as the company has no employees and relies on the infrastructure of Delta Drone SA.The group's financial losses are therefore concentrated on the4th branch (Delta Drone SA). They result from a high operating cost compared to an incipient turnover  which is still insufficient to cover the expenses.Under these conditions  and despite very promising start-up prospects regarding the commercialization of the ISS Spotter and Countbot solutions  vigorous actions are underway to drastically reduce operating costs.In any event  the objective is to achieve a situation of financial autonomy by the end of the year at the latest without the need for additional recourse to dilutive financing of any kind.In support of this objective  a bond issue of a principal amount of ‚Ç¨2.4 million has been set up  according to the characteristics described below.Bond issueDelta Drone (the ""Company"") announces the completion today ofthe issuance of simple bonds (""OS"") in the amount of ‚Ç¨ 2 150 000  by the issuance of 43 000 OS with a nominal value of ‚Ç¨ 56 at a price of ‚Ç¨ 50 each  representing a bond issue of a principal amount of ‚Ç¨ 2 408 000.Background and reasons for the transactionThe issuance of the OS will allow the Company to pursue its strategy of returning to balanceIt is part of the establishment of a mechanism called ""equitization"" of the OS  by (i) the constitution of a management trust for the benefit of the holders of OS who have decided to transfer their OS to the trust and (ii) the issuance of warrants for the benefit of the said trust  the terms and conditions of exercise of which will allow  from an economic point of view  to transform the OS thus transferred into shares.OS holders will be reimbursed either in cash by Delta Drone or by the net proceeds of disposals of said shares.Modalities and legal framework for the issuance of OSThe issuance of the tranches of OS was carried out as part of an issue reserved for the benefit of certain investors.Characteristics of the OS: The terms and conditions of the OS ( the main characteristics of which are presented in A nnexe 1 ) are available in full on the Company's website.Nominal value: The nominal value of the OS is 56 ‚Ç¨ per OS.Subscription price: The subscription price of the OS is 50 ‚Ç¨ per OS.Minimum subscription amount: The minimum subscription amount of the OS is ‚Ç¨ 100 000 per subscriber.No listing: OS will not be the subject of any application for admission to trading on a regulated or unregulated market  in France or abroad.Early repayment by hand of the Company: The Company has the right to repay at any time the OS at 105% de their nominal value e (plus accrued interest).Modalities and legal framework for the equitization of OSIncorporation of a Trust: The Company will establish no later than September 15  2022 a management trust (the ""Trust"") managed by Equitis Gestion acting as trustee (the ""Trustee"") under a trust agreement to be entered into between the Trustee and the Company. O S holders have committed to transfer their OS in order to become settlors and beneficiaries of the Trust.Issuance of BSA: In accordance with the terms of the trust agreement  the Company will issue on September 30  2022 for the benefit of the Trustee  as part of a reserved issue decided on the basis of the 7th resolution of the Combined Shareholders' Meeting of December 27  2021  subscription creditsfor shares called ""equitization"" (""BSA E "")  the main characteristics of which are presented for information purposes in Appendix 2   it being specified that their full terms and conditions were subsequently published on the Company's website.BSA E will be awarded free of charge and will be fully subscribed by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust.A press release will be issued by the Company at the time of issuance of the E BSAs to inform the market of the number of E BSAs issued and the resulting potential dilution.Exercise of BSA E by the Trustee: From the date of issue of the BSA E   the Trustee  acting on behalf of the Trust  will be responsible for exercising the BSA E by offsetting against the claim (in principal and interest) held against the Company in respect of the SO   and then to dispose as and when on the market  under strict terms defined in the trust agreement  the company's nouvelles actions resulting from the exercise of the BSA E (the ""New Shares"").The exercise of the BSA E will not give rise to any fundraising for the Company to the extent that the BSA E will be exercised only by offsetting against certain  liquid and due claims that the holder of BSA E will hold against the Company in respect of the OS.The length of time it will take to fully repay the OSes brought to the Trust through the equitization mechanism will essentially depend on the liquidity of the Delta Drone share in the market.New Shares issuedThe New Shares issued on exercise of the BSA E will be ordinary shares bearing current enjoyment which will confer on their holder  upon delivery  all the rights attached to the existing ordinary shares detailed in the Articles of Association of the Company.The New Shares will be the subject of applications for admission to trading on the Euronext Growth Paris market. They will be immediately assimilated to the existing shares of the Company and negotiable on the same line as the existing shares ( ISIN code: FR0011522168).About Delta Drone : Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the field of civilian drones for professional use.

As some companies and entities push back on ESG to protect financial interests and ideological positions  companies and funds must steer a careful course on ESG policies going forward.In a new Strategic Perspective entitled ""ESG under Attack "" Wolters Kluwer legal experts examine the increasing number of interests and actions clashing with ESG-related investor and legal demands to provide insight into what companies and investment managers will need to monitor  laws and regulations that may be struck down  and what to watch for in the future as political battles continue to spill into the financial  legal  and corporate landscape.Who: Brad Rosen  J.D.  Senior Legal Analyst; Matthew Garza  J.D.  Managing Editor; Lene Powell  J.D.  Senior Legal AnalystThe war on ESG is a well-conceived  well-calibrated and well-executed campaign that continues to vex corporations as new battle lines emerge on a near daily basis. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court overruling Roe v. Wade  Texas  along with other red states  have threatened criminal sanctions against companies pledging to assist employees in those states that are seeking abortion services. Challenges to corporations along these lines in the future promise to accelerate.- Brad Rosen  Senior Legal AnalystIn a down market in the summer of 2022  it seems likely that the question about demand for ESG products  and ESG's success as an investment strategy  may be tested at the same time the SEC's climate disclosure proposal comes under attack.- Matthew Garza  J.D.  Managing EditorCompanies need to watch closely because some of these new 'anti-ESG' laws cast a broad net.

7850,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://nation.africa/kenya/business/unmasked-kenya-oil-barons-minting-millions-3882978,Unmasked: Kenya‚Äôs oil barons minting millions in the now lucrative trade,<p>Over 100 companies are licensed to import petroleum products  but only less than 20 have consistently won the tender for years.</p>,When the Narc administration of President Mwai Kibaki assumed power in 2002  the petroleum industry was a war zone  an illustration of Charles Darwin‚Äôs concept of survival of the fittest.Oil dealers were free to import petroleum products from anywhere  and sell them at whatever price.The obvious result was that companies would look to have the lowest pump prices by importing from the cheapest possible source  at times disregarding quality.Also Read: Four firms picked to steady fuel suppliesAside from the quality risk  there were no rules to govern fair competition. It was a chaotic market.Radical changes in several sectors finally got to the petroleum industry on January 1  2004 with the introduction of the Open Tender System (OTS).Legislative amendments to Cap 116 of the Petroleum Act directed that the old way of importing fuel be abandoned for the OTS.Under the OTS  the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) would license individual companies to import all the fuel products required for a particular month.Other oil dealers would then buy fuel from the OTS winner and then sell it to the general public.All dealers would access fuel from the winning bidder at the same price.The new system had good intentions ‚Äì to ensure a level playing field for all oil-marketing companies while regulating the quality of fuel consumed locally.The Ministry of Energy and Petroleum was tasked with managing the OTS  and coming up with rules to govern the procurement process.But nearly two decades down the line  the OTS is attracting more controversy than praise  owing to the clandestine management and limited release of information regarding importers and the bidding process.Epra has licensed over 100 companies to import petroleum products through the OTS  but only less than 20 have consistently won the tender for years on end.Data obtained from Epra officials on the OTS shows that Oryx Energies (Switzerland)  Asharami Energy (Nigeria)  Gulf Energy (France) and Gapco (France) are the most consistent foreign-owned companies that win OTS tenders.The big local players with a somewhat guaranteed seat at the OTS high table are E3 Energy  Galana Oil  Texas Energy  Hashi Energy  Riva Petroleum Dealers  Petro Oil Kenya and Hass Petroleum.The ownership status of another big player  Fossil Fuel Products  is unknown as its ownership records are unavailable at the Business Registration Service.Records from the Ministry of Petroleum and Mining show that Gulf Energy will be the single largest importer of petrol to be consumed between mid-August and mid-September. It will import 170 752 cubic metres of the fuel.Galana Oil and Texas Energy will each import another 85 124 cubic metres of petrol.Last week Gulf Energy imported 73 710 cubic metres of aviation fuel that will cover the mid-July to mid-August period.The company  owned by France‚Äôs Rubis Energy following a 2020 acquisition  had the lowest bid to supply petrol.The French multinational stepped into the Kenyan market in 2017 when it incorporated Rubis Energy Kenya PLC.Rubis Energy Kenya PLC first bought a 24.99 percent stake in KenolKobil  which was owned by the family of the late former Cabinet minister Nicholas Biwott.Also Read: Intrigues that led to the deportation of Rubis bossRecords at the Business Registration Service show that Rubis borrowed $50 million (Sh5.9 billion) in February 2019. The timing indicates that the money could have been used to finance its takeover of KenolKobil and Gulf Energy.Two years later  Rubis bought out all other KenolKobil shareholders  parting with Sh36 billion for a branch network that extends to Uganda  Rwanda  Tanzania  Zambia  Burundi and Ethiopia.Rubis then used KenolKobil to buy Gulf Energy and paid Sh15.2 billion for the business.The French firm has  however  sued the previous Gulf Energy owners  seeking a Sh4.1 billion refund on the grounds that the acquired company‚Äôs books were cooked to inflate its value.Rubis used aggressive data recovery techniques to mine deleted data from computers that were acquired from Gulf Energy during the takeover. Gulf Energy has cited privacy violations in its response to the suit.Rubis Energie SAS  the parent company in France  is listed on Euronext Paris  the securities exchange in France‚Äôs capital. The parent firm is registered as a limited partnership.A limited partnership involves individuals going into business together  but they are only financially liable up to the amount they have pumped into the venture.Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault  a company owned by the family of Marcel Dassault  is the largest individual shareholder. The Dassault family owns 5.75 percent of Rubis Energie SAS.US-registered investment firm Tweedy  Browne owns five per cent of Rubis. UK-based firm BlackRock holds a 5.07 percent stake.Rubis founder Gilles Gobin owns a 0.171 percent stake. Mr Gobin founded Rubis in 1990. He also controls a 1.132 percent stake through Sogerma  a management company. Sogerma is also listed as a Rubis partner.Another company listed as a Rubis partner  Agena  owns 0.909 shares.The multinational‚Äôs board of directors holds a 0.131 stake in Rubis.Members of the supervisory board are Chantal Mazzacurati  Oliver Heckenroth  Nils Christian Bergene  Herve Claquin  Carole Fiquemont  Marie-Helene Dessailly  Laure Grimonpret-Tahon  Aurelie Goulart-Lechevalier  Marc-Oliver Lauren and Erik Pointillart.The French government holds a 0.056 per cent stake  while the company‚Äôs employees have shares equivalent to 1.321 percent of Rubis.Over 75 percent of Rubis shares are traded openly on Euronext Paris.Kenya is among 41 countries across Africa  Europe and the Caribbean where Rubis has operations.Oryx Energies SA  another regular OTS winner  is a Swiss multinational that has had a presence in Kenya since 2004.The Geneva-based company owns 99 shares in the Kenyan subsidiary.Overseas Petroleum Holdings Limited owns one share. The registration details in our possession only show that it is a foreign company  but do not specify where the company is registered.Oryx Energies SA is privately owned by the Addax and Oryx Group (AOG)  which is registered in Malta.In 2017  the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) revealed the faces behind AOG when they released the Paradise Papers ‚Äì a dossier of 13.4 million files detailing the offshore activities of national leaders  wealthy individuals and companies.Also Read: Treasury shakes up tax claims by oil marketers to curb evasionIndividuals listed as shareholders are Canary Islands businessman Alejandro Roque  the family of former Nigerian intelligence chief Ali-Shinkafi Umaru  former Total Energies Asia managing director Emmanuel De Reynies  Oryx Energies SA CEO Moussa Diao  Oryx Energies SA Board chair Arnaud Jean Talabardon  and AOG insiders Hugues De Montauzon  Pierre Bottin and Laurence Heelein.Others are Extraware GMBH managing partner Thierry Genthialon  Enterprise Power Limited founder Nikolai Germann  US-based Nigerian national Oladayu Oluchukwu Kusamoto  Lagos-based businessman Folake Adele-Adewole  Swiss national Isabelle Borel Warpelin  lawyers Vincent Labruyare  Frederique Dominique Lorencau  Peter Newman  Francois Jaclot  Afolabi Oladele and Michael Samuel Ebsray.Several shadowy companies are also listed as shareholders.Oryx Energies will ship in 171 280 cubic metres of kerosene expected to be consumed between mid-August and mid-September.In the April-June cycle  Oryx featured prominently alongside another foreign-owned dealer  Asharami Energy  in the supply of petrol. Asharami shipped in 230 350 cubic metres of petrol.Locally  the group trades as Asharami Synergy Limited. The firm was incorporated on April 27  2014. The sole owner is Asharami Energy (Kenya) Limited  which holds all 100 shares.Dubai-based Sahara Energy Resources DMCC owns 999 shares in Asharami Energy (Kenya) Limited. Nigerian national Adebola Adesanya Ewaoluwa  who is also the Asharami country manager  owns one share.Sahara Energy DMCC is privately owned  making it difficult to confirm its shareholders and details submitted to the United Arab Emirates business registration body.But data on Sahara‚Äôs website shows that the group‚Äôs original owners  who started operations in 1996  are Nigerian nationals who chose to have their parent company registered in Dubai.‚ÄúIn 2009  Asharani became the first indigenous aviation fuel marketing company with an IATA strategic partnership in Nigeria ‚Äù Asharami Synergy‚Äôs website states.The only other foreign firm that imported petroleum products in the April-June cycle was London-based Vivo Energy  which trades as Shell in African markets.Vivo Energy set foot in Kenya slightly over a month before Kenya attained independence. Vivo Energy Kenya Limited was incorporated on November 3  1963. Both firms listed as shareholders in the local subsidiary are companies registered in the Netherlands.Vivo Energy Kenya Holdings BV owns 68 050 949 shares in the local subsidiary. Vivo Energy Uganda Holdings BV owns one share.Both shareholders are subsidiaries of London-based Vivo Energy PLC  which has incorporated several other companies in the Netherlands that are used to own various operations in Africa.Dutch energy dealer Vitol is in the process of acquiring all of Vivo Energy PLC in a deal that will see the former part with an estimated $2.3 billion (Sh272.4 billion).In December 2021  the takeover faced opposition from some shareholders  stalling Vitol‚Äôs plans to control the Shell brand in Africa. There is no indication  however  that the takeover deal has collapsed.This means buying out Nigerian-owned private equity fund Helios Investment Partners  which previously owned about 40 percent of Vivo Energy PLC.Nigerians Tope Lawani and Babatunde Soyoye founded Helios in 2004. The fund previously owned 24.99 percent of Equity Bank before divesting.One of Vivo Energy‚Äôs biggest rivals  Total Energies  occasionally throws its hat in the ring for fuel import deals.Total Energies‚Äô shares are traded on Euronext Paris. Interestingly  the company‚Äôs employees own 6.8 percent of Total Energies.American investment firm Blackrock Inc owns 6.2 percent. About 87 percent of the company‚Äôs shares are traded on Euronext Paris.While the firm runs its petrol stations under the Total Energies brand  the French multinational participates in the OTS under its subsidiary Gulf African Petroleum Corporation (Gapco).Gapco was previously owned by two companies ‚Äì India‚Äôs Reliance Exploration and Production  and Fortune Oil Corporation.Total bought Gapco for an undisclosed fee in 2017.
