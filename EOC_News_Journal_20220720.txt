7869,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/93426/origin-develops-tool-for-digitising-debt-markets,Origin develops tool for digitising debt markets,Origin  the London-based fintech digitising debt capital markets  has launched Origin Extract to digitise any manually created bond termsheet  extracting structured data to automate and streamline the processes that depend on them.,Source: OriginOrigin  the London-based fintech digitising debt capital markets  has launched Origin Extract to digitise any manually created bond termsheet  extracting structured data to automate and streamline the processes that depend on them.Origin Extract automatically analyses trade documentation  extracting all relevant information accurately and efficiently  enabling all involved players easy access to standardised  structured trade data. Users can now drag-and-drop PDF termsheets into the Origin platform  and the product uses machine learning (ML) to identify important bond-specific datapoints informed by Airbrush  Origin’s industry-leading interface data standard  launched with the aim of being a universal language for bond issuance market participants.Documentation – slow  repetitive  and prone to errorThe widespread and well-understood frustrations with the current issuance process show it’s not fit for purpose  riddled with complexity  manual tasks  repetitive data entry and a high risk of inaccuracy or error. Bond settlement can take up to five days – a process complicated by the number of different parties involved. From the initial creation of the termsheet  right through to final terms and settlement  the information about a trade has to be passed through different systems  at different stages  by multiple market participants. Documents typically exist as PDFs  which require each party to re-key and proof the terms of the PDF into their own system at each change of hands. The demand from market participants is clear. Exchanges  IPAs and clearing houses alike have expressed a need for a streamlined process and structured trade data.Origin’s platform already structures and stores data for trades that take place within the Documentation product  meaning dealers and issuers alike can use the platform to collaborate on documents and through automation of the process  can work more effectively and efficiently together. For any trade that is not happening on the platform yet  Origin Extract creates a new path to digitise the trade and automate its processing.Streamlining the processAttempts to optimise the documentation process do exist – from mandated standardised templates  or the use of optical character recognition (OCR) technology – however their success levels vary and as such the industry-wide problem endures. Origin Extract has been launched with the aim of paving the way to a world in which the entire process is seamless  accurate and efficient. Importantly  it is integrated into the Origin Documentation product  and works as a complement to Origin’s existing Termsheet Generator. By having two entryways into the workflow  users can ensure structured data is never missed.John Judeh  Lead Product Manager at Origin  said: “We see this as an essential step in paving the way to more seamless and efficient bond issuance. This will enable more effective collaboration between market participants by adding automation to a greater proportion of issuances. This is a big step towards our mission of enabling a fully digitised debt issuance market.”Raja Palaniappan  CEO at Origin  said: “Origin Extract is another arrow in Origin’s quiver as we make progress on our mission to digitise the entire bond issuance process. The development of Origin Extract shows the value of our team’s commitment to constant improvement  innovation  and experimentation. The entire Origin platform was built internally by our world-class team of engineers and designers  and it’s fantastic to see that talent produce exciting new developments such as this one.”Origin Extract is the latest addition to the Origin product suite which already includes Origin Marketplace  which brings together investment banks and frequent borrowers to identify issuance opportunities; Origin Documentation  which automates document creation (such as termsheets  final terms  and accession letters); and Origin Post-Trade  which sends data to exchanges  agents and clearing houses without any human intervention through APIs. Last year  Origin also launched Airbrush  a universal data standard for bond issuance  alongside an “instant ISIN” feature to allow automated allocation to Eurobonds for frequent issuers  both in partnership with Clearstream (the Luxembourg Stock Exchange also supported on Airbrush).Origin announced its Series A round closed at $7 million at the end of 2020  led by Clearstream and the Luxembourg Stock Exchange  which brought total funding to $10 million.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.27,0.13,0.59,True,English,"['debt markets', 'Origin', 'tool', 'London-based fintech digitising debt capital markets', 'industry-leading interface data standard', 'bond issuance market participants', 'entire bond issuance process', 'debt issuance market', 'standardised, structured trade data', 'important bond-specific datapoints', 'optical character recognition', 'instant ISIN” feature', 'Luxembourg Stock Exchange', 'Series A round', 'efficient bond issuance', 'multiple market participants', 'exciting new developments', 'repetitive data entry', 'universal data standard', 'Lead Product Manager', 'current issuance process', 'existing Termsheet Generator', 'Origin product suite', 'entire Origin platform', 'Origin Documentation product', 'structured data', 'standardised templates', 'entire process', 'issuance opportunities', 'bond termsheet', 'universal language', 'new path', 'Bond settlement', 'easy access', 'machine learning', 'manual tasks', 'high risk', 'five days', 'different parties', 'initial creation', 'different systems', 'different stages', 'clearing houses', 'streamlined process', 'documentation process', 'OCR) technology', 'success levels', 'industry-wide problem', 'two entryways', 'John Judeh', 'essential step', 'effective collaboration', 'greater proportion', 'big step', 'Raja Palaniappan', 'constant improvement', 'latest addition', 'investment banks', 'frequent borrowers', 'document creation', 'accession letters', 'human intervention', 'automated allocation', 'total funding', 'trade documentation', 'Origin Extract', 'Origin Marketplace', 'Origin Post-Trade', 'final terms', 'relevant information', 'world-class team', 'frequent issuers', 'PDF termsheets', 'Source', 'processes', 'players', 'Users', 'Airbrush', 'aim', 'error', 'widespread', 'frustrations', 'purpose', 'complexity', 'inaccuracy', 'number', 'Documents', 'PDFs', 'party', 'hands', 'demand', 'Exchanges', 'IPAs', 'need', 'trades', 'dealers', 'automation', 'processing', 'Attempts', 'complement', 'workflow', 'seamless', 'issuances', 'mission', 'CEO', 'arrow', 'quiver', 'progress', 'value', 'commitment', 'innovation', 'experimentation', 'engineers', 'designers', 'talent', 'one', 'agents', 'APIs', 'Eurobonds', 'partnership', 'Clearstream', 'end']",2022-07-19,2022-07-20,finextra.com

7878,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220718005859/en/Liberty-Global-Continues-Network-Transformation-in-Europe-With-Telenet-Fluvius-Partnership-in-Belgium,Liberty Global Continues Network Transformation in Europe With Telenet/ Fluvius Partnership in Belgium,DENVER  Colorado--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Liberty Global plc (“Liberty Global” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: LBTYA  LBTYB and LBTYK) subsidiary Telenet Group Holding NV (‘Telenet’ - Euronext Brussels: TNET) and Fluvius System Operator (‘Fluvius’) have today entered int…,DENVER  Colorado--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Liberty Global plc (“Liberty Global” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: LBTYA  LBTYB and LBTYK) subsidiary Telenet Group Holding NV (‘Telenet’ - Euronext Brussels: TNET) and Fluvius System Operator (‘Fluvius’) have today entered into a highly attractive and binding agreement to create the network of the future in Flanders.The companies will incorporate a new independent self-funding infrastructure company  “NetCo”  of which Telenet will own 66.8% and Fluvius 33.2%. Combining both companies’ fixed network assets  NetCo will invest in the gradual evolution of its current hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”) network into a Fiber-to-the-Home (“FTTH”) network  targeting 78% of their combined footprint in Flanders by 2038  either through building directly or with external partners  or through wholesale arrangements. NetCo will also focus on upgrading the existing hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) network using state-of-the-art DOCSIS technology where FTTH will not be deployed.Key elements of the agreement follow:A fully-funded  5x levered NetCo will result in improved ownership economics for Telenet as opposed to the current rental arrangement whereby Telenet pays to access the Fluvius network representing 1/3 of the Telenet operating footprint today.NetCo will operate an open access network with a market-leading utilization rate that's positioned to attract additional strategic and/or financial partners.More than 50% of homes passed in NetCo's footprint are very economic to pass with FTTH at an estimated cost per premise of around EUR650.The investment will be financed from NetCo's robust cash flow as well as Telenet's EUR745 million of proceeds from its recent tower divestment  with no dependency on obtaining incremental external financing.At closing  Telenet’s pro forma net debt will decrease by around EUR500 million as Fluvious’ long-term emphyteutic lease will cease to exist. However  in order to maintain Telenet's consolidated net total leverage of around 4x through the CAPEX-intense build period  its dividend will be reset to a floor of EUR1.00 effective immediately. After the build period  CAPEX intensity is expected to materially decrease and return to normalized historical levels  leading to substantial Adjusted Free Cash Flow growth and providing scope for significantly higher shareholder disbursements.Telenet’s partnership with Fluvius is the latest development in the ongoing evolution of Liberty Global’s 10 Gigabit network strategies  utilizing a combination of the best upgrade technologies available  which also include:Full FTTH upgrade of Virgin Media O2’s fixed network in the UK  targeting completion of all 16 million UK homes by 2028. Separately  Liberty Global and Telefonica are seeking financial partners to create a new  independent joint venture that will accelerate full fiber rollout to up to seven million premises in the UK over the next five years.FTTH upgrade of Virgin Media Ireland’s entire footprint  targeting 1m FTTH homes over the next 3 years.VodafoneZiggo currently progressing with longer term HFC plans including DOCSIS 4.0 in the Netherlands  with initial indicative costs at an attractive EUR150-200 per home.A hybrid approach in Switzerland  where Sunrise is deploying a network strategy that incorporates DOCSIS 3.1 and 4.0 upgrade technologies  wholesale and select fiber builds. To support this  Sunrise has recently renewed wholesale terms with Swisscom and SFN  giving long-term visibility on attractive access terms alongside existing HFC network.Mike Fries  CEO  Liberty Global  comments: “This partnership with Fluvius places Telenet firmly in the driver’s seat in the Belgian market  and cements NetCo as the undisputed kingmaker with a combined retail and wholesale market share close to 60%.”“The partnership also highlights the effectiveness of our network strategies. By utilising a combination of the best network upgrade technologies available  we are firmly on the road to offering up to 10 gig broadband speeds in all our markets. Almost 100% of Liberty Global’s networks already offer gigabit speeds to customers today  with VodafoneZiggo due to complete its work to deliver gigabit speeds across its entire network by the end of this year. Our ongoing network development strategies will enable us to extend our leadership positions in each of our core European markets.”ABOUT LIBERTY GLOBALLiberty Global (NASDAQ: LBTYA  LBTYB and LBTYK) is a world leader in converged broadband  video and mobile communications services.

In the quarter  the Wenger acquisition contributed EUR 17m to orders received and EUR 12m to revenues. The preliminary order book of EUR 775m (Mar22: 619m and Jun21: 499m)  including the acquired order book from Wenger and Sleegers of EUR 81m  is at a record high.Operational performance is below expectations resulting in a preliminary EBIT* margin of 6.3% in the quarter (2Q21: 11.8%). Wenger contributed positively to operational performance. In light of continued supply chain disruption and inflation at high levels leading to slower ramp up of revenues than originally planned  Marel is taking firm actions to improve operational performance towards the year-end 2023 targets.To lower costs the difficult decision has been made to reduce headcount by 5% across the global Marel workforce  resulting in estimated annualized cost saving of EUR 20m with one-off cost of around EUR 10m. The strong order book and the full benefit of pricing actions will support gradual ramp up in revenues and improve price/cost coverage and operational performance in the second half of 2022  as stated in the Q1 2022 financial results.The pipeline remains strong fueled by pioneering solutions and scale up in local sales and service coverage globally initiated ahead of the growth curve. Demand from the poultry and fish industries is on a strong run rate  while the outlook for meat is softer and will impact the industry mix. In this inflationary environment with rising commodity prices  labor scarcity and shifting consumer behavior  Marel is uniquely positioned to support the food industry with the use of robotics and digital solutions that enable more automation  safety and traceability.The preliminary results are unaudited and subject to change. Marel will release its Q2 2022 financial statements after market closing of both NASDAQ Iceland and Euronext Amsterdam as scheduled on 27 July 2022.Story continues* Operating income adjusted for PPA related costs  including depreciation and amortization  and acquisition related costs.Q2 2022 investor meeting on 28 July at 10.30 CETOn 28 July 2022  at 10.30am CET (8:30 am GMT)  Marel will host a virtual investor meeting where CEO Arni Oddur Thordarson and COO Linda Jonsdottir will give an overview of the Q2 2022 financial results and operational highlights.The investor presentation is broadcast live on www.marel.com/webcast and recordings will be available after the meeting on marel.com/ir.

Parallel to this  the recognition of Sidetrade by Gartner® as one of three global Leaders for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash applications raises the Group’s international profile and confirms the relevance of investments in Artificial Intelligence. The recent commercial successes of Sidetrade clearly demonstrate this technological edge. This half-year also marks the one-year milestone since our successful arrival in the United States and validates our offensive strategy for North America. Less than a year after kick-starting our US operations  Sidetrade has already achieved more than half its new bookings in the region by winning large contracts in preference over its two main American competitors.“Now we know that we have what it takes to become firmly established in this region and the gradual ramp-up in our sales and marketing teams will quickly cement Sidetrade’s position as one of three leaders in the world’s number one market. The United States already represents a robust growth driver  and the start of a change in scale for Sidetrade is now underway.”Story continuesNew bookings up 42% and record half year with €3.04 million in new Annual Recurring RevenueIn H1 2022  Sidetrade set a record for Order-to-Cash SaaS orders  which will generate an additional €3.04 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”)  compared with €2.14 million in H1 2021; a +42% increase. The total value of these new subscription contracts over their initial contract periods (excluding renewals and services) represents €9.95 million of Total Contract Value (“TCV”) in H1 2022 versus €6.32 million in H1 2021  a +57% increase.To these SaaS bookings should be added €1.77 million of services on an annual basis (implementation  configuration  training  recurring services  etc.)  compared with €1.37 million in H1 2021  a +29% increase. In total and considering that almost all of these services will be invoiced over the next twelve months  H1 2022 enables Sidetrade to add the equivalent of €4.81 million in Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) compared to €3.51 million in H1 2021; a +37% increase.The initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals) rose to 44 months  compared with 36 months in the previous fiscal year. This length of contract period illustrates outsourcers’ trust in Sidetrade solutions and increases visibility over future revenue. It should be noted that as with all existing contracts  these new contracts include an annual automatic price reindexation clause based on changes in price indices for the relevant country.United States – a new growth driver with 58% of total new bookingsIn H1 2022  international orders represented more than 74% of all bookings  driven by unprecedented momentum in sales with world-leading organizations.Sidetrade outperforms its targets in North AmericaOne year after operations were launched in North America  Sidetrade is outperforming its targets (to achieve more than one-third of its bookings in the region by H2 2022) and already reports 58% of new bookings in the United States which include exceptional contracts signed with large American corporations such as a strategic IT services giant in Q1 2022 (see press release here ) and Insight Enterprises in Q2 2022.This faster-than-expected commercial success confirms three key observations:1/ The Order-to-Cash market is extremely buoyant worldwide  particularly in the United States. The market is worth an estimated $10 billion the world over and is fast developing with less than 10% of companies supplied. It is boosted by the inflationary environment  the rising cost of cash  and recruitment difficulties. Order-to-Cash solutions  which aim to accelerate cash flow by reducing payment delays and generate productivity gains for back-office activities  are becoming a top priority for finance departments.2/ Sidetrade’s technological edge in Artificial Intelligence has proved its worth versus its two main US competitors. The efficiency of Sidetrade’s algorithms is based on the Sidetrade Data Lake– never-before-seen in the market – which aggregates more than $4.6 trillion in B2B transactions with an analysis of 640 million payment experiences from 21 million buying companies worldwide (see press release here ). As a result  Sidetrade provides customers with predictive payment models and collection strategies adapted to the end customer. In early April 2022  Sidetrade was recognized as one of three global Leaders in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash applications  significantly expanding the Group’s reach among American key accounts and strengthening its presence in more tenders.3/ Sidetrade is staying on the offensive with its strategy to quickly become a key player in Order-to-Cash solutions across North America. In less than a year  Sidetrade has built an experienced sales team (16 people to date)  focusing on the recruitment of Order-to-Cash professionals. The US team is ramping up and will double its capacity over the next 12 months. To support this momentum  Sidetrade has implemented an ambitious strategy for recruitment and resources by deciding to:enrol two American recruiters exclusively focused on hiring sales profiles for this region;relocate the Company’s Marketing Department to the United States;create an American prospecting team in Canada (Calgary) from the start of H2 2022  eventually including some 15 operators.This offensive strategy is already producing results which will be strengthened in the months ahead.Overall  in H1 2022  bookings by new customers (“New Business”) benefited from the success in the United States and accounted for 68% of the total versus 55% on average in recent quarters.Cross-selling represents 13% of total new bookings  with the remaining 19% of bookings accounting for Upselling of additional modules to existing customers.The United States has also notably impacted the average size of new contracts (excluding Upselling). In H1 2021  the average totalled €81 000 per year of subscription (ARR) and will amount to €190 000 per year of subscription in H2 2022.Strong increase in Order-to-Cash SaaS revenue to +19% and double-digit growth in revenue to +11%Sidetrade(€m) H1 2022 H1 2021 Change ‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities 17.3 14.8 +17% of which SaaS Subscriptions 14.3 12.1 +19% ‘Sales & Marketing’ Activities 0.5 1.3 -61% Revenue 17.8 16.1 +11%2022 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities grew very sharply to +17% in H1 2022  driven by 19% growth in SaaS subscriptions. The growth in this recurring revenue is the result of record bookings in the 2021 fiscal year  which will continue to impact revenue growth throughout the 2022 fiscal year.‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities  a core business within the Company’s strategy since 2019  now represent 97% of total revenue.In addition  ‘Sales & Marketing’ Activities have become secondary to Sidetrade’s activities. They now account for only 3% of total revenue in this half year and will continue to play a less prominent role commercially  with estimated revenue of €0.9 million at end-2022.Total revenue grew by 11% in H1 2022  to €17.8 million. This performance is supported by solid growth drivers in international markets which now represent 51% of total revenue  including 21% for North America.Inflation generating solid pricing power for Order-to-Cash solutionsBusinesses must be prepared to respond to the inflationary environmentBusinesses face a twofold challenge: consolidate their cash reserves in an inflationary environment and generate productivity gains to address salary increases and recruitment difficulties. This trend is expected to continue over the next 12 to 24 months with an increased risk of future recession  notably linked to multiple hikes in interest rates. In this context  the management of operating working capital  and particularly accounts receivable  is a major challenge for businesses.Sidetrade’s model meets the challenges of the global marketThe return on investment for Sidetrade customers is directly proportional to the cost of cash made available by the “Augmented Cash” platform and the expected productivity gains.Sidetrade’s economic model provides its business with significant resilience  as 90% of its revenue is recurring  representing a significant advantage in the current and future environment. All of these multi-year contracts are indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States)  which alters the total price of SaaS subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices.Sidetrade therefore has robust pricing power that protects the Company’s future revenue against uncertainties and inflationary pressures. At present  Sidetrade perfectly combines its sound fundamentals with a highly favorable growth outlook.On the back of its H1 2022 performance  the Group’s management is confident in Sidetrade’s ability to deliver double-digit growth in the 2022 fiscal year.Next financial announcement2022 First Half Year Result: September 20  2022  after the stock market closesInvestor relationsChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relationsRebecca Parlby +44 7824 505 584 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

Sequana Medical intends to extend SAHARA to treat a small number of patients with its proprietary second-generation DSR product (“DSR 2.0”) to support the US IND filing  expected by year end.The Company has conducted two proof-of-concept studies  the RED DESERT study in euvolemic heart failure patients and the SAHARA study in decompensated heart failure patients  demonstrating that intensive DSR therapy with DSR 1.0 delivers compelling and durable clinical improvements in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients  including safe  rapid and effective decongestion  dramatic improvement in cardio-renal status and restoration of diuretic responsiveness. As a result of the strong  durable clinical signals observed  the Company will focus the heart failure development program on Short Term DSR with its proprietary DSR 2.0 administered with a peritoneal catheter.Story continuesIan Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  said: “We are very encouraged by the results from our DSR program and consider Short Term DSR to be a disease-modifying drug therapy for this large and very difficult-to-treat patient population. Based on what we have learned from RED DESERT and SAHARA  we will focus on Short Term DSR using our proprietary DSR 2.0. With just three to four weeks of DSR treatment  we believe that we can bring patients important clinical benefits lasting up to a year and progress this potential breakthrough therapy to patients in need as efficiently as possible.”Dr. Oliver Gödje  Chief Medical Officer at Sequana Medical  added: “We and our advisors are very impressed by the results and see DSR therapy as a treatment for heart failure that is complementary to other therapies. As cardiologists  we struggle to remove congestion from patients with diuretic resistance  which is the primary driver of morbidity and hospitalization in heart failure. DSR therapy tackles the key clinical need of sodium overload in patients in whom loop diuretics are no longer effective. The patients treated with DSR therapy in our studies have not been re-hospitalized for congestion-related heart failure problems during their study follow-up period and the clinical outcomes resulted in a substantial increase in predicted survival using the Seattle Heart Failure Model. We are now preparing for a US IND filing of our DSR 2.0 by year end to start MOJAVE  our Phase 1b/2a US study.”DSR heart failure drug developmentTwelve decompensated diuretic-resistant heart failure patients have been enrolled in the SAHARA study using DSR 1.0. Interim results from ten evaluableiv patients after completion of the intensive DSR period demonstrated that DSR therapy safely  effectively and rapidly eliminated persistent congestion and restored euvolemia (i.e.  normal amount of body fluids)  resulting in a mean weight loss of 6kg. There was a near normalization of diuretic response with six-hour excretion of sodium more than doubling vs. baseline  as well as a considerable improvement in cardio-renal health  with a mean reduction in NT-proBNP  a key cardiac function parameter  of more than 30% vs. baseline and a stable renal function (eGFRv) vs. baseline despite this dramatic fluid loss. The need for loop diuretics was dramatically reduced for many months following completion of the intensive DSR therapy (see table below)  which the Company believes is an important demonstration of the improvement in cardio-renal health of these patients.Evaluable patient # months follow-up post intensive DSR period Reduction in diuretic dose 01-01 11 90% 01-03 8 100% 01-04 7 90% 01-05 8 100% 01-06 7 100% 01-08 6 100% 01-09 4 83% 01-10 6 95% 01-11 2 97% 01-12 2 100%Additionally  patients treated with DSR therapy in both RED DESERT and SAHARA experienced no congestion-related heart failure hospital re-admissions during their follow-up period in the study. The clinical benefits observed in RED DESERT and SAHARA result in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality of patients pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model.Based on the SAHARA observations  which reinforce those observed in the RED DESERT study  the Company believes that an intensive treatment period of three to four weeks of DSR therapy is sufficient for six to twelve months of important clinical benefits. Therefore the Company is focusing its DSR development program on Short Term DSR using its proprietary DSR 2.0 that is expected to have an improved therapeutic and favourable safety profile  adminstered via a peritoneal catheter. In addition  the Company believes that given Short Term DSR will be regulated as a drug only (rather than a drug-device combination for Long Term alfapump DSR)  this will shorten and derisk the clinical and regulatory paths  and therefore the time to market.To support the US IND filing of DSR 2.0  the Company intends to extend SAHARA to treat a small number of patients with DSR 2.0. Patients with diuretic-resistant congestive heart failure on high doses of loop diuretics will undergo intensive DSR therapy with DSR 2.0 for two weeks which can be repeated up to two times depending on their euvolemic state  diuretic response and stable DSR dosing. Primary endpoints include safety and tolerability of DSR 2.0 and secondary feasibility endpoints include the ability of DSR therapy to restore and maintain euvolemia without the need for additional loop diuretic treatment. Top-line results of SAHARA  using DSR 1.0 and 2.0  and the US IND filing of DSR 2.0 are expected by year end.To support a compelling package for partnering  the Company is expanding its planned MOJAVE US Phase 1b/2a study. This randomized controlled study in approximately 30 diuretic resistant chronic heart failure patients will evaluate Short Term DSR with DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of standard-of-care therapy vs. standard-of-care therapy alone. This study will commence following submission and approval of the US IND.Update on alfa pump development in North AmericaPOSEIDON  the North American pivotal study of the alfapump in recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is on track to report primary endpoint data in Q4 2022. Based upon recent FDA feedback  the biocompatibility testing to support the PMA submission has been extended by 3 months. The Company now plans to submit the PMA regulatory filing in the second half of 2023.Webcast and Conference CallSequana Medical will host a webcast and conference call today at 03:00 pm CET / 09:00 am ET.Registration webcast: please click hereRegistration conference call (only if you wish to participate in the Q&A): please click here.

Standard of care includes treatment with diuretic drugs  but these have well recognized toxicity and resistance issues. Half of the heart failure patients admitted for fluid overload are discharged with no clinically relevant loss of fluid and one in four is re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. It is estimated that 200 000 US heart failure patients have drug-resistant congestion requiring repeated hospitalization  severely impacting their survival and quality of life and creating a heavy financial burden.About DSR® (Direct Sodium Removal) in heart failureSequana Medical considers its’ proprietary DSR to be a disease modifying therapy for heart failure. Fluid accumulation in heart failure patients is caused by the retention of too much sodium. The DSR drug-based approach directly tackles this key clinical problem of sodium overload  and works in partnership with the kidneys to safely and rapidly eliminate the excess fluid. Complementary to existing heart failure therapies  clinical proof-of-concept studies using the Company’s first-generation DSR product (“DSR 1.0”) have shown that DSR can i) safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate fluid overload in heart failure patients  ii) improve the health of the heart and preserve renal function  and iii) restore the ability of the kidney to manage the fluid and sodium naturally  resulting in a large and long-lasting reduction in the need for diuretic drugs. In DSR treated patients  there have been no congestion-related re-hospitalizations during the study follow-up period and the clinical benefits observed in the clinical studies resulted in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality of patients pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Modeliii. Top-line results of the Phase 2a SAHARA study using DSR 1.0 and the Company’s proprietary second-generation DSR product (“DSR 2.0”) are expected by year end  followed by the start of a Phase 1b/2a US efficacy study with DSR 2.0.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating drug-resistant fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease and heart failure. Fluid overload is a well-recognized problem in these growing diseases  causing severe problems for the large number of patients for whom current medicines are no longer effective. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical’s proprietary approaches that work with the body to remove this excess fluid  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.

At constant exchange rates  growth was +7.8%  driven by good performance in both the companion animals and food producing animals segments  in a context of market slowdown. It should be noted that our actual performance for the quarter was favorably impacted by the appreciation of certain currencies  such as the US dollar  the Indian rupee  the Brazilian real  and the Mexican peso. At area level  our growth is mainly driven by the performance of the United States  particularly in the dental and dermatology ranges and recently launched products range (Clomicalm  Itrafungol  the petfood and the food producing animals range)  by that of the Asia-Pacific zone  where India and Australia continue to benefit from a favorable momentum  and finally Latin America  driven by double-digit growth in Brazil and Mexico.Cumulative consolidated revenue at the end of JuneFor the first half of the year overall  our revenues were €616.4 million  compared with €529.4 million  representing an overall increase of +16.4% compared with the same period in 2021. Adjusted for the favorable impact of exchange rates  revenue shows growth of +12.0%. This growth benefited in part from a favorable baseline effect representing 1 point of growth in revenue  attributable to new products acquired starting in the second quarter of 2021.Story continuesAll areas are growing organically at the end of June. It should be noted  however  that double-digit growth in Europe has stalled in the last quarter  due to the slowdown in the market as anticipated in our annual outlook. Thus  the sales in this area increased by +6.8% at real rates (+6.2% at constant rates)  thanks mainly to the contribution of the United Kingdom  France and Italy. The area is supported by the strong dynamism of companion animals ranges (in particular petfood  specialties  and vaccines)  which compensate for the withdrawal of ranges intended for food producing animals. In Asia-Pacific  the development at real rates is +19.8% (+15% at constant exchange rates). Australia and India are driving growth in the region  generating more than 85% of the latter  in particular on products destined for cattle  which makes it possible to largely compensate for the withdrawal of China  which was heavily impacted by lockdowns at the beginning of the year and which  despite a rebound since May  remains down at the end of June. In Latin America  activity grew by +25.1% at real rates (+14.6% at constant exchange rates)  thanks in particular to contributions from Brazil and Mexico. Finally  in the United States  activity increased by +32.2% (+19.9% at constant exchange rates). It benefits from sustained sales on new products launched in 2021 (Clomicalm and Itrafungol) and those launched in early 2022 (petfood  and Tulissin for the food producing animals segment)  as well as good performance on the dental and dermatology ranges.In terms of species  revenue in the companion animal segment grew overall by +17.9% at real rates (+14.2% at constant exchange rates)  mainly driven by very good double-digit growth in the petfood  specialty  dermatology and hygiene ranges  as well as vaccines for dogs and cats. The food producing animals segment also showed strong growth of +15.0% at real rates (+9.9% at constant exchange rates)  mainly driven by the ruminant sector (+14.2% at constant exchange rates); and the aquaculture segment (+5.1% at constant rates) compared to the same period in 2021.Covid-19 health crisis and the war in UkraineWe continue to face significant production  logistical and supply constraints with regard to certain intermediaries  and more recently  significant inflationary impacts on our costs (energy  raw materials  transportation  etc.).OutlookThe activity in the first half of the year reinforces our perspective. Revenue growth at constant rates and scope should be in the range of 5% to 10%. The ratio of “current operating profit before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions” to “revenue” should be around 15% at constant exchange rates  despite the inflationary impacts (with a deliberate overinvestment in R&D of approximately 1 percentage point of revenue compared to 2021). Finally  our debt relief should be around €60 million  excluding dividends  at constant scope and exchange rates.CONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin millions of euros 2022 2021 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates 1 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope 1 First quarter revenue 318.1 266.5 +19.3% +16.2% +16.2% Second quarter revenue 298.3 262.9 +13.5% +7.8% +7.8% Revenue for first half year 616.4 529.4 +16.4% +12.0% +12.0%A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

7893,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4524058-celyad-still-top-notch-oncology,Celyad Stock: Probably Still Top-Notch In Oncology (NASDAQ:CYAD),Celyad Oncology (CYAD) is a seemingly neglected immuno-oncology-focused nano-cap. Check out why I see CYAD as an undervalued oncology play.,"Design CellsThesisCelyad is a Belgian overlooked and under-appraised company in a crowded and difficult-to-master oncology landscape. After a British oncology professor put the company on my radar some months ago  the stock sold off over the past months in bearish biotech times  and additionally over a clinical hold which may be able to be resolved in favor of its drug candidate.Celyad's strategy is to develop next-generation allogeneic immune cell constructs to fight cancer  allogeneic meaning the cells do not originate from the donor itself. That makes sense  as the future of immuno-oncology is allogeneic or off-the-shelf  the existing autologous drugs and drug candidates being too expensive and too time-consuming to make.Celyad owns unique technology that allows plug-and-play construction of chimeric antigen receptors or CAR's on T-cells  to trigger the body's immune system against cancer cells  without any gene-editing.The focus is currently on two allogeneic candidates  CYAD-211 and CYAD-101  with Celyad wishing to partner its autologous CAR-T cell construct CYAD-02  which had equally brought good results.CYAD-211 is being tried in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial for relapsed/refractory AML and MDS  a hematological cancer  where it has shown good results so far  with no signs of graft-versus-host disease  and good engraftment. Results in cohorts 4 and 5  at maximal dosing of CYAD-211 combined with higher dosing of chemotherapy  will be read out in the second half of 2022. That could be a catalyst.CYAD-101 has the more daunting task to show good results in metastatic colorectal cancer  where it builds on promising earlier results in the monotherapy alloSHRINK trial  and good results of CYAD-01  its autologous predecessor. CYAD-101  to me  is essentially a double killer  a CAR-T cell which also targets what NK cells target. It should furthermore come without the typical CAR-T toxicity  adding to its natural killer cell similarity  which is a great advantage. Solid tumors  a much larger market than liquid tumors  are the next frontier in immuno-oncology  and having a CAR-T cell drug candidate being successful there after so many failures would be big. The recent CYAD-101 trial in combination with Keytruda  a PD-1 inhibitor  is currently facing a clinical hold  with two deaths with similar pulmonary findings having occurred in the trial. I explain below that these pulmonary findings may not be related to CYAD-101 but to Keytruda  which has in fact often generated reports of pulmonary toxicity. To add to that  CYAD-101 was designed to inhibit graft-versus-host disease  and had shown no serious adverse events in the earlier alloSHRINK trial in metastatic colorectal cancer.The combined lack of recent data  the March 2022 clinical hold and the May 2022 discontinuation of CYAD-203 in a biotech bear market have led this company to trade as low as it does. I believe inflection points could be near.Analysts' mean price target of $11 and consistent rating the stock as outperform with an almost +700% upside lead me to consider if the stock should be trading a lot higher.Company overviewShare price and market capIt has been a year-and-a-half ago since Celyad received coverage on Seeking Alpha  with Siva Kumar Raju Kolaru calling the moment a 'chance to get in early and cheap'. The coverage was good  but the call was obviously wrong. Suffice to say few correctly predicted the biotech market obliteration due to macro-economic headwinds  or a clinical hold in a drug candidate that shouldn't generate as much toxicity as other CAR-T's.Celyad's stock has over that period dropped by 81% percent. In 2017 it even traded above $50. By the looks of it  the company is a total bust. Yet  analysts and experts loved it and keep loving it. This is its five-year chart.Celyad five-year chart (Ycharts)At a share price of $1.61  its market cap is $36 million.By the looks of it  this company seems like a total bust. However  still on June 24  2022  Celyad claimed to be a leader in the field of allogeneic CAR T cell therapies. How can both be reconciled? Across my research in companies in the oncology space over the past years  I have seen Celyad's name favorably mentioned time and again  including in a William Blair coverage of April 2022 on advances of immuno-oncology in solid tumors. And I agree Celyad is a gem  which is further advanced in solid tumors than many others are  with perfectly fine drug candidates. I believe the market/investors do not fully understand why Celyad is at the vanguard of its field  and I will explain this a bit below.Celyad's proprietary technologyCelyad's proprietary technology is fourfold. I will focus on the three most relevant technological advances  which are the all-in-one vector  TIM-technology and shRNA-technology. Elucidating this technology first will make the understanding of its drug candidates mentioned below easier. The fourth aspect of its technology  called shARC  allows T-cell armoring with IL-18 and will be used for future drug candidates.The all-in-one vector or plug-and-play approachAll immuno-oncology companies I have looked at mount always more complex elements on an immune cell  mostly a CAR-T or CAR-NK cell. This requires multiple immune-cell editing processes  with the accompanying construction time and cost. Celyad's 'plug-and-play' vector can features all of the add-ons at once  which is innovative and process-friendly.All-in-one vector (Celyad corporate presentation)Is this necessary? I believe it will be if immuno-oncology's goals are ever to reach larger addressable markets. Costs of creating billions and billions of allogeneic T- or NK-cells  with all sorts of always more complex cell editing processes  risk to make the end-product unaffordable. Affordability is a huge issue in immuno-oncology  with costs of therapy currently in the several hundreds of thousands up to a million dollars  not within the budget of most people. The proprietary plug-and-play approach streamlines CAR-development and lowers manufacturing costs. I believe that eventually  in an effort to address the masses  the field of immuno-oncology will look at process-simplifying solutions like these. The investor field does not seem to have evolved so far yet; the focus is currently still on the most complex immune cell-constructs  which are all fine in preclinical development and trials  but eventually they will need to be marketable post approval.I believe that the stage of commercialization is where the highly-praised immuno-oncology companies praised for the moment  with many of their drug candidates still preclinical or in Phase 1 trials  may eventually fail. A look at some drug candidates by Fate (FT536)  (FT596)  (FT538)  (FT573) shows how different cell editing processes are necessary to create a final immune-cell construct. We will see below that Novartis has already come to knock on Celyad's door in 2017.T-cell inhibitory molecule technology (TIM) to reduce graft-versus-host diseaseCelyad's T-cell inhibitory molecule or TIM technology inhibits T-cells signaling to induce graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). In the current T-cell-based immuno-oncology drugs and drug candidates  GvHD is the main cause of morbidity  of auto-immunity or neurotoxicity issues. It is also one of the main reasons why the field has moved away from T-cells to NK-cell based therapies. The T-cell receptor or TCR  present on the surface of T-cells  is responsible for GvHD. Celyad's TIM technology allows overcoming the GvHD issue. It has been shown to work in CYAD-101 in metastatic colorectal cancer  with good results and without any of the first 15 patients showing any signs of GvHD. Again  I believe this is great technology that could be licensed to a larger number of parties in the space.TIM complex (Celyad corporate presentation)The short hairpin RNA technologyCelyad's shRNA technology allows for gene modulation without gene editing. This may lead to longer persistence of immune cells  better engraftment  or knock-down of multiple genes such as MICA and MICB. As a result  there should be less tolerability issues  less cell manipulation  and a shorter manufacturing process.shRNA technology (Celyad ASH 2021 presentation)Celyad's pipelineCelyad pipeline (Celyad corporate presentation)Celyad has two lead drug candidates  CYAD-211 and CYAD-101.CYAD-211CYAD-211 is being tested in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial called IMMUNICY-1 following preconditioning with CyFlu chemotherapy  for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. It features a vector with a shRNA hairpin incorporating TIM to inhibit GvHD  and includes a CAR expressing an antigen against B-cell maturation.CYAD-211 drawing (Celyad corporate presentation)These are the results presented in December 2021  in heavily pretreated patients:CYAD-211 results so far (Celyad Ash 2021 update)CYAD-211 is efficacious  shows no signs of GvHD probably due to the TIM-technology  and leads to engraftment. Again  combining efficacy with lack of GvHD in CAR-T trials is major. Celyad is now enrolling in cohorts 4 and 5 in its dose-escalation regimen  to see whether higher preconditioning chemotherapy at the highest dose of 300x106 cells per infusion leads to improved cell persistence and maximization of clinical benefit.CYAD-211 dosing cohorts (Celyad corporate presentation)To me  CYAD-211 looks like a perfectly fine drug candidate. I expect improved outcomes and no issues going forward. Additional data from the trial are expected in the second half of 2022. This could be a catalyst.CYAD-101IntroductionCYAD-101 as an allogeneic drug candidate for solid tumors which builds on good results of a prior drug candidate  CYAD-01  which is autologous. CYAD-01 was seen as a milestone development in immuno-oncology as it had mounted an NKG2D receptor on a T-cell. Earlier mostly preclinical developments with NKG2D being mounted on T-cells showed robust anti-cancer activity in AMS  but also in solid tumors such as cervical cancer or glioblastoma  and low toxicity.CYAD-101 features an all-in-one vector with TIM to prevent GvHD  and an NKG2D-based CAR construct to bind to ligands expressed on many tumor cells.CYAD-101 drawing (Celyad corporate presentation)The NKG2D-based CAR basically renders a T-cell into a double killer  as the NKG2D receptor is usually expressed on the surface of NK cells to bind to multiple ligands on cancer cells  such as MICA  MICB and human UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs). So that's a T-cell that can target both NK-cell and T-cell targets  with in principle no GvHD. The below chart shows which tumors express NKG2D ligands.NKG2D expression on tumor cells (Celyad William Blair biotech focus august 2020 slides)Why is this clever? Because a CAR-construct can normally only target a single antigen  which can easily be shed by the tumor to overcome killing and lead to cancer resistance. A solution to this could be to make engineering more complex  e.g. by having a CD19/CD20 CAR construct  which could still target CD20 if CD19 is shed by the tumor cell. More explanation as to why it would be useful to place an NKG2D receptor on a CAR-T cell can be found here (slides 3 to 7).The finished alloSHRINK trialCelyad has already done a Phase 1 trial of CYAD-101 as monotherapy after chemotherapy in mCRC  alloSHRINK  and results were impressive. This is a quote taken from Celyad in that regard:""CYAD-101 is the first allogeneic CAR T candidate  to our knowledge  which has demonstrated confirmed objective responses in the treatment of a solid tumor indication  specifically advanced mCRC  with no clinical evidence of GvHD.CYAD-101 had been given at three dose levels  showing no GvHD  no dose-limiting toxicities  no serious adverse events  and no patient discontinuation. With 15 patients treated  results were outstanding (again  this is well-tolerated T-cell-based immunotherapy in solid tumors). There was a 73% disease control rate  nine patients achieving stable disease  seven patients with disease stabilization of more than or equal to three months  and two patients achieving a partial response including one with a KRAS-mutation.alloSHRINK trial results (Celyad William Blair biotech focus august 2020 slides)Median progression free survival was 3.9 months  and median overall survival was 10.6 months.There was a tumor burden decrease in 8 out of 15 patients  including six patients at dose level 3.Three of four patients treated at the highest dose achieving partial response or stable disease also showed new T-cell clones  showing persistence and activation of the patient's own immune system.I want to reiterate here: immuno-oncology trials in solid tumors typically lead to no success at all  or barely any. Iovance  often considered as a very promising solid tumor play  has shown an objective response of 36% in melanoma and 44% in cervical cancer. Tmunity's (private) MUC-1 trial has failed and led to discontinuation. BioNTech (BNTX) has just received a European priority medicines designation for its autologous CAR-T trial after having shown efficacy in third- or later-line testicular germ cell tumor. The data that were used for such designation came out of a small 16-patient phase 1/2 trial  showing a disease control rate of 86% and an overall response rate of 43%. Other interesting companies such as Poseida Therapeutics (PSTX) or Achilles Therapeutics (ACHL) have market caps of respectively $175 million and $100 million  with ACHL also being undervalued in my opinion. FT500  the first drug candidate that Fate Therapeutics (FATE) had started a trial in solid tumors with  was considered 'commercially unviable' after trial results had come out.The Keynote-B799 trial under clinical holdCYAD-101 is currently in a Phase 1b trial called KEYNOTE-B79  following FOLFOX chemotherapy and combined with Merck's Keytruda as anti-PD-1 therapy for the treatment of refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). First-patient dosing occurred in December 2021. The trial was placed on clinical hold in March 2022 due to deaths in two patients with similar pulmonary findings.Given the safety profile of NKG2D-CAR's and the lack of GvHD due to TIM  as shown in the alloSHRINK trial  the clinical hold came as a surprise.I took a look at whether Merck's Keytruda may have triggered this instead of CYAD-101. Keytruda has been reported multiple times to lead to pneumonitis  pulmonary toxicity and treatment-related mortality. This give me some comfort that Celyad may well be able to relate the pulmonary findings in its trial to Keytruda. One should not forget that  in a Phase 1 trial  one does not treat the patients one wants to treat  but those that one has to treat  after failure of multiple lines of (chemo)therapy. This is obviously the elephant in the room.It is unclear how long clinical holds may take. As an example  the FDA's clinical hold on all five of Allogene's (ALLO) trials occurred in October 2021 and was removed in January 2022.As the market now fully assumes CYAD-101 is a bust  despite showing efficacy and a good safety profile in the alloSHRINK trial  I find there is major opportunity in buying Celyad here. But I may be wrong  and the stock may fall further if the clinical hold does not get resolved.CYAD-02 - up for partnering/saleI will cover CYAD-02 briefly  as it is an autologous candidate which has shown good results  but which Celyad plans to sell as it wants to move ahead with allogeneic candidates. CYAD-02 includes a vector with a NKG2D-CAR and shRNA to knockdown MICA and MICB. The results of the CYCLE-1 study in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) showed good efficacy and tolerability.Cycle-1 study results (Celyad Ash 2021 update)The discontinuation of CYAD-03CYAD-03 is a so-called 'armored' CAR-T candidate  which saw the addition of IL-18 as a cytokine  to empower the T-cell's anti-cancer activity  and to alter the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cells within the tumor microenvironment. Celyad planned to submit an IND by the end of 2022  but discontinued that plan on May 5  2022  after further analysis of preclinical data. Biotech companies with limited budgets reassess their pipelines to only move forward with the best ones. In a competitive landscape  this is something that happens. As the discontinuation occurred before the IND  I am going to trust Celyad knew what it was doing.Partnerships with Novartis  Mesoblast  Merck and Fortress Investment GroupSince 2017  Celyad has an ongoing partnership with Novartis (NVS)  under which Novartis uses Celyad's intellectual property to develop two undisclosed targets. Celyad has received a $4 million upfront payment  and is eligible to receive additional milestone payments of up to $92.0 million  plus royalties based on net sales at percentages in the single digits if these targets make it to market. Celyad is not excluded from licensing its IP rights to other partners.Since May 2018 and with an amendment in 2022  Celyad has entered into agreements with Australian biotech company Mesoblast (MESO) to develop and commercialize an intra-myocardial injection catheter. Celyad received an upfront fee of $1 million in 2018. In the framework of the 2022 amendment  Celyad will receive $1 5 million Mesoblast ordinary shares (currently worth about $4.5 million)  and Celyad may be eligible up to $20 million in clinical  regulatory  and commercial milestone payments.Since September 2020  Celyad has a collaboration agreement with Merck (MRK) to enter into a clinical trial collaboration agreement - the KEYTRUDA-B79 trial.In December 2021  apart from a private placement shares at $5 per share  about 18% above the share price at the time  Fortress Investment Group can choose two persons to be either members of Celyad's Board of Directors or non-voting observers  insofar as Fortress Investment Group continues to hold at least 10% of Celyad's outstanding ordinary shares.CompetitorsCompetitors are numerous in the oncology space. Some of them for solid tumors have been mentioned above. Celyad's latest annual results are a good source for information in that regard. I do notice that  in light of its technology and promising candidates  Celyad seems much undervalued compared to some of its peers  many of which are even less advanced in trials or unsuccessful  certainly in solid tumors. I have already mentioned Fate Therapeutics (FATE) and Nkarta (NKTX) above  with most product candidates in preclinical or phase 1 trials. Some others are mentioned below. Arcellx (ACLX)  with a market cap of around $900 million  has preclinical or stage 1 products. Kura Oncology (KURA)  with a $1.2 billion market cap  has preclinical or phase 1 drug candidates. GT Biopharma (GTBP)  with a $90 million market cap  has assets that are either preclinical or in Phase 1. VOR Biopharma (VOR)  with a $190 million market cap  has assets that are either preclinical or in Phase 1.AnalystsAnalysts have revised their price targets downward in light of recent events  but consistently rate Celyad as outperform  with price targets far above the current share price. The average price target of analysts is $11  which would mean an upside of a bit less than 700% compared to the current share price.RisksAs mentioned above  the clinical hold of the Keynote-B79 is an issue. The question here is whether it can be resolved  and if so  in which timeframe. If it doesn't  Celyad may have to reorganize its trials  either pursuing CYAD-101 as a monotherapy or combining it with another drug.As Celyad's assets are early-stage  further risks along the development path can still be encountered. There is no certainty that the drug candidates are ever approved  and the competitive field may look different as time progresses. The FDA may impose restrictions on certain combinations of drugs (e.g. PD-1 inhibitors + CAR-T)  and the first allogeneic CAR-T trial has yet to be approved.Financing is another risk factor. At a given time  Celyad may need to dilute shares as it is looking for additional funding. That may happen sometime in 2023.Finally  Celyad trades both on the Nasdaq and on Euronext with low liquidity. Buying or selling large numbers of shares at one time may be an issue.FinancialsCelyad has a cash position of about $20.5 million. Its net cash burn for the last quarter was $10.6 million. It claims that  with access to an equity purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Fund LLC  it has sufficient access to cash to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements until mid-2023.ConclusionI see Celyad as an undervalued oncology play with state-of-the-art science  including a plug-and-play vector  CAR-T's that inhibit graft-versus-host-disease and two promising drug candidates. Efficiently and prohibiting graft-versus-host disease  Celyad has turned CAR-T cells into double killers.One of its drug candidates CYAD-101 is in solid tumors  where it has shown impressive results in the alloSHRINK monotherapy trial. However  in combination with Merck's PD-1 inhibitor  this trial is on clinical hold since four months. I assume this will not be the end of development of this drug candidate  and explain above why I believe the clinical hold may be related to Keytruda's pulmonary toxicity issues. But that is a possibility  and I could be wrong here.Although some immuno-oncology companies may have been overvalued before the biotech bear market  Celyad has consistently been the most undervalued one that I have seen. The sell-off has been so bad that the market assigns little to no value to this company's drug candidates  partnerships or technology. The sell-side analysts' mean price target is about 700% higher than the actual share price.Apart from a possible lift of the clinical hold  I see some other possible near-term inflection points  such as upcoming data release for CYAD-211  at highest dosing combined with higher-doses of chemotherapy  scheduled for the second half of 2022.",neutral,0.05,0.93,0.02,mixed,0.33,0.08,0.59,True,English,"['Celyad Stock', 'Notch', 'Oncology', 'NASDAQ', 'CYAD', 'three most relevant technological advances', 'next-generation allogeneic immune cell constructs', 'allogeneic CAR T cell therapies', 'Siva Kumar Raju Kolaru', 'natural killer cell similarity', 'autologous CAR-T cell construct', 'CAR-T cell drug candidate', 'two allogeneic candidates', 'bearish biotech times', 'existing autologous drugs', 'chimeric antigen receptors', 'serious adverse events', 'Phase 1 dose-escalation trial', 'monotherapy alloSHRINK trial', 'biotech bear market', 'biotech market obliteration', 'mean price target', 'master oncology landscape', 'British oncology professor', 'metastatic colorectal cancer', 'fine drug candidates', 'earlier alloSHRINK trial', 'typical CAR-T toxicity', 'similar pulmonary findings', 'William Blair coverage', 'March 2022 clinical hold', 'future drug candidates', 'recent CYAD-101 trial', 'Celyad five-year chart', 'immune system', 'autologous predecessor', 'double killer', 'other CAR-T', 'two deaths', 'recent data', 'larger market', 'market cap', 'pulmonary toxicity', 'Share price', 'earlier results', 'oncology space', 'hematological cancer', 'Belgian overlooked', 'past months', 'refractory AML', 'host disease', 'good engraftment', 'maximal dosing', 'higher dosing', 'second half', 'daunting task', 'great advantage', 'Solid tumors', 'liquid tumors', 'next frontier', 'many failures', 'PD-1 inhibitor', 'combined lack', 'May 2022 discontinuation', 'inflection points', 'consistent rating', 'macro-economic headwinds', 'total bust', 'past years', 'many others', 'one vector', 'fourth aspect', 'T-cell armoring', 'cancer cells', 'good results', 'Design Cells', 'NK cells', 'unique technology', 'proprietary technology', 'Company overview', 'Thesis', 'radar', 'stock', 'favor', 'strategy', 'donor', 'sense', 'immuno', 'shelf', 'play', 'construction', 'T-cells', 'body', 'gene-editing', 'focus', 'MDS', 'signs', 'cohorts', 'chemotherapy', 'catalyst', 'promising', 'CYAD-01', 'combination', 'Keytruda', 'fact', 'reports', 'CYAD-20', 'Analysts', 'outperform', '+700% upside', 'Alpha', 'moment', 'call', 'period', '81% percent', 'looks', 'experts', 'Ycharts', 'June', 'leader', 'field', 'research', 'companies', 'name', 'April', 'gem', 'investors', 'vanguard', 'TIM-technology', 'shRNA-technology', 'understanding', 'IL-18']",2022-07-19,2022-07-20,seekingalpha.com

However  a global shortage of components may limit growth in customer demand.Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and the sanctions imposed against Russia are not expected to have any direct impact on Aspocomp’s business  financial position or cash flow.Aspocomp reiterates the guidance that was published on July 14  2022. Aspocomp estimates that its net sales for 2022 will increase and its operating result for 2022 will improve clearly from 2021. In 2021  net sales amounted to EUR 33.2 million and the operating result to EUR 2.2 million.In its previous outlook for 2022 (Interim Report for January 1-March 31  2022  on April 26  2022)  Aspocomp estimated that its net sales for 2022 will increase and its operating result for 2022 will improve from 2021. In 2021  net sales amounted to EUR 33.2 million and the operating result to EUR 2.2 million.CEO’S REVIEW“The second quarter of the year went excellently. Net sales continued to grow strongly and rose 33 percent to EUR 9.6 million. Net sales for the first half of the year rose to EUR 18.6 million  a year-on-year increase of 39 percent.Strong demand continued in the Semiconductor Industry customer segment  and its net sales tripled to EUR 4.2 million. The Telecommunication segment also saw brisk growth  up 50 percent  and its net sales reached EUR 1.5 million. The Industrial Electronics segment clearly slowed down and its net sales fell by 50 percent to EUR 1.0 million.New orders valued at EUR 9.6 million were received and the order book increased to EUR 20.5 million. Growth in the order book was particularly supported by increased demand in the Semiconductor Industry customer segment. Of the order book  EUR 17.2 million has been scheduled for delivery this year and the remaining EUR 3.3 million next year.The second-quarter operating result increased clearly to EUR 1.6 million  amounting to 17 percent of net sales. The improvement in operating result in the second quarter was mainly due to the increase in net sales and the improved product mix focusing on more technologically demanding PCBs. The operating result for the first half of the year amounted to EUR 2.4 million and the operating result percentage rose to 13 percent.Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia have no direct impact on Aspocomp’s business. We reiterate the guidance for 2022 that was updated in July.”NET SALES AND EARNINGSApril-June 2022Second-quarter net sales amounted to EUR 9.6 (7.2) million  a year-on-year increase of 33%.The Semiconductor Industry customer segment’s net sales tripled to EUR 4.2 (1.3) million during the second quarter. The growth of the Semiconductor Industry customer segment was driven by ongoing global investments in significant increases in chip capacity.The Industrial Electronics customer segment’s net sales decreased by 40% to EUR 1.1 (1.8) million during the second quarter. Inflationary pressures and problems with the availability of components slowed down industrial investments.The Security  Defense and Aerospace customer segment’s net sales increased by 16% to EUR 1.5 (1.3) million. The changing geopolitical environment increases the demand for local manufacturing.The Automotive customer segment’s demand declined by 29%  with net sales remaining at EUR 1.2 (1.7) million. Growth in the Automotive segment was limited by a general shortage of components and extended delivery times in the automotive industry.The Telecommunication customer segment’s net sales amounted to EUR 1.5 (1.0) million  a year-on-year increase of 50%. Growth was supported by customers’ increased PCB needs in product development and new customers.The five largest customers accounted for 56% (49%) of net sales. In geographical terms  92% (84%) of net sales were generated in Europe and 8% (16%) on other continents.The operating result for the second quarter amounted to EUR 1.6 (0.5) million. The improvement in operating result in the second quarter was mainly due to the increase in net sales and the improved product mix.

The growth of the Semiconductor Industry customer segment was driven by ongoing global investments in significant increases in chip capacity.The Industrial Electronics customer segment’s net sales decreased by 12% to EUR 2.8 (3.2) million. Inflation and problems with the availability of components caused the segment’s demand to decline during the second quarter.The Security  Defense and Aerospace customer segment’s net sales increased by 16% to EUR 3.0 (2.6) million. The changing geopolitical environment increases the demand for local manufacturing.The Automotive customer segment’s demand declined by 13%  with net sales remaining at EUR 2.9 (3.3) million. Growth in the Automotive segment was limited by a general shortage of components and extended delivery times in the automotive industry.The Telecommunication customer segment’s net sales amounted to EUR 2.7 (2.3) million  a year-on-year increase of 23%. Growth was supported by customers’ increased PCB needs in product development and new customers.The five largest customers accounted for 54 (45) percent of net sales. In geographical terms  91 (86) percent of net sales were generated in Europe and 9 (14) percent on other continents.First-half operating result amounted to EUR 2.4 (0.0) million.

The company has continued its investments to increase capacity in line with its strategy  but the installation of equipment has been slowed down in part due to delays in material and component deliveries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company did not hold any treasury shares.

The aggregate value of the shares exchanged was EUR 3 007 472. The shares traded at a low of EUR 5.20 and a high of EUR 6.78. The average share price was EUR 6.05. The closing price at June 30  2022 was EUR 5.86  which translates into market capitalization of EUR 40.1 million.The company had 3 804 shareholders at the end of the review period. Nominee-registered shares accounted for 1.8% of the total shares.ASSESSMENT OF SHORT-TERM BUSINESS RISKSA major share of Aspocomp’s net sales is generated by quick-turn deliveries and R&D series  and thus the company’s order book is short. The company's aim is to systematically expand its services to cover the PCB needs of customers over the entire life cycle and thereby balance out variations in demand and the order book.Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the electronics supply chainThe COVID-19 pandemic may affect the availability of parts and components required by electronic assemblers  primarily from China  which would weaken demand.Risks affecting the operating environmentThe geopolitical situation has become more unstable during the first part of the year. Russia’s war against Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia in response are not expected to have a significant direct impact on the company. Aspocomp has no business operations and no direct customers or suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. However  the changed operating environment may affect our sourcing and logistics chains.Dependence on key customersAspocomp’s customer base is concentrated; approximately half of sales are generated by five key customers. This exposes the company to significant fluctuations in demand.Market trendsAlthough Aspocomp is a marginal player in the global electronics market  changes in global PCB demand also have an impact on the company’s business. Competition for quick-turn deliveries and short production series will accelerate as the market for PCBs weakens and continues to have a negative impact on both total demand and market prices.Aspocomp’s main market area comprises Northern and Central Europe. In case Aspocomp’s clients would transfer their R&D and manufacturing out of Europe  demand for Aspocomp’s offerings might weaken significantly.PUBLICATION OF FINANCIAL RELEASES FOR 2022Aspocomp Group Plc.'s financial information publication schedule for 2022 is:Interim report January-September 2022: Thursday  November 10  2022 at around 9:00 a.m. (Finnish time)Aspocomp's silent period commences 30 days prior to the publication of its financial information.Espoo  July 20  2022ASPOCOMP GROUP PLCBoard of DirectorsSome statements in this stock exchange release are forecasts and actual results may differ materially from those stated.

The company did not hold any treasury shares.

The aggregate value of the shares exchanged was EUR 3 007 472. The shares traded at a low of EUR 5.20 and a high of EUR 6.78. The average share price was EUR 6.05. The closing price at June 30  2022 was EUR 5.86  which translates into market capitalization of EUR 40.1 million.The company had 3 804 shareholders at the end of the review period. Nominee-registered shares accounted for 1.8% of the total shares.ASSESSMENT OF SHORT-TERM BUSINESS RISKSA major share of Aspocomp’s net sales is generated by quick-turn deliveries and R&D series  and thus the company’s order book is short. The company's aim is to systematically expand its services to cover the PCB needs of customers over the entire life cycle and thereby balance out variations in demand and the order book.Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the electronics supply chainThe COVID-19 pandemic may affect the availability of parts and components required by electronic assemblers  primarily from China  which would weaken demand.Risks affecting the operating environmentThe geopolitical situation has become more unstable during the first part of the year. Russia’s war against Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia in response are not expected to have a significant direct impact on the company. Aspocomp has no business operations and no direct customers or suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. However  the changed operating environment may affect our sourcing and logistics chains.Dependence on key customersAspocomp’s customer base is concentrated; approximately half of sales are generated by five key customers. This exposes the company to significant fluctuations in demand.Market trendsAlthough Aspocomp is a marginal player in the global electronics market  changes in global PCB demand also have an impact on the company’s business. Competition for quick-turn deliveries and short production series will accelerate as the market for PCBs weakens and continues to have a negative impact on both total demand and market prices.Aspocomp’s main market area comprises Northern and Central Europe. In case Aspocomp’s clients would transfer their R&D and manufacturing out of Europe  demand for Aspocomp’s offerings might weaken significantly.PUBLICATION OF FINANCIAL RELEASES FOR 2022Aspocomp Group Plc.'s financial information publication schedule for 2022 is:Interim report January-September 2022: Thursday  November 10  2022 at around 9:00 a.m. (Finnish time)Aspocomp's silent period commences 30 days prior to the publication of its financial information.Espoo  July 20  2022ASPOCOMP GROUP PLCBoard of DirectorsSome statements in this stock exchange release are forecasts and actual results may differ materially from those stated.

REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2022 RESULTS,Almere  The Netherlands July 20  2022  6 p.m. CET ASM International N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today reports its second quarter 2022 operating results...,ASM International NVAlmere  The NetherlandsJuly 20  2022  6 p.m. CETASM International N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today reports its second quarter 2022 operating results (unaudited).Record high orders and revenue in Q2 with continued revenue growth expected for the rest of the yearFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTSEUR million Q2 2021 Q1 2022 Q2 2022 New orders 515.7 705.7 942.7 YoY change % as reported / at constant currencies 73% / 86% 72% / 65% 83% / 73% Revenue 411.7 516.9 559.5 YoY change % as reported / at constant currencies 20% / 29% 31% / 25% 36% / 30% Gross profit margin % 48.1% 47.8% 47.5% Operating result 118.4 143.0 147.6 Operating result margin % 28.7% 27.7% 26.4% Share in income of investments in associates (excluding amortization intangible assets resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013) 19.3 23.7 26.9 Amortization intangible assets (resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013) (3.0) (3.2) (3.4) Net earnings 108.4 142.5 160.4 Normalized net earnings (excluding amortization intangible assets resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013 and result from sale of ASMPT shares) 111.4 145.7 163.8Record high new orders of €943 million for the second quarter 2022 increased by 73% at constant currencies compared to the same period last year (83% as reported).Year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter 2022 was 30% at constant currencies (36% as reported).Gross profit margin of 47.5% in the second quarter 2022 was slightly lower compared to 48.1% in the same quarter last year which had a stronger mix.Operating result for the second quarter 2022 improved from €118 million last year to €148 million this year driven again by strong revenue growth  which was partly offset by an increase in operating expenses.Normalized net earnings for the second quarter 2022 were €164 million and included a translation profit of €26 million compared to a translation loss of €2 million in Q2 2021 and a translation gain of €9 million in Q1 2022.COMMENT“ASM again delivered a very strong quarter  with record high orders  revenue and results ” said Benjamin Loh  President and Chief Executive Officer of ASM International. “In the second quarter  revenue increased by 30% at constant currencies to €560 million  at the higher end of the guided range of €540-570 million  as our team  in close cooperation with suppliers and customers  demonstrated again solid execution in the face of continued difficult supply chain conditions.While parts of the semiconductor end-markets  mainly PCs and smartphones  recently slowed down impacted by weakening macro-economic trends  the overall demand for wafer fab equipment continues to be strong and broad based. Our order intake surged by 73% at constant currencies to a new record high of €943 million in Q2. Our orders were boosted by robust new node spending in the logic/foundry segment and our recent wins in memory  particularly for ALD gap-fill in 3D-NAND and continued adoption of HKMG in DRAM.R&D and SG&A further increased in Q2 as we continue to invest in the growth of our company and prepare for substantially higher expected revenue levels  evidenced by the increases in order intake. At the same time  operating profits improved by 25% and free cash flow amounted to a healthy level of €121 million in Q2.Finally  we are very excited with the recent announcement that we reached an agreement to acquire LPE  which will add another high-growth business to ASM’s portfolio.”OUTLOOKSupply chain conditions have improved at a slower pace than previously projected and  as a result  are expected to remain challenging in the third quarter. For Q3  at constant currencies  we expect revenue of €570-600 million. Supported by a record high order backlog  we still project an improvement in our sales in the second half compared to the first half. Assuming some improvement in the supply situation towards the end of the year  we expect revenue in Q4 to be higher than in Q3. As supply constraints will limit the extent of the increase in our shipments in the second half  we expect our order backlog to remain at an elevated level as we exit 2022.We remain confident to outperform the earlier communicated expectation of mid to high teens percentage increase for wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending in 2022  although it is likely that WFE growth this year will be more towards the lower end of this range due to the industry-wide supply chain constraints.AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE LPEOn July 18  2022  ASM announced an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of LPE S.p.A. (“LPE”)  a manufacturer of epitaxial reactors for silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon  based in Italy.

(Graphic: Business Wire)PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:GenSight Biologics (Paris:SIGHT) (Euronext: SIGHT  ISIN: FR0013183985  PEA-PME eligible)  a biopharma company focused on discovering and developing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders  today reported that after 5 years of follow-up  Leber Hereditary Optical Neuropathy (LHON) subjects treated with LUMEVOQ® (GS010) continued to experience significantly improved vision as a result of a one-time injection of the gene therapy treatment. Compared to the trend in vision observed among untreated patients1  the findings are a significant divergence from the natural outcomes of LHON.The data from RESTORE (CLIN06)2  the long-term follow-up study to which all participants in the RESCUE3 and REVERSE4 Phase III pivotal trials were invited  also continue to show that the treatment is well-tolerated over the 5-year follow-up period.5 years’ data on efficacy and safety shows substantial durability evidence and is more extensive than what is typically submitted in a data package for a gene therapy.When RESTORE subjects enrolled in the study 2 years after the one-time injection  they had already experienced clinically meaningful improvements relative to the lowest point (the “nadir”) of their best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA): +18.8 ETDRS letters equivalent* in their LUMEVOQ®-treated eyes and +17.3 letters equivalent in their sham-treated eyes. 5 years after treatment  the bilateral improvement from nadir was sustained  with LUMEVOQ®-treated eyes achieving a mean improvement against nadir of +22.0 letters equivalent and sham-treated eyes demonstrating a mean improvement of +19.5 letters equivalent.The impact of such results on patients is demonstrated by increases in the self-reported quality of life (QoL) scores at Year 5 vs. baseline. Mean overall QoL increased by a clinically meaningful magnitude relative to baseline  driven by increases in the sub-scores corresponding to mental health and the ability to carry out activities autonomously (e.g.  composite score  mental health  role difficulties  dependency  near and distance activities  general vision  social functioning).“The 5-year data from the RESTORE long-term extension study illustrates that the efficacy and safety data previously reported following treatment with a one-time injection of LUMEVOQ® is being maintained  providing hope to patients affected with this debilitating blinding disease” said Patrick Yu-Wai-Man  MD  PhD  Professor of Ophthalmology and Honorary Consultant Neuro-ophthalmologist at the University of Cambridge  Moorfields Eye Hospital  and the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology  United Kingdom.“The data so far showing the sustained efficacy of LUMEVOQ®  combined with a favorable safety profile  is fully consistent with clinical experts’ belief that the gene therapy’s effects will not wane after its administration” noted Magali TAIEL  MD  Chief Medical Officer of GenSight Biologics. “With even more confidence about the benefit we can deliver to patients  the GenSight team is working with full intensity to bring our therapy to patients as quickly and safely as possible.”RESTORE is a large long-term follow-up study for a rare disease treatment  with 62 subjects accepting the invitation to enroll and 55 completing the study. All subjects  who were affected by LHON caused by a mutated ND4 mitochondrial gene  were treated with an intravitreal injection of LUMEVOQ® in one eye and with sham injection in the other.Table 1. BCVA Mean Improvement Vs. Nadir* In LUMEVOQ® Long-Term Follow-Up (RESTORE)2 Years Post-Injection(Start of RESTORE) 5 Years Post-Injection4}(End of RESTORE) LogMAR (Std Error) Letters Equivalent** LogMAR (Std Error) Letters Equivalent** LUMEVOQ®-treated eyes -0.38 (0.31) +18.8 -0.44 (0.46) +22.0 Sham-treated eyes -0.35 (0.29) +17.3 -0.39 (0.36) +19.5Note: The RESTORE sample consists of the RESCUE and REVERSE participants who accepted to be followed in the long-term follow-up study. Year 5 values were the LogMAR readings nearest to 1 825 days post treatment recorded between 1 825 +/- 28 days post-treatment. Missing values were imputed using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.*Nadir = worst best-corrected visual acuity recorded from baseline to Year 5.** Assessments of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were recorded in LogMAR. The change from nadir in LogMAR was converted to “letters equivalent” improvement by multiplying the LogMAR by -50 (ref. J.T. Holladay  J Refrac Surgery  1997;13  388-391).Responder analyses at Year 5 indicate that improved BCVA was a benefit for a substantial proportion of the study participants. 71.0% of RESTORE subjects achieved Clinically Relevant Recovery (CRR)5 against nadir 5 years after treatment  and 80.7% of them had on-chart vision (BCVA ≤ 1.6 LogMAR) in one or both eyes.Safety findings at 5 years post-injection were consistent with previous readouts  which concluded that LUMEVOQ® is well-tolerated: no serious adverse events were recorded among LUMEVOQ®-treated eyes  and no discontinuations occurred due to ocular events. There were no systemic serious adverse events or discontinuations related to study treatment or study procedure.The review of the European Marketing Authorisation Application for LUMEVOQ® is ongoing  with the decision from the CHMP expected in Q3 2023 as a result of an extension granted by the EMA for GenSight’s responses to its Day 120 questions. Commercial launch will follow approval by the end of 2023.References and notes:Newman NJ  Yu-Wai-Man P  Carelli V  et al. .

Front Neurol. 2021;12:662838.About GenSight BiologicsGenSight Biologics S.A. is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on discovering and developing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders. GenSight Biologics’ pipeline leverages two core technology platforms  the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) and optogenetics  to help preserve or restore vision in patients suffering from blinding retinal diseases. GenSight Biologics’ lead product candidate  GS010  is in Phase III trials in Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)  a rare mitochondrial disease that leads to irreversible blindness in teens and young adults. Using its gene therapy-based approach  GenSight Biologics’ product candidates are designed to be administered in a single treatment to each eye by intravitreal injection to offer patients a sustainable functional visual recovery.About Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease  characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells that results in brutal and irreversible vision loss that can lead to legal blindness  and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. LHON is associated with painless  sudden loss of central vision in the 1st eye  with the 2nd eye sequentially impaired. It is a symmetric disease with poor functional visual recovery. 97% of subjects have bilateral involvement at less than one year of onset of vision loss  and in 25% of cases  vision loss occurs in both eyes simultaneously. The estimated incidence of LHON is approximately 1 200-1 500 new subjects who lose their sight every year in the United States and the European Union.About LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) targets Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) by leveraging a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) proprietary technology platform  arising from research conducted at the Institut de la Vision in Paris  which  when associated with the gene of interest  allows the platform to specifically address defects inside the mitochondria using an AAV vector (Adeno-Associated Virus). The gene of interest is transferred into the cell to be expressed and produces the functional protein  which will then be shuttled to the mitochondria through specific nucleotidic sequences in order to restore the missing or deficient mitochondrial function. “LUMEVOQ” was accepted as the invented name for GS010 (lenadogene nolparvovec) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2018.About RESCUE  REVERSE  and RESTORERESCUE and REVERSE were two separate randomized  double-masked  sham-controlled Phase III trials designed to evaluate the efficacy of a single intravitreal injection of GS010 (rAAV2/2-ND4) in subjects affected by LHON due to the G11778A mutation in the mitochondrial ND4 gene.The primary endpoint measured the difference in efficacy of GS010 in treated eyes compared to sham-treated eyes based on Best‑Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  as measured with the ETDRS at 48 weeks post-injection. The patients’ LogMAR (Logarithm of the Minimal Angle of Resolution) scores  which are derived from the number of letters patients read on the ETDRS chart  were used for statistical purposes. Both trials were adequately powered to evaluate a clinically relevant difference of at least 15 ETDRS letters between drug-treated and sham-treated eyes  adjusted to baseline.The secondary endpoints involved the application of the primary analysis to best‑seeing eyes that received GS010 compared to those receiving sham  and to worse‑seeing eyes that received GS010 compared to those that received sham. Additionally  a categorical evaluation with a responder analysis was performed  including the proportion of patients who maintained vision (< ETDRS 15L loss)  the proportion of patients who gained 15 ETDRS letters from baseline and the proportion of patients with Snellen acuity of >20/200. Complementary vision metrics included automated visual fields  optical coherence tomography  and color and contrast sensitivity  in addition to quality-of-life scales  bio‑dissemination and the time course of immune response. Readouts for these endpoints were at 48  72 and 96 weeks after injection.The trials were conducted in parallel  in 37 subjects for REVERSE and 39 subjects for RESCUE  in 7 centers across the United States  the UK  France  Germany and Italy. Week 96 results were reported in 2019 for both trials  after which all patients were invited to participate in a long-term follow-up study  RESTORE  for three additional years.The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety of intravitreal LUMEVOQ® administration up to 5 years post-treatment. The secondary objective is to assess the long-term treatment efficacy of the therapy and the quality of life (QoL) in subjects up to 5 years post-treatment. The first subject was enrolled on January 9  2018. 61 subjects have enrolled.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers:REVERSE: NCT02652780RESCUE: NCT02652767RESTORE: NCT03406104,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,mixed,0.28,0.28,0.45,True,English,"['GenSight Biologics', '5 years’ data', 'sustained efficacy', 'one-time treatment', 'safety', 'LUMEVOQ ®', 'REVERSE4 Phase III pivotal trials', 'eight retrospective natural history studies', 'central nervous system disorders', 'Leber Hereditary Optical Neuropathy', 'RESTORE long-term extension study', 'Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing', 'retinal neurodegenerative diseases', 'substantial durability evidence', 'corrected visual acuity', 'debilitating blinding disease', 'Honorary Consultant Neuro-ophthalmologist', 'Moorfields Eye Hospital', 'clinical experts’ belief', 'Chief Medical Officer', 'innovative gene therapies', 'long-term follow-up study', 'favorable safety profile', '5-year follow-up period', 'Mean overall QoL', 'LUMEVOQ®-treated Patients', 'LUMEVOQ®-treated eyes', 'natural outcomes', 'gene therapy treatment', 'RESTORE studies', 'large long-term', 'QoL) scores', 'mean improvement', '5-year data', 'LOESS) curves', 'shaded areas', 'sham injection', 'REALITY registry', 'two prospective', 'Kruskal-Wallis test', 'Repeated measures', 'Business Wire', 'Regulatory News', 'GenSight Biologics', 'biopharma company', 'one-time injection', 'significant divergence', 'meaningful improvements', 'lowest point', 'bilateral improvement', 'reported quality', 'meaningful magnitude', 'mental health', 'composite score', 'role difficulties', 'social functioning', 'Patrick Yu-Wai-Man', 'UCL Institute', 'United Kingdom', 'Magali TAIEL', 'GenSight team', 'full intensity', 'Untreated Patients', '208 ND4-LHON patients', '95% confidence interval', 'data package', 'safety data', 'vision loss', 'sham-treated eyes', 'general vision', 'untreated cohort', 'RESTORE subjects', '18.8 ETDRS letters', '+22.0 letters equivalent', 'distance activities', 'sustained efficacy', '5 years’ data', 'BCVA values', '+17.3 letters', '+19.5 letters', 'Figure', 'Evolution', 'RESCUE/REVERSE/RESTORE', '12 months', 'onset', '>60 months', 'Graphic', 'PARIS', 'ISIN', 'PEA-PME', 'GS010', 'result', 'trend', 'findings', 'CLIN06', 'participants', 'RESCUE3', 'nadir', 'impact', 'increases', 'self', 'life', 'baseline', 'sub-scores', 'dependency', 'near', 'hope', 'MD', 'PhD', 'Professor', 'Ophthalmology', 'University', 'Cambridge', 'effects', 'administration', 'benefit']",2022-07-20,2022-07-20,businesswire.com

Hyloris also plans to investigate its use for broader related indications in patients undergoing oral surgical procedures with or without bleeding disorders that would benefit from a locally-acting antifibrinolytic agent.“Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that has been used for decades intravenously to reduce or prevent postoperative bleeding in patients with bleeding problems  however  it has not been approved in a locally acting form to optimally enable coagulation following dental procedures”  said Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris. “Having a tranexamic acid oral rinse could serve the needs of more than 8 million12 US people taking a blood thinner medication. Prevention of bleeding with a convenient oral rinse would help to improve both patient experience and healthcare outcomes  allowing shorter times to discharge and preventing hospitalization.”Story continuesMr. Van Rompay continued  “HY-004 is convenient to use  both in the office and at home. We conducted a market survey that indicated that more than 80% of US based dental professionals would stock a locally acting tranexamic acid mouth rinse like this to use following relevant procedures. We see a lot of potential in this product candidate since as an oral rinse  it provides efficient local activity. We believe that the opportunity for HY-004’s potential use lies beyond tooth extraction and is not limited only to patients at risk of thromboembolic complications  which provides a very lucrative opportunity for Hyloris.”Mr. Van Rompay continued  “Based on these positive results in healthy patients that indicate our oral formulation was well-tolerated  we are planning to initiate a 12-month  400-patient  pivotal study early next year.”About HY-004Hyloris HY-004 is a proprietary reformulated oral rinse developed for use in minor surgical procedures with complications/bleedings. The formulation can be used by dental care professionals for patients on anti-coagulant therapies who benefit from the opportunity to continue their anti-coagulant treatments when scheduled for dental procedures.About Tranexamic AcidTranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that has been used for decades to reduce or prevent postoperative bleeding in patients with bleeding problems. The drug is currently approved for intravenous administration (CYKLOKAPRON® IV) in the U.S. for reduction or prevention of bleeding in patients having a high risk of intra and post-operative hemorrhage (during general and oral surgery  such as tooth extractions) due to a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia (as indicated). The drug is also approved in the U.S. as an oral tablet (LYSTEDA®) for cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding.About Hyloris PharmaceuticalsHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors. Hyloris has built a broad  patented portfolio of 14 reformulated and repurposed value-added medicines that have the potential to offer significant advantages over available alternatives.

The amendment will be signed after a mandatory five-day period during which Member States can opt out. Under this amendment  the Member States’ purchases will consist of 1.25 million doses of VLA2001 in 2022  with the option to purchase an equivalent quantity later this year for delivery in 2022. This amendment follows remediation discussions based on the EC’s notice of intent2 to terminate the initial APA for VLA2001 doses in 2022 and optional doses for 2023.The first vaccine doses will be delivered to participating EU Member States (Germany  Austria  Denmark  Finland and Bulgaria) in the coming weeks. Valneva will retain inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase and  in parallel  will aim to deploy approximately eight to ten million doses of remaining inventory into international markets. Given that VLA2001’s shelf life is expected to reach up to 24 months over time  the Company will aim to deploy these doses in the next six to twelve months.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  “We welcome the fact that the EC has decided not to terminate the APA  although we feel the order volume does not reflect the interest we see from European citizens. Despite this  we have decided to enter into this amendment to make our vaccine available to the Europeans who have been waiting for it. While the pandemic had been declining  the latest COVID-19 wave in Europe clearly underlines the need for alternative vaccines. 15% of Europeans over 18 are not yet vaccinated3 and we continue to receive messages from Europeans who are awaiting a more traditional vaccine technology. Recent market studies4 conducted in several EU member states suggest that making our inactivated vaccine available in Europe could increase vaccine uptake and have a meaningful impact on public health.”Story continuesIn light of the reduced order volume from EU member states  the Company is evaluating the COVID-19 program and associated operations. Valneva continues discussions on potential additional supply and financing agreements with various other countries around the world and will invest in further development of its current or second-generation COVID-19 vaccine only if it reaches an agreement with potential customers and receives the necessary funding over the summer.Valneva does not expect immediate cash constraints following this change in the EC order and believes that its 2022 revenues could still reach the lower end of its previously communicated guidance5 based on revenue recognition linked to the EC and UK supply contracts. In light of the amended APA  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of VLA2001 and is assessing its COVID-19 related assets with regard to any potential write-down. The Company will provide a more detailed update on its plans and financial guidance with its first half results on August 11  2022.In parallel  Valneva will continue to progress its two late-stage assets: its Lyme disease vaccine candidate  which is partnered with Pfizer and expected to enter its Phase 3 study in the third quarter of 2022  and its single-shot chikungunya vaccine candidate for which the Company expects to commence submission of the Biologics License Application with the US FDA in the second half of 2022. Valneva is also actively working to add new vaccine candidates to its clinical pipeline  both through the advancement of its preclinical assets and potential program acquisitions.VLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe6. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom7 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates8 and Kingdom of Bahrain9.About VLA2001VLA2001 is the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine which has received marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to possible purchase agreements and regulatory approval of VLA2001  timing and plans for clinical programs and product candidates and revenue forecasts.

While we are still planning to ship a record number of systems this year  increasing supply chain constraints cause delayed starts. Therefore  we are increasing the planned number of fast shipments throughout the remainder of this year in order to supply our customers with the necessary capacity expansions.""ASML expects third-quarter net sales between €5.1 billion and €5.4 billion with a gross margin between 49% and 50%. ASML expects R&D costs of around €810 million and SG&A costs of around €235 million. For the full year  we expect a revenue growth of around 10%. This growth is lower than previously guided as a result of an increase in the number of fast shipments expected in the remainder of 2022  the revenue for which will be delayed into 2023 at an amount of around €2.8 billion.

They exchange on the fundamentals of education in hospitality  the importance of purpose and authenticity when attracting young talents into the industry  and how being part of a team creates everlasting memories.The first woman and youngest person to hold the position of Dean since the creation of the school in 1893  Dr Inès Blal assumed the deanship in August 2017. Inès holds a PhD in Strategic Management in Hospitality and Tourism from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University  an MBA in Hospitality Administration from EHL  and a bachelor’s degree in International Business from the INSEEC Group. Ines describes EHL as being “at the crossroad of hospitality and education”.Ines’ message to hotel GMs around the world was clear  “make sure that you know that you have people that are passionate about the industry and everything that it brings  and make sure that you deliver to them the context and the structure  to be able to live that passion.”In the podcast  the hospitality leaders discuss the work of EHL  the highly valuable and sough-after ‘soft’ skills of the hospitality sector  and the importance of developing the incredible and unique human capital in the sector.“Our role at EHL is human development – to guide and tutor talents to help them understand what they are looking for ” explains Ines. “Every person will have their own personal intrinsic motivation  each one of them will have a purpose and we help them define their own measurement for success and to co-create their professional vision.”On the topic of Gen Z  Duncan and Ines discussed the shifting priorities and aspirations of the emerging generation as they start their professional lives. “This new generation  they really look for a purpose. If they're going to work  they want that work to mean something. And it is super inspiring. They want to work for people and businesses with authenticity  that are walking the talk.”Commenting on the episode  Duncan O’Rourke  Heart of Hospitality host and CEO Accor Northern Europe said: “Together  the hospitality sector and world-renowned hospitality and business schools  of the calibre of EHL  nurture talents. We help define professional careers  celebrate the diversity of each individual and help shape the career and impact they could each have professionally. Students from EHL are sought after by some of the biggest businesses in the world  both in and out of hospitality. This is because of the incredibly valuable  powerful and transferable skills that thrive in the hospitality sector. Lifelong ‘soft skills’  coupled with creativity  innovation  management and care  are the backbone of this sector and skills to be cherished.”Ines added: “Working in a hotel at the start of my career my colleagues and I had to deliver a banquette for 1000 people  and I was doing the service  moving between the elegant atmosphere at the dinner table and the pace of the kitchen. It was a team effort  intense  focused and sometimes so quiet because everybody was concentrating so hard on delivering the next dish perfectly. And I thought  wow  this is so exciting. I still have goosebumps thinking about it and it was 25 years ago. The collaboration  management  effort and preparation ensured a stunning result. It was just fantastic. We felt so proud about delivering that service in such intense circumstances. And for me  that's the summary of hospitality – togetherness  you truly feel that you are part of something.”The Heart of Hospitality podcast is part of a pan-European industry platform of the same name  built to tell stories of the sector and its people.

7952,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://theaccidentalsuccessfulcio.com/technology-2/european-cios-come-under-fire-when-their-systems-fail,European CIOs Come Under Fire When Their Systems Fail,European stock exchange CIOs have had a series of outages that have halted stock trading and are now thinking about creating a consolidated tapeThe post European CIOs Come Under Fire When Their Systems Fail appeared first on The Accidental Successful CIO.,If you're new here  you may want to subscribe to my RSS feed. Thanks for visiting!When a stock trading system goes down  CIOs get involvedImage Credit: Stock CatalogThe one thing that stock traders want to be able to do is to trade their stocks. However  if the IT systems that they use to make this happen have a fault or an outage  then all of a sudden something that is normally always there can vanish instantly. When this happens  down lost time means money lost for stock traders. The person that they are going to be holding responsible for their losses will be the CIO who is in charge of the systems that they use. This was recently a big problem. What are CIOs to do to prevent events like this?The Day Stocks Couldn’t Be TradedInvestors in Europe learned the hard way that the key structural differences between some of the region’s main stock exchanges and their U.S. counterparts put them at a costly disadvantage when it comes to trading stocks. Technical glitches halted trading on two separate occasions highlighting the importance of information technology and risking potential losses for investors that trade stocks on five of the six European marketplaces owned by Euronext  including those in Paris  Amsterdam and Lisbon. The breakdown bolstered arguments by the people in the CIO position that Europe should follow U.S. practices and introduce a consolidated tape. This is an electronic system that collates real-time prices for stocks that trade on different marketplaces simultaneously.Trading activity in stocks normally spikes at the end of the day. When the closing auction failed it didn’t. Such a system would have allowed investors to continue trading stocks on alternative venues – including Cboe Global Markets’s Europe-based marketplace  the London Stock Exchange’s majority owned Turquoise trading facility  and Aquis Exchange – despite the Euronext glitches. This is because the consolidated-tape prices would serve as a reference for investors to trade stocks on different marketplaces. Instead  what happened is that when Euronext’s exchanges went down investors struggled to trade even the biggest corporate names such as Paris-listed luxury-goods giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton or Amsterdam-listed Just Eat Takeaway.com  a big food-delivery company  because pricing was unavailable or difficult to access.A breakdown in Euronext’s platform risks disrupting trading across an increasing number of Europe’s exchanges given the pan-European operator is in the process of acquiring the Italian exchange from the LSE for about $5.1 billion. That deal would expand the number of trading venues it owns to seven. The consolidated tape would save investors billions of euros  provide better investment outcomes for investors and promote greater competition and resilience among trading venues.Change Is Required To Prevent Future ProblemsThe person with the Euronext CIO job defends its technology. He says that that its Optiq trading platform has demonstrated reliability since its implementation in 2018. The trading disruption is one of two technical breakdowns involving a key part of Europe’s financial plumbing. A previous software glitch disrupted the European bloc’s main wholesale payment system  which prevented banks from processing transactions and securities trades for almost 11 hours. The European Central Bank CIO said Wednesday they have taken steps to avoid a repeat of the disruption.If investors and their brokers in Europe wanted to avoid future outages  they would be required to subscribe to stock quotes from multiple trading venues to replicate a consolidated tape. The problem with this solution is that this solution is costly  inexact  and raises the risk of missing out on the full view of available stock prices. That structure showed its flaws when Euronext halted trading for a few hours on most of its venues because of a software glitch. Many investors struggled to access alternative venues during this time to complete their transactions.A consolidated tape helps to overcome the challenges by offering investors one source for real-time quotes that would allow them to switch between marketplaces to trade a stock if one venue went down. In the U.S.  a consolidated tape protected investors when trading on the New York Stock Exchange froze for almost four hours. All of the other exchanges were able to keep trading and no one really noticed. Euronext’s technical challenges also highlight the relative risks of trading in Europe as an increasing number of orders are executed during a narrow window at the end of the trading day. A heavier reliance on closing auctions on at least some exchanges in Europe suggests the fallout from any trading disruption would be more severe by canceling a greater number of trades.What All Of This Means For YouThe CIOs who run the firms that provide the data that people who trade stocks are always under a great deal of pressure. The systems that these CIOs are in charge of are used every day  all day long  by people to make money. If one of their systems experiences an outage  then all of a sudden nobody is making any money. Preventing outages is one of the key jobs of these types of CIOs.The one thing that the European stock exchange CIOs don’t want to have happen is an outage. Yet  that is what they recently experienced. Problems with the software that allows stocks to be traded has experienced issues twice in recent history. The volume of trading that is being done generally goes up at the end of the day. However  during the outages this did not happen because investors did not have the information that they needed in order to make trades. As the European stock trading systems become more and more intertwined  the impact of an outage grows larger and larger. Investors think that they know what the solution to their problem is: a consolidated tape. This does not currently exist  but European CIOs need to think about creating one.“Mission critical” is a phrase that many CIOs like to use when referring to their most valuable system. The European stock exchange CIOs know that just about all of their systems can be considered to be mission critical. Although there is probably no way to prevent any of them from ever going down  it sure seems like having a backup plan like a consolidated tape might be a good idea. We’ll have to see what these CIO’s next steps are…– Dr. Jim Anderson Blue Elephant Consulting –Your Source For Real World IT Department Leadership Skills™Question For You: If the European stock exchange CIOs don’t decide to create a consolidated tape  what should they do instead?P.S.: Free subscriptions to The Accidental Successful CIO Newsletter are now available.

You are the one who is responsible for securing the companies network  you have to roll out new servers and storage  and you have to worry about getting everyone to reset their passwords every 90 days.

Growth at constant exchange rates is slightly down at -1%  reflecting an upturn in the Brazilian real over the period. The average EUR/BRL exchange rate is 5.55 in H1 2022 compared to 6.49 in H1 2021.In the first half of 2022 production is 1.3 TWh  compared to 1.6 TWh in H1 2021  reflecting the drop in wind and solar resources.Q2 2022 revenues from Energy sales amount to €52.6 million  up +8% at current exchange rates (-3% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q2 2021.Quarterly production is 0.6 TWh compared to 0.8 TWh in 2021 and installed capacity in operation is 1 226 MW at end of June 2022 (-3%).Production by country:In Brazil production decreases by -30% due to the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 power plants (which had started their production in the first half of 2021) and less favourable wind conditions than a year ago and well below the long-term resource average. The volume loss was almost entirely offset by a favourable exchange rate effect (strengthening of the Brazilian currency) and by the contractual clauses indexing sale prices to inflation.In France production is down -5% during the second quarter  mainly due to the wind plants; it benefited from the production of solar and biomass plants commissioned in 2021 (Laspeyres  Cabanon and Cacao).In other countries  Voltalia's production is growing overall  multiplied by x3.3 in Greece  benefiting from the commissioning of the new Stavria solar plant  up +89% in Spain  +47% in Belgium and +37% in Portugal  due to the strong growth in Helexia's production over the period.

The analysis by segment shows a strong general progression of the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment:The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posts revenues of €87 million  up +41% (+38% at constant exchange rates). During the quarter  Development revenues are up due to the sale of projects under development to third-party clients  while Construction records strong growth in third-party client revenues in the UK  Portugal and Kenya; and Equipment Procurement to third-party customers posts sustained growth particularly in Portugal  but also in the UK and Italy. Revenues for third-party clients increase by +53%  while internal revenues increase by +24%.Revenues of the Operation & Maintenance segment amount to €7.3 million  almost identical to those of Q2 2021 (down -4% at constant exchange rates). Third-party clients make up 61% of the segment’s revenues.H1 and Q2 2022 revenue eliminations amount to respectively €48.4 million euros (+35% at current exchange rates and +32% at constant exchange rates) and €36 million (+20% at current exchange rates and +17% at constant exchange rates)  reflecting the growth of Services sold internally in Q2 2022  to the benefit of power plants under construction and in operation owned by Voltalia.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SELECTED)117 MW of solar sites awarded in Morocco6Voltalia was awarded the largest volume with 117 MW out of a total of 400 MW offered  spread over two sites: Ain Beni Mathar (69 MW) and Guercif (48 MW). These two solar sites located in the Oriental will cover the energy needs equivalent to the annual consumption of 290 000 inhabitants. Construction is scheduled to start at the end of 2023. Revenues will be guaranteed by long-term electricity sales contracts  to be concluded with private customers connected to the public electricity grid.Voltalia closed with success its second employee share holding plan7For this second edition  seven countries  or 88% of employees  were eligible: France  Portugal  Brazil  Greece  Italy  Spain and the United Kingdom. In total  72% of eligible employees decided to participate (compared to 69.5% in the first plan). This second employee shareholding plan aims to make employee shareholding a sustainable lever for aligning the interests of all stakeholders and building employee loyalty. Through this plan  Voltalia has placed the commitment of its teams at the heart of its concerns and has allowed them to express their confidence in the company  both in its social role and in its operational objectives and financial performance.Voltalia is now part of the Euronext Tech Leaders8Euronext Tech Leaders is composed of 100+ high-growth and leading companies  each meeting a specific set of criteria to qualify.
