Aspocomp estimates that its net sales for 2022 will increase and its operating result for 2022 will improve clearly from 2021. In 2021  net sales amounted to EUR 33.2 million and the operating result to EUR 2.2 million.In its previous outlook for 2022 (Interim Report for January 1-March 31  2022  on April 26  2022)  Aspocomp estimated that its net sales for 2022 will increase and its operating result for 2022 will improve from 2021.

The Telecommunication segment also saw brisk growth  up 50 percent  and its net sales reached EUR 1.5 million. The Industrial Electronics segment clearly slowed down and its net sales fell by 50 percent to EUR 1.0 million.New orders valued at EUR 9.6 million were received and the order book increased to EUR 20.5 million. Growth in the order book was particularly supported by increased demand in the Semiconductor Industry customer segment.

The improvement in operating result in the second quarter was mainly due to the increase in net sales and the improved product mix focusing on more technologically demanding PCBs. The operating result for the first half of the year amounted to EUR 2.4 million and the operating result percentage rose to 13 percent.Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia have no direct impact on Aspocomp’s business.

The company did not hold any treasury shares. Each share is of the same share series and entitles its holder to one vote at a General Meeting and to have an identical dividend right.A total of 497 250 Aspocomp Group Plc. shares were traded on Nasdaq Helsinki during the period from January 1 to June 30  2022. The aggregate value of the shares exchanged was EUR 3 007 472. The shares traded at a low of EUR 5.20 and a high of EUR 6.78. The average share price was EUR 6.05. The closing price at June 30  2022 was EUR 5.86  which translates into market capitalization of EUR 40.1 million.The company had 3 804 shareholders at the end of the review period. Nominee-registered shares accounted for 1.8% of the total shares.ASSESSMENT OF SHORT-TERM BUSINESS RISKSA major share of Aspocomp’s net sales is generated by quick-turn deliveries and R&D series  and thus the company’s order book is short. The company's aim is to systematically expand its services to cover the PCB needs of customers over the entire life cycle and thereby balance out variations in demand and the order book.Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the electronics supply chainThe COVID-19 pandemic may affect the availability of parts and components required by electronic assemblers  primarily from China  which would weaken demand.Risks affecting the operating environmentThe geopolitical situation has become more unstable during the first part of the year. Russia’s war against Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia in response are not expected to have a significant direct impact on the company. Aspocomp has no business operations and no direct customers or suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. However  the changed operating environment may affect our sourcing and logistics chains.Dependence on key customersAspocomp’s customer base is concentrated; approximately half of sales are generated by five key customers. This exposes the company to significant fluctuations in demand.Market trendsAlthough Aspocomp is a marginal player in the global electronics market  changes in global PCB demand also have an impact on the company’s business. Competition for quick-turn deliveries and short production series will accelerate as the market for PCBs weakens and continues to have a negative impact on both total demand and market prices.Aspocomp’s main market area comprises Northern and Central Europe. In case Aspocomp’s clients would transfer their R&D and manufacturing out of Europe  demand for Aspocomp’s offerings might weaken significantly.PUBLICATION OF FINANCIAL RELEASES FOR 2022Aspocomp Group Plc.'s financial information publication schedule for 2022 is:Interim report January-September 2022: Thursday  November 10  2022 at around 9:00 a.m. (Finnish time)Aspocomp's silent period commences 30 days prior to the publication of its financial information.Espoo  July 20  2022ASPOCOMP GROUP PLCBoard of DirectorsSome statements in this stock exchange release are forecasts and actual results may differ materially from those stated.

The company has continued its investments to increase capacity in line with its strategy  but the installation of equipment has been slowed down in part due to delays in material and component deliveries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The investments were mainly focused on upgrading the capacity of the Oulu plant  improving automation  and increasing production efficiency.In 2017  Aspocomp launched an investment program amounting to a total of EUR 10 million to further strengthen its position as a strategic partner to leading companies in the semiconductor  automotive  defense and aerospace  and telecommunications (5G) industries.

The company did not hold any treasury shares. Each share is of the same share series and entitles its holder to one vote at a General Meeting and to have an identical dividend right.A total of 497 250 Aspocomp Group Plc. shares were traded on Nasdaq Helsinki during the period from January 1 to June 30  2022. The aggregate value of the shares exchanged was EUR 3 007 472. The shares traded at a low of EUR 5.20 and a high of EUR 6.78. The average share price was EUR 6.05. The closing price at June 30  2022 was EUR 5.86  which translates into market capitalization of EUR 40.1 million.The company had 3 804 shareholders at the end of the review period. Nominee-registered shares accounted for 1.8% of the total shares.ASSESSMENT OF SHORT-TERM BUSINESS RISKSA major share of Aspocomp’s net sales is generated by quick-turn deliveries and R&D series  and thus the company’s order book is short. The company's aim is to systematically expand its services to cover the PCB needs of customers over the entire life cycle and thereby balance out variations in demand and the order book.Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the electronics supply chainThe COVID-19 pandemic may affect the availability of parts and components required by electronic assemblers  primarily from China  which would weaken demand.Risks affecting the operating environmentThe geopolitical situation has become more unstable during the first part of the year. Russia’s war against Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia in response are not expected to have a significant direct impact on the company. Aspocomp has no business operations and no direct customers or suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. However  the changed operating environment may affect our sourcing and logistics chains.Dependence on key customersAspocomp’s customer base is concentrated; approximately half of sales are generated by five key customers. This exposes the company to significant fluctuations in demand.Market trendsAlthough Aspocomp is a marginal player in the global electronics market  changes in global PCB demand also have an impact on the company’s business. Competition for quick-turn deliveries and short production series will accelerate as the market for PCBs weakens and continues to have a negative impact on both total demand and market prices.Aspocomp’s main market area comprises Northern and Central Europe. In case Aspocomp’s clients would transfer their R&D and manufacturing out of Europe  demand for Aspocomp’s offerings might weaken significantly.PUBLICATION OF FINANCIAL RELEASES FOR 2022Aspocomp Group Plc.'s financial information publication schedule for 2022 is:Interim report January-September 2022: Thursday  November 10  2022 at around 9:00 a.m. (Finnish time)Aspocomp's silent period commences 30 days prior to the publication of its financial information.Espoo  July 20  2022ASPOCOMP GROUP PLCBoard of DirectorsSome statements in this stock exchange release are forecasts and actual results may differ materially from those stated.

REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2022 RESULTS,Almere  The Netherlands July 20  2022  6 p.m. CET ASM International N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today reports its second quarter 2022 operating results...,ASM International NVAlmere  The NetherlandsJuly 20  2022  6 p.m. CETASM International N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today reports its second quarter 2022 operating results (unaudited).Record high orders and revenue in Q2 with continued revenue growth expected for the rest of the yearFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTSEUR million Q2 2021 Q1 2022 Q2 2022 New orders 515.7 705.7 942.7 YoY change % as reported / at constant currencies 73% / 86% 72% / 65% 83% / 73% Revenue 411.7 516.9 559.5 YoY change % as reported / at constant currencies 20% / 29% 31% / 25% 36% / 30% Gross profit margin % 48.1% 47.8% 47.5% Operating result 118.4 143.0 147.6 Operating result margin % 28.7% 27.7% 26.4% Share in income of investments in associates (excluding amortization intangible assets resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013) 19.3 23.7 26.9 Amortization intangible assets (resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013) (3.0) (3.2) (3.4) Net earnings 108.4 142.5 160.4 Normalized net earnings (excluding amortization intangible assets resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013 and result from sale of ASMPT shares) 111.4 145.7 163.8Record high new orders of €943 million for the second quarter 2022 increased by 73% at constant currencies compared to the same period last year (83% as reported).Year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter 2022 was 30% at constant currencies (36% as reported).Gross profit margin of 47.5% in the second quarter 2022 was slightly lower compared to 48.1% in the same quarter last year which had a stronger mix.Operating result for the second quarter 2022 improved from €118 million last year to €148 million this year driven again by strong revenue growth  which was partly offset by an increase in operating expenses.Normalized net earnings for the second quarter 2022 were €164 million and included a translation profit of €26 million compared to a translation loss of €2 million in Q2 2021 and a translation gain of €9 million in Q1 2022.COMMENT“ASM again delivered a very strong quarter  with record high orders  revenue and results ” said Benjamin Loh  President and Chief Executive Officer of ASM International. “In the second quarter  revenue increased by 30% at constant currencies to €560 million  at the higher end of the guided range of €540-570 million  as our team  in close cooperation with suppliers and customers  demonstrated again solid execution in the face of continued difficult supply chain conditions.While parts of the semiconductor end-markets  mainly PCs and smartphones  recently slowed down impacted by weakening macro-economic trends  the overall demand for wafer fab equipment continues to be strong and broad based. Our order intake surged by 73% at constant currencies to a new record high of €943 million in Q2. Our orders were boosted by robust new node spending in the logic/foundry segment and our recent wins in memory  particularly for ALD gap-fill in 3D-NAND and continued adoption of HKMG in DRAM.R&D and SG&A further increased in Q2 as we continue to invest in the growth of our company and prepare for substantially higher expected revenue levels  evidenced by the increases in order intake. At the same time  operating profits improved by 25% and free cash flow amounted to a healthy level of €121 million in Q2.Finally  we are very excited with the recent announcement that we reached an agreement to acquire LPE  which will add another high-growth business to ASM’s portfolio.”OUTLOOKSupply chain conditions have improved at a slower pace than previously projected and  as a result  are expected to remain challenging in the third quarter. For Q3  at constant currencies  we expect revenue of €570-600 million. Supported by a record high order backlog  we still project an improvement in our sales in the second half compared to the first half. Assuming some improvement in the supply situation towards the end of the year  we expect revenue in Q4 to be higher than in Q3. As supply constraints will limit the extent of the increase in our shipments in the second half  we expect our order backlog to remain at an elevated level as we exit 2022.We remain confident to outperform the earlier communicated expectation of mid to high teens percentage increase for wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending in 2022  although it is likely that WFE growth this year will be more towards the lower end of this range due to the industry-wide supply chain constraints.AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE LPEOn July 18  2022  ASM announced an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of LPE S.p.A.

(Graphic: Business Wire)PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:GenSight Biologics (Paris:SIGHT) (Euronext: SIGHT  ISIN: FR0013183985  PEA-PME eligible)  a biopharma company focused on discovering and developing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders  today reported that after 5 years of follow-up  Leber Hereditary Optical Neuropathy (LHON) subjects treated with LUMEVOQ® (GS010) continued to experience significantly improved vision as a result of a one-time injection of the gene therapy treatment. Compared to the trend in vision observed among untreated patients1  the findings are a significant divergence from the natural outcomes of LHON.The data from RESTORE (CLIN06)2  the long-term follow-up study to which all participants in the RESCUE3 and REVERSE4 Phase III pivotal trials were invited  also continue to show that the treatment is well-tolerated over the 5-year follow-up period.5 years’ data on efficacy and safety shows substantial durability evidence and is more extensive than what is typically submitted in a data package for a gene therapy.When RESTORE subjects enrolled in the study 2 years after the one-time injection  they had already experienced clinically meaningful improvements relative to the lowest point (the “nadir”) of their best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA): +18.8 ETDRS letters equivalent* in their LUMEVOQ®-treated eyes and +17.3 letters equivalent in their sham-treated eyes. 5 years after treatment  the bilateral improvement from nadir was sustained  with LUMEVOQ®-treated eyes achieving a mean improvement against nadir of +22.0 letters equivalent and sham-treated eyes demonstrating a mean improvement of +19.5 letters equivalent.The impact of such results on patients is demonstrated by increases in the self-reported quality of life (QoL) scores at Year 5 vs. baseline. Mean overall QoL increased by a clinically meaningful magnitude relative to baseline  driven by increases in the sub-scores corresponding to mental health and the ability to carry out activities autonomously (e.g.  composite score  mental health  role difficulties  dependency  near and distance activities  general vision  social functioning).“The 5-year data from the RESTORE long-term extension study illustrates that the efficacy and safety data previously reported following treatment with a one-time injection of LUMEVOQ® is being maintained  providing hope to patients affected with this debilitating blinding disease” said Patrick Yu-Wai-Man  MD  PhD  Professor of Ophthalmology and Honorary Consultant Neuro-ophthalmologist at the University of Cambridge  Moorfields Eye Hospital  and the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology  United Kingdom.“The data so far showing the sustained efficacy of LUMEVOQ®  combined with a favorable safety profile  is fully consistent with clinical experts’ belief that the gene therapy’s effects will not wane after its administration” noted Magali TAIEL  MD  Chief Medical Officer of GenSight Biologics. “With even more confidence about the benefit we can deliver to patients  the GenSight team is working with full intensity to bring our therapy to patients as quickly and safely as possible.”RESTORE is a large long-term follow-up study for a rare disease treatment  with 62 subjects accepting the invitation to enroll and 55 completing the study. All subjects  who were affected by LHON caused by a mutated ND4 mitochondrial gene  were treated with an intravitreal injection of LUMEVOQ® in one eye and with sham injection in the other.Table 1. BCVA Mean Improvement Vs. Nadir* In LUMEVOQ® Long-Term Follow-Up (RESTORE)2 Years Post-Injection(Start of RESTORE) 5 Years Post-Injection4}(End of RESTORE) LogMAR (Std Error) Letters Equivalent** LogMAR (Std Error) Letters Equivalent** LUMEVOQ®-treated eyes -0.38 (0.31) +18.8 -0.44 (0.46) +22.0 Sham-treated eyes -0.35 (0.29) +17.3 -0.39 (0.36) +19.5Note: The RESTORE sample consists of the RESCUE and REVERSE participants who accepted to be followed in the long-term follow-up study. Year 5 values were the LogMAR readings nearest to 1 825 days post treatment recorded between 1 825 +/- 28 days post-treatment. Missing values were imputed using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.*Nadir = worst best-corrected visual acuity recorded from baseline to Year 5.** Assessments of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were recorded in LogMAR. The change from nadir in LogMAR was converted to “letters equivalent” improvement by multiplying the LogMAR by -50 (ref. J.T. Holladay  J Refrac Surgery  1997;13  388-391).Responder analyses at Year 5 indicate that improved BCVA was a benefit for a substantial proportion of the study participants. 71.0% of RESTORE subjects achieved Clinically Relevant Recovery (CRR)5 against nadir 5 years after treatment  and 80.7% of them had on-chart vision (BCVA ≤ 1.6 LogMAR) in one or both eyes.Safety findings at 5 years post-injection were consistent with previous readouts  which concluded that LUMEVOQ® is well-tolerated: no serious adverse events were recorded among LUMEVOQ®-treated eyes  and no discontinuations occurred due to ocular events. There were no systemic serious adverse events or discontinuations related to study treatment or study procedure.The review of the European Marketing Authorisation Application for LUMEVOQ® is ongoing  with the decision from the CHMP expected in Q3 2023 as a result of an extension granted by the EMA for GenSight’s responses to its Day 120 questions. Commercial launch will follow approval by the end of 2023.References and notes:Newman NJ  Yu-Wai-Man P  Carelli V  et al. .

Front Neurol. 2021;12:662838.About GenSight BiologicsGenSight Biologics S.A. is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on discovering and developing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders. GenSight Biologics’ pipeline leverages two core technology platforms  the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) and optogenetics  to help preserve or restore vision in patients suffering from blinding retinal diseases. GenSight Biologics’ lead product candidate  GS010  is in Phase III trials in Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)  a rare mitochondrial disease that leads to irreversible blindness in teens and young adults. Using its gene therapy-based approach  GenSight Biologics’ product candidates are designed to be administered in a single treatment to each eye by intravitreal injection to offer patients a sustainable functional visual recovery.About Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease  characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells that results in brutal and irreversible vision loss that can lead to legal blindness  and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. LHON is associated with painless  sudden loss of central vision in the 1st eye  with the 2nd eye sequentially impaired. It is a symmetric disease with poor functional visual recovery. 97% of subjects have bilateral involvement at less than one year of onset of vision loss  and in 25% of cases  vision loss occurs in both eyes simultaneously. The estimated incidence of LHON is approximately 1 200-1 500 new subjects who lose their sight every year in the United States and the European Union.About LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) targets Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) by leveraging a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) proprietary technology platform  arising from research conducted at the Institut de la Vision in Paris  which  when associated with the gene of interest  allows the platform to specifically address defects inside the mitochondria using an AAV vector (Adeno-Associated Virus). The gene of interest is transferred into the cell to be expressed and produces the functional protein  which will then be shuttled to the mitochondria through specific nucleotidic sequences in order to restore the missing or deficient mitochondrial function. “LUMEVOQ” was accepted as the invented name for GS010 (lenadogene nolparvovec) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2018.About RESCUE  REVERSE  and RESTORERESCUE and REVERSE were two separate randomized  double-masked  sham-controlled Phase III trials designed to evaluate the efficacy of a single intravitreal injection of GS010 (rAAV2/2-ND4) in subjects affected by LHON due to the G11778A mutation in the mitochondrial ND4 gene.The primary endpoint measured the difference in efficacy of GS010 in treated eyes compared to sham-treated eyes based on Best‑Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  as measured with the ETDRS at 48 weeks post-injection. The patients’ LogMAR (Logarithm of the Minimal Angle of Resolution) scores  which are derived from the number of letters patients read on the ETDRS chart  were used for statistical purposes. Both trials were adequately powered to evaluate a clinically relevant difference of at least 15 ETDRS letters between drug-treated and sham-treated eyes  adjusted to baseline.The secondary endpoints involved the application of the primary analysis to best‑seeing eyes that received GS010 compared to those receiving sham  and to worse‑seeing eyes that received GS010 compared to those that received sham. Additionally  a categorical evaluation with a responder analysis was performed  including the proportion of patients who maintained vision (< ETDRS 15L loss)  the proportion of patients who gained 15 ETDRS letters from baseline and the proportion of patients with Snellen acuity of >20/200. Complementary vision metrics included automated visual fields  optical coherence tomography  and color and contrast sensitivity  in addition to quality-of-life scales  bio‑dissemination and the time course of immune response. Readouts for these endpoints were at 48  72 and 96 weeks after injection.The trials were conducted in parallel  in 37 subjects for REVERSE and 39 subjects for RESCUE  in 7 centers across the United States  the UK  France  Germany and Italy. Week 96 results were reported in 2019 for both trials  after which all patients were invited to participate in a long-term follow-up study  RESTORE  for three additional years.The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety of intravitreal LUMEVOQ® administration up to 5 years post-treatment. The secondary objective is to assess the long-term treatment efficacy of the therapy and the quality of life (QoL) in subjects up to 5 years post-treatment.

HY-004 is being developed for use in patients on anti-coagulant therapies that are undergoing dental procedures with the potential for complications/bleeding. The study results showed that HY-004 was found to be well-tolerated under varied conditions with no serious adverse events following tooth extraction  while effectively controlling procedural bleeding without delaying clot formation. Hyloris also plans to investigate its use for broader related indications in patients undergoing oral surgical procedures with or without bleeding disorders that would benefit from a locally-acting antifibrinolytic agent.“Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that has been used for decades intravenously to reduce or prevent postoperative bleeding in patients with bleeding problems  however  it has not been approved in a locally acting form to optimally enable coagulation following dental procedures”  said Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris. “Having a tranexamic acid oral rinse could serve the needs of more than 8 million12 US people taking a blood thinner medication. Prevention of bleeding with a convenient oral rinse would help to improve both patient experience and healthcare outcomes  allowing shorter times to discharge and preventing hospitalization.”Story continuesMr. Van Rompay continued  “HY-004 is convenient to use  both in the office and at home. We conducted a market survey that indicated that more than 80% of US based dental professionals would stock a locally acting tranexamic acid mouth rinse like this to use following relevant procedures. We see a lot of potential in this product candidate since as an oral rinse  it provides efficient local activity. We believe that the opportunity for HY-004’s potential use lies beyond tooth extraction and is not limited only to patients at risk of thromboembolic complications  which provides a very lucrative opportunity for Hyloris.”Mr. Van Rompay continued  “Based on these positive results in healthy patients that indicate our oral formulation was well-tolerated  we are planning to initiate a 12-month  400-patient  pivotal study early next year.”About HY-004Hyloris HY-004 is a proprietary reformulated oral rinse developed for use in minor surgical procedures with complications/bleedings. The formulation can be used by dental care professionals for patients on anti-coagulant therapies who benefit from the opportunity to continue their anti-coagulant treatments when scheduled for dental procedures.About Tranexamic AcidTranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that has been used for decades to reduce or prevent postoperative bleeding in patients with bleeding problems. The drug is currently approved for intravenous administration (CYKLOKAPRON® IV) in the U.S. for reduction or prevention of bleeding in patients having a high risk of intra and post-operative hemorrhage (during general and oral surgery  such as tooth extractions) due to a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia (as indicated). The drug is also approved in the U.S. as an oral tablet (LYSTEDA®) for cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding.About Hyloris PharmaceuticalsHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors. Hyloris has built a broad  patented portfolio of 14 reformulated and repurposed value-added medicines that have the potential to offer significant advantages over available alternatives. Outside of its core strategic focus  the Company also has 4 high barrier generic products in development. Two products are currently in initial phases of commercialization with partners: Sotalol IV for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and Maxigesic® IV  a non-opioid post-operative pain treatment. The Company’s development strategy primarily focuses on the FDA’s 505(b)2 regulatory pathway  which is specifically designed for pharmaceuticals for which safety and efficacy of the molecule have already been established.

The amendment will be signed after a mandatory five-day period during which Member States can opt out. Under this amendment  the Member States’ purchases will consist of 1.25 million doses of VLA2001 in 2022  with the option to purchase an equivalent quantity later this year for delivery in 2022. This amendment follows remediation discussions based on the EC’s notice of intent2 to terminate the initial APA for VLA2001 doses in 2022 and optional doses for 2023.The first vaccine doses will be delivered to participating EU Member States (Germany  Austria  Denmark  Finland and Bulgaria) in the coming weeks. Valneva will retain inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase and  in parallel  will aim to deploy approximately eight to ten million doses of remaining inventory into international markets. Given that VLA2001’s shelf life is expected to reach up to 24 months over time  the Company will aim to deploy these doses in the next six to twelve months.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  “We welcome the fact that the EC has decided not to terminate the APA  although we feel the order volume does not reflect the interest we see from European citizens. Despite this  we have decided to enter into this amendment to make our vaccine available to the Europeans who have been waiting for it. While the pandemic had been declining  the latest COVID-19 wave in Europe clearly underlines the need for alternative vaccines. 15% of Europeans over 18 are not yet vaccinated3 and we continue to receive messages from Europeans who are awaiting a more traditional vaccine technology. Recent market studies4 conducted in several EU member states suggest that making our inactivated vaccine available in Europe could increase vaccine uptake and have a meaningful impact on public health.”Story continuesIn light of the reduced order volume from EU member states  the Company is evaluating the COVID-19 program and associated operations. Valneva continues discussions on potential additional supply and financing agreements with various other countries around the world and will invest in further development of its current or second-generation COVID-19 vaccine only if it reaches an agreement with potential customers and receives the necessary funding over the summer.Valneva does not expect immediate cash constraints following this change in the EC order and believes that its 2022 revenues could still reach the lower end of its previously communicated guidance5 based on revenue recognition linked to the EC and UK supply contracts. In light of the amended APA  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of VLA2001 and is assessing its COVID-19 related assets with regard to any potential write-down. The Company will provide a more detailed update on its plans and financial guidance with its first half results on August 11  2022.In parallel  Valneva will continue to progress its two late-stage assets: its Lyme disease vaccine candidate  which is partnered with Pfizer and expected to enter its Phase 3 study in the third quarter of 2022  and its single-shot chikungunya vaccine candidate for which the Company expects to commence submission of the Biologics License Application with the US FDA in the second half of 2022. Valneva is also actively working to add new vaccine candidates to its clinical pipeline  both through the advancement of its preclinical assets and potential program acquisitions.VLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe6. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom7 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates8 and Kingdom of Bahrain9.About VLA2001VLA2001 is the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine which has received marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein.

While we are still planning to ship a record number of systems this year  increasing supply chain constraints cause delayed starts. Therefore  we are increasing the planned number of fast shipments throughout the remainder of this year in order to supply our customers with the necessary capacity expansions.""ASML expects third-quarter net sales between €5.1 billion and €5.4 billion with a gross margin between 49% and 50%. ASML expects R&D costs of around €810 million and SG&A costs of around €235 million. For the full year  we expect a revenue growth of around 10%. This growth is lower than previously guided as a result of an increase in the number of fast shipments expected in the remainder of 2022  the revenue for which will be delayed into 2023 at an amount of around €2.8 billion. With the combination of this delayed revenue recognition  the extra costs related to the planned increase in output capacity and certain inflationary trends  we expect the full year 2022 gross margin to be between 49% and 50% "" said ASML President and Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink.Products and business highlightsIn our DUV business  we shipped the first NXT KrF system – the TWINSCAN NXT:870 – to a customer. With a 27% increase in throughput capability  we take a major step in responding to the industry’s demand for KrF tools and wafer output. The NXT platform provides opportunities to further increase productivity.In our Applications business  we completed the first eScan1100 multi-beam system installation at a customer site and are currently starting customer evaluation.In our EUV High-NA business  we received both the first High-NA mechanical projection optics and illuminator as well as the new wafer stage from suppliers.

They exchange on the fundamentals of education in hospitality  the importance of purpose and authenticity when attracting young talents into the industry  and how being part of a team creates everlasting memories.The first woman and youngest person to hold the position of Dean since the creation of the school in 1893  Dr Inès Blal assumed the deanship in August 2017. Inès holds a PhD in Strategic Management in Hospitality and Tourism from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University  an MBA in Hospitality Administration from EHL  and a bachelor’s degree in International Business from the INSEEC Group. Ines describes EHL as being “at the crossroad of hospitality and education”.Ines’ message to hotel GMs around the world was clear  “make sure that you know that you have people that are passionate about the industry and everything that it brings  and make sure that you deliver to them the context and the structure  to be able to live that passion.”In the podcast  the hospitality leaders discuss the work of EHL  the highly valuable and sough-after ‘soft’ skills of the hospitality sector  and the importance of developing the incredible and unique human capital in the sector.“Our role at EHL is human development – to guide and tutor talents to help them understand what they are looking for ” explains Ines. “Every person will have their own personal intrinsic motivation  each one of them will have a purpose and we help them define their own measurement for success and to co-create their professional vision.”On the topic of Gen Z  Duncan and Ines discussed the shifting priorities and aspirations of the emerging generation as they start their professional lives. “This new generation  they really look for a purpose. If they're going to work  they want that work to mean something. And it is super inspiring. They want to work for people and businesses with authenticity  that are walking the talk.”Commenting on the episode  Duncan O’Rourke  Heart of Hospitality host and CEO Accor Northern Europe said: “Together  the hospitality sector and world-renowned hospitality and business schools  of the calibre of EHL  nurture talents. We help define professional careers  celebrate the diversity of each individual and help shape the career and impact they could each have professionally. Students from EHL are sought after by some of the biggest businesses in the world  both in and out of hospitality. This is because of the incredibly valuable  powerful and transferable skills that thrive in the hospitality sector. Lifelong ‘soft skills’  coupled with creativity  innovation  management and care  are the backbone of this sector and skills to be cherished.”Ines added: “Working in a hotel at the start of my career my colleagues and I had to deliver a banquette for 1000 people  and I was doing the service  moving between the elegant atmosphere at the dinner table and the pace of the kitchen. It was a team effort  intense  focused and sometimes so quiet because everybody was concentrating so hard on delivering the next dish perfectly. And I thought  wow  this is so exciting. I still have goosebumps thinking about it and it was 25 years ago. The collaboration  management  effort and preparation ensured a stunning result. It was just fantastic. We felt so proud about delivering that service in such intense circumstances. And for me  that's the summary of hospitality – togetherness  you truly feel that you are part of something.”The Heart of Hospitality podcast is part of a pan-European industry platform of the same name  built to tell stories of the sector and its people.

7952,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://theaccidentalsuccessfulcio.com/technology-2/european-cios-come-under-fire-when-their-systems-fail,European CIOs Come Under Fire When Their Systems Fail,European stock exchange CIOs have had a series of outages that have halted stock trading and are now thinking about creating a consolidated tapeThe post European CIOs Come Under Fire When Their Systems Fail appeared first on The Accidental Successful CIO.,If you're new here  you may want to subscribe to my RSS feed. Thanks for visiting!When a stock trading system goes down  CIOs get involvedImage Credit: Stock CatalogThe one thing that stock traders want to be able to do is to trade their stocks. However  if the IT systems that they use to make this happen have a fault or an outage  then all of a sudden something that is normally always there can vanish instantly. When this happens  down lost time means money lost for stock traders. The person that they are going to be holding responsible for their losses will be the CIO who is in charge of the systems that they use. This was recently a big problem. What are CIOs to do to prevent events like this?The Day Stocks Couldn’t Be TradedInvestors in Europe learned the hard way that the key structural differences between some of the region’s main stock exchanges and their U.S. counterparts put them at a costly disadvantage when it comes to trading stocks. Technical glitches halted trading on two separate occasions highlighting the importance of information technology and risking potential losses for investors that trade stocks on five of the six European marketplaces owned by Euronext  including those in Paris  Amsterdam and Lisbon. The breakdown bolstered arguments by the people in the CIO position that Europe should follow U.S. practices and introduce a consolidated tape. This is an electronic system that collates real-time prices for stocks that trade on different marketplaces simultaneously.Trading activity in stocks normally spikes at the end of the day. When the closing auction failed it didn’t. Such a system would have allowed investors to continue trading stocks on alternative venues – including Cboe Global Markets’s Europe-based marketplace  the London Stock Exchange’s majority owned Turquoise trading facility  and Aquis Exchange – despite the Euronext glitches. This is because the consolidated-tape prices would serve as a reference for investors to trade stocks on different marketplaces. Instead  what happened is that when Euronext’s exchanges went down investors struggled to trade even the biggest corporate names such as Paris-listed luxury-goods giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton or Amsterdam-listed Just Eat Takeaway.com  a big food-delivery company  because pricing was unavailable or difficult to access.A breakdown in Euronext’s platform risks disrupting trading across an increasing number of Europe’s exchanges given the pan-European operator is in the process of acquiring the Italian exchange from the LSE for about $5.1 billion. That deal would expand the number of trading venues it owns to seven. The consolidated tape would save investors billions of euros  provide better investment outcomes for investors and promote greater competition and resilience among trading venues.Change Is Required To Prevent Future ProblemsThe person with the Euronext CIO job defends its technology. He says that that its Optiq trading platform has demonstrated reliability since its implementation in 2018. The trading disruption is one of two technical breakdowns involving a key part of Europe’s financial plumbing. A previous software glitch disrupted the European bloc’s main wholesale payment system  which prevented banks from processing transactions and securities trades for almost 11 hours. The European Central Bank CIO said Wednesday they have taken steps to avoid a repeat of the disruption.If investors and their brokers in Europe wanted to avoid future outages  they would be required to subscribe to stock quotes from multiple trading venues to replicate a consolidated tape. The problem with this solution is that this solution is costly  inexact  and raises the risk of missing out on the full view of available stock prices. That structure showed its flaws when Euronext halted trading for a few hours on most of its venues because of a software glitch. Many investors struggled to access alternative venues during this time to complete their transactions.A consolidated tape helps to overcome the challenges by offering investors one source for real-time quotes that would allow them to switch between marketplaces to trade a stock if one venue went down. In the U.S.  a consolidated tape protected investors when trading on the New York Stock Exchange froze for almost four hours. All of the other exchanges were able to keep trading and no one really noticed. Euronext’s technical challenges also highlight the relative risks of trading in Europe as an increasing number of orders are executed during a narrow window at the end of the trading day. A heavier reliance on closing auctions on at least some exchanges in Europe suggests the fallout from any trading disruption would be more severe by canceling a greater number of trades.What All Of This Means For YouThe CIOs who run the firms that provide the data that people who trade stocks are always under a great deal of pressure. The systems that these CIOs are in charge of are used every day  all day long  by people to make money. If one of their systems experiences an outage  then all of a sudden nobody is making any money. Preventing outages is one of the key jobs of these types of CIOs.The one thing that the European stock exchange CIOs don’t want to have happen is an outage. Yet  that is what they recently experienced. Problems with the software that allows stocks to be traded has experienced issues twice in recent history. The volume of trading that is being done generally goes up at the end of the day. However  during the outages this did not happen because investors did not have the information that they needed in order to make trades. As the European stock trading systems become more and more intertwined  the impact of an outage grows larger and larger. Investors think that they know what the solution to their problem is: a consolidated tape. This does not currently exist  but European CIOs need to think about creating one.“Mission critical” is a phrase that many CIOs like to use when referring to their most valuable system. The European stock exchange CIOs know that just about all of their systems can be considered to be mission critical. Although there is probably no way to prevent any of them from ever going down  it sure seems like having a backup plan like a consolidated tape might be a good idea. We’ll have to see what these CIO’s next steps are…– Dr. Jim Anderson Blue Elephant Consulting –Your Source For Real World IT Department Leadership Skills™Question For You: If the European stock exchange CIOs don’t decide to create a consolidated tape  what should they do instead?P.S.: Free subscriptions to The Accidental Successful CIO Newsletter are now available.

Resolution on establishment of an incentive programme (LTIP 2022) by a) issuing warrants to the subsidiary Kanalfläkt Industrial Service AB and b) approving the transfer of warrants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaryThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve on the introduction of an incentive programme by the Company carrying out an issue of warrants and the transfer of warrants to certain employees within the group on the terms and conditions set out below (""LTIP 2022"").The issue of the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be directed to the wholly owned subsidiary  Kanalfläkt Industrial Service AB  registration number 556063-2530 (""the Subsidiary""). The warrants shall be issued free of charge to the Subsidiary. The right to subscribe for the warrants is vested in the Subsidiary with the right and obligation for the Subsidiary to offer employees as defined in section B.1 below the right to acquire the warrants for a consideration on the terms and conditions set out below.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the Board of Directors believes that it is important and in the interest of all shareholders that Group Management and other key persons  who are deemed important for the further development of the Company  have a long-term interest in good value growth for the Company’s shares. A personal long-term shareholder commitment may be expected to contribute to an increased interest in the Company's activities and performance  as well as to increase participants' motivation and affinity with the Company and its shareholders.An explanation of the preparation of the proposal  the costs of the programme and the impact on key indicators is given in Annex A.a) Issue of warrants to the SubsidiaryThe issue  which comprises a maximum of 600 000 warrants of series 2022/2026 shall be made with derogation from shareholders' preferential rights and on the following terms.1. Number of warrants issuedThe Company shall issue a maximum of 600 000 warrants. Each warrant carries the right to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company.2. Subscription rights and allocationThe right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be exclusively vested in the Subsidiary wholly owned by the Company. Oversubscription cannot occur. The subsidiary shall  after subscription  offer the employees of the Company as defined in section B.1 below the right to acquire the warrants.3. Issue priceThe warrants shall be issued free of charge to the Subsidiary.4. Subscription periodThe warrants must be subscribed for within four weeks from the date of the issue decision. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription period.5. Period for exercise of warrantsEach warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company. Subscription of shares in accordance with the terms of the warrants may take place during the following periods:a two-week period from the day following publication of the Company's interim report for the period 1 May to 31 July 2025/2026  but no earlier than 18 August 2025 and no later than 30 September 2025  a two-week period from the day following the publication of the Company's interim report for the period 1 May to 31 January 2025/2026  but no earlier than 2 March 2026 and no later than 30 April 2026  and a two-week period from the day following publication of the Company's interim report for the period 1 May to 31 July 2026/2027  but no earlier than 17 August 2026 and no later than 30 September 2026.6. Subscription priceThe subscription price per share upon exercise of the warrant shall be an amount equal to 110 percent of the calculated volume weighted average price paid for the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the period from 29 August 2022 up to and including 9 September 2022. If the Company has insider information during this period  the Board of Directors shall have the right to postpone the measurement period. The subscription price may not be lower than the current quota value of the share. In the event that the subscription price exceeds the quota value of the previous shares  the excess amount (the excess price) shall be recorded in the free share premium fund in the Company's balance sheet.If  upon subscription of a share  the last price paid on Nasdaq Stockholm for the Company's share at the close of trading on the trading day immediately preceding the new subscription exceeds 160 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Company's share during the period from 29 August 2022 up to and including 9 September 2022  the subscription price shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount by which the aforementioned payment price exceeds 160 percent of the aforementioned average price.Alternative exercise modelHolders of the warrants shall have the right  upon subscription of shares with the exercise of the warrants  to request the application of an alternative exercise model in accordance with the full terms and conditions. When applying the alternative subscription model  the subscription price for each share shall be equal to the quota value of the share and the warrants shall entitle the holder to a converted number of shares  which as a starting-point shall be lower. However  the warrants shall not entitle the holder to more than one (1) share per warrant  subject to any conversion in accordance with the full terms and conditions of the warrants. Assuming that the subscription price for the shares in the Company for which warrants entitle to subscription is set at SEK 56.20  application of the alternative exercise model would have the following effects in the event of full new subscription with the support of all 600 000 warrants and full exercise of the alternative exercise model at the share prices for the Company's shares prior to the subscription period indicated below:Illustrative calculation based on an assumed subscription price of SEK 56.20:1 Share price 1 Total dilution 1 Total number of new shares 1 SEK 60 1 0.02% 1 38 159 1 SEK 70 1 0.06% 1 118 710 1 SEK 80 1 0.09% 1 179 060 1 SEK 90 1 0.11% 1 225 9617. Increase in share capitalThe increase in the Company's share capital  if the warrants are exercised in full  may amount to a maximum of SEK 150 000 (assuming the current quota value and that no conversion has taken place in accordance with the full terms and conditions of the warrants).8. DividendShares subscribed for through exercise of the warrants carry the right to a dividend for the first time on the nearest record day for dividends after subscription has been executed.9. AuthorisationThe Board of Directors  or person appointed by the Board of Directors for the task  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments to the resolution as may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.Other terms and conditions are set out in the full terms and conditions of the warrants. Among other things  it is stated that the subscription price as well as the number of shares for which each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe may be recalculated in the event of a bonus issue  new issue  split  merger or in certain other cases.In the event of full subscription and full exercise of the warrants  the Company's share capital may be increased by a maximum of SEK 150 000 through the issue of a maximum of 600 000 shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.25  subject  however  to any recalculation that may be required under the terms of the warrants. These new shares  when fully utilised  represent approximately 0.29 per cent of the total number of shares in the Company.b) Approval of transfer of warrantsParticipants and allocationThe Board of Directors further proposes that the AGM resolve to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer a maximum of 600 000 warrants in the Company of series 2022/2026 to the participants  or otherwise dispose of the warrants to secure the commitments in connection with the Incentive Programme 2022/2026.The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall be granted to the following categories of employees:1 Category 1 Number of warrants per category 1 Maximum number of warrants per person 1 A. President and CEO(maximum 1 person) 1 48 000 1 96 000 1 B. Group Management(maximum 6 people) 1 168 000 1 48 000 1 C. Other key individuals(maximum 53 people) 1 384 000 20 000If warrants within a certain category remain after all applications within the category have been satisfied  the remaining number may be allocated to participants in the same or another category  whereby the Board shall determine the allocation based on factors such as category membership  category of personnel and number applied for. However  such allocation must not result in the maximum number of warrants per person within a given category as set out in the table above being exceeded. The Board of Directors of the Company decides on the final allocation.The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall only accrue to those persons who have not resigned or been dismissed at the end of the notification period.Warrants should also be offered to new employees. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to those set out in this resolution. This means  for example  that acquisitions must be made at the current market value at that time.Transfer of warrants to participants is conditional upon it being legally possible to purchase the warrants  and that such transfers can be performed using reasonable administrative and financial resources according to the assessment of the Board.Price and paymentThe warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price (premium) equal to an estimated market value of the warrants using a generally accepted valuation model calculated by an independent valuation institution. For acquisitions made by new employees after the end of the initial notification period  the new market price shall be determined accordingly.For the warrants  the value has been provisionally calculated at SEK 4.83 per warrant  based on a share price of SEK 51.10  which corresponded to the closing price of Systemair's shares on 20 June 2022  an assumption of a subscription price of SEK 56.20 per share and an upper limit of SEK 81.80 per share  an assumption of future dividends of SEK 1.20 and 10 percent annual growth thereafter  a risk-free interest rate of 2.11 percent and a volatility of 29 percent. The preliminary valuation has been conducted by People & Corporate Performance AB.The warrants shall be transferred to the participants no later than before the 2023 AGM  after which any non-transferred warrants shall be cancelled.The warrants shall otherwise be subject to market conditions.Termination of employmentThe warrants shall be subject to a right for the Company or its subsidiaries to repurchase the warrants  at the lower of cost and market value  if a participant's employment with or assignment to the Company is terminated  or if the employee resigns or is terminated  during the term of the program.Authorisation and majority requirementsIt is proposed that the Board of Directors  or the person appointed by the Board of Directors  be authorised to make such minor adjustments to the above resolution as may be required by the registration thereof with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear Sweden AB.In order for the AGM’s decision to be valid  the proposal must be supported by shareholders representing no less than two thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.17. Authorisation for the Board to approve the issue of new sharesThe Board proposes that the AGM resolve to authorise the Board  on one or more occasions during the period until the next AGM  with or without deviation from the preferential rights of the shareholders  to decide to increase the Company’s share capital by issuing new shares.

Growth at constant exchange rates is slightly down at -1%  reflecting an upturn in the Brazilian real over the period. The average EUR/BRL exchange rate is 5.55 in H1 2022 compared to 6.49 in H1 2021.In the first half of 2022 production is 1.3 TWh  compared to 1.6 TWh in H1 2021  reflecting the drop in wind and solar resources.Q2 2022 revenues from Energy sales amount to €52.6 million  up +8% at current exchange rates (-3% at constant exchange rates) compared to Q2 2021.Quarterly production is 0.6 TWh compared to 0.8 TWh in 2021 and installed capacity in operation is 1 226 MW at end of June 2022 (-3%).Production by country:In Brazil production decreases by -30% due to the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 power plants (which had started their production in the first half of 2021) and less favourable wind conditions than a year ago and well below the long-term resource average. The volume loss was almost entirely offset by a favourable exchange rate effect (strengthening of the Brazilian currency) and by the contractual clauses indexing sale prices to inflation.In France production is down -5% during the second quarter  mainly due to the wind plants; it benefited from the production of solar and biomass plants commissioned in 2021 (Laspeyres  Cabanon and Cacao).In other countries  Voltalia's production is growing overall  multiplied by x3.3 in Greece  benefiting from the commissioning of the new Stavria solar plant  up +89% in Spain  +47% in Belgium and +37% in Portugal  due to the strong growth in Helexia's production over the period.

Revenues from third-party clients and internal revenues (eliminated in consolidation) are up +48% and +20% respectively. The analysis by segment shows a strong general progression of the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment:The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posts revenues of €87 million  up +41% (+38% at constant exchange rates). During the quarter  Development revenues are up due to the sale of projects under development to third-party clients  while Construction records strong growth in third-party client revenues in the UK  Portugal and Kenya; and Equipment Procurement to third-party customers posts sustained growth particularly in Portugal  but also in the UK and Italy. Revenues for third-party clients increase by +53%  while internal revenues increase by +24%.Revenues of the Operation & Maintenance segment amount to €7.3 million  almost identical to those of Q2 2021 (down -4% at constant exchange rates). Third-party clients make up 61% of the segment’s revenues.H1 and Q2 2022 revenue eliminations amount to respectively €48.4 million euros (+35% at current exchange rates and +32% at constant exchange rates) and €36 million (+20% at current exchange rates and +17% at constant exchange rates)  reflecting the growth of Services sold internally in Q2 2022  to the benefit of power plants under construction and in operation owned by Voltalia.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SELECTED)117 MW of solar sites awarded in Morocco6Voltalia was awarded the largest volume with 117 MW out of a total of 400 MW offered  spread over two sites: Ain Beni Mathar (69 MW) and Guercif (48 MW). These two solar sites located in the Oriental will cover the energy needs equivalent to the annual consumption of 290 000 inhabitants. Construction is scheduled to start at the end of 2023. Revenues will be guaranteed by long-term electricity sales contracts  to be concluded with private customers connected to the public electricity grid.Voltalia closed with success its second employee share holding plan7For this second edition  seven countries  or 88% of employees  were eligible: France  Portugal  Brazil  Greece  Italy  Spain and the United Kingdom. In total  72% of eligible employees decided to participate (compared to 69.5% in the first plan). This second employee shareholding plan aims to make employee shareholding a sustainable lever for aligning the interests of all stakeholders and building employee loyalty. Through this plan  Voltalia has placed the commitment of its teams at the heart of its concerns and has allowed them to express their confidence in the company  both in its social role and in its operational objectives and financial performance.Voltalia is now part of the Euronext Tech Leaders8Euronext Tech Leaders is composed of 100+ high-growth and leading companies  each meeting a specific set of criteria to qualify.

This plant is made up of half crystalline photovoltaic panels and half concentrator photovoltaic modules  and benefits from a twenty-year electricity contract. Its production will cover the domestic electricity needs of more than 4 560 inhabitants. In order to support the region’s development  the plant has a grazing agreement which allows the land to be shared with a local sheep breeder.Development of a new renewable solar cluster in southeastern Brazil10After developing its large clusters in Brazil at Serra Branca (potential of 2.4 GW  in the state of Rio Grande do Norte) and Canudos (potential of more than 1 GW  in the state of Bahia)  Voltalia is developing Arinos  a new solar cluster with a potential of more than 1.5 GW  this time located in the southeast of the country. With the Arinos cluster  Voltalia is developing for its own account and also for third parties. Voltalia has already signed partnerships  notably with CTG Brasil  a reference in clean energy in the country. Following approvals  these partners will purchase a significant portion of the solar sites in the Arinos cluster once the development phase of each site is completed and thus shortly before construction begins.Construction launch of Karavasta project in Albania11Voltalia has won a 30-year concession for the Karavasta photovoltaic power plant in 2020. The 140 MW project was awarded to Voltalia by decision of the Albanian Council of Ministers on January 21  2020  following the competitive bidding process launched by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy with the support of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - EBRD. According to the terms of the tender  Karavasta will sell 50% of the electricity through a 15-year sales contract to the Albanian public operator  while the remaining production will be sold through long-term contracts to private operators. The plant is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2023. It is the largest solar power project in the Western Balkans.2023 AMBITIONS CONFIRMEDThe ambition of 2.6 GW in operation or under construction by the end of 2023 is confirmed. Voltalia has 2.1 GW of capacity in operation or under construction.

As of the latest investment report dated 4 May 2022  the portfolio derived 97.2% of the total gross rental income (GRI) from EDF and ENEDIS  a subsidiary of EDF.EDF (Euronext: EDF) is an electric utility company that is 84.0% owned by the French government. The company provides power to over 35.0 million customers throughout the European zone and is the dominate energy provider in France  with close to 80.0% of the electricity output in the country. ENEDIS is a wholly-owned  operationally-independent subsidiary of EDF. The company is an electricity network distributor and is responsible for managing most of the electricity distribution network in France. ENEDIS provides daily development  maintenance  and operation across the electricity network and has a physical presence throughout France.Further details were reported this week on the French government’s intention to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of EDF  fully nationalising the company. KBRA expects that the proposed nationalisation of EDF is highly likely to be consummated. Should this occur  no rating actions are anticipated as it should strengthen the credit profile of both EDF and ENEDIS  which will have credit characteristics consistent with a high investment grade rating. The tenant’s credit profile will continue to be considered in our ongoing monitoring and future surveillance reviews.To access ratings and relevant documents  click here.Related PublicationsDisclosuresA description of all substantially material sources that were used to prepare the credit rating and information on the methodology(ies) (inclusive of any material models and sensitivity analyses of the relevant key rating assumptions  as applicable) used in determining the credit rating is available in the Information Disclosure Form(s) located here.Information on the meaning of each rating category can be located here.This credit rating is endorsed by Kroll Bond Rating Agency Europe Limited for use in the European Union.

This status will allow Acticor Biotech to strengthen interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities in order to confirm the clinical development plan for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke.Glenzocimab is currently being evaluated in the Phase 2/3 registration ACTISAVE study in stroke patients. This study started in Q3 2021  with the inclusion of the first patient in Europe. In parallel  ACTICOR had obtained an IND for this study from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2021. To date  87 patients have already been enrolled in Europe.A total of 1 000 patients will be included in the United States and Europe. An interim futility analysis is planned after inclusion of the first 200 patients to confirm the baseline hypotheses.Yannick Pletan  General Manager & CMO of Acticor Biotech  said: ""We are delighted that the European Medicines Agency has granted ""PRIME"" status to glenzocimab. This designation is both a recognition of the significant unmet medical need for stroke and a validation of the relevance of the positive clinical results of our Phase 1b/2a ACTIMIS study with glenzocimab in stroke patients. We will now be able to more easily pursue our discussions with regulatory authorities and ensure the smooth continuation of the ACTISAVE Phase 2/3 clinical trial  conducted in the United States and in Europe. To date  87 patients have already been enrolled across Europe  which is perfectly in line with our theoretical inclusion curve. The good recruitment momentum in this study will lead  as previously announced  to the interim futility analysis  scheduled after the inclusion of the 200 patients  in the first half of 2023.""About ACTISAVEACTISAVE (NCT05070260) is a multinational  adaptive  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group Phase 2/3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of glenzocimab used in combination with standard of care (thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy) for acute ischemic stroke.About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.Acticor Biotech is developing glenzocimab (ACT017)  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against a novel target of major interest  platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Glenzocimab inhibits platelet binding to the thrombus without affecting physiological hemostasis  thereby limiting the bleeding risk  particularly in the brain.In May 2022  Acticor Biotech presented positive results from its Phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  at the ESOC  confirming the safety profile and showing a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group in patients with stroke. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being evaluated in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  which will include 1 000 patients.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Mirae Asset Capital  Anaxago  Primer Capital  Mediolanum farmaceutici and the Armesa foundation).

The strategy focused on the development of high-performance enclosures for power  optronics and microwave applications continues to bear fruit with new projects  in line with the modernization plan of the production tool  currently being deployed.Egide USA is still suffering from the tight labor market in the US  despite adjusting pay scales to above market bearing costs. Out of a target workforce of 95 employees  there has been shortages of up to 15 employees at any given time. As new employees are added to the facility  intense training to meet customer requirements has affected efficiencies of the operation. In addition  the supply chain  which is primarily in the US  has also been affected by the tight labor market. This has delayed delivery of key components to meet the customer demand. Despite these industrial difficulties  which are beginning to fade  commercial activity and the order book are at a high level  thanks in particular to the thermal battery and defense sector. The order backlog is strong.Story continuesSantier's business was also disrupted by the tight labor market although at a lower level  and supply chain issues continue to hamper production. Although it may seem counter-intuitive  the signs of a slowdown in the US economy may lead to an easier recruitment and supply situation in the second half of the year and ultimately be positive for Santier as well as for Egide USA.Sales in dollar terms by US entities represented 52 % of the group's total revenue in the first half of 2022.REVENUE PER GEOGRAPHICAL AREAIn million Euros H1 2021 H1 2022* Var. % Comp.Var. % ** Egide SA 7.31 7.64 + 4.5% + 4.5% Egide USA 5.35 4.25 -20 .5% -27.9% Santier 3.93 4.13 +4.9% -4.8% Group 16.59 16.02 -3.5% -8.1%* unaudited ** in constant dollarsFor information  the average euro/dollar parity in H1 2022 was 1.094 against 1.2057 in H1 2021.REVENUE PER APPLICATIONIn million Euros H1 2021 H1 2022 * Var. % (€) Compt.Var. %** Therm imaging. 5.89 5.91 +0.3% -0.4% Power 4.37 3.02 -31.0% -37.3% Optronics 1.98 2.19 +10.7% +3.8% Microwave/RF 2.34 2.90 +23.9% +16.4% Other 2.01 2.00 -0.4% -7.7% Group 16.59 16.02 -3.5% -8.1%* unaudited ** At constant exchange ratesThermal imagingThe demand on this market remains strong for 2022 for our key customers in Europe  the Middle East and also in Asia  where Egide acquired several new customers. The US market is also strong and qualification on new programs at key customers is underway.PowerMainly delivered by Egide USA  deliveries in H1-2021 were inflated due to the lack of deliveries in the previous semester because of the fire in Cambridge. H1-2022 returned to a normal level of activity in this market segment. We now expect this segment to increase as products for thermal battery are qualified and increase in 2022 and beyond.OptronicsWith high-end high-frequency products  it is an area of attention and effort  especially with modernization projects in the framework of Industry 4.0 at the facility in Bollène. The infusion of capital in the US via the sale-leaseback of the Cambridge factory would allow for similar improvements in the HTCC process in the US. This should allow for more activity in the US optronics markets in the coming years.MicrowaveGrowth in this market has been seen at all three facilities. Most of the growth is in defense related companies and in various geographic markets.OUTLOOKEgide SA aims to continue its growth in 2022 and accelerate it in 2023.Egide USA and Santier are expected to finalize their financing of the working capital requirement in the coming days  which will allow them to focus on customer execution and satisfaction.In addition  and for the record  Egide Group should finalize its project to transfer the listing of Egide's shares on the Euronext Growth market in Paris by the end of August 2022. This transfer project aims to enable Egide to be listed on a market more appropriate to the size of the company.

Revenue development this first half year was influenced by a number of important market trends. On the positive side  it reflected ongoing strength for Besi’s computing and automotive end-user markets continuing favorable trends from H2-21. Such strength was partially offset by reduced demand for high-end smartphones following a large capacity build in 2021. It also reflected a 31.4% decrease in revenue from Chinese customers primarily associated with reduced shipments to subcontractors for mobile handsets and mainstream electronics applications due to overcapacity and Covid-19 related lockdowns. Net income growth in H1-22 benefitted from higher revenue levels  stable gross margins of 60.5% and cost control efforts which enabled us to keep operating expense margins relatively flat despite funding a 46.8% increase in R&D spending associated with new wafer level product development.Our liquidity position continued to improve at June 30  2022 with net cash of € 284.0 million and total cash and deposits of € 601.6 million increasing 37.4% and 17.6%  respectively  versus June 30  2021. Such increases occurred despite the distribution of € 305.7 million to shareholders in H1-22 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Given continued strong cash flow generation and current market conditions  we intend to complete the current € 185 million share repurchase program by July 31  2022. Beginning August 1  2022  we intend to initiate a new € 300 million program representing approximately 7.5% of current shares outstanding with a completion date of October 2023. Repurchases under this new program will help reduce dilution related to Besi’s Convertible Notes outstanding and issuances under employee stock plans.For the quarter  Besi’s revenue of € 214.0 million and net income of € 75.6 million grew by 5.7% and 12.0%  respectively  versus Q1-22. Sequential revenue and profit growth were primarily due to increased shipments for high-end smartphones  an increase of gross margins to 61.0% due to a more favorable product mix  a stronger dollar and a 5.0% reduction in operating expenses. However  orders of € 153.1 million decreased by 25.2% versus Q1-22 as industry conditions weakened  global GDP growth rates decelerated and customer caution increased. In particular  they reflected lower bookings for high-end mobile and high performance computing applications as well as lower orders by Asian subcontractors partially offset by continued strength in demand for automotive end-user markets. Of note  we received three orders for Besi’s new embedded bridge die attach system in H1-22 reflecting progress in the build out of our wafer level assembly portfolio. In addition  Besi’s backlog of € 275 million at June 30  2022 remained at higher than typical levels reflecting ongoing supply chain issues  selective pre ordering by customers and  to a lesser extent  pushouts by some Asian subcontractors given changing market conditions.Whether ​current market​ softness is a temporary pause or more prolonged in duration is difficult to tell ​at present ​given the many conflicting economic  geopolitical and industry cross currents. For Q3-22  we estimate that revenue will decrease by 20-30% versus Q2-22 reflecting current market conditions and seasonal trends. However  Besi’s gross margin is expected to remain in the 60-62% range due to the flexibility of our production model and timely operational actions taken. In this regard  we reduced temporary production headcount approximately 16% in the latter half of the quarter to better align production with order trends. Further  operating expenses are anticipated to decrease by 10-15% versus Q2-22 principally related to lower revenue levels.We are accelerating investment in Besi’s future  particularly for our hybrid bonding and wafer level assembly portfolio as the long-term drivers of our business remain intact and sub 10 nanometer device innovation continues apace. As such  we are deploying greater resources to meet hybrid bonding goals  introducing new wafer level assembly systems  adding development and support personnel and taking occupancy of a new 125 000 square foot leased facility in Malaysia in Q3-22 which should lessen capacity constraints for our most advanced systems.”Second Quarter Results of Operations€ millions Q2-2022 Q1-2022 Δ Q2-2021 Δ Revenue 214.0 202.4 +5.7% 226.1 -5.4% Orders 153.1 204.8 -25.2% 200.2 -23.5% Book to Bill Ratio 0.7x 1.0x -0.3 0.9 -0.2Q2-22 revenue of € 214.0 million increased 5.7% versus Q1-22 primarily due to increased shipments for high-end mobile applications. Versus Q2-21  revenue decreased by 5.4% as a result of significantly lower demand for high-end smartphones post new product introductions in 2021 as well as lower demand for Chinese handset and mainstream electronics applications due to overcapacity and Covid-19 related lockdowns. This decrease was partially offset by strong revenue growth for both Besi’s computing and automotive end-user markets including shipments of hybrid bonding systems to multiple customers.Orders of € 153.1 million decreased 25.2% versus Q1-22 due primarily to lower orders for high-end mobile and high performance computing applications as well as lower orders by Asian subcontractors partially offset by continued strength in demand for automotive end-user markets. Versus Q2-21  orders decreased by 23.5% primarily due to significantly lower demand by Chinese subcontractors and  to a lesser extent  decreased orders for high performance computing applications. Per customer type  IDM orders decreased € 10.3 million  or 10.6%  versus Q1-22 and represented 57% of total orders for the period.

Gross margin decreased by 1.1 points as compared to Q2-21 due to a less favorable product mix.Q2-22 operating expenses declined by € 2.0 million  or 5.0%  versus Q1-22 principally due to a € 5.0 million reduction in share-based compensation expense partially offset by increased variable sales related  travel and R&D personnel costs. Operating expenses increased by € 4.3 million  or 12.8% versus Q2-21 primarily due to increased R&D spending for next generation wafer level assembly systems. As a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were 17.7% in Q2-22 versus 19.7% in Q1-22 and 14.9% in Q2-21.Q2-22 financial expense  net increased by € 2.1 million versus Q1-22 due to increased interest expense from the issuance of € 175 million of 1.875% Convertible Notes due 2029 in March 2022  increased hedging expenses and negative forex effects.€ millions Q2-2022 Q1-2022 Δ Q2-2021 Δ Net Income 75.6 67.5 +12.0% 93.5 -19.1% Net Margin 35.4% 33.4% +2.0 41.3% -5.9 Tax Rate 12.7% 13.4% -0.7 10.0% +2.7Besi’s net income increased 12.0% versus Q1-22 primarily due to increased revenue and gross margins combined with a 5.0% reduction in sequential operating expenses. As a result  Besi’s net margin increased to 35.4% versus 33.4%. As compared to Q2-21  Besi’s net income decreased by 19.1% principally as a result of decreased revenue and gross margin levels combined with higher development spending in support of wafer level assembly programs and a higher effective tax rate.Half Year Results of Operations€ millions H1-2022 H1-2021 Δ Revenue 416.4 369.3 +12.8% Orders 357.9 527.3 -32.1% Gross Margin 60.5% 60.5% - Operating Income 174.2 155.0 +12.4% Net Income 143.2 131.1 +9.2% Net Margin 34.4% 35.5% -1.1 Tax Rate 13.1% 11.3% +1.8H1-22 revenue of € 416.4 million rose 12.8% reflecting strong demand for Besi’s computing and automotive end-user markets including increased shipments of hybrid bonding systems. Growth was partially offset by significantly decreased demand for high-end smartphones  decreased shipments for mobile handsets and mainstream electronics applications to Chinese subcontractors and some pushouts of system deliveries due to softening industry conditions. Of note  revenue from Chinese customers decreased by € 42.1 million  or 31.4%  year-over-year and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 36.3% in H1-21 to 22.1% in H1-22.Orders of € 357.9 million decreased by 32.1% versus H1-21 due to less favorable market conditions post the significant assembly capacity build over the past two years. In particular  the decrease reflected lower orders for high-end smartphones post new product introductions in 2021 and decreased demand from Chinese subcontractors. IDM and subcontractor orders represented 51% and 49%  respectively  of H1-22 orders versus 46% and 54%  respectively  in H1-21.Besi’s H1-22 net income of € 143.2 million grew by € 12.1 million  or 9.2%  versus H1-21 due primarily to higher revenue levels. Operating and net margins were roughly equal in each respective period as we successfully controlled overhead growth while increasing development spending by 46.8% in support of wafer level R&D programs.Financial Condition€ millionsQ22022 Q12022 Δ Q22021 Δ H12022 H12021 Δ Total Cash and Deposits 601.6 696.6 -13.6% 511.4 +17.6% 601.6 511.4 +17.6% Net Cash and Deposits 284.0 407.0 -30.2% 206.7 +37.4% 284.0 206.7 +37.4% Cash flow from Ops. 27.6 45.0 -38.7% 51.2 -46.1% 72.5 77.4 -6.3%At the end of Q2-22  Besi had a strong liquidity position with total cash and deposits aggregating € 601.6 million  an increase of 17.6% versus Q2-21.

We achieved significant growth and could maintain a high profit margin despite some headwinds from currencies. Since the beginning of the year  we increased our worldwide headcount by a good 1 500  and the recent acquisitions are contributing to our business development as expected. Given the healthy underlying demand in our industry and good order situation  we confirm our full-year outlook as well as our ambitious investment program  despite higher inflation and lower corona-related demand. However  the global political and economic uncertainties  the resulting strained supply chains  and thus also the uncertainties of projections and outlooks remain high "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1In the first half of the year  Group sales revenue rose by 22.1 percent year-over-year in constant currencies (reported: + 27.5 percent) to around 1 724 million euros. This good performance was mainly driven by organic growth  while acquisitions2 contributed around 2 percentage points to sales revenue growth. All major product segments contributed to this positive development with clear double-digit growth rates  while business with vaccine manufacturers normalized faster than expected. All three business regions – EMEA3  Americas  and Asia | Pacific – posted double-digit percentage growth in constant currencies. The restrictions in China caused by the pandemic had a relatively minor impact on growth.Following the extraordinarily high growth rates due to the pandemic in the first half of 2021  order intake also continued to normalize and reached 1 827 million euros  which was  as expected  slightly below the prior-year figure of 1 890 million euros (in constant currencies: -7.3 percent  reported -3.3 percent).Following the strong growth in sales revenue  underlying EBITDA rose by 24.5 percent to 607 million euros in the first half of the year. The corresponding margin reached 35.2 percent (prior-year period: 36.1 percent). The development was influenced by positive economies of scale which were offset by negative currency effects and  as planned  higher costs due to new employees and an increase in the number of business trips. Effects from price trends and adjustments on the purchasing and customer sides largely compensated each other.Relevant net profit reached 405 million euros  up 26.0 percent from the prior-year period. Underlying earnings per share were 4.40 euros (prior-year period: 3.49 euros).Key financial indicatorsThe Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. As of June 30  2022  its equity ratio stood at 48.6 percent (December 31  2021: 43.9 percent). The ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA was 0.5 as of the reporting date  compared with 0.4 at year-end 2021. Cash flow from investing activities stood at –180 million euros  compared with -114 million euros in the first half of 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue reached 10.4 percent (prior-year period: 8.4 percent).Increase in the number of employeesAs of June 30  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech employed a total of 11 942 people worldwide  representing a headcount increase of 1 533 from the end of December 2021.Outlook for fiscal 2022 confirmedThe management confirms its outlook for the current fiscal year. Consolidated sales revenue is expected to increase by about 15 percent to 19 percent with non-organic growth from acquisitions projected to contribute about 2 percentage points. Regarding profitability  Sartorius Stedim Biotech continues to expect its underlying EBITDA margin to reach more than 35 percent.The CAPEX ratio is anticipated to be about 14.5 percent and net debt to underlying EBITDA to be about 0.2 at year-end. Possible further acquisitions are not included in this projection.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends.

7990,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.wbko.com/prnewswire/2022/07/21/half-year-results-2022-sartorius-stedim-biotech/,Half-year results 2022 of Sartorius Stedim Biotech,,"AUBAGNE  France  July 21  2022Sartorius (PRNewsfoto/Sartorius AG) (PRNewswire)Sales revenue up 22.1 percent in constant currencies  underlying EBITDA margin 35.2 percent2022 outlook confirmed: Sales revenue expected to rise by 15 to 19 percent and underlying EBITDA margin projected to be more than 35 percentUncertainties due to the global political and economic situation remain highSartorius Stedim Biotech  a leading partner of the biopharma industry  increased sales revenue and earnings with double-digit growth rates in the first half of 2022 and confirmed its full-year outlook.""Sartorius Stedim Biotech performed well during the first half of the year in an increasingly challenging environment. We achieved significant growth and could maintain a high profit margin despite some headwinds from currencies. Since the beginning of the year  we increased our worldwide headcount by a good 1 500  and the recent acquisitions are contributing to our business development as expected. Given the healthy underlying demand in our industry and good order situation  we confirm our full-year outlook as well as our ambitious investment program  despite higher inflation and lower corona-related demand. However  the global political and economic uncertainties  the resulting strained supply chains  and thus also the uncertainties of projections and outlooks remain high "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1In the first half of the year  Group sales revenue rose by 22.1 percent year-over-year in constant currencies (reported: + 27.5 percent) to around 1 724 million euros. This good performance was mainly driven by organic growth  while acquisitions2 contributed around 2 percentage points to sales revenue growth. All major product segments contributed to this positive development with clear double-digit growth rates  while business with vaccine manufacturers normalized faster than expected. All three business regions – EMEA3  Americas  and Asia | Pacific – posted double-digit percentage growth in constant currencies. The restrictions in China caused by the pandemic had a relatively minor impact on growth.Following the extraordinarily high growth rates due to the pandemic in the first half of 2021  order intake also continued to normalize and reached 1 827 million euros  which was  as expected  slightly below the prior-year figure of 1 890 million euros (in constant currencies: -7.3 percent  reported -3.3 percent).Following the strong growth in sales revenue  underlying EBITDA rose by 24.5 percent to 607 million euros in the first half of the year. The corresponding margin reached 35.2 percent (prior-year period: 36.1 percent). The development was influenced by positive economies of scale which were offset by negative currency effects and  as planned  higher costs due to new employees and an increase in the number of business trips. Effects from price trends and adjustments on the purchasing and customer sides largely compensated each other.Relevant net profit reached 405 million euros  up 26.0 percent from the prior-year period. Underlying earnings per share were 4.40 euros (prior-year period: 3.49 euros).Key financial indicatorsThe Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. As of June 30  2022  its equity ratio stood at 48.6 percent (December 31  2021: 43.9 percent). The ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA was 0.5 as of the reporting date  compared with 0.4 at year-end 2021. Cash flow from investing activities stood at –180 million euros  compared with -114 million euros in the first half of 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue reached 10.4 percent (prior-year period: 8.4 percent).Increase in the number of employeesAs of June 30  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech employed a total of 11 942 people worldwide  representing a headcount increase of 1 533 from the end of December 2021.Outlook for fiscal 2022 confirmedThe management confirms its outlook for the current fiscal year. Consolidated sales revenue is expected to increase by about 15 percent to 19 percent with non-organic growth from acquisitions projected to contribute about 2 percentage points. Regarding profitability  Sartorius Stedim Biotech continues to expect its underlying EBITDA margin to reach more than 35 percent.The CAPEX ratio is anticipated to be about 14.5 percent and net debt to underlying EBITDA to be about 0.2 at year-end. Possible further acquisitions are not included in this projection.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends. Moreover  the forecasts are based on the assumption of no further deterioration in the geopolitical and global economic situation  supply chains  inflation and energy supply  and no new relevant restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. Accordingly  current forecasts show even higher uncertainties than usual.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

This change in legislation was retroactively applied to the March 27  2022 modification to the ICE Contract. The up to 90 day cessation of the ICE Contract provided by the First Amendment was intended to allow ICE ample time to obtain a Congressional notification for the modification of the ICE Contract. However  as of July 15  2022 (the end of the 90 day cessation period)  ICE had not yet been able to obtain such a Congressional notification.Story continuesThe Second Amendment is intended to provide ICE additional time to obtain such a Congressional notification  so that the Company can continue to provide services to ICE under the ICE Contract.EnquiriesTrust Stamp Email: Shareholders@truststamp.aiGareth Genner  Chief Executive OfficerDavy (Euronext Growth Listing Sponsor) Tel: +353 1 679 6363Barry MurphyInvestor Relations Tel: +1 212-671-1021Crescendo Communications Email: idai@crescendo-ir.comAbout Trust StampTrust Stamp  is a global provider of AI-powered identity services for use in multiple sectors including banking and finance  regulatory compliance  government  real estate  communications  and humanitarian services.

Hodgkinson  who has led OSTC for more than four years after joining from Euronext in 2018 ,The chief executive of OSTC Lee Hodgkinson has said he is stepping down from that role as the prop trading group spins off its training arm into a separate entity.Hodgkinson  who has led OSTC for more than four years after joining from Euronext in 2018  said he will leave his post as group chief executive before the end of next week.“After four fantastic years as CEO  I will be leaving OSTC at the end of this month ” Hodgkinson said on Tuesday. “I’m taking up a truly unique opportunity  and the next exciting chapter in my career begins shortly.”Hodgkinson told Global Investor his departure is timed to coincide with a corporate restructuring that will see OSTC's fast-growing training arm ZISHI become independent from the group's traditional proprietary trading business.The firm has made in the past two years acquisitions to grow ZISHI Cornerstone  including FSTP in May 2021  BG Consulting in January 2021 and UK options training firm Volcube in late 2020.OSTC Group chairman Jonny Aucamp said: “The time is right to separate our business activities into two-individual standalone companies so they can pursue their individual strategic priorities.
