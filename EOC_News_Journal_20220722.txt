Resolution on establishment of an incentive programme (LTIP 2022) by a) issuing warrants to the subsidiary Kanalfl√§kt Industrial Service AB and b) approving the transfer of warrants to employees of the Company or its subsidiaryThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve on the introduction of an incentive programme by the Company carrying out an issue of warrants and the transfer of warrants to certain employees within the group on the terms and conditions set out below (""LTIP 2022"").The issue of the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be directed to the wholly owned subsidiary  Kanalfl√§kt Industrial Service AB  registration number 556063-2530 (""the Subsidiary""). The warrants shall be issued free of charge to the Subsidiary. The right to subscribe for the warrants is vested in the Subsidiary with the right and obligation for the Subsidiary to offer employees as defined in section B.1 below the right to acquire the warrants for a consideration on the terms and conditions set out below.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the Board of Directors believes that it is important and in the interest of all shareholders that Group Management and other key persons  who are deemed important for the further development of the Company  have a long-term interest in good value growth for the Company‚Äôs shares. A personal long-term shareholder commitment may be expected to contribute to an increased interest in the Company's activities and performance  as well as to increase participants' motivation and affinity with the Company and its shareholders.An explanation of the preparation of the proposal  the costs of the programme and the impact on key indicators is given in Annex A.a) Issue of warrants to the SubsidiaryThe issue  which comprises a maximum of 600 000 warrants of series 2022/2026 shall be made with derogation from shareholders' preferential rights and on the following terms.1. Number of warrants issuedThe Company shall issue a maximum of 600 000 warrants. Each warrant carries the right to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company.2. Subscription rights and allocationThe right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be exclusively vested in the Subsidiary wholly owned by the Company. Oversubscription cannot occur. The subsidiary shall  after subscription  offer the employees of the Company as defined in section B.1 below the right to acquire the warrants.3. Issue priceThe warrants shall be issued free of charge to the Subsidiary.4. Subscription periodThe warrants must be subscribed for within four weeks from the date of the issue decision. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription period.5. Period for exercise of warrantsEach warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company. Subscription of shares in accordance with the terms of the warrants may take place during the following periods:a two-week period from the day following publication of the Company's interim report for the period 1 May to 31 July 2025/2026  but no earlier than 18 August 2025 and no later than 30 September 2025  a two-week period from the day following the publication of the Company's interim report for the period 1 May to 31 January 2025/2026  but no earlier than 2 March 2026 and no later than 30 April 2026  and a two-week period from the day following publication of the Company's interim report for the period 1 May to 31 July 2026/2027  but no earlier than 17 August 2026 and no later than 30 September 2026.6. Subscription priceThe subscription price per share upon exercise of the warrant shall be an amount equal to 110 percent of the calculated volume weighted average price paid for the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the period from 29 August 2022 up to and including 9 September 2022. If the Company has insider information during this period  the Board of Directors shall have the right to postpone the measurement period. The subscription price may not be lower than the current quota value of the share. In the event that the subscription price exceeds the quota value of the previous shares  the excess amount (the excess price) shall be recorded in the free share premium fund in the Company's balance sheet.If  upon subscription of a share  the last price paid on Nasdaq Stockholm for the Company's share at the close of trading on the trading day immediately preceding the new subscription exceeds 160 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Company's share during the period from 29 August 2022 up to and including 9 September 2022  the subscription price shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount by which the aforementioned payment price exceeds 160 percent of the aforementioned average price.Alternative exercise modelHolders of the warrants shall have the right  upon subscription of shares with the exercise of the warrants  to request the application of an alternative exercise model in accordance with the full terms and conditions. When applying the alternative subscription model  the subscription price for each share shall be equal to the quota value of the share and the warrants shall entitle the holder to a converted number of shares  which as a starting-point shall be lower. However  the warrants shall not entitle the holder to more than one (1) share per warrant  subject to any conversion in accordance with the full terms and conditions of the warrants. Assuming that the subscription price for the shares in the Company for which warrants entitle to subscription is set at SEK 56.20  application of the alternative exercise model would have the following effects in the event of full new subscription with the support of all 600 000 warrants and full exercise of the alternative exercise model at the share prices for the Company's shares prior to the subscription period indicated below:Illustrative calculation based on an assumed subscription price of SEK 56.20:1 Share price 1 Total dilution 1 Total number of new shares 1 SEK 60 1 0.02% 1 38 159 1 SEK 70 1 0.06% 1 118 710 1 SEK 80 1 0.09% 1 179 060 1 SEK 90 1 0.11% 1 225 9617. Increase in share capitalThe increase in the Company's share capital  if the warrants are exercised in full  may amount to a maximum of SEK 150 000 (assuming the current quota value and that no conversion has taken place in accordance with the full terms and conditions of the warrants).8. DividendShares subscribed for through exercise of the warrants carry the right to a dividend for the first time on the nearest record day for dividends after subscription has been executed.9. AuthorisationThe Board of Directors  or person appointed by the Board of Directors for the task  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments to the resolution as may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.Other terms and conditions are set out in the full terms and conditions of the warrants. Among other things  it is stated that the subscription price as well as the number of shares for which each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe may be recalculated in the event of a bonus issue  new issue  split  merger or in certain other cases.In the event of full subscription and full exercise of the warrants  the Company's share capital may be increased by a maximum of SEK 150 000 through the issue of a maximum of 600 000 shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.25  subject  however  to any recalculation that may be required under the terms of the warrants. These new shares  when fully utilised  represent approximately 0.29 per cent of the total number of shares in the Company.b) Approval of transfer of warrantsParticipants and allocationThe Board of Directors further proposes that the AGM resolve to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer a maximum of 600 000 warrants in the Company of series 2022/2026 to the participants  or otherwise dispose of the warrants to secure the commitments in connection with the Incentive Programme 2022/2026.The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall be granted to the following categories of employees:1 Category 1 Number of warrants per category 1 Maximum number of warrants per person 1 A. President and CEO(maximum 1 person) 1 48 000 1 96 000 1 B. Group Management(maximum 6 people) 1 168 000 1 48 000 1 C. Other key individuals(maximum 53 people) 1 384 000 20 000If warrants within a certain category remain after all applications within the category have been satisfied  the remaining number may be allocated to participants in the same or another category  whereby the Board shall determine the allocation based on factors such as category membership  category of personnel and number applied for. However  such allocation must not result in the maximum number of warrants per person within a given category as set out in the table above being exceeded. The Board of Directors of the Company decides on the final allocation.The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall only accrue to those persons who have not resigned or been dismissed at the end of the notification period.Warrants should also be offered to new employees.

As of the latest investment report dated 4 May 2022  the portfolio derived 97.2% of the total gross rental income (GRI) from EDF and ENEDIS  a subsidiary of EDF.EDF (Euronext: EDF) is an electric utility company that is 84.0% owned by the French government. The company provides power to over 35.0 million customers throughout the European zone and is the dominate energy provider in France  with close to 80.0% of the electricity output in the country. ENEDIS is a wholly-owned  operationally-independent subsidiary of EDF. The company is an electricity network distributor and is responsible for managing most of the electricity distribution network in France. ENEDIS provides daily development  maintenance  and operation across the electricity network and has a physical presence throughout France.Further details were reported this week on the French government‚Äôs intention to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of EDF  fully nationalising the company. KBRA expects that the proposed nationalisation of EDF is highly likely to be consummated. Should this occur  no rating actions are anticipated as it should strengthen the credit profile of both EDF and ENEDIS  which will have credit characteristics consistent with a high investment grade rating.

This status will allow Acticor Biotech to strengthen interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities in order to confirm the clinical development plan for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke.Glenzocimab is currently being evaluated in the Phase 2/3 registration ACTISAVE study in stroke patients. This study started in Q3 2021  with the inclusion of the first patient in Europe. In parallel  ACTICOR had obtained an IND for this study from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2021. To date  87 patients have already been enrolled in Europe.A total of 1 000 patients will be included in the United States and Europe. An interim futility analysis is planned after inclusion of the first 200 patients to confirm the baseline hypotheses.Yannick Pletan  General Manager & CMO of Acticor Biotech  said: ""We are delighted that the European Medicines Agency has granted ""PRIME"" status to glenzocimab. This designation is both a recognition of the significant unmet medical need for stroke and a validation of the relevance of the positive clinical results of our Phase 1b/2a ACTIMIS study with glenzocimab in stroke patients. We will now be able to more easily pursue our discussions with regulatory authorities and ensure the smooth continuation of the ACTISAVE Phase 2/3 clinical trial  conducted in the United States and in Europe. To date  87 patients have already been enrolled across Europe  which is perfectly in line with our theoretical inclusion curve. The good recruitment momentum in this study will lead  as previously announced  to the interim futility analysis  scheduled after the inclusion of the 200 patients  in the first half of 2023.""About ACTISAVEACTISAVE (NCT05070260) is a multinational  adaptive  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group Phase 2/3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of glenzocimab used in combination with standard of care (thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy) for acute ischemic stroke.About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.Acticor Biotech is developing glenzocimab (ACT017)  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against a novel target of major interest  platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Glenzocimab inhibits platelet binding to the thrombus without affecting physiological hemostasis  thereby limiting the bleeding risk  particularly in the brain.In May 2022  Acticor Biotech presented positive results from its Phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  at the ESOC  confirming the safety profile and showing a reduction in mortality and intracerebral hemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group in patients with stroke. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being evaluated in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  which will include 1 000 patients.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Mirae Asset Capital  Anaxago  Primer Capital  Mediolanum farmaceutici and the Armesa foundation).

The strategy focused on the development of high-performance enclosures for power  optronics and microwave applications continues to bear fruit with new projects  in line with the modernization plan of the production tool  currently being deployed.Egide USA is still suffering from the tight labor market in the US  despite adjusting pay scales to above market bearing costs. Out of a target workforce of 95 employees  there has been shortages of up to 15 employees at any given time. As new employees are added to the facility  intense training to meet customer requirements has affected efficiencies of the operation. In addition  the supply chain  which is primarily in the US  has also been affected by the tight labor market. This has delayed delivery of key components to meet the customer demand. Despite these industrial difficulties  which are beginning to fade  commercial activity and the order book are at a high level  thanks in particular to the thermal battery and defense sector. The order backlog is strong.Story continuesSantier's business was also disrupted by the tight labor market although at a lower level  and supply chain issues continue to hamper production. Although it may seem counter-intuitive  the signs of a slowdown in the US economy may lead to an easier recruitment and supply situation in the second half of the year and ultimately be positive for Santier as well as for Egide USA.Sales in dollar terms by US entities represented 52 % of the group's total revenue in the first half of 2022.REVENUE PER GEOGRAPHICAL AREAIn million Euros H1 2021 H1 2022* Var. % Comp.Var. % ** Egide SA 7.31 7.64 + 4.5% + 4.5% Egide USA 5.35 4.25 -20 .5% -27.9% Santier 3.93 4.13 +4.9% -4.8% Group 16.59 16.02 -3.5% -8.1%* unaudited ** in constant dollarsFor information  the average euro/dollar parity in H1 2022 was 1.094 against 1.2057 in H1 2021.REVENUE PER APPLICATIONIn million Euros H1 2021 H1 2022 * Var. % (‚Ç¨) Compt.Var. %** Therm imaging. 5.89 5.91 +0.3% -0.4% Power 4.37 3.02 -31.0% -37.3% Optronics 1.98 2.19 +10.7% +3.8% Microwave/RF 2.34 2.90 +23.9% +16.4% Other 2.01 2.00 -0.4% -7.7% Group 16.59 16.02 -3.5% -8.1%* unaudited ** At constant exchange ratesThermal imagingThe demand on this market remains strong for 2022 for our key customers in Europe  the Middle East and also in Asia  where Egide acquired several new customers. The US market is also strong and qualification on new programs at key customers is underway.PowerMainly delivered by Egide USA  deliveries in H1-2021 were inflated due to the lack of deliveries in the previous semester because of the fire in Cambridge. H1-2022 returned to a normal level of activity in this market segment. We now expect this segment to increase as products for thermal battery are qualified and increase in 2022 and beyond.OptronicsWith high-end high-frequency products  it is an area of attention and effort  especially with modernization projects in the framework of Industry 4.0 at the facility in Boll√®ne. The infusion of capital in the US via the sale-leaseback of the Cambridge factory would allow for similar improvements in the HTCC process in the US. This should allow for more activity in the US optronics markets in the coming years.MicrowaveGrowth in this market has been seen at all three facilities. Most of the growth is in defense related companies and in various geographic markets.OUTLOOKEgide SA aims to continue its growth in 2022 and accelerate it in 2023.Egide USA and Santier are expected to finalize their financing of the working capital requirement in the coming days  which will allow them to focus on customer execution and satisfaction.In addition  and for the record  Egide Group should finalize its project to transfer the listing of Egide's shares on the Euronext Growth market in Paris by the end of August 2022. This transfer project aims to enable Egide to be listed on a market more appropriate to the size of the company. The transfer to the Euronext Growth market in Paris would simplify the company's operations and reduce its listing costs  while allowing it to continue to benefit from the advantages of a listing on a financial market.FINANCIAL CALENDAROctober 25   2022 : Press release - 2022 Half-year results (before French market opens).Meeting - 2022 Half Year Results presentation to analysts ‚Äì 10:00 a.m. (Paris Time)CONTACTSEGIDE ‚Äì Luc Ardon ‚Äì FinancialDirector - +33 4 90 30 35 94 ‚Äì luc.ardon@fr.egide-group.comFIN'EXTENSO ‚Äì Press Relations - Isabelle Aprile - +33 1 39 97 61 22 ‚Äì i.aprile@finextenso.frAbout Egide - www.egide-group. comEgide is an international group specializing in the manufacture of hermetic enclosures and heat dissipation solutions for sensitive electronic components.

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:‚ÄúBesi reported solid first half year results with revenue and net income of ‚Ç¨ 416.4 million and ‚Ç¨ 143.2 million increasing by 12.8% and 9.2%  respectively  versus H1-21. Revenue development this first half year was influenced by a number of important market trends. On the positive side  it reflected ongoing strength for Besi‚Äôs computing and automotive end-user markets continuing favorable trends from H2-21. Such strength was partially offset by reduced demand for high-end smartphones following a large capacity build in 2021. It also reflected a 31.4% decrease in revenue from Chinese customers primarily associated with reduced shipments to subcontractors for mobile handsets and mainstream electronics applications due to overcapacity and Covid-19 related lockdowns. Net income growth in H1-22 benefitted from higher revenue levels  stable gross margins of 60.5% and cost control efforts which enabled us to keep operating expense margins relatively flat despite funding a 46.8% increase in R&D spending associated with new wafer level product development.Our liquidity position continued to improve at June 30  2022 with net cash of ‚Ç¨ 284.0 million and total cash and deposits of ‚Ç¨ 601.6 million increasing 37.4% and 17.6%  respectively  versus June 30  2021. Such increases occurred despite the distribution of ‚Ç¨ 305.7 million to shareholders in H1-22 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Given continued strong cash flow generation and current market conditions  we intend to complete the current ‚Ç¨ 185 million share repurchase program by July 31  2022. Beginning August 1  2022  we intend to initiate a new ‚Ç¨ 300 million program representing approximately 7.5% of current shares outstanding with a completion date of October 2023. Repurchases under this new program will help reduce dilution related to Besi‚Äôs Convertible Notes outstanding and issuances under employee stock plans.For the quarter  Besi‚Äôs revenue of ‚Ç¨ 214.0 million and net income of ‚Ç¨ 75.6 million grew by 5.7% and 12.0%  respectively  versus Q1-22. Sequential revenue and profit growth were primarily due to increased shipments for high-end smartphones  an increase of gross margins to 61.0% due to a more favorable product mix  a stronger dollar and a 5.0% reduction in operating expenses. However  orders of ‚Ç¨ 153.1 million decreased by 25.2% versus Q1-22 as industry conditions weakened  global GDP growth rates decelerated and customer caution increased. In particular  they reflected lower bookings for high-end mobile and high performance computing applications as well as lower orders by Asian subcontractors partially offset by continued strength in demand for automotive end-user markets. Of note  we received three orders for Besi‚Äôs new embedded bridge die attach system in H1-22 reflecting progress in the build out of our wafer level assembly portfolio. In addition  Besi‚Äôs backlog of ‚Ç¨ 275 million at June 30  2022 remained at higher than typical levels reflecting ongoing supply chain issues  selective pre ordering by customers and  to a lesser extent  pushouts by some Asian subcontractors given changing market conditions.Whether ‚Äãcurrent market‚Äã softness is a temporary pause or more prolonged in duration is difficult to tell ‚Äãat present ‚Äãgiven the many conflicting economic  geopolitical and industry cross currents. For Q3-22  we estimate that revenue will decrease by 20-30% versus Q2-22 reflecting current market conditions and seasonal trends. However  Besi‚Äôs gross margin is expected to remain in the 60-62% range due to the flexibility of our production model and timely operational actions taken. In this regard  we reduced temporary production headcount approximately 16% in the latter half of the quarter to better align production with order trends. Further  operating expenses are anticipated to decrease by 10-15% versus Q2-22 principally related to lower revenue levels.We are accelerating investment in Besi‚Äôs future  particularly for our hybrid bonding and wafer level assembly portfolio as the long-term drivers of our business remain intact and sub 10 nanometer device innovation continues apace. As such  we are deploying greater resources to meet hybrid bonding goals  introducing new wafer level assembly systems  adding development and support personnel and taking occupancy of a new 125 000 square foot leased facility in Malaysia in Q3-22 which should lessen capacity constraints for our most advanced systems.‚ÄùSecond Quarter Results of Operations‚Ç¨ millions Q2-2022 Q1-2022 Œî Q2-2021 Œî Revenue 214.0 202.4 +5.7% 226.1 -5.4% Orders 153.1 204.8 -25.2% 200.2 -23.5% Book to Bill Ratio 0.7x 1.0x -0.3 0.9 -0.2Q2-22 revenue of ‚Ç¨ 214.0 million increased 5.7% versus Q1-22 primarily due to increased shipments for high-end mobile applications. Versus Q2-21  revenue decreased by 5.4% as a result of significantly lower demand for high-end smartphones post new product introductions in 2021 as well as lower demand for Chinese handset and mainstream electronics applications due to overcapacity and Covid-19 related lockdowns. This decrease was partially offset by strong revenue growth for both Besi‚Äôs computing and automotive end-user markets including shipments of hybrid bonding systems to multiple customers.Orders of ‚Ç¨ 153.1 million decreased 25.2% versus Q1-22 due primarily to lower orders for high-end mobile and high performance computing applications as well as lower orders by Asian subcontractors partially offset by continued strength in demand for automotive end-user markets. Versus Q2-21  orders decreased by 23.5% primarily due to significantly lower demand by Chinese subcontractors and  to a lesser extent  decreased orders for high performance computing applications. Per customer type  IDM orders decreased ‚Ç¨ 10.3 million  or 10.6%  versus Q1-22 and represented 57% of total orders for the period. Subcontractor orders decreased by ‚Ç¨ 41.4 million  or 38.4%  versus Q1-22 and represented 43% of total orders.‚Ç¨ millions Q2-2022 Q1-2022 Œî Q2-2021 Œî Gross Margin 61.0% 60.1% +0.9 62.1% -1.1 Operating Expenses 37.9 39.9 -5.0% 33.6 +12.8% Financial Expense/(Income)  net 5.8 3.7 +56.8% 2.8 +107.1% EBITDA 98.0 87.2 +12.4% 110.9 -11.6%Besi‚Äôs gross margin increased to 61.0% in Q2-22  an increase of 0.9 points versus Q1-22 primarily due to forex benefits from an increase in the USD versus the euro and a more favorable product mix. Gross margin decreased by 1.1 points as compared to Q2-21 due to a less favorable product mix.Q2-22 operating expenses declined by ‚Ç¨ 2.0 million  or 5.0%  versus Q1-22 principally due to a ‚Ç¨ 5.0 million reduction in share-based compensation expense partially offset by increased variable sales related  travel and R&D personnel costs. Operating expenses increased by ‚Ç¨ 4.3 million  or 12.8% versus Q2-21 primarily due to increased R&D spending for next generation wafer level assembly systems. As a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were 17.7% in Q2-22 versus 19.7% in Q1-22 and 14.9% in Q2-21.Q2-22 financial expense  net increased by ‚Ç¨ 2.1 million versus Q1-22 due to increased interest expense from the issuance of ‚Ç¨ 175 million of 1.875% Convertible Notes due 2029 in March 2022  increased hedging expenses and negative forex effects.‚Ç¨ millions Q2-2022 Q1-2022 Œî Q2-2021 Œî Net Income 75.6 67.5 +12.0% 93.5 -19.1% Net Margin 35.4% 33.4% +2.0 41.3% -5.9 Tax Rate 12.7% 13.4% -0.7 10.0% +2.7Besi‚Äôs net income increased 12.0% versus Q1-22 primarily due to increased revenue and gross margins combined with a 5.0% reduction in sequential operating expenses. As a result  Besi‚Äôs net margin increased to 35.4% versus 33.4%. As compared to Q2-21  Besi‚Äôs net income decreased by 19.1% principally as a result of decreased revenue and gross margin levels combined with higher development spending in support of wafer level assembly programs and a higher effective tax rate.Half Year Results of Operations‚Ç¨ millions H1-2022 H1-2021 Œî Revenue 416.4 369.3 +12.8% Orders 357.9 527.3 -32.1% Gross Margin 60.5% 60.5% - Operating Income 174.2 155.0 +12.4% Net Income 143.2 131.1 +9.2% Net Margin 34.4% 35.5% -1.1 Tax Rate 13.1% 11.3% +1.8H1-22 revenue of ‚Ç¨ 416.4 million rose 12.8% reflecting strong demand for Besi‚Äôs computing and automotive end-user markets including increased shipments of hybrid bonding systems. Growth was partially offset by significantly decreased demand for high-end smartphones  decreased shipments for mobile handsets and mainstream electronics applications to Chinese subcontractors and some pushouts of system deliveries due to softening industry conditions. Of note  revenue from Chinese customers decreased by ‚Ç¨ 42.1 million  or 31.4%  year-over-year and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 36.3% in H1-21 to 22.1% in H1-22.Orders of ‚Ç¨ 357.9 million decreased by 32.1% versus H1-21 due to less favorable market conditions post the significant assembly capacity build over the past two years. In particular  the decrease reflected lower orders for high-end smartphones post new product introductions in 2021 and decreased demand from Chinese subcontractors. IDM and subcontractor orders represented 51% and 49%  respectively  of H1-22 orders versus 46% and 54%  respectively  in H1-21.Besi‚Äôs H1-22 net income of ‚Ç¨ 143.2 million grew by ‚Ç¨ 12.1 million  or 9.2%  versus H1-21 due primarily to higher revenue levels. Operating and net margins were roughly equal in each respective period as we successfully controlled overhead growth while increasing development spending by 46.8% in support of wafer level R&D programs.Financial Condition‚Ç¨ millionsQ22022 Q12022 Œî Q22021 Œî H12022 H12021 Œî Total Cash and Deposits 601.6 696.6 -13.6% 511.4 +17.6% 601.6 511.4 +17.6% Net Cash and Deposits 284.0 407.0 -30.2% 206.7 +37.4% 284.0 206.7 +37.4% Cash flow from Ops. 27.6 45.0 -38.7% 51.2 -46.1% 72.5 77.4 -6.3%At the end of Q2-22  Besi had a strong liquidity position with total cash and deposits aggregating ‚Ç¨ 601.6 million  an increase of 17.6% versus Q2-21. Versus Q1-22  total cash and deposits decreased by ‚Ç¨ 95.0 million versus Q1-22 due primarily to (i) the payment of ‚Ç¨ 269.5 million in cash dividends to shareholders  (ii) ‚Ç¨ 22.2 million of share repurchases and (iii) ‚Ç¨ 5.2 million of capitalized development spending which was partially offset by (i) ‚Ç¨ 172.2 million net proceeds received from the issuance of Besi‚Äôs 1.875% Convertible Notes due 2029 and (ii) cash flow from operations of ‚Ç¨ 27.6 million. Net cash of ‚Ç¨ 284.0 million at quarter end increased by ‚Ç¨ 77.3 million  or 37.4%  versus June 30  2021.During Q2-22  ‚Ç¨ 125.6 million of Besi‚Äôs 0.50% Convertible Notes due 2024 were converted into shares.

We achieved significant growth and could maintain a high profit margin despite some headwinds from currencies. Since the beginning of the year  we increased our worldwide headcount by a good 1 500  and the recent acquisitions are contributing to our business development as expected. Given the healthy underlying demand in our industry and good order situation  we confirm our full-year outlook as well as our ambitious investment program  despite higher inflation and lower corona-related demand. However  the global political and economic uncertainties  the resulting strained supply chains  and thus also the uncertainties of projections and outlooks remain high "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1In the first half of the year  Group sales revenue rose by 22.1 percent year-over-year in constant currencies (reported: + 27.5 percent) to around 1 724 million euros. This good performance was mainly driven by organic growth  while acquisitions2 contributed around 2 percentage points to sales revenue growth. All major product segments contributed to this positive development with clear double-digit growth rates  while business with vaccine manufacturers normalized faster than expected. All three business regions ‚Äì EMEA3  Americas  and Asia | Pacific ‚Äì posted double-digit percentage growth in constant currencies. The restrictions in China caused by the pandemic had a relatively minor impact on growth.Following the extraordinarily high growth rates due to the pandemic in the first half of 2021  order intake also continued to normalize and reached 1 827 million euros  which was  as expected  slightly below the prior-year figure of 1 890 million euros (in constant currencies: -7.3 percent  reported -3.3 percent).Following the strong growth in sales revenue  underlying EBITDA rose by 24.5 percent to 607 million euros in the first half of the year. The corresponding margin reached 35.2 percent (prior-year period: 36.1 percent). The development was influenced by positive economies of scale which were offset by negative currency effects and  as planned  higher costs due to new employees and an increase in the number of business trips. Effects from price trends and adjustments on the purchasing and customer sides largely compensated each other.Relevant net profit reached 405 million euros  up 26.0 percent from the prior-year period. Underlying earnings per share were 4.40 euros (prior-year period: 3.49 euros).Key financial indicatorsThe Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. As of June 30  2022  its equity ratio stood at 48.6 percent (December 31  2021: 43.9 percent). The ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA was 0.5 as of the reporting date  compared with 0.4 at year-end 2021. Cash flow from investing activities stood at ‚Äì180 million euros  compared with -114 million euros in the first half of 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue reached 10.4 percent (prior-year period: 8.4 percent).Increase in the number of employeesAs of June 30  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech employed a total of 11 942 people worldwide  representing a headcount increase of 1 533 from the end of December 2021.Outlook for fiscal 2022 confirmedThe management confirms its outlook for the current fiscal year. Consolidated sales revenue is expected to increase by about 15 percent to 19 percent with non-organic growth from acquisitions projected to contribute about 2 percentage points. Regarding profitability  Sartorius Stedim Biotech continues to expect its underlying EBITDA margin to reach more than 35 percent.The CAPEX ratio is anticipated to be about 14.5 percent and net debt to underlying EBITDA to be about 0.2 at year-end. Possible further acquisitions are not included in this projection.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends. Moreover  the forecasts are based on the assumption of no further deterioration in the geopolitical and global economic situation  supply chains  inflation and energy supply  and no new relevant restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. Accordingly  current forecasts show even higher uncertainties than usual.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

Exchanges want a 15-minute delay before the mandatory handing over of their data. Banks and investment funds say a tape will be of no use if not in real time.The plans pit exchanges like Deutsche Boerse and Euronext  keen to keep control over data  against asset managers and banks who say that data on share trades is too expensive -- a complaint rejected by exchanges.The European Parliament and EU states will have the final say on the proposed legislation.Danuta Huebner is leading negotiations on parliament's side and will propose exempting platforms which represent less than 1% of total EU daily trading from supplying prices to the tape  an excerpt from her upcoming report  leaked to the press  said.Platforms which ""do not contribute significantly to the fragmentation of EU markets"" would also be exempt  but bourses that do not make use of an exemption should get a higher share of the tape's revenues.Smaller bourses  such as in eastern Europe  would benefit if the amendment is backed by parliament and EU states.In a move banks will welcome  Huebner  who had no immediate comment  backed the draft law's provision for a tape giving real-time prices.It was also ""essential"" that the share tape contains ""pre-trade"" information  the excerpt says  a step industry bodies like the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME https://www.afme.eu/news/press-releases/details/AFME-BVI-Cboe-Europe-and-EFAMA-Agree-Cross-Industry-Consensus-on-EU-Equity-Consolidated-Tape) have called for. The draft law only refers to ""post-trade"" prices or completed transactions.FESE  which represents exchanges in Europe  said the proposals would further concentrate share trading among large  non-EU investment banks.""We will continue to advocate for a package of market structure measures... but not one that publishes pre-trade data  creating an illusory view of the market "" FESE said.The efficient functioning of Europe's markets is now even more critical to fund the economy given the financial impact of war in Ukraine  said AFME CEO Adam Farkas.",neutral,0.03,0.82,0.14,mixed,0.12,0.18,0.7,True,English,"['Market Data Waiver', 'EU Lawmaker', 'Smaller Bourses', 'AFME CEO Adam Farkas', 'total EU daily trading', 'large, non-EU investment banks', 'mandatory handing over', 'senior EU lawmaker', 'market structure measures', 'The European Parliament', 'EU draft law', 'Smaller stock exchanges', 'investment funds', 'share trading', 'European Union', 'stock, bond', 'EU states', 'EU markets', 'real-time record', 'consolidated tapes', 'real time', 'best deals', '15-minute delay', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'asset managers', 'share trades', 'final say', 'upcoming report', 'higher share', 'Smaller bourses', 'immediate comment', 'trade"" information', 'industry bodies', 'illusory view', 'efficient functioning', 'financial impact', 'derivatives markets', 'Financial Markets', 'market prices', 'real-time prices', 'post-trade"" prices', 'Danuta Huebner', 'eastern Europe', 'pre-trade data', 'share tape', 'transactions', 'investors', '27 countries', 'platforms', 'aim', 'use', 'plans', 'Euronext', 'control', 'complaint', 'legislation', 'negotiations', 'side', 'less', 'excerpt', 'press', 'fragmentation', 'exemption', 'revenues', 'amendment', 'move', 'provision', 'step', 'Association', 'details', 'AFME-BVI-Cboe-Europe', 'EFAMA-Agree-Cross-Industry-Consensus', 'EU-Equity-Consolidated-Tape', 'completed', 'FESE', 'proposals', 'package', 'economy', 'war', 'Ukraine']",2022-07-22,2022-07-22,ibtimes.com

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/LONDON  July 22 (Reuters) - Smaller stock exchanges in the European Union should be exempt from having to supply market prices to a real-time record of transactions for investors  a senior EU lawmaker has proposed.An EU draft law is mandating ""consolidated tapes"" to mesh stock  bond and derivatives markets spread across 27 countries by forcing platforms to supply prices as close to real time as possible to investors. read moreThe aim is to enable investors to find the best deals.

The pace of investments continued to accelerate during the second quarter with seven investments in total amounting to ‚Ç¨7.6m. Flow Traders has completed 19 investments to date for a total value of ‚Ç¨14.3mAs part of its investment strategy  Flow Traders Capital most recently formed part of the consortium to drive the expansion of RFQ-Hub to create the leading global institutional multi-asset RFQ platformIn addition  Flow Traders Capital further built its global presence in the digital asset and decentralized finance space by having completed strategic minority investments in Thalex  Tonic  Elwood  Ondo  BloXroute and Astaria which are all highly innovative ventures that accelerate growth  create greater transparency in financial markets and enable financial ecosystem scalabilityOutlookDuring the first quarter  a systematic exercise was undertaken to shift the total compensation mix of certain employee groups towards a greater fixed component which meant that targeted base compensation increases have been implemented. To account for the shift in total compensation mix  the profit sharing percentage for employees has been adjusted to 32.5% of operating result  from 35% previously. This ensures that the shift in compensation mix is income statement neutral going forward. This change was implemented in the second quarter which has led to a catch-up effect in the Q222 results. This adjusted profit sharing percentage will be used going forwardGrowth in fixed operating expenses (excluding one-off expenses) in 2022 is now expected to be approximately 25% given the shift in total compensation mix towards higher levels of base compensation as well as the impact across all categories of the strengthening US dollar. The impact of the base compensation increases will be offset by the adjustment of the profit sharing percentage to 32.5% of operating result. The expectation is that the maximum annual growth in fixed operating expenses will revert to the c. 10-15% levelThe second quarter saw further one-off strategy related costs being incurred  which are again expected to deliver meaningful benefits going forward. These relate specifically to optimization of group legal entity and regulatory structure and further balance sheet review efforts. The expectation is that the vast majority of these costs have now been absorbed during the second quarter. Flow Traders remains focused on underlying cost efficiency and discipline while executing the overall strategic growth agendaFlow Traders announces a share buyback program for a total aggregate consideration of up to ‚Ç¨25m over a period of 12 months from the start of the forthcoming open period. The purpose of the buyback is to return excess capital to shareholders. The intention is that shares repurchased as part of this program will initially be held in treasury until cancellationManagement Board CommentsDennis Dijkstra  CEO  stated:‚ÄúThe strengths of our business remained very much evident during the second quarter. A robust risk management approach along with pricing and hedging expertise enabled the successful navigation of the recent volatility in the crypto markets. Our institutional counterparty base continues to grow quarter on quarter as Flow Traders‚Äô trading proposition across multiple asset classes is increasingly utilized by the buyside. It is also highly satisfying that we will soon be able to open an office in Shanghai in line with our plans to enter the mainland China market. We have also worked hard to build on our strong offering to current and prospective employees both from a culture as well as a compensation mix perspective. We have expanded our offices in every region and all colleagues are now all back in the office. We have long held the firm belief that we are an employer of choice  and it is pleasing to note that this has also been recognized externally by MT 500 where we ranked in the top 10% of companies with the best reputation in The Netherlands. Lastly  within the context of our capital allocation framework  we have elected to pay a ‚Ç¨0.70 interim dividend to shareholders as well as launching a share buyback program. This buyback in combination with the proposed final dividend will further enhance capital returns to shareholders.‚ÄùFolkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:‚ÄúThe second quarter saw more normalised market conditions with lower levels of activity compared to Q1. Nonetheless  we delivered a resilient trading performance in Q2. Our trading footprint continues to grow with more counterparties onboarded as well additional connectivity to trading platforms. With this in mind  we remain active in enhancing our coverage of fixed income  commodity  and FX markets. The recent volatility in the crypto markets has not altered our conviction around the long term potential of crypto and decentralised finance both from a trading as well as a technological and financial markets innovation standpoint. With our generally market neutral approach  we continuously provided liquidity across these markets in Q2 which once again highlights our trading capabilities  strong risk framework and consistently improving technology stack.Mike Kuehnel  Chief Financial Officer  added:‚ÄúThe whole team is looking forward to sharing our strategic ambition at today‚Äôs capital markets update  which reflects the strong conviction we have in the future of Flow Traders. One aspect of this strategic roadmap has been the creation of Flow Traders Capital  our dedicated corporate venture capital unit  which formalises our accelerating strategic ecosystem approach. This approach has led to seven minority investments since the start of the second quarter. From an operating cost perspective  we have adjusted the profit-sharing percentage to better reflect the shift in compensation mix following the systematic increase in base compensation for certain employee groups. This ensures that the base compensation increases are income statement neutral. There were also one-off expenses incurred this quarter relating to optimization of group legal entity and regulatory structure as well as further balance sheet review efforts  which are all expected to deliver meaningful benefits going forward. Our strong focus on underlying cost efficiency remains.‚ÄùPreliminary Financial Calendar16 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend ex-dividend date17 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend record date19 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend payment date30 September 2022 Start silent period ahead of Q322 trading update27 October 2022 Release Q322 trading update (no analyst conference call)Analyst Conference Call and WebcastThe Q222 results analyst conference call will be held at 10:00 am CEST on Friday 22 July 2022.

But you might be surprised at what these funds actually hold these days.According to data from Bank of America  6% of ESG funds in Europe now have investments in Shell ‚Äî one of the oil and gas supermajors. A year ago  none of the funds owned the company.‚ÄúWe believe [some] ESG funds are revisiting the cost of exclusion [of energy companies] given their underperformance in the first half of 2022 or waiting for regulations to be finalised amid greenwashing fears ‚Äù says Bank of America‚Äôs ESG strategist Menka Bajaj.With strong oil prices  traditional energy stocks are firing on all cylinders. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) is up 24% year to date. That‚Äôs in stark contrast with the S&P 500‚Äôs 17% decline over the same period.In fact  Wall Street sees further upside in the sector. Here‚Äôs a look at three companies that analysts find particularly attractive.Don‚Äôt missMitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger demand for these two physical assets ‚Äî get in now before the super-rich swarmThere‚Äôs a ‚Äòperfect storm‚Äô brewing in the multifamily housing market ‚Äî here are 3 of the easiest ways to take advantageWarren Buffett likes these 2 investment opportunities outside of the stock marketShell (SHEL)Let‚Äôs start with Shell ‚Äî the company so attractive that even ESG funds couldn‚Äôt say no to.Headquartered in London  Shell is a multinational energy giant with operations in more than 70 countries. It produces around 3.2 barrels of oil equivalent per day  has an interest in 10 refineries  and sold 64.2 million tons of liquefied natural gas last year.It‚Äôs a staple for global investors  too. Shell is listed on the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam  and the New York Stock Exchange.Energy stocks have pulled back over the past month and Shell was caught in the sell-off as well. However  its NYSE-listed shares are still up 9.4% year to date.Story continuesPiper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd sees opportunity in the company. On Tuesday  the analyst reiterated an ‚Äòoverweight‚Äô rating on Shell while raising his price target from $69 to $75.Considering that Shell trades at around $49 per share today  Todd‚Äôs new price target implies a potential upside of 53%.Chevron (CVX)Chevron is another oil and gas supermajor that‚Äôs benefiting from the commodity boom.For Q1  the company reported earnings of $6.3 billion  which more than quadrupled the $1.4 billion in the same period last year. Revenue totaled $54.4 billion for the quarter  up 70% year over year.In January  Chevron‚Äôs board approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend rate to $1.42 per share. That gives the company an annual dividend yield of 3.9%.The stock has enjoyed a nice rally too  climbing 22% in 2022.HSBC analyst Gordon Gray expects the fun to continue. The analyst recently upgraded Chevron from ‚Äòhold‚Äô to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô and set a price target of $167 ‚Äî roughly 15% above where the stock sits today.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Commanding a market cap of nearly $370 billion  Exxon Mobil is bigger than Shell and Chevron.The company also boasts the strongest stock price performance among the trio in 2022 ‚Äî Exxon shares are up 38% year to date.It‚Äôs not hard to see why investors like the stock: the oil-producing giant gushes profits and cash flow. In Q1  Exxon earned $5.5 billion in profits  a huge increase from the $2.7 billion in the year-ago period. Free cash flow totaled $10.8 billion for the quarter  compared to $6.9 billion in the same period last year.Solid financials allow the company to return cash to investors. Exxon pays quarterly dividends of 88 cents per share  translating to an annual yield of 4.0%. Management has also increased the company‚Äôs share repurchase program to up to $30 billion through 2023.Bank of America analyst Doug Leggate has a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô rating on Exxon and a price target of $120. That implies a potential upside of 37% from the current levels.What to read nextSign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.US is only a few days away from an ‚Äòabsolute explosion‚Äô on inflation ‚Äî here are 3 shockproof sectors to help protect your portfolio‚ÄòThere‚Äôs always a bull market somewhere‚Äô: Jim Cramer‚Äôs famous words suggest you can make money no matter what.

Exchanges want a 15-minute delay before the mandatory handing over of their data. Banks and investment funds say a tape will be of no use if not in real time.The plans pit exchanges like Deutsche Boerse and Euronext  keen to keep control over data  against asset managers and banks who say that data on share trades is too expensive ‚Äî a complaint rejected by exchanges.The European Parliament and EU states will have the final say on the proposed legislation.Danuta Huebner is leading negotiations on parliament‚Äôs side and will propose exempting platforms which represent less than 1% of total EU daily trading from supplying prices to the tape  an excerpt from her upcoming report  leaked to the press  said.Platforms which ‚Äúdo not contribute significantly to the fragmentation of EU markets‚Äù would also be exempt  but bourses that do not make use of an exemption should get a higher share of the tape‚Äôs revenues.Smaller bourses  such as in eastern Europe  would benefit if the amendment is backed by parliament and EU states.In a move banks will welcome  Huebner  who had no immediate comment  backed the draft law‚Äôs provision for a tape giving real-time prices.It was also ‚Äúessential‚Äù that the share tape contains ‚Äúpre-trade‚Äù information  the excerpt says  a step industry bodies like the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME https://www.afme.eu/news/press-releases/details/AFME-BVI-Cboe-Europe-and-EFAMA-Agree-Cross-Industry-Consensus-on-EU-Equity-Consolidated-Tape) have called for. The draft law only refers to ‚Äúpost-trade‚Äù prices or completed transactions.FESE  which represents exchanges in Europe  said the proposals would further concentrate share trading among large  non-EU investment banks.‚ÄúWe will continue to advocate for a package of market structure measures‚Ä¶ but not one that publishes pre-trade data  creating an illusory view of the market ‚Äù FESE said.The efficient functioning of Europe‚Äôs markets is now even more critical to fund the economy given the financial impact of war in Ukraine  said AFME CEO Adam Farkas.(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Susan Fenton),neutral,0.04,0.84,0.12,mixed,0.11,0.19,0.7,True,English,"['market data waiver', 'EU lawmaker', 'smaller bourses', 'AFME CEO Adam Farkas', 'total EU daily trading', 'large, non-EU investment banks', 'market structure measures', 'The European Parliament', 'EU draft law', 'investment funds', 'share trading', 'EU states', 'EU markets', 'consolidated tapes', 'stock, bond', 'real time', 'best deals', '15-minute delay', 'mandatory handing', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'asset managers', 'share trades', 'final say', 'upcoming report', 'higher share', 'immediate comment', 'trade‚Äù information', 'industry bodies', 'illusory view', 'efficient functioning', 'financial impact', 'Huw Jones', 'Susan Fenton', 'derivatives markets', 'Financial Markets', 'Danuta Huebner', 'Smaller bourses', 'real-time prices', 'post-trade‚Äù prices', 'eastern Europe', 'pre-trade data', 'share tape', '27 countries', 'platforms', 'investors', 'aim', 'Exchanges', 'use', 'plans', 'Euronext', 'control', 'complaint', 'legislation', 'negotiations', 'side', 'less', 'excerpt', 'press', 'fragmentation', 'exemption', 'revenues', 'amendment', 'move', 'provision', 'step', 'Association', 'news', 'releases', 'AFME-BVI-Cboe-Europe', 'EFAMA-Agree-Cross-Industry-Consensus', 'EU-Equity-Consolidated-Tape', 'completed', 'transactions', 'FESE', 'proposals', 'package', 'economy', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Editing']",2022-07-22,2022-07-22,fxempire.com

Exchanges want a 15-minute delay before the mandatory handing over of their data. Banks and investment funds say a tape will be of no use if not in real time.The plans pit exchanges like Deutsche Boerse and Euronext  keen to keep control over data  against asset managers and banks who say that data on share trades is too expensive -- a complaint rejected by exchanges.The European Parliament and EU states will have the final say on the proposed legislation.Danuta Huebner is leading negotiations on parliament's side and will propose exempting platforms which represent less than 1% of total EU daily trading from supplying prices to the tape  an excerpt from her upcoming report  leaked to the press  said.Platforms which ""do not contribute significantly to the fragmentation of EU markets"" would also be exempt  but bourses that do not make use of an exemption should get a higher share of the tape's revenues.Smaller bourses  such as in eastern Europe  would benefit if the amendment is backed by parliament and EU states.In a move banks will welcome  Huebner  who had no immediate comment  backed the draft law's provision for a tape giving real-time prices.It was also ""essential"" that the share tape contains ""pre-trade"" information  the excerpt says  a step industry bodies like the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME https://www.afme.eu/news/press-releases/details/AFME-BVI-Cboe-Europe-and-EFAMA-Agree-Cross-Industry-Consensus-on-EU-Equity-Consolidated-Tape) have called for. The draft law only refers to ""post-trade"" prices or completed transactions.Story continuesFESE  which represents exchanges in Europe  said the proposals would further concentrate share trading among large  non-EU investment banks.""We will continue to advocate for a package of market structure measures... but not one that publishes pre-trade data  creating an illusory view of the market "" FESE said.The efficient functioning of Europe's markets is now even more critical to fund the economy given the financial impact of war in Ukraine  said AFME CEO Adam Farkas.(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Susan Fenton)",neutral,0.04,0.84,0.12,mixed,0.17,0.2,0.63,True,English,"['market data waiver', 'EU lawmaker', 'smaller bourses', 'AFME CEO Adam Farkas', 'total EU daily trading', 'large, non-EU investment banks', 'German stock exchange', 'senior EU lawmaker', 'market structure measures', 'The European Parliament', 'EU draft law', 'Smaller stock exchanges', 'investment funds', 'stock, bond', 'trading floor', 'trading day', 'European Union', 'share trading', 'EU states', 'EU markets', 'FILE PHOTO', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Huw Jones', 'real-time record', 'consolidated tapes', 'real time', 'best deals', '15-minute delay', 'mandatory handing', 'asset managers', 'share trades', 'final say', 'upcoming report', 'higher share', 'Smaller bourses', 'immediate comment', 'trade"" information', 'industry bodies', 'illusory view', 'efficient functioning', 'financial impact', 'Susan Fenton', 'derivatives markets', 'Financial Markets', 'market prices', 'real-time prices', 'post-trade"" prices', 'Danuta Huebner', 'exempting platforms', 'eastern Europe', 'pre-trade data', 'share tape', 'end', 'Frankfurt', 'LONDON', 'Reuters', 'transactions', 'investors', '27 countries', 'aim', 'use', 'plans', 'Euronext', 'control', 'complaint', 'legislation', 'negotiations', 'side', 'less', 'excerpt', 'press', 'fragmentation', 'exemption', 'revenues', 'move', 'provision', 'step', 'Association', 'details', 'AFME-BVI-Cboe-Europe', 'EFAMA-Agree-Cross-Industry-Consensus', 'EU-Equity-Consolidated-Tape', 'completed', 'Story', 'FESE', 'proposals', 'package', 'economy', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Editing']",2022-07-22,2022-07-22,sg.news.yahoo.com

8043,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/the-evolution-of-equity-derivatives-an-asset-class-thats-all-grown-up/,The evolution of equity derivatives: an asset class that‚Äôs all grown up,Given the latest developments for the asset class in today‚Äôs unprecedented climate of volatility  Wesley Bray looks at how equity derivatives have evolved over the years - and how the big European exchanges are battling it out to differentiate themselves in the current competitive marketplace.,Infant stagesEquity derivatives  as we know them today  are financial instruments that derive their value from price movements of underlying assets  typically a stock or stock index. They‚Äôre popular with traders as a means both to speculate  and to manage risk for their stock portfolio. The asset class usually takes on two key forms: equity options and equity index futures  but other forms such as equity swaps  warrants and single-stock futures also exist.Today  the equity derivatives landscape is highly competitive  with major European exchanges such as ICE  Eurex  Euronext  CME Group ‚Äì and new player Cboe Europe Derivatives (CEDX) ‚Äì consistently battling it out for market share. However  it‚Äôs only over the last two decades that this competition has really emerged.Historically  apart from single stock futures and options  competition among European exchanges in the equity derivatives space has been limited  largely because Europe‚Äôs index futures and options markets were predominantly domestic. For example  if investors wanted to trade German equity derivatives  they would do so on the German exchange and if they were looking to trade Italian equity derivatives  they would do so on the Italian exchange  and so on.Learning to walkConfinements to national boundaries inevitably limited the scope for competition amongst European exchanges  but with the introduction of the European Monetary Union in the 1990s and the opportunity to trade across borders  the needs of customers and the available opportunities were suddenly slightly different ‚Äì providing a fertile environment for competition to grow.When looking at the differences between the European equity derivatives market and that of the US  Ade Cordell  president of Cboe NL  notes: ‚ÄúWhen compared to its US counterpart  the European options market is significantly smaller  even though both economies are of similar size.‚ÄúAt least two reasons why this is the case come to mind. First  in order to build a pan-European exposure  established participants had to connect to multiple venues and clearing houses  adhere to different pricing structures  and use different market models. Conforming to this access model can prove to be challenging for new participants looking to access this geography.‚ÄúSecond  the European options market is dominated by a pre-arranged block trading model  often referred to as a call-around market. Larger transactions are agreed off-exchange and reported on a delayed basis  therefore limiting the ability of exchanges to compete for on-screen liquidity and in turn slowing the growth of the market. This contrasts markedly with what participants are accustomed to in the US  which has a highly liquid  on-screen based equity and index options market.‚ÄùComing of ageThe European equity derivatives market place has  however  since begun to shift ‚Äì with competition continuing to grow. ICE  which describes itself as the home of the UK derivatives market  has FTSE derivatives and the MSCI derivatives as its two largest product suites ‚Äì of which it boasts over 95% and 73% market share  respectively. Meanwhile  Cboe Derivatives Exchange has the CBOE UK 100  which competes directly with FTSE derivatives. Elsewhere  Eurex provides the Euro STOXX derivatives  which it dominates  among several other listings. This brings into question how the big exchanges can differentiate themselves in this highly competitive market ‚Äì especially given that exchanges sometimes offer products that are very similar. Breaking into this market is no easy task  especially with established players dominating the landscape. So how exactly do you stand out? One thing all major exchanges agree upon is the need for liquidity when offering equity derivatives.‚ÄúLiquidity is key. Exchanges are constantly listing alternative or lookalike products but building liquidity in new products is very difficult. If there is a more established product that is already very liquid  clients will just continue to use that ‚Äù says Caterina Caramaschi  global head of equity derivatives at ICE.‚ÄúIn addition to liquidity  something that is increasingly on the forefront of traders‚Äô minds is margin efficiencies as a result of regulatory changes (UMR) and the recent spike in volatility. For example  we offer the most liquid FTSE 100 futures and options contracts globally  we also offer the most liquid MSCI Index Futures globally  covering both Developed and Emerging Market Index Futures. Our clearing houses hold the largest pool of open interest in FTSE UK Index Futures and options and MSCI Index Futures  making ICE the most margin efficient venue to trade these products.‚ÄúIn January we went live with IRM2 on ICE Clear US for our MSCI Index Futures. IRM2 is ICE‚Äôs new Value-at-Risk (VaR)-based portfolio margining methodology that models the behaviour of a portfolio as a whole rather than measuring risk on an instrument by instrument basis. IRM2 has brought even further risk-appropriate capital efficiencies for clearing members and their customers. And finally  how else can exchanges differentiate themselves in this competitive environment? By listening to your clients. Give clients what they want as opposed to what you ‚Äòthink‚Äô they want. We are here to serve our clients by giving them tools to risk manage their portfolios.‚ÄùHaving a broad offering can also help exchanges differentiate themselves and improve their overall competitiveness. Michael Peters  chief executive of Eurex Frankfurt  notes: ‚ÄúThe broader your offering is  the more attractive you will be for the market. However  the total cost of trading is an important element as well. This includes not only the actual trading fees  but also the capital costs incurred through clearing and the costs for providing collateral.‚ÄúThese capital costs are of course largely determined by your margining system and possible portfolio margining efficiencies. The more diverse your product portfolio is and the more derivatives on individual index components are offered in addition to index derivatives  the higher  of course  the potential for portfolio margining efficiencies that can then be realised by market participants.‚ÄùNew kid on the blockDifferentiating yourself and ensuring you stay afloat in a market that is as competitive as the equity derivatives landscape is a feat on its own. But how easy is it to enter the space when established exchanges such as Ice  Eurex  Euronext and CME Group are already so dominant? Cboe chose to take this task upon itself with the launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives (CEDX) in September last year.‚ÄúWe believe there is a significant opportunity to bring competition to and grow the European equity derivatives market through a differentiated model and CEDX is looking to achieve this in a number of ways ‚Äù says Cordell.‚ÄúFirstly  the exchange places a strong emphasis on lit order book trading to encourage more on-screen liquidity for equity and equity index options trading in Europe. We have designed our market from a pan-European point-of-view  enabling market participants to access a modern derivatives market through a single access point  creating meaningful efficiencies in trading and clearing. Through a single connection to CEDX  participants can trade a broad range of European country and regional equity strategies  compared to having to connect to multiple domestic venues and clearers currently.‚ÄúFinally  we also have the consistency of product and index construction. CEDX products are based on Cboe Europe indices  which are highly correlated benchmarks powered by Cboe Europe market data. These indices are designed and managed under the same methodology  meaning our derivatives contracts have a uniform set of underlying indices and rules. From a futures and options contract design standpoint  our derivative contracts also encompass the feedback that participants have relayed to us  including right-sized index contracts with appropriately calibrated tick sizes.‚ÄùGrowing painsWith ongoing competition and exchanges‚Äô need to consistently improve their offerings  the equity derivatives market is set to continue to flourish  giving market participants enhanced products as well as better costs of trading. In a landscape where a lot of ‚Äòlook-alike‚Äô products exists  it is interesting to see how exchanges respond to requests to launch new or enhanced products.‚ÄúWhen you launch a new product  ask yourself is there a need for this  will this add to a trader‚Äôs risk management toolbox or are we just launching more of the same? As exchanges  we need to look at the over-the-counter (OTC) space and provide more capital efficient alternatives to the OTC market. Of course  this comes with its challenges  as you are taking a highly flexible OTC product and standardising it by bringing it on exchange. This could mean a change in how the product is traded and reported  thus  impacting clients back-office systems and vendors etc  and all this requires resources ‚Äù says Caramaschi.‚ÄúWe are continuously looking at the OTC space and trying to find ways to bring this business on exchange. We started doing this back in 2005  with the launch of Bclear (now ICE Block) and more recently  we have focused on the ESG and climate change products with the launch of the MSCI ESG Leaders and MSCI Climate PAI Futures  as interest in socially responsible investing grows. We continue to work with our clients to improve our existing products and launch new products to complement our FTSE and MSCI derivatives offering.‚ÄùBuilding liquidity does pose challenges to the launch of new products as well  especially given that it can take a while to do so. Cordell agrees that launching new products can prove challenging  however  notes that ‚Äú[Cboe‚Äôs] experience in the market so far confirms [its] belief that firms have capital to deploy in the European options market if on-screen market liquidity can be improved. Speaking more broadly  we think participants have resources and time available to assess new exchanges and contracts  particularly with major implementation projects associated with MiFID II and Brexit now behind them.‚ÄùIn a slightly different take  Eurex‚Äôs Peters says that launching new products is easy  however  he notes that: ‚ÄúThe question is to what extent you are able to attract interest and generate liquidity as a market operator. That  in turn  depends on the willingness of liquidity providers to quote prices  which is an effort. Here  of course  we are in competition. Equally important is whether products can attract customer flow by the buy-side. And these customer groups will  of course  look closely at where attractive liquidity already exists and where the market is sufficiently deep to be able to execute trades without market impact. In addition  cost efficiency plays an important role for customers.‚ÄùA bright futureCompetition within the equity derivatives space is likely to continue in the coming years and the level of competition is something that exchanges seem to view as valuable ‚Äì even healthy. Whether new entrants will (or can) enter the space is yet to be seen  but given Cboe Europe Derivatives‚Äô attempt  we could see more players enter this buzzing asset class.
