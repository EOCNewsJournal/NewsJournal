The pace of investments continued to accelerate during the second quarter with seven investments in total amounting to ‚Ç¨7.6m. Flow Traders has completed 19 investments to date for a total value of ‚Ç¨14.3mAs part of its investment strategy  Flow Traders Capital most recently formed part of the consortium to drive the expansion of RFQ-Hub to create the leading global institutional multi-asset RFQ platformIn addition  Flow Traders Capital further built its global presence in the digital asset and decentralized finance space by having completed strategic minority investments in Thalex  Tonic  Elwood  Ondo  BloXroute and Astaria which are all highly innovative ventures that accelerate growth  create greater transparency in financial markets and enable financial ecosystem scalabilityOutlookDuring the first quarter  a systematic exercise was undertaken to shift the total compensation mix of certain employee groups towards a greater fixed component which meant that targeted base compensation increases have been implemented. To account for the shift in total compensation mix  the profit sharing percentage for employees has been adjusted to 32.5% of operating result  from 35% previously. This ensures that the shift in compensation mix is income statement neutral going forward. This change was implemented in the second quarter which has led to a catch-up effect in the Q222 results. This adjusted profit sharing percentage will be used going forwardGrowth in fixed operating expenses (excluding one-off expenses) in 2022 is now expected to be approximately 25% given the shift in total compensation mix towards higher levels of base compensation as well as the impact across all categories of the strengthening US dollar. The impact of the base compensation increases will be offset by the adjustment of the profit sharing percentage to 32.5% of operating result. The expectation is that the maximum annual growth in fixed operating expenses will revert to the c. 10-15% levelThe second quarter saw further one-off strategy related costs being incurred  which are again expected to deliver meaningful benefits going forward. These relate specifically to optimization of group legal entity and regulatory structure and further balance sheet review efforts. The expectation is that the vast majority of these costs have now been absorbed during the second quarter. Flow Traders remains focused on underlying cost efficiency and discipline while executing the overall strategic growth agendaFlow Traders announces a share buyback program for a total aggregate consideration of up to ‚Ç¨25m over a period of 12 months from the start of the forthcoming open period. The purpose of the buyback is to return excess capital to shareholders. The intention is that shares repurchased as part of this program will initially be held in treasury until cancellationManagement Board CommentsDennis Dijkstra  CEO  stated:‚ÄúThe strengths of our business remained very much evident during the second quarter. A robust risk management approach along with pricing and hedging expertise enabled the successful navigation of the recent volatility in the crypto markets. Our institutional counterparty base continues to grow quarter on quarter as Flow Traders‚Äô trading proposition across multiple asset classes is increasingly utilized by the buyside. It is also highly satisfying that we will soon be able to open an office in Shanghai in line with our plans to enter the mainland China market. We have also worked hard to build on our strong offering to current and prospective employees both from a culture as well as a compensation mix perspective. We have expanded our offices in every region and all colleagues are now all back in the office. We have long held the firm belief that we are an employer of choice  and it is pleasing to note that this has also been recognized externally by MT 500 where we ranked in the top 10% of companies with the best reputation in The Netherlands. Lastly  within the context of our capital allocation framework  we have elected to pay a ‚Ç¨0.70 interim dividend to shareholders as well as launching a share buyback program. This buyback in combination with the proposed final dividend will further enhance capital returns to shareholders.‚ÄùFolkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:‚ÄúThe second quarter saw more normalised market conditions with lower levels of activity compared to Q1. Nonetheless  we delivered a resilient trading performance in Q2. Our trading footprint continues to grow with more counterparties onboarded as well additional connectivity to trading platforms. With this in mind  we remain active in enhancing our coverage of fixed income  commodity  and FX markets. The recent volatility in the crypto markets has not altered our conviction around the long term potential of crypto and decentralised finance both from a trading as well as a technological and financial markets innovation standpoint. With our generally market neutral approach  we continuously provided liquidity across these markets in Q2 which once again highlights our trading capabilities  strong risk framework and consistently improving technology stack.Mike Kuehnel  Chief Financial Officer  added:‚ÄúThe whole team is looking forward to sharing our strategic ambition at today‚Äôs capital markets update  which reflects the strong conviction we have in the future of Flow Traders. One aspect of this strategic roadmap has been the creation of Flow Traders Capital  our dedicated corporate venture capital unit  which formalises our accelerating strategic ecosystem approach. This approach has led to seven minority investments since the start of the second quarter. From an operating cost perspective  we have adjusted the profit-sharing percentage to better reflect the shift in compensation mix following the systematic increase in base compensation for certain employee groups. This ensures that the base compensation increases are income statement neutral. There were also one-off expenses incurred this quarter relating to optimization of group legal entity and regulatory structure as well as further balance sheet review efforts  which are all expected to deliver meaningful benefits going forward. Our strong focus on underlying cost efficiency remains.‚ÄùPreliminary Financial Calendar16 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend ex-dividend date17 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend record date19 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend payment date30 September 2022 Start silent period ahead of Q322 trading update27 October 2022 Release Q322 trading update (no analyst conference call)Analyst Conference Call and WebcastThe Q222 results analyst conference call will be held at 10:00 am CEST on Friday 22 July 2022.

But you might be surprised at what these funds actually hold these days.According to data from Bank of America  6% of ESG funds in Europe now have investments in Shell ‚Äî one of the oil and gas supermajors. A year ago  none of the funds owned the company.‚ÄúWe believe [some] ESG funds are revisiting the cost of exclusion [of energy companies] given their underperformance in the first half of 2022 or waiting for regulations to be finalised amid greenwashing fears ‚Äù says Bank of America‚Äôs ESG strategist Menka Bajaj.With strong oil prices  traditional energy stocks are firing on all cylinders. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) is up 24% year to date. That‚Äôs in stark contrast with the S&P 500‚Äôs 17% decline over the same period.In fact  Wall Street sees further upside in the sector. Here‚Äôs a look at three companies that analysts find particularly attractive.Don‚Äôt missMitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger demand for these two physical assets ‚Äî get in now before the super-rich swarmThere‚Äôs a ‚Äòperfect storm‚Äô brewing in the multifamily housing market ‚Äî here are 3 of the easiest ways to take advantageWarren Buffett likes these 2 investment opportunities outside of the stock marketShell (SHEL)Let‚Äôs start with Shell ‚Äî the company so attractive that even ESG funds couldn‚Äôt say no to.Headquartered in London  Shell is a multinational energy giant with operations in more than 70 countries. It produces around 3.2 barrels of oil equivalent per day  has an interest in 10 refineries  and sold 64.2 million tons of liquefied natural gas last year.It‚Äôs a staple for global investors  too. Shell is listed on the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam  and the New York Stock Exchange.Energy stocks have pulled back over the past month and Shell was caught in the sell-off as well. However  its NYSE-listed shares are still up 9.4% year to date.Story continuesPiper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd sees opportunity in the company. On Tuesday  the analyst reiterated an ‚Äòoverweight‚Äô rating on Shell while raising his price target from $69 to $75.Considering that Shell trades at around $49 per share today  Todd‚Äôs new price target implies a potential upside of 53%.Chevron (CVX)Chevron is another oil and gas supermajor that‚Äôs benefiting from the commodity boom.For Q1  the company reported earnings of $6.3 billion  which more than quadrupled the $1.4 billion in the same period last year. Revenue totaled $54.4 billion for the quarter  up 70% year over year.In January  Chevron‚Äôs board approved a 6% increase to the quarterly dividend rate to $1.42 per share. That gives the company an annual dividend yield of 3.9%.The stock has enjoyed a nice rally too  climbing 22% in 2022.HSBC analyst Gordon Gray expects the fun to continue. The analyst recently upgraded Chevron from ‚Äòhold‚Äô to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô and set a price target of $167 ‚Äî roughly 15% above where the stock sits today.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Commanding a market cap of nearly $370 billion  Exxon Mobil is bigger than Shell and Chevron.The company also boasts the strongest stock price performance among the trio in 2022 ‚Äî Exxon shares are up 38% year to date.It‚Äôs not hard to see why investors like the stock: the oil-producing giant gushes profits and cash flow. In Q1  Exxon earned $5.5 billion in profits  a huge increase from the $2.7 billion in the year-ago period. Free cash flow totaled $10.8 billion for the quarter  compared to $6.9 billion in the same period last year.Solid financials allow the company to return cash to investors. Exxon pays quarterly dividends of 88 cents per share  translating to an annual yield of 4.0%. Management has also increased the company‚Äôs share repurchase program to up to $30 billion through 2023.Bank of America analyst Doug Leggate has a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô rating on Exxon and a price target of $120. That implies a potential upside of 37% from the current levels.What to read nextSign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.US is only a few days away from an ‚Äòabsolute explosion‚Äô on inflation ‚Äî here are 3 shockproof sectors to help protect your portfolio‚ÄòThere‚Äôs always a bull market somewhere‚Äô: Jim Cramer‚Äôs famous words suggest you can make money no matter what.

Exchanges want a 15-minute delay before the mandatory handing over of their data. Banks and investment funds say a tape will be of no use if not in real time.The plans pit exchanges like Deutsche Boerse and Euronext  keen to keep control over data  against asset managers and banks who say that data on share trades is too expensive ‚Äî a complaint rejected by exchanges.The European Parliament and EU states will have the final say on the proposed legislation.Danuta Huebner is leading negotiations on parliament‚Äôs side and will propose exempting platforms which represent less than 1% of total EU daily trading from supplying prices to the tape  an excerpt from her upcoming report  leaked to the press  said.Platforms which ‚Äúdo not contribute significantly to the fragmentation of EU markets‚Äù would also be exempt  but bourses that do not make use of an exemption should get a higher share of the tape‚Äôs revenues.Smaller bourses  such as in eastern Europe  would benefit if the amendment is backed by parliament and EU states.In a move banks will welcome  Huebner  who had no immediate comment  backed the draft law‚Äôs provision for a tape giving real-time prices.It was also ‚Äúessential‚Äù that the share tape contains ‚Äúpre-trade‚Äù information  the excerpt says  a step industry bodies like the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME https://www.afme.eu/news/press-releases/details/AFME-BVI-Cboe-Europe-and-EFAMA-Agree-Cross-Industry-Consensus-on-EU-Equity-Consolidated-Tape) have called for. The draft law only refers to ‚Äúpost-trade‚Äù prices or completed transactions.FESE  which represents exchanges in Europe  said the proposals would further concentrate share trading among large  non-EU investment banks.‚ÄúWe will continue to advocate for a package of market structure measures‚Ä¶ but not one that publishes pre-trade data  creating an illusory view of the market ‚Äù FESE said.The efficient functioning of Europe‚Äôs markets is now even more critical to fund the economy given the financial impact of war in Ukraine  said AFME CEO Adam Farkas.(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Susan Fenton),neutral,0.04,0.84,0.12,mixed,0.11,0.19,0.7,True,English,"['market data waiver', 'EU lawmaker', 'smaller bourses', 'AFME CEO Adam Farkas', 'total EU daily trading', 'large, non-EU investment banks', 'market structure measures', 'The European Parliament', 'EU draft law', 'investment funds', 'share trading', 'EU states', 'EU markets', 'consolidated tapes', 'stock, bond', 'real time', 'best deals', '15-minute delay', 'mandatory handing', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'asset managers', 'share trades', 'final say', 'upcoming report', 'higher share', 'immediate comment', 'trade‚Äù information', 'industry bodies', 'illusory view', 'efficient functioning', 'financial impact', 'Huw Jones', 'Susan Fenton', 'derivatives markets', 'Financial Markets', 'Danuta Huebner', 'Smaller bourses', 'real-time prices', 'post-trade‚Äù prices', 'eastern Europe', 'pre-trade data', 'share tape', '27 countries', 'platforms', 'investors', 'aim', 'Exchanges', 'use', 'plans', 'Euronext', 'control', 'complaint', 'legislation', 'negotiations', 'side', 'less', 'excerpt', 'press', 'fragmentation', 'exemption', 'revenues', 'amendment', 'move', 'provision', 'step', 'Association', 'news', 'releases', 'AFME-BVI-Cboe-Europe', 'EFAMA-Agree-Cross-Industry-Consensus', 'EU-Equity-Consolidated-Tape', 'completed', 'transactions', 'FESE', 'proposals', 'package', 'economy', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Editing']",2022-07-22,2022-07-23,fxempire.com

The agreement between parties includes a right to trigger an IPO under certain conditions for both parties after a defined period and  in such a scenario  an option for ORANGE to take control of the combined entity at IPO price.The joint venture between MASMOVIL and ORANGE will create a sustainable player with the financial capacity and scale to continue investing to foster the future of infrastructure competition in Spain for the benefit of consumers and businesses.A joint venture between the two complementary businesses would lead to significant efficiency gains  allowing the combined company to accelerate investments in FTTH and 5G that will benefit Spanish customers.As part of the final agreement  ORANGE Spain‚Äôs enterprise value is set at ‚Ç¨7.8 billion (7.2x 2022E EBITDAaL and 37.1x 2022E EBITDAaL ‚Äì eCapex)2 and MASMOVIL‚Äôs (which includes the acquisition of EUSKALTEL) at ‚Ç¨10.9 billion (8.7x 2022E EBITDAaL and 14.9x 2022E EBITDAaL ‚Äì eCapex)2.Due diligence conducted since March shows potential synergies in excess of ‚Ç¨450m per annum to be reached by the fourth year post closing.The transaction is supported by a ‚Ç¨6.6 billion non-recourse debt package that will finance  among other things  a ‚Ç¨5.85 billion payment up-streamed to the ORANGE Group and MASMOVIL shareholders. This distribution to the shareholders will be asymmetric as it also embeds an equalization payment in favor of ORANGE to reflect the different levels of indebtedness of the two standalone businesses. This debt package is mainly comprised of bank debt  provided by a large pool of banks. MASMOVIL‚Äôs existing debt will remain in place. Post closing  the financial policy agreed between ORANGE and LORCA JVCO includes a leverage target of 3.5x net debt/EBITDA ratio to facilitate an IPO of the joint venture in the medium term.Story continuesThe transaction is subject to approval from antitrust authorities and other relevant administrative authorities and is expected to close during the second half of 2023 at the latest. Until such approvals and closing conditions are satisfied  the two companies will continue to operate independently.Christel Heydemann  CEO of ORANGE  commented: ‚ÄúI am very happy to announce the conclusion of these negotiations today. This deal paves the way for the creation of a joint company that combines the forces of ORANGE and MASMOVIL into a single  stronger operator that will enable investments in 5G and Fiber  benefiting customers across Spain. I strongly believe that the creation of this new company is of fundamental importance for the Group  the Spanish telecoms market and for our customers.‚ÄùMeinrad Spenger  CEO of MASMOVIL  commented: ‚ÄúThis is a great day for Spanish consumers as well as for our stakeholders. Together with ORANGE  we plan to form a strong operator with a sustainable business model and the capacity to invest in world-class infrastructure  technology and talent. We anticipate this will drive competition  digitization and innovation in the Spanish market.‚ÄùMore informationSee presentation on orange.com (https://newsroom.orange.com/?lang=en) for the main facts and figures concerning this transaction.DISCLAIMERThis press release contains prospects  hypothesis  estimates and other forward-looking statements or anticipations that involve risks and uncertainties  including references concerning expected future savings  synergies  as well as its future positioning in the market  financial structure  growth and profitability  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in such estimates and forward-looking statements.Many of these risks and uncertainties are related to factors that can be neither controlled nor estimated with certainty  such as future market conditions  approvals to be granted by relevant competent authorities  or the responses from investors or other market actors and there can be no assurance that anticipated events will occur or that the objectives set out will actually be achieved.

OneWeb  in which the UK government has a minority stake  would be valued at about $3 billion or more  the people said.Paris-listed Eutelsat  with a market value of about 2.4 billion euros ($2.5 billion)  is backed by French state investment firm BPIFrance SA and is also a minority investor in OneWeb.As part of the proposed transaction  existing investors in OneWeb would continue to hold minority stakes  the people said. Those investors include the UK government and Bharti Airtel Ltd.  run by telecommunications tycoon Sunil Mittal.The combined company would be listed in the Euronext bourse in Paris  though the firm could also seek a London listing in future  the people said.While discussions are advanced  a final agreement hasn‚Äôt been reached and talks could still end without one  the people said.A spokesman for OneWeb and a representative for the UK government declined to comment. A spokesperson for Eutelsat wasn‚Äôt immediately available for comment outside business hours in France.Musk‚Äôs Starlink fleet of more than 1 500 satellites launched in the past three years by SpaceX has created an unprecedented challenge for rivals  leading to a wave of consolidation in the sector.Story continuesLast year  Viasat Inc. agreed to purchase Inmarsat Group Holdings Ltd. for $4 billion  creating the world‚Äôs biggest geostationary satellite company. Eutelsat itself rejected a takeover bid from billionaire Patrick Drahi that valued it at 2.8 billion euros.OneWeb emerged from bankruptcy in 2020 in bailout by the UK with the help of Mittal  signaling a more interventionist industrial strategy by the government after Brexit. A deal with Eutelsat would be a rare example of a UK and a French company merging  and one that involves two state-backed companies shows how much the two governments are getting involved in the telecommunications industry.The company was established in 2012 to build a constellation of small satellites in low-earth orbit  beaming internet connections to isolated places. OneWeb raised $3.4 billion from SoftBank Group Corp.  Airbus SE and other big names before collapsing when lead investors pulled their money at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.(Adds no comment from OneWeb  UK government in seventh paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek¬©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.02,0.89,0.09,mixed,0.09,0.12,0.79,True,English,"['UK Satellite Operator', 'OneWeb', 'Merger', 'Eutelsat', 'Inmarsat Group Holdings Ltd.', 'biggest geostationary satellite company', 'French state investment firm', 'Bharti Airtel Ltd', 'SoftBank Group Corp.', 'British satellite firm', 'outside business hours', 'past three years', 'billionaire Patrick Drahi', 'interventionist industrial strategy', 'other big names', 'two state-backed companies', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Eutelsat Communications SA', 'French company', 'BPIFrance SA', 'two governments', 'combined company', 'pan-European operator', 'Starlink project', 'next week', 'minority stake', 'market value', '2.4 billion euros', 'minority investor', 'telecommunications tycoon', 'Euronext bourse', 'London listing', 'Starlink fleet', 'unprecedented challenge', 'Viasat Inc.', 'takeover bid', '2.8 billion euros', 'rare example', 'telecommunications industry', 'low-earth orbit', 'internet connections', 'isolated places', 'Airbus SE', 'coronavirus pandemic', 'seventh paragraph', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'existing investors', 'lead investors', 'Elon Musk', 'Paris-listed Eutelsat', 'Sunil Mittal', 'final agreement', 'small satellites', 'UK government', '1,500 satellites', 'OneWeb', 'deal', 'transaction', 'people', 'matter', 'discussions', 'part', 'future', 'talks', 'spokesman', 'representative', 'spokesperson', 'comment', 'SpaceX', 'rivals', 'wave', 'consolidation', 'sector', 'Story', 'world', 'bankruptcy', 'bailout', 'help', 'Brexit', 'constellation', 'money', 'height']",2022-07-23,2022-07-23,au.news.yahoo.com
