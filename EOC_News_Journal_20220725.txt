Business income was up 7% to EUR 807 million  reflecting the continued strong growth of Euroclear's core business lines as it implements its strategy.Interest  banking and other income increased by 262% to EUR 191 million as a consequence of rising interest rates and higher cash balances from frozen assets due to the Russian sanctions.Operating Expenses increased to EUR 534 million  up 12% compared to H1 2021  as Euroclear continued to invest in its technology and service offering  as well as being impacted by inflation and costs related to managing the Russian sanctions.An increase of 40% in earnings per share to EUR 111.7 per share  reflected the increase in net profit.Implications of frozen assets due to Russian sanctionsAs a result of sanctions imposed by the US  the EU and other jurisdictions  as well as Russian countermeasures  the cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. During the first half of 2022  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by €72 billion year-on-year.At the end of June 2022  Euroclear Bank's cash balances had increased by €72 billion year-on-year. As per Euroclear's standard process  the cash is invested which results in interest income. During the first half  the interest income earned from frozen assets held as a result of Russian sanctions was EUR 110 million.The Board expects these interest earnings to grow materially as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate in a rising interest rate environment.While this is expected to have an impact on the balance sheet  it should not result in material change in credit risk profile and therefore will not have a meaningful impact on the group's capital ratios.Business Performance & H1 HighlightsEuroclear's underlying business continues to perform strongly. Excluding the impact of frozen assets due to the Russian sanctions  adjusted net profit rose by 12% to EUR 277 million.Adjusted operating income was up 11% to EUR 892 million. This was driven by adjusted business income growth  up 8%. Adjusted Interest  Banking and Other income was up 53% to EUR 81 million.The key operating metrics  shown below  underpinned the strong business performance during the period. Market volatility remains high  driving transaction volumes to record levels. Equity market valuations have fallen significantly during the period which has restricted growth in assets under custody and fund asset under custody during the period.H1 total % change vs H1 2021Assets under Custody EUR 35.5 trillion +1 % Number of Transactions 155.5 million +4 % Turnover EUR 523 trillion +9 % Fund assets under custody EUR 2.8 trillion +1 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.9 trillion +13 %Euroclear continues to see very strong demand for collateral management and lending services from a broad range of market participants. Since 2016  structural demand has been driven by the introduction of the Uncleared Margin Rules (UMR) under Basel III as more participants were require to adopt collateral management services to reduce the risk of derivatives exposures. The fifth wave of the UMR came into force last year.In the second quarter  Euroclear launched a new ESG reporting solution for asset managers  through the combination of MFEX by Euroclear and Greenomy  two recent investments. In addition to illustrating the benefits of the expanded product offering  the new service demonstrates Euroclear's increased strategic focus on Sustainable Finance.The integration of MFEX is progressing to plan as MFEX's established fund distribution platforms are combined with Euroclear's post-trade expertise to create a new end-to-end funds offering.The group also continues to modernise its legacy technology infrastructure  including the domestic CSDs. These investments will further strengthen the resilience and efficiency of the group's platforms  allowing for further digitalisation and service enhancements.Dividend on 2021 resultsThe Board confirms its intention to pay its previously announced dividend of EUR 88.5 per share (equating to a total of EUR 279 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022. The dividend  which was delayed while the potential implications of the sanctions on capital were evaluated and mitigated  relates to the performance in the 2021 financial year.Commenting on the resultsLieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer""We delivered a strong performance across the business and saw an increase in interest earnings due to higher interest rates and accumulated cash balances as a consequence of frozen assets due to the Russian sanctions.In a context where financial market conditions have been dynamic  we have continued to operate safe and efficient infrastructure to support our clients.As we look forward  we see opportunities to further enhance our client offerings  such as through innovative data-enabled services and connecting to global markets  while meeting our responsibilities as a financial market infrastructure to support sustainable economic growth.""Note to editorsEuroclear group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

8093,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/thought-leadership/the-upward-trend-in-co-operation/,The upward trend in co-operation,Anya van den Berg  vice president of analytics at Deutsche Börse  explores the increase in data exchange between venues as well as the availability of new and unique market data products developed directly by the exchanges themselves.,Alliances between exchanges and other trading venues are nothing new across the capital markets space  however the past few years have seen these partnerships skyrocket with a plethora of interesting co-operations being announced. Exchanges are not only leading the marketplace with their own unique analytics but are also actively acquiring independent data providers to leverage their alternative and big datasets. This has created a truly compelling combination of offerings for investors  who can now move into new markets  securities  and asset classes with relative ease. Recent examples of this include the Cboe completion of NEO and ErisX and the London Stock Exchange acquisition of Refinitiv and TORA.At Deutsche Börse  the Group has echoed this level of M&A engagement and acquired several organisations over recent years  including Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)  Clearstream Fund Centre AG  Quantitative Brokers and Crypto Finance AG. The organisation has also just announced in June of this year a partnership with Kaiko to extend its offering into the crypto sector with both real-time and historical tick level data for all crypto exchanges and all digital assets from the provider. In addition to this  Deutsche Börse has partnered up with the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV Group)  Pakistan Stock Exchange  Korea Exchange and the Guangzhou Futures Exchange to enable other trading participants to benefit from their technology.Most notably however is the latest co-operation project with CME Group  which has allowed Deutsche Börse’s customers to access a unique combination of historical market data across two of the largest derivatives markets in a single cloud-based interface. A7 Analytics provides nanosecond precise order book data across Eurex  Xetra and EEX markets alongside CME Group market data.As one of the world’s leading and most diverse derivatives marketplace  CME Group offers a wide range of futures and options datasets across interest rates  equity indexes  foreign exchange  energy  agriculture  and metals products. These datasets are generated across CME Group’s four major exchanges that are all including within A7: Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)  Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)  Commodity Exchange (COMEX) and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).A7 customers will therefore have direct access to order-by-order historical market data in nanoseconds granularity without any heavy lifting  instantly pulling results down a high-speed API. The Algo-engine will allow customers to back-test across the full depth of book and across the aforementioned markets allowing them to quickly grasp market situations and easily drill down into the market microstructure. A7 therefore enables a broader community of investors to identify actionable insights with greater speed and less complexity.For a high-level overview of this offering  please feel free to view our one-minute video that summarises this capably here.If you would like to learn more about A7 or would be interested in a free trial of platform  please reach out to analytics@deutsche-boerse.com.,neutral,0.1,0.8,0.11,positive,0.95,0.05,0.01,True,English,"['upward trend', 'co', 'operation', 'nanosecond precise order book data', 'Clearstream Fund Centre AG', 'London Stock Exchange acquisition', 'historical tick level data', 'New York Mercantile Exchange', 'CME Group market data', 'historical market data', 'independent data providers', 'Mexican Stock Exchange', 'Pakistan Stock Exchange', 'other trading venues', 'Deutsche Börse', 'M&A engagement', 'Institutional Shareholder Services', 'other trading participants', 'latest co-operation project', 'single cloud-based interface', 'Chicago Mercantile Exchange', 'Crypto Finance AG', 'capital markets space', 'largest derivatives markets', 'diverse derivatives marketplace', 'Guangzhou Futures Exchange', 'four major exchanges', 'new markets', 'Korea Exchange', 'foreign exchange', 'Commodity Exchange', 'market situations', 'market microstructure', 'Chicago Board', 'crypto sector', 'EEX markets', 'BMV Group', 'crypto exchanges', 'interesting co-operations', 'compelling combination', 'asset classes', 'relative ease', 'Recent examples', 'Cboe completion', 'several organisations', 'Quantitative Brokers', 'digital assets', 'unique combination', 'wide range', 'interest rates', 'equity indexes', 'metals products', 'direct access', 'nanoseconds granularity', 'heavy lifting', 'high-speed API', 'The Algo-engine', 'full depth', 'broader community', 'actionable insights', 'greater speed', 'less complexity', 'high-level overview', 'one-minute video', 'free trial', 'unique analytics', 'big datasets', 'options datasets', 'recent years', 'A7 Analytics', 'A7 customers', 'Alliances', 'past', 'partnerships', 'plethora', 'alternative', 'offerings', 'investors', 'securities', 'NEO', 'ErisX', 'Refinitiv', 'TORA', 'ISS', 'June', 'Kaiko', 'real-time', 'addition', 'technology', 'Eurex', 'Xetra', 'world', 'leading', 'energy', 'agriculture', 'Trade', 'CBOT', 'COMEX', 'NYMEX', 'results', 'platform', 'boerse']",2022-07-25,2022-07-25,thetradenews.com

OneWeb is one of the two only global LEO networks and has experienced strong momentum over recent months  with service expected to be fully deployed in 2023.The transaction would represent a logical next step in the successful partnership between Eutelsat and OneWeb  started with Eutelsat’s equity investment in OneWeb in April 2021 and deepened with the Global Distribution Agreement announced in March 2022. Eutelsat currently holds 23% of OneWeb’s share capital  alongside a consortium of high-profile public and private investors.Under the terms of the transaction being discussed  Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders would each hold 50% of the combined group’s shares.The transaction would be structured as a contribution by OneWeb’s shareholders of their stake in OneWeb to Eutelsat in exchange for newly issued Eutelsat shares. Any combination would be subject to  among other conditions  approval by the requisite majority of Eutelsat shareholders and receipt of all relevant antitrust and regulatory (including foreign investment) approvals.There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement. Eutelsat will inform the market as soon as soon as there are any new developments.About Eutelsat CommunicationsFounded in 1977  Eutelsat Communications is one of the world's leading satellite operators.

As a significant percentage of sales are recorded in dollars  the increase on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates is slightly lower  with +9% for the first half of 2022.Consolidated revenues (unaudited)Revenues (€m) 2022 2021 Change First quarter 38.0 33.8 +12% Second quarter 46.0 41.7 +10% First half 84.0 75.5 +11% of which Photonics 38.6 34.7 +11% Medical 45.4 40.8 +11%The LUMIBIRD Group’s consolidated revenues came to €84.0m at June 30  2022  up 11% (9% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates). This growth is split equally across the Photonics and Medical divisions. The Group is organized to produce against a backdrop of the disruption affecting supply chains globally. However  across the various business segments  this disruption may result in deliveries being deferred from one quarter to another.This is notably the case for the Photonics division  with contrasting levels of growth that do not necessarily reflect the overall trend. The Industrial and Scientific business lines show first-half growth of +2% (to €17.4m)  while the Lidar business is up +48% to €11.0m  with an increase in sales for both Lidar and OEM systems. The Defense / Space business is stable for the first half of the year (+1% to €10.2m)  with a relatively significant base effect due to a particularly high second quarter in 2021. The new subsidiary Lumibird Photonics Sweden (former Saab)  consolidated since May 31  2022  made a still marginal contribution to business (€0.36m).The Medical division  with first-half growth of +11% (€45.4m)  is benefiting from a catch-up with deliveries from the order book at end-March and an acceleration in sales  particularly in the United States  where the strengthening of the sales teams and the extension of the product range are reflected in very positive trends.Story continuesLUMIBIRD is looking ahead to the second half of the year with an extremely sustained order book  for its Photonics and Medical activities. Its ability to build on these positive commercial trends is still linked to the production and delivery contingencies in a context of pressure on supply chains.The Group is confirming its targets for 2023 reported revenues of over €250m  driven by organic and external growth  with its EBIDTA/revenue ratio to continue increasing within a 20%-25% range.Next date:2022 half-year earnings on September 22  2022 (after close of trading)LUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading specialists in lasers. With 50 years of experience and a mastering of solid state laser  laser diodes and fiber laser technologies  the Group designs  manufactures and markets high performance lasers for scientific (laboratories and universities)  industrial (manufacturing  defense  Lidar sensors) and medical (ophthalmology  ultrasound diagnostic) markets.Born from the combination of Keopsys Group with Quantel in October 2017  LUMIBIRD has more than 940 employees and over €162 million of consolidated revenues in 2021 and is present in Europe  America and Asia.LUMIBIRD shares are listed on the Euronext Paris B Compartment.

This good business resilience reflects:- The continued growth of traditional activities  excluding COVID  despite increased selectivity in terms of distribution which led to the termination of certain less profitable partnerships;- Continued substantial COVID revenues with a sharp drop in sales prices and test volumes  partially offset by the extension of the product portfolio with specific tests for the characterization of SARS-Cov-2 virus variants;in M€ H1 2022 H1 2021 var. Excluding COVID 43 0 40 9 +5 1% COVID 40 6 54 8 -26% Total 83 6 95 7 -13% not auditedGrowth in turnover excluding COVIDNon-COVID activities  which are the group’s fundamentals  increased by 5.1% in the 1st half of 2022  with €43.0 million in revenues. This increase reflects a still strong growth dynamic  partially offset by the announced termination of certain low-margin distribution contracts  one of which represented €2.2 million in revenue in the 1st half of 2021.This strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio is performed with new partnerships aimed at making innovative products with a strong impact available for healthcare professionals and patients in France. The Group has thus taken over the exclusive distribution in France of HIV self-tests from the American company Orasure  has signed partnerships with Alcor  Technoclone and SD Biosensor laboratories for distributions in the field of ""Point of Care"" proximity tests  and in the field of connected biology based on artificial intelligence.Story continuesThis increase also reflects a good rate of renewal of public contracts  such as the one recently concluded with AP-HP for a period of 4 years in the field of transplantation. Over its entire duration  this contract represents an overall turnover of around 24 million euros.Extension of the COVID diagnostic product portfolioIn a COVID diagnostics market that is beginning to slow down in 2022  Eurobio Scientific has been able to limit the drop in its turnover to 26% despite a sharp reduction in prices and volumes. This good resistance is explained in particular by the richness of the portfolio of proprietary products  made possible by a strategy of innovation and highly responsive marketing capabilities. Eurobio Scientific introduced 6 new proprietary tests in 2021 and 3 more in the 1st half of 2022  thus providing its customers with test kits adapted to the evolution of the pandemic  often with a single kit for screening and differentiation of new variants. The expertise of the R&D teams  the strength of regulatory affairs demonstrated by the company's ISO 13485 recertification within the new IVDR1 framework  and a high-capacity production tool enable the Group to support laboratories in quasi real time.Eurobio Scientific thus remains one of the main French players in the diagnosis of COVID and benefits from a large base of installed automates  capable of processing a multitude of tests  including the Group's proprietary tests.Continuation of synergies internationallySales from international subsidiaries amounted to €9.4 million in the 1st half  compared to €8.2 million in 2021. Synergies with foreign subsidiaries (TECOmedical and Pathway Diagnostic) continue to produce their positive effects. These are now supplemented by the recent integration of Biomedical Diagnostics NV  which strengthens the group's presence in the Benelux area.Resources matching the Group's ambitionsEurobio Scientific currently has a gross cash amount in excess of €115 million  against a financial debt of €13.8 million. These financial resources  combined with a strengthening of its human resources  particularly in R&D  support the strategic deployment focused on increasing the share of proprietary products  the pursuit of international expansion  and the opening of new market segments. The support of Nextstage AM  a new strategic partner whose entry into the capital was confirmed in May in collaboration with AXA  also contributes to supporting the new phase of development of Eurobio Scientific.Next financial meeting2022 Half-year results: October 11  2022  before market opensDisclaimerThis press release contains elements that are not historical facts including  without limitation  certain statements about future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

These initial commercial successes have made it possible to create solid references  thanks to which several contracts of significant size could be signed before the end of the year.The activity of our subsidiary Delta Drone International is growing rapidly  both in Africa and Australia. In Africa  several contracts have been renewed for periods of several years. In Australia  a first contract of $1MAU over 3 years was signed with Red5 Ltd (see press release of 8 June 2022).Delta Drone Human Tech  the Group's security division  continues to grow  driven by the growing need for security.

This reflects the combination of a 6% growth at constant exchange rates and perimeter and a positive currency impact of 6%3.Paul Boudre  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “We recorded our highest first quarter ever  despite two production interruptions in Bernin  making us confident in our ability to achieve our full-year guidance that will be leading to a new record year. Our performance has been driven by continuous growth in radiofrequency applications driven by the 5G momentum  a sharp increase in automotive applications led by the ongoing deep transformation of the automotive industry  as well as a strong surge in FD-SOI wafer sales across our three end markets.”First quarter FY’23 consolidated revenue (unaudited)As indicated during the presentation of its full-year results in June 2022  Soitec is  from now on  reporting its revenue by end market instead of breaking it down by wafer size. This decision was made in order to better reflect the way Soitec is conducting and monitoring its business4.Q1’22 Q1’23 Q1’23/Q1’22 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 135 152 +13% +6% Automotive & Industrial 16 23 +46% +37% Smart devices 29 28 -6% -11% Total revenue 180 203 +12% +6%Soitec recorded a 6% total revenue increase at constant exchange rates and perimeter in the first quarter of FY’23 compared to the first quarter of FY’22. Performance was driven by sustained growth in Mobile communications revenue and by a strong increase in Automotive & Industrial revenue. Production at Bernin site was affected from April 5th to April 9th by a power outage due to a fire that broke out at an external electricity supply facility  and from June 10th to June 16th by a strike action. Soitec should however be able to progressively make up for the lost production (around 10 days) and does not expect these events to impact its FY’23 guidance.Story continuesMobile communicationsIn the first quarter of FY’23  Mobile communications revenue reached 152 million Euros  a 6% growth at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to the first quarter of FY’22. Growth continues to be supported by the adoption of 5G smartphones and WiFi6  as well as the deployment of 5G infrastructure. It mainly reflects an increase in volumes.RF-SOI wafer sales continue to be boosted by the increase in RF content in every 5G smartphone and by better penetration of high-end phones. Growth is driven by RF-SOI 300-mm  enabled by a good ramp-up in production following the ongoing capacity increase at the Singapore facility.Sales of FD-SOI wafers for 5G mmWave modules recorded a significant increase confirming the ongoing adoption of this technology by several players.Regarding sales of POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers dedicated to RF filters for 5G smartphones  Soitec is still in the adoption phase by several customers for the coming quarters.Automotive & IndustrialAutomotive & Industrial revenue reached 23 million Euros in the first quarter of FY’23  a 37% increase at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to the first quarter of FY’22. Growth reflects a very strong increase in volumes combined with a slightly positive price/mix effect. Demand from the automotive industry is supported by increasing needs for infotainment  ADAS & functional safety  as well as electrical vehicles.Growth is mainly coming from Power-SOI wafers  which are used for automotive applications  while FD-SOI wafers moved from a minimal contribution of Automotive & Industrial revenue in the first quarter of FY’22 to a substantial proportion in the first quarter of FY’23.Smart devicesSmart devices revenue reached 28 million Euros in the first quarter of FY’23  a less than 2 million Euros decrease compared to the first quarter of FY’22. Performance reflects lower volumes  including a different timing of sales during the year  partially offset by a positive price/mix effect.Sales of Imager-SOI wafers  which allow improved imager performance in near infrared  and Photonics-SOI wafers for data transceivers remained at a solid level.Sales of FD-SOI wafers recorded a strong increase compared to the first quarter of FY’22 confirming pervasive demand for Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing devices across consumer and industrial sectors.Confirmed FY’23 outlookSoitec continues to anticipate FY’23 revenue to grow around 20% at constant exchange rates and perimeter  and FY’23 EBITDA1 margin2 to reach around 36%.Key events of the quarterCEA  Soitec  GlobalFoundries and STMicroelectronics to advance next generation FD-SOI roadmap for automotive  IoT and mobile applicationsOn April 8th  2022  leading semiconductor players CEA  Soitec  GlobalFoundries and STMicroelectronics announced a new collaboration in which they intend to jointly define the industry’s next generation roadmap for FD-SOI technology. Semiconductors and FD-SOI innovation are of strategic value to France and the EU as well as to customers globally. FD-SOI offers substantial benefits for designers and customer systems  including lower power consumption as well as easier integration of additional features such as connectivity and security  a key feature for automotive  IoT and mobile applications.Soitec released its first 200-mm silicon carbide SmartSiC™ waferOn May 4th  2022  Soitec announced the release of its first 200-mm silicon carbide SmartSiC™ wafer  from the pilot line at its Substrate Innovation Center. The release enabled Soitec to demonstrate the quality and performance of 200-mm SmartSiC™ engineered substrates and to conduct a first round of key customer validations. The addition of 200-mm is enlarging Soitec’s SiC product portfolio beyond 150-mm to address an even larger variety of customer requirements  in terms of product quality  reliability  volume  and energy efficiency.Soitec announced the extension of its Pasir Ris Facility to produce 300mm SOI wafersOn June 8th  2022  Soitec announced the extension of its Pasir Ris facility in Singapore  with the objective to add a new capacity of 1 million wafers per year. Soitec expects the construction of this extension to start in FY’23  and the fab to enter into operation by the end of FY’25. The robust level of customer demand gives Soitec enough visibility to accelerate the launch of this new fab  which was initially planned for FY’26. Combining Bernin II  Pasir Ris I and Pasir Ris II  Soitec’s total 300-mm SOI production capacity will ultimately reach 2.7 million wafers per year. The extension of Pasir Ris is also due to include additional refresh and epitaxy capacities.Post-closing eventSTMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries to advance FD-SOI ecosystem with new 300mm manufacturing facility in FranceOn July 11th  2022  STMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries announced the creation of a new  jointly-operated 300-mm semiconductor manufacturing facility adjacent to ST’s existing site in Crolles  France. This new facility will support several technologies  in particular FD-SOI-based technologies  and will cover multiple variants. This includes GF’s market leading FDX technology and ST’s comprehensive technology roadmap down to 18nm  which are expected to remain in high demand for Automotive  IoT  and Mobile applications for the next few decades. The facility is targeted to ramp at full capacity by 2026  with up to 620 000 wafers per year production at full build-out.# # #Analysts conference call to be held in English on Tuesday 26th July at 8:00 am CET.To listen this conference call  the audiocast is available live and in replay at the following address: https://channel.royalcast.com/soitec/#!/soitec/20220726_1# # #AgendaSoitec’s Annual General Meeting will be held on July 26th  2022.Q2’23 revenue is due to be published on October 26th  2022  after market close.# # #DisclaimerThis document is provided by Soitec (the “Company”) for information purposes only.The Company’s business operations and financial position are described in the Company’s 2021-2022 Universal Registration Document (which notably includes the 2021-2022 Annual Financial Report) which was filed on June 20  2022 with the French stock market authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers  or AMF) under number D.22-0523.

8115,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/the-battle-for-euronexts-clearing-a-tale-of-two-ccps/,The battle for Euronext’s clearing: a tale of two CCPs,Following the exchange’s decision to migrate its clearing operations  LCH SA and EuroCCP are lacing up for battle. The question is  who will be preferred?,The race to be Euronext’s preferred clearing counterparty is hotting up  with two main contenders EuroCCP and LCH SA  LSEG’s Paris based clearing arm  preparing for war.Euronext moved to break off its 10-year deal – originally due to expire in 2027 – with LCH SA in November after announcing its plans to move its clearing operations to Italy. The move followed its acquisition of Borsa Italiana and the bourse’s clearing house CC&G – now rebranded to Euronext Clearing.Currently  Euronext Clearing only clears for Euronext Milan  however  the exchange operator has confirmed plans to expand coverage to all of its venues  subject to regulatory approval  meaning it will replace LCH SA as the primary CCP for Euronext’s markets.The exchange operator is looking to migrate its cash equities business to Euronext Clearing by the end of next year  The TRADE understands. The first termination window for the listed derivatives LCH SA contract is in January 2023 with a one-year notice and a six-month migration period meaning the first time Euronextcan migrate these flows will be June 2024.When cash equities flow migrates at the end of the year  LCH SA will ask for a preferred clearing link to Euronext markets  The TRADE understands. However  EuroCCP who has also had a clearing relationship with Euronext since 2017  is also gearing up to become the exchange operator’s preferred clearing partner of choice.LCH SA and EuroCCP will therefore be in direct competition with one another to win the business of the some of the largest markets in the Bloc.“It’s a matter of winning the battle in market share ” said one source familiar with the matter.The preferred clearing model allows a CCP to connect to a trade feed at an exchange for a fee. Both EuroCCP and LCH SA intend to offer their services to Euronext in this capacity  however  it is widely known that using multiple preferred clearing houses makes it harder to gain market share as the preferred CCP must have been selected by both the buyer and the seller to oversee a transaction. When this does not occur  the primary CCP assumes responsibility for it.“Before Mifir and Mifid II  some venues wouldn’t necessarily open up trade feeds to preferred clearing houses because they most likely owned a CCP that’s in a vertical silo. What preferred clearing allows us to do is get access to that venue – albeit we don’t interoperate with the primary CCP ” EuroCCP’s head of commercial and business development  Tim Beckwith  told The TRADE.“This reduces the probability of a cleared transaction because you need lots and lots of clearing members to join in for the service.”EuroCCP claims to have seen 233% growth on its cleared volumes across the Euronext markets in Paris  Amsterdam  Lisbon and Milan  reaching 15 million transactions this year to date and with plans to grow this number further.However  with so many Euronext clearing members already connected to LCH SA on the back of its multi-year deal – it currently oversees 90% of Euronext’s clearing market share – continuation and consolidation could play into the hands of LSEG’s Paris based clearing house.LCH SA and Euronext declined to comment.Brexit significantly fragmented the clearing landscape and UK-based CCPs have subsequently continued to grapple with EU regulators over their equivalence in the last few years. Originally granted an 18-month temporary equivalence post-Brexit due to expire in June  LCH  ICE Clear Europe and LME Clearing were all awarded another temporary three-year equivalence earlier this year  due to expire in June 2025.The move was designed to reduce European institutions’ reliance on them without a cliff edge deadline and is expected to impact the market share of UK-based CCPs.“As a result of that [temporary equivalence] banks were looking at the risk of having EU clearing with a UK CCP and the impact it could have had on interoperability ” added Beckwith. “They’re trying to de-risk that migration by moving flow to us now and we believe that’s one of the key elements of our preferred clearing growth.”According to Euronext’s first quarter results  Euronext Clearing revenues reached €2 million for derivatives  €5 million for equities and just over €2 million for bonds.Its future market share and revenues are dependent on whoever is left standing between LCH SA and EuroCCP. As both clearing houses throw their hats into the ring  there’s just one question that remains  who will participants prefer?,neutral,0.07,0.55,0.39,negative,0.02,0.25,0.72,True,English,"['two CCPs', 'battle', 'Euronext', 'clearing', 'tale', 'Paris based clearing arm', 'Paris based clearing house', 'multiple preferred clearing houses', 'many Euronext clearing members', 'two main contenders', 'ICE Clear Europe', 'European institutions’ reliance', 'cliff edge deadline', 'first termination window', 'first quarter results', 'preferred clearing counterparty', 'preferred clearing link', 'preferred clearing partner', 'preferred clearing model', '18-month temporary equivalence', 'temporary three-year equivalence', 'temporary equivalence] banks', 'six-month migration period', 'future market share', 'preferred clearing growth', 'clearing market share', 'LCH SA contract', 'cash equities business', 'Euronext Clearing revenues', 'preferred CCP', 'first time', 'clearing operations', 'clearing relationship', 'clearing landscape', 'LME Clearing', 'EU clearing', '10-year deal', 'Borsa Italiana', 'CC&G', 'regulatory approval', 'The TRADE', 'one-year notice', 'direct competition', 'one source', 'trade feed', 'Mifid II', 'vertical silo', 'business development', '15 million transactions', 'multi-year deal', 'UK-based CCPs', 'EU regulators', 'key elements', 'one question', 'exchange operator', 'largest markets', 'primary CCP', 'UK CCP', 'next year', 'Tim Beckwith', 'Euronext markets', 'Euronext Milan', '233% growth', 'race', 'EuroCCP', 'LSEG', 'war', 'November', 'plans', 'Italy', 'move', 'acquisition', 'bourse', 'coverage', 'derivatives', 'January', 'Euronextcan', 'flows', 'June', 'choice', 'Bloc', 'matter', 'battle', 'services', 'capacity', 'buyer', 'seller', 'responsibility', 'Mifir', 'access', 'head', 'commercial', 'probability', 'lots', 'volumes', 'Amsterdam', 'Lisbon', 'date', 'number', 'back', 'continuation', 'consolidation', 'hands', 'Brexit', 'last', 'years', 'risk', 'impact', 'interoperability', 'bonds', 'hats', 'participants']",2022-07-25,2022-07-25,thetradenews.com
