OneWeb is one of the two only global LEO networks and has experienced strong momentum over recent months  with service expected to be fully deployed in 2023.The transaction would represent a logical next step in the successful partnership between Eutelsat and OneWeb  started with Eutelsat’s equity investment in OneWeb in April 2021 and deepened with the Global Distribution Agreement announced in March 2022. Eutelsat currently holds 23% of OneWeb’s share capital  alongside a consortium of high-profile public and private investors.Under the terms of the transaction being discussed  Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders would each hold 50% of the combined group’s shares.The transaction would be structured as a contribution by OneWeb’s shareholders of their stake in OneWeb to Eutelsat in exchange for newly issued Eutelsat shares. Any combination would be subject to  among other conditions  approval by the requisite majority of Eutelsat shareholders and receipt of all relevant antitrust and regulatory (including foreign investment) approvals.There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement. Eutelsat will inform the market as soon as soon as there are any new developments.About Eutelsat CommunicationsFounded in 1977  Eutelsat Communications is one of the world's leading satellite operators.

As a significant percentage of sales are recorded in dollars  the increase on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates is slightly lower  with +9% for the first half of 2022.Consolidated revenues (unaudited)Revenues (€m) 2022 2021 Change First quarter 38.0 33.8 +12% Second quarter 46.0 41.7 +10% First half 84.0 75.5 +11% of which Photonics 38.6 34.7 +11% Medical 45.4 40.8 +11%The LUMIBIRD Group’s consolidated revenues came to €84.0m at June 30  2022  up 11% (9% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates). This growth is split equally across the Photonics and Medical divisions. The Group is organized to produce against a backdrop of the disruption affecting supply chains globally. However  across the various business segments  this disruption may result in deliveries being deferred from one quarter to another.This is notably the case for the Photonics division  with contrasting levels of growth that do not necessarily reflect the overall trend. The Industrial and Scientific business lines show first-half growth of +2% (to €17.4m)  while the Lidar business is up +48% to €11.0m  with an increase in sales for both Lidar and OEM systems. The Defense / Space business is stable for the first half of the year (+1% to €10.2m)  with a relatively significant base effect due to a particularly high second quarter in 2021. The new subsidiary Lumibird Photonics Sweden (former Saab)  consolidated since May 31  2022  made a still marginal contribution to business (€0.36m).The Medical division  with first-half growth of +11% (€45.4m)  is benefiting from a catch-up with deliveries from the order book at end-March and an acceleration in sales  particularly in the United States  where the strengthening of the sales teams and the extension of the product range are reflected in very positive trends.Story continuesLUMIBIRD is looking ahead to the second half of the year with an extremely sustained order book  for its Photonics and Medical activities. Its ability to build on these positive commercial trends is still linked to the production and delivery contingencies in a context of pressure on supply chains.The Group is confirming its targets for 2023 reported revenues of over €250m  driven by organic and external growth  with its EBIDTA/revenue ratio to continue increasing within a 20%-25% range.Next date:2022 half-year earnings on September 22  2022 (after close of trading)LUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading specialists in lasers. With 50 years of experience and a mastering of solid state laser  laser diodes and fiber laser technologies  the Group designs  manufactures and markets high performance lasers for scientific (laboratories and universities)  industrial (manufacturing  defense  Lidar sensors) and medical (ophthalmology  ultrasound diagnostic) markets.Born from the combination of Keopsys Group with Quantel in October 2017  LUMIBIRD has more than 940 employees and over €162 million of consolidated revenues in 2021 and is present in Europe  America and Asia.LUMIBIRD shares are listed on the Euronext Paris B Compartment.

This good business resilience reflects:- The continued growth of traditional activities  excluding COVID  despite increased selectivity in terms of distribution which led to the termination of certain less profitable partnerships;- Continued substantial COVID revenues with a sharp drop in sales prices and test volumes  partially offset by the extension of the product portfolio with specific tests for the characterization of SARS-Cov-2 virus variants;in M€ H1 2022 H1 2021 var. Excluding COVID 43 0 40 9 +5 1% COVID 40 6 54 8 -26% Total 83 6 95 7 -13% not auditedGrowth in turnover excluding COVIDNon-COVID activities  which are the group’s fundamentals  increased by 5.1% in the 1st half of 2022  with €43.0 million in revenues. This increase reflects a still strong growth dynamic  partially offset by the announced termination of certain low-margin distribution contracts  one of which represented €2.2 million in revenue in the 1st half of 2021.This strategic reallocation of the distribution portfolio is performed with new partnerships aimed at making innovative products with a strong impact available for healthcare professionals and patients in France. The Group has thus taken over the exclusive distribution in France of HIV self-tests from the American company Orasure  has signed partnerships with Alcor  Technoclone and SD Biosensor laboratories for distributions in the field of ""Point of Care"" proximity tests  and in the field of connected biology based on artificial intelligence.Story continuesThis increase also reflects a good rate of renewal of public contracts  such as the one recently concluded with AP-HP for a period of 4 years in the field of transplantation. Over its entire duration  this contract represents an overall turnover of around 24 million euros.Extension of the COVID diagnostic product portfolioIn a COVID diagnostics market that is beginning to slow down in 2022  Eurobio Scientific has been able to limit the drop in its turnover to 26% despite a sharp reduction in prices and volumes. This good resistance is explained in particular by the richness of the portfolio of proprietary products  made possible by a strategy of innovation and highly responsive marketing capabilities. Eurobio Scientific introduced 6 new proprietary tests in 2021 and 3 more in the 1st half of 2022  thus providing its customers with test kits adapted to the evolution of the pandemic  often with a single kit for screening and differentiation of new variants. The expertise of the R&D teams  the strength of regulatory affairs demonstrated by the company's ISO 13485 recertification within the new IVDR1 framework  and a high-capacity production tool enable the Group to support laboratories in quasi real time.Eurobio Scientific thus remains one of the main French players in the diagnosis of COVID and benefits from a large base of installed automates  capable of processing a multitude of tests  including the Group's proprietary tests.Continuation of synergies internationallySales from international subsidiaries amounted to €9.4 million in the 1st half  compared to €8.2 million in 2021. Synergies with foreign subsidiaries (TECOmedical and Pathway Diagnostic) continue to produce their positive effects. These are now supplemented by the recent integration of Biomedical Diagnostics NV  which strengthens the group's presence in the Benelux area.Resources matching the Group's ambitionsEurobio Scientific currently has a gross cash amount in excess of €115 million  against a financial debt of €13.8 million. These financial resources  combined with a strengthening of its human resources  particularly in R&D  support the strategic deployment focused on increasing the share of proprietary products  the pursuit of international expansion  and the opening of new market segments. The support of Nextstage AM  a new strategic partner whose entry into the capital was confirmed in May in collaboration with AXA  also contributes to supporting the new phase of development of Eurobio Scientific.Next financial meeting2022 Half-year results: October 11  2022  before market opensDisclaimerThis press release contains elements that are not historical facts including  without limitation  certain statements about future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

These initial commercial successes have made it possible to create solid references  thanks to which several contracts of significant size could be signed before the end of the year.The activity of our subsidiary Delta Drone International is growing rapidly  both in Africa and Australia. In Africa  several contracts have been renewed for periods of several years. In Australia  a first contract of $1MAU over 3 years was signed with Red5 Ltd (see press release of 8 June 2022).Delta Drone Human Tech  the Group's security division  continues to grow  driven by the growing need for security.

This reflects the combination of a 6% growth at constant exchange rates and perimeter and a positive currency impact of 6%3.Paul Boudre  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “We recorded our highest first quarter ever  despite two production interruptions in Bernin  making us confident in our ability to achieve our full-year guidance that will be leading to a new record year. Our performance has been driven by continuous growth in radiofrequency applications driven by the 5G momentum  a sharp increase in automotive applications led by the ongoing deep transformation of the automotive industry  as well as a strong surge in FD-SOI wafer sales across our three end markets.”First quarter FY’23 consolidated revenue (unaudited)As indicated during the presentation of its full-year results in June 2022  Soitec is  from now on  reporting its revenue by end market instead of breaking it down by wafer size. This decision was made in order to better reflect the way Soitec is conducting and monitoring its business4.Q1’22 Q1’23 Q1’23/Q1’22 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile communications 135 152 +13% +6% Automotive & Industrial 16 23 +46% +37% Smart devices 29 28 -6% -11% Total revenue 180 203 +12% +6%Soitec recorded a 6% total revenue increase at constant exchange rates and perimeter in the first quarter of FY’23 compared to the first quarter of FY’22. Performance was driven by sustained growth in Mobile communications revenue and by a strong increase in Automotive & Industrial revenue. Production at Bernin site was affected from April 5th to April 9th by a power outage due to a fire that broke out at an external electricity supply facility  and from June 10th to June 16th by a strike action. Soitec should however be able to progressively make up for the lost production (around 10 days) and does not expect these events to impact its FY’23 guidance.Story continuesMobile communicationsIn the first quarter of FY’23  Mobile communications revenue reached 152 million Euros  a 6% growth at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to the first quarter of FY’22. Growth continues to be supported by the adoption of 5G smartphones and WiFi6  as well as the deployment of 5G infrastructure. It mainly reflects an increase in volumes.RF-SOI wafer sales continue to be boosted by the increase in RF content in every 5G smartphone and by better penetration of high-end phones. Growth is driven by RF-SOI 300-mm  enabled by a good ramp-up in production following the ongoing capacity increase at the Singapore facility.Sales of FD-SOI wafers for 5G mmWave modules recorded a significant increase confirming the ongoing adoption of this technology by several players.Regarding sales of POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers dedicated to RF filters for 5G smartphones  Soitec is still in the adoption phase by several customers for the coming quarters.Automotive & IndustrialAutomotive & Industrial revenue reached 23 million Euros in the first quarter of FY’23  a 37% increase at constant exchange rates and perimeter compared to the first quarter of FY’22. Growth reflects a very strong increase in volumes combined with a slightly positive price/mix effect. Demand from the automotive industry is supported by increasing needs for infotainment  ADAS & functional safety  as well as electrical vehicles.Growth is mainly coming from Power-SOI wafers  which are used for automotive applications  while FD-SOI wafers moved from a minimal contribution of Automotive & Industrial revenue in the first quarter of FY’22 to a substantial proportion in the first quarter of FY’23.Smart devicesSmart devices revenue reached 28 million Euros in the first quarter of FY’23  a less than 2 million Euros decrease compared to the first quarter of FY’22. Performance reflects lower volumes  including a different timing of sales during the year  partially offset by a positive price/mix effect.Sales of Imager-SOI wafers  which allow improved imager performance in near infrared  and Photonics-SOI wafers for data transceivers remained at a solid level.Sales of FD-SOI wafers recorded a strong increase compared to the first quarter of FY’22 confirming pervasive demand for Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing devices across consumer and industrial sectors.Confirmed FY’23 outlookSoitec continues to anticipate FY’23 revenue to grow around 20% at constant exchange rates and perimeter  and FY’23 EBITDA1 margin2 to reach around 36%.Key events of the quarterCEA  Soitec  GlobalFoundries and STMicroelectronics to advance next generation FD-SOI roadmap for automotive  IoT and mobile applicationsOn April 8th  2022  leading semiconductor players CEA  Soitec  GlobalFoundries and STMicroelectronics announced a new collaboration in which they intend to jointly define the industry’s next generation roadmap for FD-SOI technology. Semiconductors and FD-SOI innovation are of strategic value to France and the EU as well as to customers globally. FD-SOI offers substantial benefits for designers and customer systems  including lower power consumption as well as easier integration of additional features such as connectivity and security  a key feature for automotive  IoT and mobile applications.Soitec released its first 200-mm silicon carbide SmartSiC™ waferOn May 4th  2022  Soitec announced the release of its first 200-mm silicon carbide SmartSiC™ wafer  from the pilot line at its Substrate Innovation Center. The release enabled Soitec to demonstrate the quality and performance of 200-mm SmartSiC™ engineered substrates and to conduct a first round of key customer validations. The addition of 200-mm is enlarging Soitec’s SiC product portfolio beyond 150-mm to address an even larger variety of customer requirements  in terms of product quality  reliability  volume  and energy efficiency.Soitec announced the extension of its Pasir Ris Facility to produce 300mm SOI wafersOn June 8th  2022  Soitec announced the extension of its Pasir Ris facility in Singapore  with the objective to add a new capacity of 1 million wafers per year. Soitec expects the construction of this extension to start in FY’23  and the fab to enter into operation by the end of FY’25. The robust level of customer demand gives Soitec enough visibility to accelerate the launch of this new fab  which was initially planned for FY’26. Combining Bernin II  Pasir Ris I and Pasir Ris II  Soitec’s total 300-mm SOI production capacity will ultimately reach 2.7 million wafers per year. The extension of Pasir Ris is also due to include additional refresh and epitaxy capacities.Post-closing eventSTMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries to advance FD-SOI ecosystem with new 300mm manufacturing facility in FranceOn July 11th  2022  STMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries announced the creation of a new  jointly-operated 300-mm semiconductor manufacturing facility adjacent to ST’s existing site in Crolles  France. This new facility will support several technologies  in particular FD-SOI-based technologies  and will cover multiple variants. This includes GF’s market leading FDX technology and ST’s comprehensive technology roadmap down to 18nm  which are expected to remain in high demand for Automotive  IoT  and Mobile applications for the next few decades. The facility is targeted to ramp at full capacity by 2026  with up to 620 000 wafers per year production at full build-out.# # #Analysts conference call to be held in English on Tuesday 26th July at 8:00 am CET.To listen this conference call  the audiocast is available live and in replay at the following address: https://channel.royalcast.com/soitec/#!/soitec/20220726_1# # #AgendaSoitec’s Annual General Meeting will be held on July 26th  2022.Q2’23 revenue is due to be published on October 26th  2022  after market close.# # #DisclaimerThis document is provided by Soitec (the “Company”) for information purposes only.The Company’s business operations and financial position are described in the Company’s 2021-2022 Universal Registration Document (which notably includes the 2021-2022 Annual Financial Report) which was filed on June 20  2022 with the French stock market authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers  or AMF) under number D.22-0523.

We explain what to expect in the near term.,Crispus is a Financial Analyst for Invezz covering the stock  cryptocurrency and forex markets. He’s an experienced analyst with… read moreThe DAX index pulled back on Tuesday as investors continued worrying about corporate earnings  European gas crisis  and the hawkish Federal Reserve and European Central Bank (ECB). The index dropped to a low of €13 200  which was slightly below this week’s high of €13 368.Germany stocks under pressureThe DAX index is under intense pressure as investors worry about the ongoing turmoil in Europe. Last week  Mario Draghi  the respected Italian Prime Minister resigned  meaning that the country will soon go to a new election.Are you looking for fast-news  hot-tips and market analysis? Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter  today.At the same time  there are concerns about Europe’s energy future after Russia’s Gazprom announced that it will reduce gas supplies via its Nord Stream 1 pipeline. It slashed deliveries to about 20% and there is a likelihood that it will end shipments in the coming months.Germany will be in a crisis mode considering that the country depends mostly on Russia’s energy. As such  there is a likelihood that the country will implement gas rationing in the coming months  which will affect companies profitability. Indeed  there are concerns about whether German companies will become competitive without cheap Russian gas.The DAX index is also reacting to last week’s decision by the European Central Bank (ECB) to hike interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. The bank also hinted that it will continue hiking interest rates in the coming months. Historically  German stocks tend to underperform in a period when the ECB is hawkish.The next key catalyst for the index will be the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Analysts expect that the bank will deliver a 0.75% interest rate hike as it continues fighting inflation.The top performers in the DAX index on Tuesday were companies Siemens Healthineers  Symrise  Beirsdorf  MTU Aero  and Deutsche Boerse. All these shares rose by more than 1%. On the other hand  the worst performers were Zalando  HelloFresh  Adidas  and Daimler.DAX index forecastThe four-hour chart shows that the DAX index formed a double-bottom pattern at €12 451. In price action analysis  this pattern is usually a bullish sign. The index then found a strong resistance level at €13 368  which was the highest point on June 29th.The DAX 40 index has moved above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved below the overbought level. It has also formed a bullish flag pattern. Therefore  the index will likely have a bullish break-out as bulls target the next key level at €14 000.Where to buy right nowTo invest simply and easily  users need a low-fee broker with a track record of reliability.

So this continent has huge strengths ” he said.Some of its “structural weaknesses” he said are that European markets are more fragmented than the US. While he is not quite so sure that Europe could create its own Godzilla companies there are “many very material niche markets that are very big that allow European companies to be global peers ” he said.One of those niche markets is fintech  especially payment systems  which Europe has raised several big names including Klarna and Revolut. But the other big player will be deep tech  predicts Boujnah.“I do believe that in the semiconductors  in the telecom equipment  in the software side of the universe  above and beyond the usual buzzwords like that.“And the European deep tech technology skills and assets are going to make the difference in the years to come”.,negative,0.08,0.37,0.54,mixed,0.18,0.25,0.57,True,English,"['tech companies', 'stagnation fears', 'Euronext', 'Europe', 'Euronews', 'European deep tech technology skills', 'high-quality technology projects', 'new technology initiative', 'homogeneous technology players', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'current economic climate', 'International Financial Forum', 'European member countries', 'several big names', 'strongest tech scene', 'other big player', 'specialised asset managers', 'European technology companies', 'European tech leaders', 'material niche markets', 'private equity funds', 'European tech companies', 'European markets', 'tech funds', 'European companies', 'other investors', 'big difference', 'rising prices', 'interest rates', 'Managing Board', 'smaller valuation', 'consistent progress', 'venture capitalists', 'United States', 'strong research', 'blue chip', 'huge strengths', 'structural weaknesses', 'global peers', 'payment systems', 'telecom equipment', 'software side', 'usual buzzwords', 'Godzilla companies', 'past 15 years', 'collective group', 'Stephane Boujnah', 'Creating Europe', 'start-ups', 'stagflation', 'Euronext', 'situation', 'CEO', 'Chairman', 'Euronews', 'Paris', 'outlook', 'bloc', 'June', 'bid', 'Nasdaq', 'sector', 'visibility', 'continent', 'reasons', 'creation', 'part', 'location', 'giants', 'Amazon', 'Google', 'academia', 'People', 'pipe', 'debt', 'sake', 'pensions', 'fintech', 'Klarna', 'Revolut', 'semiconductors', 'universe', 'assets']",2022-07-26,2022-07-26,euronews.com
8172,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/26/eutelsat-and-oneweb-agree-merger-to-create-european-satellite-juggernaut/,Eutelsat and OneWeb agree on merger to create European satellite juggernaut – TechCrunch,Two major players in the European satellite space are merging in a $3.4 billion all-share transaction  a move that is widely seen as a challenge to Elon...,Two major players in the European satellite space are merging in a $3.4 billion all-share transaction  a move that is widely seen as a challenge to Elon Musk’s SpaceX.Rumors emerged earlier this week that France’s Eutelsat was gearing up to buy its British rival OneWeb  and the duo have now confirmed these plans.Founded in 1977  Eutelsat is a long-established provider of satellite services for myriad industries  from broadcast television and aviation  to IoT and telecom. The Paris-based company  whose biggest shareholder is French state-owned investment bank Bpifrance  says it currently has 36 GEO (geostationary orbit) satellites in operation.OneWeb  meanwhile  is a newer entrant to the space  focused on low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites for delivering internet services. Although OneWeb is 10 years old  it only launched its first tranche of satellites into orbit in 2019  and a year later the London-based company filed for bankruptcy having raised $3 billion from a slew of investors including SoftBank  Qualcomm and Virgin. Later in 2020  OneWeb emerged from bankruptcy with backing from the U.K. government and India’s Bharti Global  with Eutelsat later buying a 24% stake in the company.Crowded spaceA number of notable players are battling it out in the burgeoning satellite space race  including Amazon via its Kuiper project that is expected to begin launching satellites later this year; and more notably Elon Musk-led SpaceX  which has been launching satellites at a rate of knots — the company now has more than 2 500 satellites in orbit and completed its 33rd launch of the year on Sunday  sending a further 53 into space.Moreover  SpaceX is already selling its Starlink-branded broadband service directly to consumers in several markets around the world.OneWeb  for its part  currently has 428 LEO satellites in orbit  and it has been ramping up its commercial agreements  including a deal with AT&T to deliver high-speed broadband to remote locations in the U.S. And this highlights one of the key differences between SpaceX’s Starlink and OneWeb — the former seems to be targeting consumers directly  whereas OneWeb is pursuing a B2B approach.Following its merger with Eutelsat  the duo are planning to double down on their existing partnership  which includes a global distribution agreement they entered into back in March. And today  the two companies revealed that they have signed a new commercial partnership that addresses the “European and global cruise markets.”Ultimately  Eutelsat and OneWeb are touting the complementary nature of their respective products as the big opportunity here: Eutelsat’s GEO satellites  which are higher altitude and thus higher latency  are better suited for things like weather forecasts and TV broadcasts. And OneWeb’s constellation of lower-altitude satellites are better for critical communications that require low-latency data transfers. Combined  the companies argue that they will be better positioned to target a broader array of use cases across the B2B and B2C spheres.The companies’ joint press release issued today reads:The operations of Eutelsat and OneWeb are highly complementary. A clear roadmap has been designed to develop over time a complementary GEO/LEO service including a common platform  hybrid terminals and a fully mutualized network creating a one-stop shop solution for customers  providing them with a unique offering and a seamless user experience.What’s also notable about this deal is that it sees both the French and U.K. governments formally coming together as joint shareholders in the new combined entity  though it’s not clear how much stakes they will each retain in the new company  or whether they will have seats on the board.The proposal notes that the transaction will see OneWeb shares exchanged with new shares issued by Eutelsat  with Eutelsat owning 100% of OneWeb when the deal closes — with the exception of what is referred to as the “special share” that the U.K. government will retain in OneWeb.OneWeb will continue to trade under its existing brand and remain headquartered in the U.K.  while Eutelsat will still operate from its HQ in France and remain listed on the Euronext stock exchange in Paris. Under the proposals  current Eutelsat CEO Eva Berneke would stay as CEO of the new combined company  while chairman Dominique D’Hinnin will also continue as head of the board. It’s not clear what role — if any — OneWeb CEO Neil Masterson would have at the new company.The transaction  if greenlighted by the usual regulatory bodies  is expected to close by the end of the first half of 2023 — so this potentially has another year or so until completion.,neutral,0.03,0.92,0.05,mixed,0.22,0.22,0.56,True,English,"['European satellite juggernaut', 'Eutelsat', 'OneWeb', 'merger', 'TechCrunch', 'current Eutelsat CEO Eva Berneke', 'chairman Dominique D’Hinnin', 'French state-owned investment bank', 'companies’ joint press release', 'burgeoning satellite space race', 'OneWeb CEO Neil Masterson', '36 GEO (geostationary orbit) satellites', 'low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites', 'low-latency data transfers', 'one-stop shop solution', 'seamless user experience', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'usual regulatory bodies', 'global distribution agreement', 'Starlink-branded broadband service', 'complementary GEO/LEO service', 'new combined entity', 'U.K. government', 'global cruise markets', 'Two major players', '$3.4 billion all-share transaction', 'new commercial partnership', 'new combined company', 'European satellite space', 'satellite services', '428 LEO satellites', 'GEO satellites', 'joint shareholders', 'two companies', 'Bharti Global', 'U.S.', 'notable players', 'several markets', 'commercial agreements', 'high-speed broadband', 'existing partnership', 'complementary nature', 'new shares', 'new company', 'Crowded space', 'Elon Musk', 'British rival', 'myriad industries', 'broadcast television', 'biggest shareholder', 'newer entrant', 'internet services', 'first tranche', 'Kuiper project', '33rd launch', 'AT&T', 'remote locations', 'key differences', 'respective products', 'big opportunity', 'higher altitude', 'higher latency', 'weather forecasts', 'TV broadcasts', 'lower-altitude satellites', 'critical communications', 'broader array', 'use cases', 'B2C spheres', 'clear roadmap', 'common platform', 'hybrid terminals', 'mutualized network', 'unique offering', 'special share', 'existing brand', 'first half', 'Paris-based company', 'London-based company', 'B2B approach', 'OneWeb shares', '2,500 satellites', 'move', 'challenge', 'SpaceX', 'Rumors', 'France', 'duo', 'plans', 'provider', 'aviation', 'IoT', 'telecom', 'operation', 'bankruptcy', 'slew', 'investors', 'SoftBank', 'Qualcomm', 'Virgin', 'India', '24% stake', 'number', 'Amazon', 'rate', 'knots', 'year', 'Sunday', 'consumers', 'world', 'deal', 'merger', 'March', 'things', 'constellation', 'time', 'customers', 'stakes', 'seats', 'board', 'proposal', 'exception', 'HQ', 'head', 'role', 'end', 'completion']",2022-07-26,2022-07-26,techcrunch.com

OneWeb is one of the two only global LEO networks and has experienced strong momentum over recent months  with service expected to be fully deployed in 2023.The transaction would represent a logical next step in the successful partnership between Eutelsat and OneWeb  started with Eutelsat's equity investment in OneWeb in April 2021 and deepened with the Global Distribution Agreement announced in March 2022. Eutelsat currently holds 23% of OneWeb's share capital  alongside a consortium of high-profile public and private investors.Under the terms of the transaction being discussed  Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders would each hold 50% of the combined group's shares.The transaction would be structured as a contribution by OneWeb's shareholders of their stake in OneWeb to Eutelsat in exchange for newly issued Eutelsat shares. Any combination would be subject to  among other conditions  approval by the requisite majority of Eutelsat shareholders and receipt of all relevant antitrust and regulatory (including foreign investment) approvals.There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement. Eutelsat will inform the market as soon as soon as there are any new developments.Related LinksEutelsat CommunicationsThe latest information about the Commercial Satellite IndustryThanks for being there;We need your help.

Importantly  Fixed Broadband and Mobile Connectivity businesses have delivered double-digit growth highlighting their long-term potential whereas our Broadcast business has shown an improvement in trend in the second semester. In parallel  all the components necessary to foster our Telecom Pivot are gradually being put in place  including a new organization  an integrated platform and adequate in-orbit resources which will enable us to address the massive long-term connectivity opportunity. For the first year of our investment  our cooperation with OneWeb has been strengthened with in particular  the conclusion of a global distribution agreement to address all connectivity verticals further strengthened by an exclusive commercial partnership. Looking ahead  Operating Verticals revenues for FY 2022-23 are expected between €1 150 and €1 180 million4 with a return to growth in FY 2023-24 fully reiterated. Cash generation will remain sustained with an Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow objective expected on average at €420 million per annum in the next couple of years. We are also renewing our commitment to strong shareholder returns with a recommended dividend maintained at a high level of €0.93 per share.”EBITDA  EBITDA margin  Net debt / EBITDA ratio  Cash Capex  Discretionary Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow are considered Alternative Performance Indicators.

Cumulative Reported DFCF above €2.2bn over the last 5 years.Net Debt / EBITDA ratio at 3.27x (versus 2.88x last year) ahead of phase 2 of C-Band proceeds.Putting all components in place to foster the Telecom PivotMassive long-term market opportunity for both B2C and B2B connectivity.Successful launch of our Eutelsat Advance managed services solutions with a promising commercial start  notably in Maritime.Reorganization along two business lines  Video and Connectivity to enhance customer-centricity  gain efficiency and favour return to growth  as part of Comete project.Substantial growth capacity entering service from FY 2023-24 with high level of pre-commitments.Closer cooperation with OneWeb which is making good progress despite Russian headwindInvestment closed with a further strengthening of the initial stake making Eutelsat OneWeb’s second largest shareholder.Global distribution partnership secured to address key connectivity verticals  deepening cooperation and showcasing operational synergies between the two companies.Exclusive commercial partnership agreement  with Eutelsat taking a firm commitment for some OneWeb’s capacity and benefitting from exclusive use over certain pre-determined sales regions and verticals  in particular continental Europe and Global cruise.Following the suspension of operations in Baikonur  OneWeb to resume satellite launches with SpaceX and New Space India.Continued commercial traction highlighting substantial long-term potential.Updated financial objectives including confirmed return to topline growth from FY 2023-24Operating Vertical revenues expected between €1 150 million and €1 180 million in FY 2022-23.Operating Vertical revenues expected to grow from FY 2023-24 on the back of the entry into service of new assets with substantial firm precommitments.Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow objective expected at an average of €420 million per year in FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24  representing a cumulative Adjusted DFCF generation of €1 361 million over three fiscal years (FY 2021-22  FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24) at a 1.00 €/$ rate.All objectives are set using a 1.00 €/$ rate.Recommended dividend of €0.93 per share  subject to AGM approvalDividend covered more than twice by Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow.Scrip dividend option to be proposed to shareholders.ANALYSIS OF REVENUES5In € millions FY 2020-21 FY 2021-22 Change Reported Like-for-like6 Broadcast 741.0 696.9 -6.0% -6.9% Data & Professional Video 161.4 158.5 -1.8% -4.2% Government Services 151.4 144.4 -4.6% -7.9% Fixed Broadband 80.2 68.7 -14.3% +36.0% Mobile Connectivity 67.2 79.9 +18.9% +15.0% Total Operating Verticals 1 201.2 1 148.3 -4.4% -3.8% Other Revenues7 32.7 3.3 -89.9% -11.8% Total 1 233.9 1 151.6 -6.7% -3.9% EUR/USD exchange rate 1.19 1.14Total revenues for FY 2021-22 stood at €1 152 million  down by 6.7% on a reported basis and by 3.9% like-for-like.Revenues of the five Operating Verticals (ie  excluding ‘Other Revenues’) stood at €1 148 million. They were down by 3.8% on a like-for-like basis excluding a positive currency effect of circa 2 points as well as a negative perimeter effect of circa 2.5 points from the disposal of Euro Broadband Infrastructure (EBI) on 30 April 2021  only partly offset by the consolidation of Bigblu Broadband Europe since 1st October 2020.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €293 million down 3.8% on a reported basis and by 3.3% like-for-like. Revenues of the five Operating Verticals stood at €295 million  down 3.1% year-on-year and up 1.5% quarter-on-quarter on a like-for-like basis.Unless otherwise stated  all variations indicated below are on a like-for-like basis  ie  at constant currency and perimeter.Broadcast (61% of revenues)FY 2021-22 Broadcast revenues were down 6.9% like-for-like to €697 million. They reflected predominantly the effect of the partial renewal of capacity with Nilesat at 7/8° West as well as lower revenues in Europe in the first half of the fiscal year due largely to the carry-forward effect of a slowdown in the pace of new business during the Covid period.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €174 million  down by 5.8% year-on-year. Excluding the 7/8° West impact  Broadcast revenues experienced a low-single-digit decline. Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were broadly stable for the second quarter in a row.Data & Professional Video (14% of revenues)FY 2021-22 Data & Professional Video revenues stood at €159 million  down by 4.2% year-on-year  a trend which is broadly in keeping with the previous fiscal year (-3.7%).Fixed Data  which accounts for more than two thirds of this vertical  is benefiting from higher volumes which partly offset a continued double-digit price pressure. Professional Video remains in structural decline  although it benefited from a robust performance in Occasional Use.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €41 million  down 5.8% year-on-year and 1.1% quarter-on-quarter.Government Services (12% of revenues)FY 2021-22 Government Services revenues stood at €144 million  down 7.9% year-on-year. This reflected the negative effect of US Government renewals  driven by the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan which led to a renewal rate of circa 75% during the fiscal year  as well as the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A. These headwinds were only partly offset by initial incremental revenues secured on EUTELSAT QUANTUM.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €36 million  down 12.9% year-on-year. They were stable quarter-on-quarter.Fixed Broadband (6% of revenues)FY 2021-22 Fixed Broadband revenues stood at €69 million  up 36.0% year-on-year. They reflected the contribution from the wholesale agreements with Orange  TIM and  from November 2021  Hispasat  the strong dynamic of our African operations and the ramp-up of the multi-beam agreement signed on EUTELSAT 65 West A with several Mexican service providers. Revenues also benefitted from a positive one-off in the Fourth Quarter amounting to circa €2.5 million. These tailwinds more than offset the erosion of the legacy business of Bigblu Broadband on the KA-SAT satellite.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €22 million  up 26.0% quarter-on-quarter and largely reflecting the above-mentioned one-off. They were up 39.2% on a year-on-year basis (+22.4% excluding the one-off).Mobile Connectivity (7% of revenues)FY 2021-22 Mobile Connectivity revenues stood at €80 million  up 15.0% year-on-year. Revenues reflected the carry-forward effect of the contract signed with Anuvu last year as well as the ongoing strong growth of Maritime  driven by the ramp-up of contracts with service providers signed in recent years and by the agreement inked earlier this year on EUTELSAT QUANTUM with a customer in the Middle East. These tailwinds more than offset the downsizing of a contract with a service provider in the Middle East.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €23 million  up 16.4% year-on-year and 4.5% quarter-on-quarter.On the commercial front  Eutelsat has been selected by Telenor Maritime for in-orbit resources and managed services for cruise connectivity on several of its satellites. Under the agreement Eutelsat will deliver capacity on EUTELSAT 33E for coverage of the Mediterranean Sea  and on multiple satellites  together with its Eutelsat ADVANCE managed connectivity service  for coverage of the Caribbean Sea. This deal testifies to the strong momentum of the maritime connectivity business and showcases the compelling combination of Eutelsat's in-orbit resources and its Eutelsat ADVANCE solution.Other RevenuesOther Revenues amounted to €3 million versus €33 million a year earlier. They included a negative €12 million impact from hedging operations compared to a positive effect of €16 million last year.OPERATIONAL AND UTILIZED TRANSPONDERSThe number of operational transponders at 30 June 2022 stood at 1 361 units  down 16 units year-on-year  the latter reflecting principally the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A.The number of utilized transponders stood at 996 units  up 15 units year-on-year  reflecting principally the ramp-up of the maritime connectivity vertical  partially offset by the renewal campaigns with the US Government as well as the partial renewal with Nilesat.As a result  the fill rate stood at 73.2% compared with 71.2% a year ago.30 June 2021 30 June 2022 Operational transponders8 1 377 1 361 Utilized transponders9 981 996 Fill rate 71.2% 73.2% Note: Based on 36 MHz-equivalent transponders excluding high throughput capacityBACKLOGAt 30 June 2022 the backlog stood at €4.0 billion  down 7.5% compared to 30 June 2021  largely reflecting natural backlog consumption.The backlog was equivalent to 3.5 times 2021-22 revenues  with Broadcast representing 62%.30 June 2021 30 June 2022 Value of contracts (in billions of euros) 4.4 4.0 In years of revenues based on last fiscal year 3.5 3.5 Share of Broadcast 64% 62% Note: The backlog represents future revenues from capacity or service agreements and can include contracts for satellites under procurement.PROFITABILITYEBITDA stood at €862 million versus €922 million at 30 June 2021  down 6.5%. Despite lower revenues  the EBITDA margin is stable at 74.8% (75.0% at constant currency and excluding Hedging) versus 74.7% a year earlier.Opex were €26m lower than last fiscal year at constant currency reflecting the favorable effect of changes in perimeter  lower Bad Debt and continued strict cost discipline in the legacy businesses which more than offset additional costs for growth verticals. In the context of the LEAP 2 cost-saving program  €24 million savings are being achieved  in the high end of the 20-25 million annual savings target range.Group share of net income stood at €231 million versus €214 million in FY 2020-21  up by 7.8%. The net margin stood at 20% versus 17% last year. This reflected mainly:Lower depreciation and amortisation costs of -€482 million at 30 June 2022 compared with -€508 million a year earlier  as a result of the disposal of the KA-SAT satellite in May 2021 and of the end of the amortisation period of certain in-orbit assets  which more than offset the effect of the entry into service of KONNECT in November 2020 and of EUTELSAT QUANTUM in November 2021.of -€482 million at 30 June 2022 compared with -€508 million a year earlier  as a result of the disposal of the KA-SAT satellite in May 2021 and of the end of the amortisation period of certain in-orbit assets  which more than offset the effect of the entry into service of KONNECT in November 2020 and of EUTELSAT QUANTUM in November 2021. Other operating income of +€45 million versus -€67 million last year. FY 2021-22 included the $125m payment related to Phase I of C-Band proceeds  partly offset by some asset impairments recorded mostly in the first half.

Negative income from associates ((€72) million) reflecting the contribution of the stake in OneWeb since September.CASH FLOWNet cash flow from operating activities amounted to €801 million  €88 million lower than last year. This reflected the decrease in EBITDA as well as an unfavourable comparison basis for working capital requirement as FY 2020-21 benefitted from a catch up after the Covid crisis. Excluding the tax related to the phase I of C-Band proceeds  cash tax was lower than in previous year.Cash Capex10 amounted to €280 million (€63 million below FY 2020-21)  well within our €400m per annum envelope and not reflective of our long-term expectations. FY 2020-21 notably included anticipated leases and ECA repayments.Interest and other fees paid net of interest received amounted to €78 million  essentially unchanged versus last year (€80 million).As a result  Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow amounted to €443 million on a reported basis. At the €/$ rate which was set for financial objectives (1.20) and excluding the impact of hedging and one-off costs  Adjusted DFCF stood at €460 million  down 2.1% compared to the record high level of FY 2020-21  but well above our expected range of objectives (€400 to €430 million).Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow represented 38% of revenues.FINANCIAL STRUCTUREAt 30 June 2022 net debt stood at €2 814 million  a €159m increase versus end of June 2021. It mainly reflected  on one hand  the €443 million reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow and the first instalment of C-Band proceeds net of tax of €86 million  and on the other  the dividend payment of €222 million (including minority interests) and the outflow in respect of inorganic investments of €495m  mostly OneWeb. Other items (mostly variations related to leases  structured debt and the foreign exchange portion of the cross-currency swap) contributed to the decrease in net debt for a net impact of €28 million.As a result  the net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at 3.27x  0.39x higher compared to end-June 2021 (2.88x).The weighted average maturity of the Group’s debt stood at 4.3 years (5.0 years at end-June 2021) and the average cost of debt after hedging stood at 2.55% versus 2.4% in FY 2020-21. The Group’s liquidity position at the end of June 2022 including cash and undrawn credit lines stood at around €1.9 billion.DIVIDENDOn 25 July 2022 the Board of Directors agreed to recommend to the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders a dividend of €0.93 per share for FY 2021-22  unchanged versus last fiscal year.An option for shareholders to receive the entire dividend  either in cash or in new shares of the Company will be proposed.OUTLOOK AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVESWith a robust backlog  an industry-leading profitability and a proven ability to generate a high level of Free Cash Flow  Eutelsat is in a strong position to face the challenges of FY 2022-23  which is expected to be the last year of transition before a return to growth from FY 2023-24  driven by new in-orbit resources.Broadcast revenue trend is expected to materially improve in FY 2022-23 relative to FY 2021-22 (-6.9%). Nevertheless  while the impact of the Nilesat headwind will wash out from mid-October 2022  revenues will be negatively affected by the anticipated non-renewal of the capacity contract with Digitürk  leading to an overall mid-single digit decline for this application.Data & Professional Video revenue trend in FY 2022-23 will remain largely in keeping with the mid-single digit decline trend reported in FY 2021-22 (-4.2%).Government Services revenue will reflect  on one hand  the ramp-up of EUTELSAT QUANTUM  and on the other  the carry-forward effect of FY 2021-22 below-average renewals. The outturn of the fiscal year will also remain dependent on the outcome of future renewals.Fixed Broadband and Mobility will keep growing in FY 2022-23  although at a slower pace compared to the massive double-digit growth recorded in FY 2021-22 (respectively +36.0% and +15.0%)  ahead of the arrival of incremental capacity.Taking these elements into account  we expect to generate revenues from the five Operating Verticals of between €1 150-1 180 million in FY 2022-23  based on a €/$ rate of 1.00  representing a -4% like-for-like decline at mid-point versus FY 2021-22  in keeping with the trend of FY 2021-22. Thanks to new capacity including notably the firm precommitments secured on EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS and EUTELSAT 10B  revenues are expected to grow from FY 2023-24.Cash Capex11 will not exceed €400 million per annum for each of the next two fiscal years (FY 2022-23 / FY 2023-24).The Group will continue to leverage all measures to maximise cash generation with an objective of Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow expected at an average of €420 million per year at a €/$ rate of 1.00 for FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24. This is equivalent to a cumulative Adjusted DFCF generation of €1 361 million over three fiscal years at a 1.00 €/$ rate (FY 2021-22  FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24). Adjusted DFCF objectives exclude future payments related to the exclusive commercial partnership with OneWeb mentioned below.We remain committed to a sound financial structure and continue to target a medium-term net debt / EBITDA ratio of around 3x.A €0.93 per share dividend will be proposed to the upcoming AGM with a scrip option. Beyond that  the dividend policy is suspended in the context of the Oneweb transaction.This outlook is based on the nominal deployment plan outlined below. It assumes no material deterioration of revenues generated from Russian customers. It excludes the impact of the contemplated combination with OneWeb.COMETE PROJECTEutelsat has decided to adapt its organisation to better serve its strategic priorities  the evolution of its markets and the specific characteristics of each of its businesses.In this context  two distinct Business Units  Video and Connectivity  will be created and will integrate all the activities carried out by the current Sales Department  as well as the teams providing support for customer services  currently in the Technical Department. The new organisation  which is expected to be fully in place early in calendar year 2023  will place customer satisfaction at the heart of our operations  enable differentiated sales strategies per each sub-segment and increase collaboration between the relevant teams.This new organization will be instrumental to foster return to growth  enhance customer centricity  and ensure an optimized efficiency in the use of the resources of the company.FLEET DEPLOYMENTNominal deployment programCompared to the last quarterly update in May 2022  the entry into service of EUTELSAT 10B has been slightly delayed from the end of the first half of calendar 2023 to the third quarter of calendar year 2023.Satellite Orbital position Estimated entry into service (calendar year) Main applications Main geographic coverage Physical Transponders/ Spot beams Of which expansion EUTELSAT 10B 10° East Q3 2023 Mobile Connectivity EMEA Atlantic & Indian Ocean 12 Ku 10 C >100 Ku spot beams -48 Ku c. 35 Gbps EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13G 13° East H1 2023 Broadcast Europe MENA 80 Ku1 EGNOS payload EGNOS payload KONNECT VHTS To be confirmed H2 2023 Connectivity Europe ~230 Ka spot beams 500 Gbps EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13F 13° East Q2/Q3 2023 Broadcast Europe MENA 80 Ku1 None EUTELSAT 36D 36° East H2 2024 Broadcast Government Africa  Russia  Europe 70 Ku UHF payload UHF payload 1 Nominal capacity corresponding to the specifications of the satellites.

These indicators are the object of reconciliation with the consolidated accounts.EBITDA  EBITDA margin and Net debt / EBITDA ratioEBITDA reflects the profitability of the Group before Interest  Tax  Depreciation and Amortisation. It is a frequently used indicator in the Fixed Satellite Services Sector and more generally the Telecom industry. The table below shows the calculation of EBITDA based on the consolidated P&L accounts for FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22:Twelve months ended June 30 (€ millions) 2021 2022 Operating income 347.2 424.8 + Depreciation and Amortisation 507.7 481.7 - Other operating income and expenses 67.0 -44.9 EBITDA 921.9 861.6The EBITDA margin is the ratio of EBITDA to revenues. It is calculated as follows:Twelve months ended June 30 (€ millions) 2021 2022 EBITDA 921.9 861.6 Revenues 1 233.9 1 151.6 EBITDA margin (as a % of revenues) 74.7% 74.8%The Net debt / EBITDA ratio is the ratio of net debt to last-twelve months EBITDA. It is calculated as follows:Twelve months ended June 30 (€ millions) 2021 2022 Last twelve months EBITDA 921.9 861.6 Closing net debt16 2 655.5 2 814.4 Net debt / EBITDA 2.88x 3.27xCash CapexThe Group on occasion operates capacity within the framework of leases  or finances all or part of certain satellite programs under export credit agreements or through other bank facilities  leading to outflows which are not reflected in the item “acquisition of satellites and other tangible or intangible assets”. Cash Capex including the outflows related to these elements is published in order to reflect the totality of Capital Expenditures undertaken in any financial year.In addition  in the event of a partial or total loss of a satellite  as previously reported cash Capex included investment in assets which are inoperable or partially inoperable  the amount of insurance proceeds is deducted from Cash Capex.Cash Capex therefore covers the acquisition of satellites and other tangible or intangible assets  payments in respect of export credit facilities or other bank facilities financing investments as well as payments related to lease liabilities. If applicable it is net from the amount of insurance proceeds.The table below shows the calculation of Cash Capex for FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22:Twelve months ended June 30 (€ millions) 2021 2022 Acquisitions of satellites  other property and equipment and intangible assets (183.4) (177.2) Insurance proceeds 6.6 - Repayments of ECA loans  lease liabilities and other bank facilities 17 (165.2) (102.3) Cash Capex (342.0) (279.5)Discretionary Free Cash Flow (DFCF)The Group communicates on Discretionary Free Cash Flow which reflects its ability to generate cash after the payment of interest and taxes. DFCF generally and principally serves the shareholder remuneration and debt reduction.Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash flow from operating activities less Cash Capex as well as Interest and other fees paid net of interest received. It excludes C-Band proceeds and attendant tax.Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow (as per financial objectives) is calculated at the €/$ rate assumed in financial objectives (1.20) and excludes one-off impacts such as Hedging  effects of changes in perimeter when relevant  and one-off costs related to specific projects in particular to the LEAP 2 program and to the move to new headquarters. The table below shows the calculation of Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow for FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 and its reconciliation with the Cash Flow statement:Twelve months ended June 30 (€ millions) 2021 2022 Net cash flows from operating activities 889.0 800.9 Cash Capex (as defined above) (342.0) (279.5) Interest and other fees paid net of interest received (80.0) (78.3) Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow 467.1 443.2 Currency impact18 (3.2) (16.6) Hedging Impact (15.6) 11.8 One-off costs related to “LEAP 2” program and move to new headquarters 21.7 21.6 Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow 470.0 460.01 Dividend proposed at the next AGM.2 FY 2021-22 “Operating Verticals” revenues are converted at 1.20 €/$ rate.3 Please refer to Appendix 3 for more details on Alternative Performance Measures.4 Based on €/$ rate of 1.00 and on the nominal deployment plan outlined below. It assumes no material deterioration of revenues generated from Russian customers.5 The share of each application as a percentage of total revenues is calculated excluding “Other Revenues”.6 Change at constant currency and perimeter. The variation is calculated as follows: i) FY 2021-22 USD revenues are converted at FY 2020-21 rates; ii) the contribution of BigBlu Broadband Europe (BBB) from 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021 is excluded from FY 2021-22 revenues; iii) the contribution of Eurobroadband Infrastructure (EBI) is excluded from FY 2020-21 revenues; iv) Hedging revenues are excluded from Other Revenues.7 “Other Revenues” include mainly the impact of EUR/USD revenue currency hedging  the provision of various services or consulting/engineering fees and termination fees.8 Number of transponders on satellites in stable orbit  back-up capacity excluded.9 Number of transponders utilized on satellites in stable orbit.10 Please refer to Appendix 3 for more details on Alternative Performance Measures.11 Including capital expenditure and payments under existing export credit facilities and other bank facilities financing investments as well as payments related to lease liabilities.12 Operating expenses is defined as the sum of operating costs and of selling  general & administrative expenses.13 Forex portion.14 Mostly related to leases and structured debt.15 Change at constant currency and perimeter. The variation is calculated as follows: i) Q4 2021-22 USD revenues are converted at Q4 2020-21 rates; ii) the contribution of Eurobroadband Infrastructure (EBI) is excluded from Q4 2020-21 revenues; iii) Hedging impact is excluded from Other Revenues.16 Net debt includes all bank debt  bonds and all liabilities from lease agreements and structured debt as well as Forex portion of the cross-currency swap  less cash and cash equivalents (net of bank overdraft).

Eutelsat will combine its 36-strong fleet of GEO satellites with OneWeb’s constellation of 648 Low Earth Orbit satellites  of which 428 are currently in orbit.The transaction would be structured as an exchange of OneWeb shares by its shareholders (other than Eutelsat) with new shares issued by Eutelsat  such that  at closing  Eutelsat would own 100% of OneWeb (excluding the ‘Special Share’ of the UK Government). OneWeb shareholders would receive 230 million newly issued Eutelsat shares representing 50% of the enlarged share capital4.The potential transaction builds on the deepening collaboration between Eutelsat and OneWeb  begun with the equity stake acquired by Eutelsat in OneWeb in April 2021  the global distribution agreement between Eutelsat and OneWeb announced in March 2022  and the new exclusive commercial partnership5  addressing mainly the European and global cruise markets  signed today.Commenting on the combination  Dominique D’Hinnin  Eutelsat’s Chairman said “I am delighted to announce this new and significant step in the collaboration between Eutelsat and OneWeb. Bringing together our two businesses will deliver a global first  combining LEO constellations and GEO assets to seize the significant growth opportunity in Connectivity  and deliver to our customers solutions to their needs across an even wider range of applications. This combination will accelerate the commercialisation of OneWeb’s fleet  while enhancing the attractiveness of Eutelsat’s growth profile. In addition  the combination carries significant value creation potential  anchored on a balanced mix of revenue  cost and capex synergies. The strong support of strategic shareholders of both parties is a testament to the huge opportunity that this combination offers and the value that will be created for all its stakeholders. This is truly a game changer for our industry.”Sunil Bharti Mittal  OneWeb’s Executive Chairman said “Having played a pioneering role in providing connectivity in the emerging world  I am excited about the possibilities of connecting the unconnected. The combination of Eutelsat and OneWeb represents a significant development in that direction as well as a unique GEO/LEO combination. The positive early results of our service together with our strong pipeline represent a very exciting opportunity in the fast-growing satellite connectivity segment  especially for customers requiring a high speed  low latency experience. Our customers are actively seeking a combined GEO/LEO offering leading us towards this important step. Bharti  as the lead shareholder of OneWeb  along with other key shareholders  is looking forward to playing a meaningful role in providing expanded connectivity through the combination of OneWeb and Eutelsat.”Eva Berneke  Eutelsat’s Chief Executive Officer said “Our initial investment in OneWeb was underpinned by our strong belief that the future growth in Connectivity will be driven by both GEO and LEO capacity. This belief has intensified as our relationship with OneWeb has deepened  first by raising our stake in the company  and then with the global distribution agreement signed a few months ago. We are now moving to the next level  with a full combination that will ensure the potential of the GEO/LEO integration is fully realized  supported by compelling financial  strategic  and industrial logic. This ground-breaking combination will create a powerful global player with the financial strength and technical expertise to accelerate both OneWeb’s commercial deployment  and Eutelsat’s pivot to Connectivity. The combined entity will be geared towards profitable growth  with strong medium-term cash flow generation and a rapid deleveraging driven by strong forecast EBITDA growth. The benefits for our customers and strategic partners  who are at the center of our strategy  are both significant and unique. This is also a very exciting opportunity for our employees who will be key to the success of this transformation.”Neil Masterson  OneWeb’s Chief Executive Officer said “Just 20 months ago  OneWeb resumed its mission to connect the unconnected and remove the barriers to connectivity that hold back many of the world’s underserved economies and communities. Since then  we have turned this vision into reality and become the second largest low Earth orbit satellite operator in the world. Today’s announcement is another bold step in OneWeb’s remarkable journey. It is testament to the resilience  execution and innovation of our teams  the strong demand we have seen since launching our commercial services  and the close collaboration we have forged with our partners to provide high-speed  low latency connectivity for governments  businesses  and communities. This combination accelerates our mission to deliver connectivity that will change lives at scale and create a fast growing  well-funded company which will continue to create significant value for our shareholders.”A compelling market opportunityEutelsat and OneWeb will address the considerable Connectivity market opportunity  which is fueled by the growing needs of customers in both the B2B and B2C segments for consistent  reliable connectivity. These market segments are forecast to grow by three and five times respectively over the next decade  to reach a combined value of circa $16bn by 2030  with growth being served by both GEO HTS and LEO capacity6.Moreover  the combination of the network density  compelling economics and high throughput of GEO with the low latency and ubiquity of LEO  creates the optimal solution to address an even wider range of customer needs  thereby expanding the addressable market.A powerful combination  representing a game-changer in the industryThe operations of Eutelsat and OneWeb are highly complementary. A clear roadmap has been designed to develop over time a complementary GEO/LEO service including a common platform  hybrid terminals and a fully mutualized network creating a one-stop shop solution for customers  providing them with a unique offering and a seamless user experience.Tapping into significant revenue  cost and capex synergiesThe combination of Eutelsat with OneWeb is forecast to generate substantial value:Average annual revenue synergies are estimated at circa €150m after four years  with hybrid GEO/LEO offerings providing a premium service to customers as well as improving the fill rate.Synergies from joining organizational forces are expected to generate annual run-rate savings of over €80m pre-tax after five years  mostly through cost duplication avoidance.Capex optimization is expected to generate average savings estimated at circa €80m per annum  from year one. This would be achieved by leveraging the hybrid GEO/LEO satellite infrastructure and through the improved purchasing power of the combined entity.These sources of incremental value creation represent a balanced split between revenues  costs and capex. Taken together they equate to a net present value of over €1.5bn after tax (net of implementation costs).Value-creative pathway to robust  profitable growthThe transaction provides a platform for both entities to create value while transforming their respective growth profiles and cash generation potential.Combined entity would have revenues of circa €1.2bn and EBITDA of circa €0.7bn in FY22-23.Revenues are forecast to grow at low double-digit CAGR over the next decade.EBITDA is expected to grow at a mid-teen CAGR over the medium to long term  outpacing sales growth  with EBITDA margin levels moving gradually back in line with best-in-class GEO standards.The capex of the combined entity is estimated in average at some €725m to €875m  per annum  over the period FY23-24 - FY29-30.Well-funded investment programme and rapid deleveragingEutelsat’s strong cash flow generation will provide both visibility and funding to develop OneWeb’s fleet at minimal risk. Combined EBITDA – CAPEX  standing at circa -€0.2bn in FY22-23 is expected to be back in positive territory by FY24-25 - FY25-26 (depending on Gen-2 capex phasing).Eutelsat will temporarily suspend its dividend  and cash flow will be focused on the deployment of the Gen 2 constellation while maintaining a strong balance sheet.Leverage  which would stand at circa 4x net debt / EBITDA post transaction  is expected to be reduced on the back of strong EBITDA growth  backed by a disciplined financial policy  with an objective of leverage of circa 3x in the medium term.Eutelsat will pay its dividend in respect of FY21-22 with a scrip option. Thereafter  the dividend will be suspended for FY22-23 and FY23-24.Structure of the transactionThe transaction would be structured as an exchange of OneWeb shares for newly issued Eutelsat shares. This excludes the ‘Special Share’ in OneWeb which is retained by the UK Government together with the existing rights associated therewith. OneWeb shareholders would receive 230 million newly issued Eutelsat shares  representing 50% of Eutelsat’s enlarged share capital7.The number of new Eutelsat shares to be received by existing OneWeb shareholders would not be affected by the payment of the €0.93 per share dividend with a scrip option for FY 21-22 to be proposed at the upcoming AGM of Eutelsat.Trading under its existing name  OneWeb will continue to operate the LEO business  with OneWeb’s headquarters remaining in the UK.Eutelsat will continue to be headquartered and domiciled in France  listed on Euronext Paris and would apply for admission to the standard segment of the UK Official List of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange (subject to meeting the applicable eligibility requirements and the approval of the UK Financial Conduct Authority).A new balanced ownership and governanceThe combined entity will have a balanced ownership structure with a substantial free float alongside anchor public shareholders and supportive private investors.The Board of Directors of the combined group would consist of 15 members including ten independent directors. Seven directors  in addition to the CEO of Eutelsat  would be proposed by Eutelsat and its key shareholders and seven directors would be proposed by OneWeb and its key shareholders (the number of directors proposed by each of key Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders being commensurate to their shareholding in Eutelsat post transaction).It is contemplated that  post-closing  a shareholder agreement between Eutelsat key shareholders and OneWeb key shareholders which does not qualify as a concerted action be in place. It would in substance provide for the right for each party to propose 1 director (if its shareholding is at least 7.5%) and 2 directors (if its shareholding is at least 15%)  as well as a 6-month lock up period.Dominique D’Hinnin would be proposed as Chairman of the combined entity and Sunil Bharti Mittal as Co-Chairman (Vice-Président). Eva Berneke would continue as CEO of the combined entity.Indicative timetable and next stepsThe Memorandum of Understanding has been unanimously approved by each of Eutelsat’s and OneWeb’s board of directors and the envisaged transaction is fully supported by both parties’ long-term investors  namely Bpifrance  Fonds Stratégique de Participations  Bharti  HMG  SoftBank and Hanwha. CMA CGM  a shareholder of Eutelsat  is also supporting the proposed combination. It will be submitted to the French Eutelsat Works Council information and consultation process.The Memorandum of Understanding provides for customary exclusivity commitments by Eutelsat and key Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders.The transaction will be subject to clearance from relevant regulatory authorities.The transaction will also be conditional on approval by Eutelsat’s shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of Eutelsat  to take place by end of first half 2023. Bpifrance and Fonds Stratégique de Participations have undertaken to vote in favour of the transaction-related resolutions at this EGM  subject to usual conditions.The transaction is expected to close by the end of first half of 2023.AdvisorsEutelsat is assisted by d’Angelin & Co.

The resolutions presented  including those relating to the share consolidation  were approved by the shareholders with the exception of the 5th resolution  concerning the capital increase reserved for employees  which was rejected in accordance with the Board of Directors' recommendation. The Board of Directors of the Company  which met on the same day  decided to implement the share consolidation.Watch the video of Stéphane Le Roux  CEO of Spineway click hereImplementation of the share consolidationAt its meeting of July 25  2022  the Spineway Board of Directors decided to implement the reverse stock split of Spineway's share capital approved by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of July 25  2022 under the terms of its first resolution  at the rate of one (1) new share to be issued for forty thousand (40 000) existing shares to be consolidated. Taking into account the exchange parity retained  as a result of the consolidation  the number of outstanding shares will be divided by forty thousand (40 000). The par value of the Spineway share will be increased in proportion to the consolidation ratio and will increase from a ten thousandth (0.0001) of euro to four (4) euros.The purpose of this consolidation is to reduce the volatility of Spineway's share price  promote its stabilization and thus better reflect the Group's development prospects.This consolidation has no impact on the amount of share capital  only the par value of the share and  concomitantly  the number of shares in circulation are modified.The consolidation is therefore a purely technical adjustment  with no direct impact on the total value of the Spineway shares held by each shareholder. The mnemonic code (ALSPW) will remain unchanged. However  the ISIN code of the new SPINEWAY shares (post consolidation) will become FR001400BVK2.Story continuesGrouping methodsAll the terms and conditions of the business combination were approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting of July 25  2022 and are detailed in the notice of business combination which will be published in the Bulletin des Annonces Légales Obligatoires (BALO) on July 29  2022.The main terms are as follows:Basis of consolidation: exchange of forty thousand (40 000) existing shares with a par value of a ten thousandth (0.0001) of euro for one (1) new share with a par value of four (4) euros.Number of shares subject to the reverse split: all the shares comprising the capital of Spineway  i.e. twenty-three billion four hundred seventy-three million nine hundred twenty-one thousand and eight hundred seventy-four (23 473 921 874) shares.The number of shares subject to and to result from the reverse split will be increased  as the case may be  by the shares issued following the exercise of the rights of the beneficiaries of any securities giving access to the Company's share capital  or by the shares that would be issued as from the date of this notice.Number of post-consolidation shares: five hundred eighty-six thousand and eight hundred forty-eight (586 848) shares with a par value of four (4) euros each.Start date of the business combination: August 16  2022 .Effective date of the combination: September 14  2022 .Each shareholder will be automatically allocated  by his financial intermediary  one (1) new share for forty thousand (40 000) old shares held. The shareholders holding a number of shares multiple of forty thousand (40 000) will thus have no steps to take.Shareholders who do not hold a number of existing shares corresponding to a whole number of new shares must personally purchase or sell the fractional shares between August 16  2022 and September 14  2022 inclusive  in order to obtain a number of shares multiple of forty thousand (40 000).After this period  the new shares which could not be allotted individually and corresponding to fractional rights will be sold on the stock exchange by the account holder within 30 days from September 14  2022  in accordance with the provisions of articles L.228-6-1 and R.228-12 of the French Commercial Code and with market practice. The proceeds from the sale will be allocated in proportion to the fractional rights among the shareholders who would not have been able to obtain a number of shares in multiples of forty thousand (40 000) during the consolidation period.At the end of the consolidation period  the old shares not presented for consolidation will be delisted and will lose their voting rights and their right to dividends.Indicative schedule of consolidation operationsShare exchange period August 16  2022 Start of exchange operations September 14  2022 End of exchange operations Consolidation operations September 14  2022 Last listing of the old shares on Euronext Growth (ISIN code: FR0011398874) September 15  2022 First listing of the new shares on Euronext Growth (ISIN code: FR001400BVK2) September 19  2022 Allocation of the new shares Breakage management September 14  2022 Start of compensation of fractional shares by financial intermediaries October 14  2022 Deadline for the compensation of fractional shares by financial intermediariesUpcoming : September 8th 2022  Results of the 1st semester 2022SPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PEA-PME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

The PRIMAvera study aims to confirm the safety and clinical benefits provided by the Prima System and is the last clinical step before seeking market approval in Europe. The study was initiated in Q4 2020 in France where the first patient was implanted in March 2021. Pixium Vision has since established additional clinical sites and implanted patients in Germany as well as the UK and anticipates recruitment will be completed by the end of 2022 leading to a read-out of the PRIMAvera study primary endpoints around the end of 2023.""The PRIMAvera study has been making impressive progress with the implantation of patients in new clinical sites across Europe and we are very pleased to be joining these efforts to help bring the benefits of the innovative Prima System to those suffering from dry AMD "" said Dr. Koen van Overdam  Consultant Ophthalmologist and Vitreoretinal Surgeon at the Rotterdam Eye Hospital. ""The potential of the technology and the relative ease with which the small wireless implant can be surgically placed under the macula offer a real chance for patients who lost vision due to dry AMD and we look forward to contributing further to the PRIMAvera study.""Story continuesThe PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in the French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System.A total of 38 patients will be enrolled in the PRIMAvera study  an open-label  baseline-controlled  non-randomized  multi-center  prospective  single-arm pivotal trial. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline after 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

The main highlights include:First-half 2022 net current cash flow at €1.32 per share(2)  up 83.7% year-on-yearRetailer sales ( 3 ) near or above pre-pandemic level in the 5 undisturbed months of 2022  with a significant acceleration in the second quarter Like-for-like net rental income up 66.7% year on year Steady leasing activity with a 2.7% positive reversion and occupancy rate improving to 94.7% year on year Successful inauguration of the extension of Gran Reno (Bologna  Italy) early July  98% occupied  with a yield on cost of 7.6% and better-than-expected rents €431 million in disposals closed since January 1  2022 Stronger financial metrics with a Loan-to-Value ratio of 38.8%  a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 8.6x ( 4 ) and an ICR of 10.0x EPRA Net Tangible Assets ( 5 ) per share of €30.60  with a broadly stable portfolio value 2022 net current cash flow guidance raised to at least €2.45 ( 2 ) per share  a 5.4% increase compared to the midpoint of the initial guidanceJean-Marc Jestin  Chairman of the Klépierre Executive Board  commented  “Klépierre delivered a steady performance over the first six months  with a rise in net current cash flow per share  supported by growth in rental income  an increase in retailer sales and dynamic leasing activity. Regarding development  I am particularly proud of the inauguration in early July of our flagship mall Gran Reno in Bologna  with an occupancy rate of 98%. This major achievement is a perfect illustration of Klépierre’s ambitions for retail and its value creation abilities. We have also actively pursued our asset rotation strategy with more than €430 million in disposals closed to date  translating into further improvement of our robust financial metrics with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 8.6x and an ICR of 10.0x. In May  S&P confirmed our BBB+ rating with a stable outlook. Since the outbreak of the pandemic  thanks to the resilience of our business model and our financial discipline  Klépierre has paid €1.4 billion in cash dividends to shareholders and reduced net debt by c.€1 billion(4). On the back of our solid first-half results  we are revising our full-year guidance upwards to at least €2.45 per share  a 5.4% increase compared to the midpoint of our initial guidance.”Story continuesKEY FINANCIALSH1 2022 H1 2021 Reported Change Like-for-like change(a) In millions of euros  total share Total revenues 613.8 475.4 +29.1% Net Rental Income (NRI)  shopping centers 490.3 315.9 +55.2% +66.4% Property portfolio valuation (inc. transfer taxes) 20 577 21 471 -4.2% +0.8% Net debt 7 867 (b) 9 146 -14.0% Loan-to-Value (LTV) 38.8% (b) 42.6% -380 bps Net debt to EBITDA 8.6x (b) 12.6x -4.0x ICR 10.0x 6.5x +3.5x In euros  Group share EPRA Net Tangible Assets (NTA) per share 30.6 29.7 +3.0% Net current cash flow per share 1.30 0.72 +79.3% Net current cash flow per share (excluding IFRS 16) 1.32 0.72 +83.7%(a) Like-for-like data exclude the contribution of new spaces (acquisitions  greenfield projects and extensions)  spaces being restructured  disposals completed since January 2022  and foreign exchange impacts.(b) Taking into account disposals closed after June 30  2022.OPERATING PERFORMANCERetailer sales(3) and footfallRetailer sales in January were negatively impacted by the pandemic (store closures in the Netherlands  the “2G” law in Germany and mandatory face coverings to visit stores in other countries). From February to June  retailer sales continued to improve strongly in line with the second half of 2021 with a sequential monthly acceleration  supported by the end of health restrictions and the economic rebound  reaching 92% of 2019 levels in February and March and up to 101% in the second quarter.Similarly  footfall continued to improve to reach the highest level since 2021 at c.90% of 2019 levels in May and June (10 percentage points better than in second-half 2021). High transformation rates and average basket sizes once again drove the increase in retailer sales.In all geographies  retailer sales and footfall were on a steady upwards trend from February to June.By segment  fashion confirmed its recovery over the first half and posted one of the strongest rebounds in the second quarter. Culture  gifts & leisure together with health & beauty experienced a sustained increase over the second quarter  with performances respectively above and on a par with 2019 levels. Household equipment continued to outperform over the first half. Lastly  food & beverage has posted solid rises since the beginning of the year with also a sharp acceleration between the first and second quarters.Leasing updateKlépierre recorded a dynamic first half in terms of leasing with 699 leases signed  including 516 renewals and re-lettings at an average 2.7% positive rental reversion. Strong retailer demand for Klépierre’s malls contributed to maintaining a high occupancy rate at 94.7%  up 50 basis points over one year with a sustained occupancy cost ratio of 12.4% (down 20 basis points over 6 months).Across its portfolio  Klépierre continued to adapt its mix  prioritizing the expansion of omnichannel retailers that are better suited to evolving consumer expectations. This translated into a sustained deal flow with banners such as Inditex (9 leases)  H&M (6 leases)  Calzedonia (17 leases)  Nike (3 leases)  Mango (1 lease)  Rituals (2 leases) and Pandora (2 leases). Greater emphasis has also been placed on dynamic segments like sports. Sneakers group Deichmann unveiled seven stores in Italy  Sweden and Spain  while JD Sports signed leases for the expansion of two stores in France and Italy. In addition  the Group signed an important deal for the opening of the first Nike stores in its Scandinavian malls at Emporia (Malmö  Sweden) and Bruun’s Galleri (Aarhus  Denmark). Lastly  the sportswear specialist  4F  and the Danish retailer  Hummel  joined malls in Poland and Denmark  respectively  while Adidas is set to unveil a brand-new boutique in Arcades (Paris region  France) in the second half of 2022.Convinced by the quality of the locations offered by the Group  a host of newcomers and on-trend concepts also chose Klépierre as part of their growth strategy. Jimmy Fairly  the hip eyewear specialist  is set to unveil its new flagship in France in the coming months  while the Chinese online retail platform  AliExpress  launched an offline concept in Spain in April. Likewise  household equipment specialist Tefal signed up for its first stores in Klépierre’s portfolio in France and Sweden  while several contracts were signed with Danish brand Flying Tiger Copenhagen  lifestyle brand Miniso and Chinese retailer Xiaomi. Leasing activity was also dense within the popular value retail segment  with the opening of new stores for Normal  Pepco  Xenos or HalfPrice. Lastly  with the normalization of the health situation  the Group also resumed its specialty leasing activities – especially pop-up stores – welcoming brands including Izipizi  Devialet  Jean-Paul Gaultier  Havaianas  Bons Baisers de Paname and Thermomix  all of which contributed to rejuvenating the retail offering and boosting footfall and sales in numerous shopping centers.Rent collectionAs of July 18  2022  Klépierre had collected 95% of invoiced rents and charges (96% collected for the first quarter). The Group is on track to achieve a collection rate of at least 96.7% for first-half 2022  only 1.7 percentage points below the 5-year average pre-pandemic level.Collection rates for 2020 and 2021 continued to improve  leading to additional income (reversal of provisions) in first-half 2022 for €38 million (one-off item).Net rental incomeNet rental income amounted to €501.3 million  up 56.4% on a reported basis  with the increase mainly attributable to lower rent abatements and provisions for credit losses  and higher variable revenue and other income for an aggregate amount of €197 million.On a like-for-like basis  net rental income increased by 66.7%.NET CURRENT CASH FLOWOver the first half of 2022  net current cash flow amounted to €428 million (total share)  or €1.32 per share  of which €0.12 relates to higher than anticipated rents collection for 2020 and 2021.Compared to the same period last year  the €0.60 per share improvement in net current cash flow(6) is mainly attributable to net rental income (€0.64) and a lower cost of debt (€0.02)  partially offset by higher current tax expenses (-€0.05).PORTFOLIO VALUE AND EPRA NET TANGIBLE ASSETS (NTA)Klépierre’s total portfolio value stood at €20 577 million(7) on a total share basis as of June 30  2022  up 0.8% like-for-like over 12 months and up 0.3% over 6 months. Overall  as of June 30  2022  the average EPRA Net Initial Yield for the shopping center portfolio stood at 5.2%  flat compared to December 31  2021.EPRA NTA(5) per share amounted to €30.60 compared to €31.20 as of December 2021. This slight decrease mainly reflected the payment in a single installment of the €1.70 per share distribution  partly offset by the 6-month cash flow (€1.32 per share). The increase in the like-for-like portfolio value had a positive impact of €0.28 per share  while foreign exchange and other items had a negative impact of €0.50 per share.DEBT AND FINANCINGAs of June 30  2022  consolidated net debt amounts to €8 124 million  versus €8 006 million six months ago. Considering the disposals closed early July  notably the €290 million assets in Norway (see the “Disposals” section below)  net debt stood at €7 867 million. The gross debt has an average maturity of 6.5 years.As of June 30  2022  the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio stood at 39.5% (compared to 38.7% as of December 31  2021) and 38.8% factoring in the recent disposals early July. Net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at 8.6x while ICR was at 10.0x. The hedging profile(8) remains solid with 88% of net debt hedged at fixed rates in 2022  breaking down as 69% fixed-rate debt and payer swaps and 19% caps and with a weighted average maturity of 4.8 years.Klépierre’s liquidity position(9) stood at €2.3 billion (including €1.8 billion of committed credit facilities) and covers all the Group’s refinancing needs until the end of 2024.DEVELOPMENTS AND DISPOSALSInvestmentsIn the first half of 2022  the Group focused on its main committed development projects: the extension of Gran Reno in Bologna (Italy)  the refurbishment and extension of Grand Place in Grenoble (France) and the development of five Primark megastores (31 000 sq.m. total) in Italy and France with most set to open by the end of the year.Total capital expenditure in the first half of 2022 amounted to €90.9 million  of which €57.7 million in development projects and €23.7 million in maintenance and refurbishment  mainly.PipelineEarly July  Klépierre successfully inaugurated the extension of Gran Reno (Bologna  Italy)  on budget and with better rents than expected. This operation finalized the full makeover of this flagship shopping center and was 98% let at opening. Perfectly illustrating the Group’s operational strategy  the 16 700 sq.m. extension hosts an outstanding set of retailers such as Sephora  New Balance  JD Sports  the Inditex brands  H&M  Tommy Hilfiger and Primark  together with a new food destination area. The full makeover of Gran Reno delivered a 7.6% yield on cost.The refurbishment of Grand Place  the leading retail destination in Grenoble (France)  was delivered in March 2022 with new store signings including Vans and Lego. In addition  the first stone was laid on the construction of the 16 200 sq.m. extension in May 2022  with completion scheduled for the end of 2023. Pre-leasing is well on track  with 82% of projected net rental income signed (68%) or under advanced negotiations (14%).DisposalsSince January 1  2022  the Group has closed or signed disposals for a total consideration of €470 million(10) at an average yield of 6.0%(11) and prices in line with appraised values (-0.4%). €431 million were closed to date mainly including the disposal  on July 1  2022  of three Norwegian properties (€290 million) as well as a few portfolios of retail properties in France.ACT FOR GOOD ®Since the beginning of the year  Klépierre has pressed ahead with its Act for Good® policy based on three pillars: Act for the Planet  Act for Territories and Act for People. This strategy demonstrates Klépierre’s intention to reconcile the requirements of operational excellence with environmental  societal and social performance and has already been largely recognized by several non-financial rating agencies. Thanks to the outstanding work put in day-in  day-out by Klépierre teams’ in making shopping centers more efficient and ever more environmentally ambitious  GRESB  MSCI  SBTi and CDP  ranked the Group as the leader in its sector. Amid tight energy supply and higher associated costs  Klépierre is also actively engaged in reducing its power consumption while supporting retailers in the same aim.The Group and its employees have also been highly committed to providing support to the people in Ukraine since the outbreak of war on February 24  2022. Klépierre’s teams promptly organized donations for refugees  and in our shopping centers in Europe  we also arranged for the collection of clothes  food and healthcare products from our retailers and visitors as well as from non-profits organizations. These were then shipped to Sadyba Best Mall in Warsaw (Poland) which became a logistics hub for the distribution of the donations to Ukraine.OUTLOOKFor 2022  the Group expects net current cash flow to reach at least €2.45 per share(2)  a 5.4% increase compared to the midpoint of the initial guidance.This updated guidance assumes that business operations are not impacted in H2 2022 by new Covid-related disruptions on our clients’ operations or by any major deterioration in the geopolitical situation. It does include disposals closed to date and a €0.12 profit per share booked in H1 2022 relating to higher rent collection for 2020 and 2021.RETAILER SALES AND FOOTFALL VERSUS 2019(A)Retailer sales Footfall January 2022 83% 78% February 2022 94% 83% March 2022 91% 82% April 2022 101% 85% May 2022 105% 90% June 2022 99% 89%(a) Change on a same store basis  excluding the impact of asset sales and acquisitions.TOTAL REVENUESIn millions of eurosTotal share Group share H1 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 H1 2021 France 226.8 144.1 185.4 117.4 Italy 107.2 76.4 106.0 75.6 Scandinavia 75.9 85.2 42.6 47.8 Iberia 63.0 53.9 63.0 53.9 Netherlands & Germany 53.8 43.6 53.2 42.8 Central Europe 32.2 29.9 32.2 29.9 Other countries 7.5 6.2 6.8 5.7 SHOPPING CENTER GROSS RENTAL INCOME 566.4 439.3 489.2 373.1 Other retail properties 10.9 5.1 10.9 5.1 TOTAL GROSS RENTAL INCOME 577.3 444.3 500.1 378.2 Management and development fees 36.5 31.1 35.1 29.3 TOTAL REVENUES 613.8 475.4 535.2 407.5 Equity-accounted companies* 41.2 30.9 39.7 29.1* Contributions from equity-accounted investees include investments in jointly controlled companies and investments in companies under significant influence.QUARTERLY NET RENTAL INCOME ON A TOTAL SHARE BASISH1 2022 2021 In millions of euros Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 France 119.0 79.2 109.5 100.1 43.6 45.6 Italy 53.1 45.5 70.5 48.2 36.1 22.9 Scandinavia 32.3 32.8 31.6 33.9 50.5 23.4 Iberia 29.8 27.4 29.9 33.5 22.9 19.8 Netherlands & Germany 22.9 14.1 23.8 28.8 23.1 3.8 Central Europe 12.7 17.4 12.5 18.7 10.4 9.6 Other countries 2.9 1.4 3.7 2.9 1.9 2.3 SHOPPING CENTERSNET RENTAL INCOME 272.5 217.8 281.5 266.0 188.5 127.3 Other retail properties 7.2 3.8 5.3 6.1 2.5 2.2 TOTAL NET RENTAL INCOME 279.8 221.5 286.8 272.1 191.0 129.6NET CURRENT CASH FLOWH1 2022 H1 2021 Change (Total share  in millions of euros) Gross rental income 577.3 444.3 +29.9% Rental and building expenses (76.0) (123.8) -38.6% Net rental income 501.3 320.6 +56.4% Management and other income 42.0 35.7 +17.6% General and administrative expenses (76.7) (71.4) +7.5% EBITDA 466.6 284.9 +63.8% Adjustments to calculate operating cash flow: Depreciation charge for right-of use assets(a) (4.0) (4.2) Employee benefits  stock option expense and non-current operating expenses/income (1.9) 0.0 IFRIC 21 impact 7.7 8.2 Operating cash flow 468.4 288.9 +62.1% Cost of net debt (58.1) (58.2) -0.2% Adjustments to calculate net current cash flow before taxes: Amortization of Corio debt mark-to-market (0.4) (1.9) Financial instrument close-out costs 6.8 1.7 Current cash flow before taxes 416.7 230.5 +80.8% Share in earnings of equity-accounted companies 28.5 17.6 +62.6% Current tax expense (17.6) 0.1 n.m.

Aramis Group is adapting its offering to this context  accelerating its inventory rotation and protecting its profitabilityConfirmation of 2022 revenues of over €1.7 billion  with around +40% growth in refurbished vehicle volumes (vs. over +45% expected previously). 2022 adjusted EBITDA revised to between -€10 and-€12 million (vs. positive figure expected previously)Aramis Group [Ticker: ARAMI – ISIN: FR0014003U94]  European leader for B2C online used car sales  operating the Aramisauto  Cardoen  Clicars and CarSupermarket brands in France  Belgium  Spain and the UK respectively  is today reporting its revenues for the third quarter of the fiscal year endingSeptember 30  2022.Story continuesNicolas Chartier and Guillaume Paoli  co-founders1 of Aramis Group:“During the third quarter of 2022  Aramis Group’s teams once again showed their outstanding commitment to customer satisfaction  helping drive sustained growth in its business. This performance is particularly notable as the automotive market continued to deteriorate over the period  becoming more volatile and uncertain. Alongside the pre-registered vehicle segment  which might not have reached its low point yet due to the major sourcing difficulties seen  the refurbished vehicle segment faces an increasingly wait-and-see attitude among consumers. In response to this market environment  Aramis Group is ensuring that its offering is appropriate and is working to protect its balance sheet and profitability. With its 21-year track record  a business model that has proven its resilience during previous crises  and the strategic and financial support of its majority shareholder Stellantis  it is approaching this cycle low with confidence. Aramis Group is moving forward with its strategy  continuing to ramp up its refurbishing capacities and pursue robust external growth  and is effectively positioned to capitalize on all the opportunities that will enable it to further consolidate its leadership in Europe for online refurbished vehicle sales”.2022 THIRD-QUARTER ACTIVITYDuring the third quarter of 2022  ended June 30  the Group recorded revenues of €458.0 million  up +20.1% from the third quarter of 2021.The automotive market became more complex over the period. On the refurbished vehicle segment  the Group’s strategic priority  which represented 89% of its B2C volumes in the third quarter of 2022  a certain wait-and-see approach among consumers has been seen over the past few weeks. On the pre-registered vehicle segment  the negative trend has accelerated  while the sourcing of this type of vehicle has become very complicated due to the continued shortage of new vehicles against a backdrop of persistent supply chain disruption (semiconductors  war in Ukraine  Covid-19).Overview of volumes and revenues2022 third-quarter B2C volumesIn units On a reported basis On a pro forma basis On a reported basis Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % Refurbished 18 357 14 346 +28.0% 51 742 35 763 +44.7% 51 742 29 914 +73.0% Pre-registered 2 232 8 851 -74.8% 10 064 23 055 -56.3% 10 064 23 055 -56.3% Total B2C volumes 20 589 23 197 -11.2% 61 806 58 818 +5.1% 61 806 52 969 +16.7%2022 third-quarter revenuesBy segmentIn million € On a reported basis On a pro forma basis On a reported basis Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % Refurbished 327.7 196.6 +66.7% 902.7 498.0 +81.2% 902.7 418.4 +115.8% Pre-registered 46.1 134.4 -65.7% 197.4 342.4 -42.4% 197.4 342.4 -42.4% Total B2C 373.7 331.0 +12.9% 1 100.1 840.5 +30.9% 1 100.1 760.7 +44.6% Total B2B 61.1 30.9 +97.7% 160.6 81.4 +97.5% 160.6 67.3 +138.7% Total Services 23.1 19.3 +19.5% 69.8 51.2 +36.3% 69.8 44.1 +58.3% Revenues 458.0 381.2 +20.1% 1 330.6 973.0 +36.7% 1 330.6 872.2 +52.6%By countryIn million € On a reported basis On a pro forma basis On a reported basis Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % France 196.6 194.9 +0.9% 555.9 496.9 +11.9% 555.9 496.9 +11.9% Belgium 62.3 53.5 +16.4% 178.7 140.5 +27.3% 178.7 140.4 +27.3% Spain 86.7 57.8 +50.0% 273.7 136.4 +100.7% 273.7 136.4 +100.7% United Kingdom 112.3 75.0 +49.7% 322.3 199.4 +61.6% 322.3 98.6 +227.0% Revenues 458.0 381.2 +20.1% 1 330.6 973.0 +36.7% 1 330.6 872.2 +52.6%Analysis of revenues by segmentB2C – sales of cars to private customers (82% of revenues)Revenues for the B2C segment – corresponding to sales of refurbished and pre-registered cars to private customers – totaled €373.7 million in the third quarter of 2022  up +12.9% from the third quarter of 2021.Revenues for the refurbished cars segment came to €327.7 million  with +66.7% growth versus the third quarter of 2021. 18 357 vehicles were delivered  up +28.0%  a robust level despite the used vehicle market slowdown. To be able to continue guaranteeing a wide selection of vehicles and the best level of customer satisfaction  Aramis Group has continued to ramp up its in-house refurbishing capacities  thanks in particular to the opening of a new center in France in Saint-Pierre-Lès-Nemours  south of the Paris Region. This site  which will complement the longstanding Donzère site located in the south of France  will make it possible to manage the Group’s delivery times  logistics costs and carbon footprint more effectively.Revenues for the pre-registered cars segment came to €46.1 million  down -65.7% from the third quarter of 2021. Sourcing conditions saw a further deterioration during the quarter due to the limited progress recorded on the normalization of new car production. As a result  only 2 232 units were able to be sold during the third quarter of 2022  which is -74.8% lower than the same period in 2021.B2B – sales of cars to professional customers (13% of revenues)Revenues for the B2B segment climbed to €61.1 million  driven by very strong growth of +97.7% compared with the third quarter of 2021. This growth is a result of the increased sourcing of vehicles from private owners  some of which are resold to professionals (mainly vehicles over eight years old or 150 000 km).Services (5% of revenues)Lastly  services generated €23.1 million of revenues  up +19.5% compared with the third quarter of 2021. Financing solutions penetration rate increased in France and fell somewhat in the United Kingdom in a context of rising interest rates. On average across the Group  the penetration rate continued to rise and is now close to 50%.Acquisition of Onlinecars in AustriaLast June  Aramis Group announced the acquisition  subject to minor conditions precedent  particularly concerning antitrust aspects  to acquire all the capital of Onlinecars  the Austrian market leader for refurbished vehicle sales  with more than 10 000 used vehicles sold in 2021  revenues of over €200 million and an EBITDA margin of over 3%.The acquisition of Onlinecars will open up a number of operational synergies with Aramis Group and extensive opportunities for sharing experience  as achieved with the Group’s previous acquisitions. Aramis Group will enable in particular Onlinecars to benefit from its industrial flow management and refurbishing process optimization expertise  as well as its know-how and the tools from its technological and data platform. Alongside this  Onlinecars will help consolidate the major network of suppliers and brands built up by Aramis Group  which represents one of its many competitive advantages.The transaction is fully financed through an increase in Aramis Group’s credit lines with Stellantis  which willcontinue to be a powerful support to Aramis Group's development  accompanying its strategic internationalexpansion.OUTLOOKIn a volatile market  Aramis Group is adopting its product and service offering  accelerating inventory rotation and keeping its cost structure under control  to protect its balance sheet and profitability.Over the coming quarters  the Group expects:Its sales volumes on the pre-registered vehicle segment to remain very low;Its sales volumes on the refurbished vehicle segment to continue growing  driven by the underlying market trends (including the essential positioning of vehicle-based mobility and the digital transformation underway for the distribution of cars)  independently from the potential deferral of certain purchases by households;Sales prices to remain high  although they are stabilizing in the third quarter of 2022;The gross profit per unit (GPU) to contract  decreasing in the second half of 2022 to an average level around -10% below that achieved in the first half of 2022 (€2 311 as a reminder)  before stabilizing at around €2 150 per unit on average  in line with the objectives communicated at the time of its IPO.2022 full-year objectives are adjusted as follows:Revenues of over €1.7 billion (unchanged);Growth of around +40% in refurbished vehicle volumes (vs. over +45% previously);Negative adjusted EBITDA between -€10 and -€12 million (vs. positive figure previously).These objectives are on a like-for-like basis  i.e. they do not include the impact of Onlinecars  which will be consolidated from the start of the Group’s next fiscal year2.***Next financial information:2022 full-year results: December 1  2022 (after market close)About Aramis GroupAramis Group is the leading European B2C platform for online used car sales  operating the Aramisauto  Cardoen  Clicars and CarSupermarket brands  in France  Belgium  Spain and the UK respectively.

Fuel prices surged  in a context of post-COVID economic recovery combined with a decline in supply since the onset of the conflict in Ukraine. Excluding the impact of fuel prices  revenue is stable (+1 %). The half-year was characterised by the good availability of the facilities and the maintenance shutdowns were carried out under very good conditions.Story continuesThe availability rate was 90.1% in the first half of 2022  compared with 87.5% in the first half of 2021; power generation from thermal facilities reached 740 GWh  compared with 952 GWh in the first half of 2021  reflecting the sharp decline in call rates by EDF on Reunion Island in particular  in connection with the high prices of coal and CO 2 .EBITDA for the period came to €81.7 million  slightly up on the €80.3 million of the first half of 2021.Construction and development of projectsWork continues on converting Albioma’s Bois-Rouge power station to 100% biomassThe conversion of the Bois-Rouge power plant to 100% biomass moved ahead smoothly in the half year. Tranche 3 is scheduled to be restarted at the end of the year  operating with 100% biomass.Green light for the conversion of the Albioma Le Gol plant to 100% biomassNew riders were signed with EDF after a favourable opinion from the French energy regulator (Commission de Régulation de l’Énergie) on 24 February 2022  validating the rider to the power purchase agreement and establishing the cost of the complete project to convert Albioma’s Le Gol power plant on Reunion Island to biomass as well as the extension of its operation to 2044. At the same time  additional financing was secured on 18 May 2022  allowing preparatory work to be launched during the first half of the year.The Group continues to develop its projects  focusing particularly give up coal in the overseas territories over the course of the next few years.Solar powerStable production and commissioning of new facilitiesDespite highly adverse sunshine conditions  particularly in French Guiana  performances of the photovoltaic plants were stable in the first half of 2022. Production of photovoltaic electricity in the period reached 60 GWh.EBITDA for the first half of 2022 came to €15.3 million  slightly down on the first half of 2021 (€16.4 million). This performance integrates the downward revision of tariffs for solar power purchase agreements concluded between 2006 and 2010. Discussions are underway with the Energy Regulation Commission (CRE) in the context of the safeguard clause for two plants.New facilities were commissioned  mainly in France and Mayotte.BrazilThermal biomassProduction down in the first half yearProduction was down  at 156 GWh  for the period  compared with 228 GWh in the first half of 2021. This decrease is the result of a technical incident that led to a shutdown of the Esplanada power plant in May and a shortened 2021 inter-campaign for the Vale Do Parana power plant  which operated exceptionally in January and February 2021 in order to use the stock of bagasse accumulated before its commissioning.The macro-economic situation was marked by the appreciation of the real/euro exchange rate during the first half of the year and the increase in financing costs. Electricity prices on the spot market are at a low level due to the high rainfall observed during the half-year.EBITDA totalled €1.2 million for the period  as against €3.3 million in the first half of 2021.TurkeyGeothermal energyImprovement in yields and acquisition of a second unitThe Gümüskoÿ power plant performed well during the half-year. Production reached 25 GWh  up by more than 30% compared with the same period of last year  thanks to the optimisation works carried out in 2021.On 14 February 2022  the Group completed the acquisition of a second geothermal power plant (Kuyucak) in Turkey  becoming its sole shareholder. Commissioned in late 2017  this plant  with a gross installed capacity of 18 MW  operates under a licence valid until 2042  with scope to extend for an additional 10-year period. It produces electricity from five production wells for a net exported production at the end of 2021 of 83 GWh. The plant benefits from a dollarised feed-in tariff of around USD 118/MWh until the end of 2022 and a tariff of USD 105/MWh between 2023 and 2027. Production amounted to 49 GWh in the half-year.EBITDA reached €5.3 million for the period  as against €1.0 million in the first half of 2021.The acquisition of this second plant strengthens Albioma's entry into the geothermal business. The Group will benefit from the synergies between the neighbouring Gümüşköy and Kuyucak plants and will be able to capitalise on the teams’ expertise to roll it out in new regions.Friendly takeover offer initiated by KKRFollowing the receipt of all required regulatory approvals  the takeover offer for Albioma shares and BSAAR warrants initiated by KKR earlier this year opened on 23 June 2022.The Offer was deemed compliant by the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des marchés financiers - AMF) on 21 June 2022 and all the documents relating to the operation have been made available to the public.

Sustained momentum for new contract wins in largely underpenetrated markets   such as the SME markets in France and Germany   propelled by the deployment of carefully tailored sales channels   as notably demonstrated by the success of the online sales platforms now available in 14 countries. An ambitious ESG policy   with non-financial indicators in line with the 2022-2030 targets. Solutions contributing to a better world   as illustrated by the new global Move for Good program designed to accompany fleet and mobility clients on their green transition.Edenred is better poised than ever to generate sustainable and profitable growth in a new macro-economic contextDrawing on its strong sales momentum and a platform that is ever-more attractive thanks to technology investments  Edenred is ready to capture opportunities from structural trends  such as more widespread digitalization and radical changes in the working world.Edenred should also benefit from a favorable macro-economic context  with rising inflation making its solutions even more attractive and driving additional revenue for the Group  notably due to higher interest rates.In view of these factors  the Group is targeting record-high EBITDA of between €770 million and €820 million for full-year 20221  versus €670 million in 2021.***Bertrand Dumazy  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Edenred  said: “Thanks to very tangible growth momentum in the second quarter  Edenred delivered a record performance in the first half of 2022  with a strong increase in earnings. Operating revenue grew by double digits across all of the Group’s business lines and regions  and EBITDA came in at an all-time high for a first half. These results show how Edenred is leveraging the unique benefits of its digital platform to continue its market penetration in a new macro-economic environment. The solutions the Group offers are attracting more and more clients who view them as an opportunity to increase their employees’ purchasing power  encourage more responsible behaviors or tighten their cost control. Edenred is now better poised than ever to pursue its sustainable and profitable growth trajectory in the second half of the year and beyond. The Group is continuing to step up its technology investments  which have made it the leading innovator in its markets. In light of these achievements  we are confident in our prospects for the second half of 2022 and are targeting record-high EBITDA of between €770 million and €820 million for the full year.”Turkey is now qualified as a hyperinflationary economy. The Group has therefore applied IAS 29 – Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies to its operations in this country since January 1  2022.FIRST-HALF 2022 RESULTSAt its meeting on July 25  2022  the Board of Directors reviewed the Group’s interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30  2022.First-half 2022 key financial metrics:(in € millions) First-half 2022 First-half 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Operating revenue 891 736 +20.9% +17.3% Other revenue (A) 31 21 +49.1% +46.5% Total revenue 922 757 +21.7% +18.1% EBITDA 365 295 +23.6% +22.0% Operating EBIT (B) 264 211 +25.2% +24.3% EBIT (A + B) 295 232 +27.3% +26.3% Net profit  Group share 170 133 +27.5%Total revenue of €922 millionTotal revenue for first-half 2022 amounted to €922 million  up 21.7% as reported compared with first-half 2021. This year-on-year increase includes a favorable 4.0% currency effect and a slightly negative 0.4% scope effect. On a like-for-like basis  total revenue was up 18.1%.In the second quarter  total revenue rose by 25.7% as reported and by 20.4% like-for-like  with growth accelerating versus the first quarter of the year  when total revenue increased by 17.6% as reported and by 15.7% like-for-like.Operating revenue: €891 millionOperating revenue for the first six months of 2022 came to €891 million  up 20.9% as reported. The currency effect was a favorable 4.1% and the scope effect was a slightly negative 0.5%. On a like-for-like basis  the increase in operating revenue was 17.3% year on year.Second-quarter operating revenue totaled €465 million  up 24.5% as reported and 19.2% like-for-like.This solid performance came on the back of an excellent start to the year and strong growth in operating revenue during the first quarter. It clearly shows the Group’s ability to keep up a sustained pace of growth  with double-digit growth figures recorded across all of its business lines and regions. By fully leveraging its digital platform  the Group has continued to penetrate its markets by capitalizing on its stand-out technology assets and sales expertise. For example  thanks to the online sales platforms it has developed in 14 countries  the Group saw a more-than 50% increase in the number of new contracts it won with SMEs in the first half of 2022 versus the first six months of 2021.Edenred’s first-half 2022 performance was also boosted by a favorable macro-economic environment  notably the current high rates of inflation. This has made the Group’s solutions even more attractive  as clients see them as a way of increasing their employees’ purchasing power  through the Employee Benefits offering  and tightening control of their fleet management costs  through Fleet & Mobility Solutions.Operating revenue by business line(in € millions) First-half 2022 First-half 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 528 448 +17.7% +15.7% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 252 190 +32.3% +24.0% Complementary Solutions 111 98 +13.6% +11.4% Total 891 736 +20.9% +17.3%The Employee Benefits business line generated €528 million in operating revenue in first-half 2022  representing an increase of 17.7% as reported (+15.7% like-for-like) and accounting for 59% of the consolidated total.The Group continued to penetrate its markets during the period  fueled by strong sales activity  both with key accounts and in the particularly fast-growing SME segment. Drawing on a broader portfolio of solutions resulting from its Beyond Food strategy  and amid radical changes in the working world  Edenred is fully meeting the needs of its clients  who are seeking to strengthen their employer brand and employee engagement. In France  for example  the Group has a comprehensive range of digital solutions for food  incentives and mobility  with 7 million employees benefiting from them. These solutions provide employers with an effective means to boost each employee’s purchasing power by up to €5 000 per year  while adapting to new consumption patterns  which have become more digital and more responsible.This momentum has led to an increase in the benefits granted to employees  particularly in countries where the public authorities have raised the statutory maximum face value of benefits  such as in Romania and Turkey for meal benefits.In the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business line  which accounted for 28% of the Group’s business  operating revenue came to €252 million in the first half of the year  up 32.3% as reported over the period (+24.0% like-for-like).This strong year-on-year growth reflects brisk sales momentum  especially in the vastly underpenetrated SME segment. It also reflects the successful deployment of the Beyond Fuel strategy  notably through the maintenance management solution in Latin America. Thanks to this fully digital offering  with a broad portfolio of services such as dashboards  customized maintenance plans and dedicated mobile apps  Edenred provides a first-class user experience for fleet managers  drivers and repair shops in the network. In light of the success of this offering in Brazil (more than 400 000 vehicles managed and orders up by over 20% in the first half of 2022)  Edenred has begun to roll it out to Mexico and Argentina as well.The Complementary Solutions business line  which includes Corporate Payment Services  Incentive & Rewards and Public Social Programs  generated operating revenue of €111 million in first-half 2022  representing 13% of the Group total. This figure was up 13.6% year on year as reported (+11.4% like-for-like)  despite a high basis of comparison for the first quarter due to the specific earmarked funds programs set up during the first quarter of 2021 amid the health crisis.Growth for this business line reflects the good performance of Corporate Payment Services in North America  operated through CSI  driven by new contracts won through its direct and indirect sales channels  and the continued recovery in sales volumes generated by clients in the media and hospitality segments.The sharp rise in Complementary Services operating revenue is also the result of Edenred’s ability to develop new value-added services for its stakeholders  such as in the United Arab Emirates  where the salary advance offering is meeting the growing needs of the 500 000 users of the C3Pay mobile app.Operating revenue by region(in € millions) First-half 2022 First-half 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 551 475 +16.0% +15.7% Latin America 270 204 +32.5% +16.9% Rest of the World 70 58 +20.5% +31.3% Total 891 736 +20.9% +17.3%In Europe   operating revenue amounted to €551 million in first-half 2022  an increase of 16.0% as reported and of 15.7% like-for-like. In the second quarter  operating revenue was up 18.1% as reported and 18.0% like-for-like. Europe represented 62% of Group operating revenue.In France  operating revenue amounted to €150 million  representing an increase of 11.2% both as reported and like-for-like. In the second quarter  operating revenue growth was 12.2% as reported and like-for-like. This performance was notably led by robust growth for Employee Benefits solutions  fueled by contract wins for the Ticket Restaurant® offering – the market’s digital leader with a market share of over 40% – as well as the broader range of solutions integrated into the MyEdenred mobile app. Fleet & Mobility Solutions also drove up operating revenue  propelled by ongoing high demand  notably in the SME segment.Operating revenue in Europe excluding France totaled €401 million in first-half 2022  up 17.8% as reported (+17.5% like-for-like). Second-quarter operating revenue rose by 20.3% as reported (+20.2% like-for-like). This sustained growth is the result of the growing attractiveness of the solutions offered by the Group in its various business lines. In Employee Benefits  Ticket Restaurant® meal benefits once again delivered robust growth  boosted by an increase in face values introduced by clients in the current inflationary context  and the Beyond Food strategy continued to be a success. Performance for the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business line was driven by strong sales momentum in the SME segment.Operating revenue in Latin America amounted to €270 million  up 32.5% as reported in the first half (+16.9% like-for-like)  with a 38.0% reported increase in the second quarter (+17.2% like-for-like). The region represented 30% of total consolidated operating revenue in first-half 2022.In Brazil  operating revenue growth came to 17.1% like-for-like in the first six months of the year  including a 17.7% increase in the second quarter. This robust year-on-year growth reflects the strong momentum of the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business  led notably by the success of the Beyond Fuel offering  which was underpinned by a sharp increase in demand for maintenance and toll management solutions. Employee Benefits also contributed to growth in Brazil  spurred by the ongoing success of the partnership with Itaú Unibanco and the rollout of the multi-benefit offering.In Hispanic Latin America  operating revenue rose by 16.4% like-for-like  with a 16.3% increase in the second quarter. The recovery in the Employee Benefits business continued in the region in the second quarter  while in Fleet & Mobility Solutions growth was driven by the gradual rollout of the Beyond Fuel offering with its toll solutions.In the Rest of the World   operating revenue amounted to €70 million  up 20.5% as reported and 31.3% like-for-like over the period. Second-quarter operating revenue rose by 26.9% as reported (+36.7% like-for-like).This performance was notably driven by the success of digital solutions proposed in countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. In North America  CSI’s Corporate Payment Services business saw strong sales momentum  notably buoyed by a recovery in volumes for its historical portfolio  as well as the ramp-up of distribution partnerships entered into with several banks.Other revenue: €31 millionFor the six months ended June 30  2022  other revenue came to €31 million  representing an increase of 49.1% as reported and of 46.5% like-for-like. This solid growth notably reflects the continued increase in float  resulting from the high level of business during the first half of the year. Other revenue also benefited from the rise in interest rates compared with first-half 2021  notably in Latin America and in European countries outside the euro zone.EBITDA: €365 millionIn first-half 2022  EBITDA amounted to €365 million  up 23.6% as reported and 22.0% like-for-like.The EBITDA margin came in at 39.6%  up 0.6 of a percentage point compared with first-half 2021. On a like-for-like basis  the EBITDA margin was 1.3 percentage points higher year on year  demonstrating Edenred’s ability to capitalize on its operating leverage while continuing to invest in technology and innovation to help drive the Group’s growth.Net profit: €170 millionNet profit  Group share amounted to €170 million versus €133 million in first-half 2021  a 27.5% increase primarily driven by growth in EBITDA.Net profit takes into account other income and expenses for a net expense of €9 million (versus a net expense of €7 million in first-half 2021)  a net financial expense of €17 million (versus €9 million in 2021)2  a net income tax expense of €84 million (versus €73 million in 2021)  and €(16) million attributable to non-controlling interests (versus €(14) million in 2021).Strong cash flow generationEdenred’s business model generates significant cash flows  delivering funds from operations before other income and expenses (FFO) of €299 million in first-half 2022  up 17.5% as reported.At June 30  2022  Edenred had net debt of €1.06 billion  versus €1.45 billion at end-June 2021. This sharp year-on-year decrease in net debt notably reflects free cash flow generation of €767 million over the twelve months ended June 30  2022  €269 million returned to shareholders  and a negative €45 million impact of currency effects and non-recurring items.Robust financial positionEdenred therefore enjoys a robust financial position with a high level of liquidity and a solid balance sheet. In April 2022  Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed the Group’s BBB+ Strong Investment Grade rating and upgraded its outlook from stable to positive.Ongoing commitment to ESG and non-financial performanceIn the first half of 2022  Edenred continued to put its commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) into practice.One of the ways it does this is by deploying solutions that encourage more responsible behaviors. For example  in June  the Group launched “Move for Good”  a global green and sustainable mobility program for its clients in the transportation and mobility sector  which is based on four pillars: awareness  reduction and avoidance  offsetting  and preservation. Also  in the first half of the year  the Group rolled out its Agri digital solution in Cameroon to support local agriculture – serving 600 000 farmers – and broadened its range of value-added services that support financial inclusion in the United Arab Emirates  including a salary advance system.At the same time  the Group continued to implement its “Ideal” CSR policy through the policy’s three main components  “People  Planet and Progress”  and is well on the way to achieving its targets for 2030. In April  Edenred’s commitment to CSR was recognized once again  when it was assigned a rating of 79 out of 100 by S&P Global Ratings  well above the global average for the other companies assessed. This rating notably highlights how the Group’s ESG goals are underpinned by a strong corporate culture and effective strategic planning and decision-making processes.Edenred will further strengthen its CSR commitments  notably those related to the climate  at the Capital Markets Day to be held in October 2022.OUTLOOKIn the first half of 2022  Edenred once again proved its capacity to leverage the benefits of its digital platform  thanks to its ongoing strong sales and innovation momentum.In an environment accelerating new structural trends  such as increased digitalization among stakeholders (clients  partner merchants and users)  radical transformations in the working world and the beginning of a new era of greener mobility  Edenred is ideally positioned to seize the opportunities arising from these changes.At the same time  the Group expects to continue benefiting from a favorable macro-economic context that is further enhancing the attractiveness of its offerings. This can be seen both in Employee Benefits  against a backdrop of “talent wars” for employers and a desire by both governments and companies to protect workers’ purchasing power  and in Fleet & Mobility Solutions  where fleet managers are looking to tighten control over their expenses.Edenred is therefore better poised than ever to generate sustainable and profitable growth. The Group is targeting full-year EBITDA of between €770 million and €820 million3 for 2022  versus €670 million in 2021.In addition  Edenred has an investment capacity of between €1.5 billion and €2.0 billion to be able to carry out any external growth transactions.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAREdenred strengthens its toll offering in Brazil with the acquisition of GreenpassOn February 22  Edenred announced that it had acquired a 51% controlling interest in Greenpass  an issuer of electronic toll solutions in Brazil. The deal strengthens Edenred’s position in this business as well as its technology and sales capabilities in an attractive market offering significant cross-selling potential with its client base. It is fully in line with the Group’s Beyond Fuel strategy to develop new non-fuel fleet and mobility services  enhancing its value proposition for fleet managers and expanding its addressable market.UTA Edenred partners with ChargePointOn April 5  Edenred announced a partnership with ChargePoint  a leading electric vehicle charging network provider in Europe and in the USA. This partnership enables customers of UTA Edenred  a leading mobility service provider in Europe  to access over 240 000 public electric charge points across 32 European countries. Edenred supports fleet managers in the transition towards electric vehicle usage  notably through the introduction of an all-in-one  fully integrated solution that combines an electric vehicle charging solution with UTA Edenred’s proven energy  toll and maintenance services.Edenred launches “Move for Good”  a global program that accompanies its clients on their green transitionOn June 15  Edenred launched “Move for Good”  a global sustainability program enabling its transportation and mobility clients to mitigate their environmental impact  while promoting biodiversity preservation.

This indicator reflects the Group’s business performance.Changes in activity (like-for-like or organic growth) represent changes in amounts between the current period and the comparative period  adjusted for currency effects and for the impact of acquisitions and/or disposals.The impact of acquisitions is eliminated from the amount reported for the current period. The impact of disposals is eliminated from the amount reported for the comparative period. The sum of these two amounts is known as the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation or the scope effect.The calculation of changes in activity is translated at the exchange rate applicable in the comparative period and divided by the adjusted amount for the comparative period.The currency effect is the difference between the amount for the reported period translated at the exchange rate for the reported period and the amount for the reported period translated at the exchange rate applicable in the comparative period.Business volume:Business volume comprises total issue volume of Employee Benefits  Incentive and Rewards  Public Social Program solutions and Corporate Payment Services  plus the transaction volume of Fleet & Mobility Solutions and other solutions.Issue volume:Issue volume is the total face value of the funds preloaded on all of the payment solutions issued by Edenred to its corporate and public sector clients.Transaction volume:Transaction volume represents the total value of the transactions paid for with payment instruments  at the time of the transaction.b) Alternative performance measurement indicators included in the June 30  2022 Interim Financial ReportThe alternative performance measurement indicators outlined below are presented and reconciled with accounting data in the Annual Financial Report.Indicator Reference note in Edenred’s 2022 condensed interim consolidated financial statements Operating revenueOperating revenue corresponds to: operating revenue generated by prepaid vouchers managed by Edenred and operating revenue from value-added services such as incentive programs  human services and event-related services.It corresponds to the amount billed to the client company and is recognized on delivery of the solutions.

8190,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4525475-publicis-trading-fcf-yield-dividend-yield,Publicis Stock Is Now Trading At A 12% FCF Yield And A 5% Dividend Yield (OTCMKTS:PUBGY),Publicis  listed in Paris  is one of the largest communications and PR firms in the world. Click here for a full investment analysis of PUBGY stock.,Mystockimages/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionPublicis (OTCQX:PUBGY) (OTCQX:PGPEF) has surprised me in 2021 with a free cash flow result of in excess of 1.2B EUR in its first post-COVID year. Unfortunately the COVID crisis wasn't fully digested before a new crisis erupted and as an European communications and advertising firm  Publicis is bound to feel an impact from the war in Ukraine. Since my previous article I wrote some put options on Publicis  but they either all expired or will expire out of the money so the fresh set of half-year results is a good moment to have another look at the company from an investment perspectiveYahoo FinanceAs a reminder  one share of PUBGY represents 0.25 shares of Publicis. I will discuss the results of Publicis in EUR as the main listing of the company is on Euronext Paris where it's trading with PUB as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Paris exceeds 700 000 shares per day so it makes sense to refer to the primary listing. Investors interested in trading PUBGY should divide the per-share results by four to end up with the results per PUBGY share.The results are in  and the result in the first semester remained very strongPublicis performed very well in the first half of the year. Its revenue increased by almost 20% to 6.55B EUR while the operating income increased by a similar percentage  up 22% to 1.29B EUR.Publicis Investor RelationsThat's important because most of the other expenses are relatively fixed in nature. The depreciation and amortization expenses increased but the net cost of the financial debt decreased and as you can see above  the pre-tax income increased from 543M EUR to 717M EUR  an increase of approximately 32%.After deducting the income taxes and adding back the income from associates and the loss attributable to non-controlling interests  the net income attributable to the shareholders of Publicis was 537M EUR and based on the average share count of 250M shares  the EPS was 2.15 EUR per share.Publicis also released the 'headline diluted EPS'. That's the EPS on a diluted basis but excluding the impairment charges and the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Adjusting the result for these elements  the EPS was actually 2.88 EUR per share which is excellent.Another way to look through these impairment charges and non-cash amortization expenses is by studying the cash flow statement. The reported operating cash flow was quite disappointing at 210M EUR but as you can see below  this clearly is related to the 858M EUR investment in the working capital position while the company also paid about 62M EUR in taxes that weren't owed based on the H1 results (251M EUR paid while only 189M EUR was due).Publicis Investor RelationsWe should also deduct the 63M EUR in net interest payments as well as the 215M EUR in lease related payments (170M EUR in lease liability payments and 45M EUR in interest paid on lease liabilities). The adjusted operating cash flow was 852M EUR.With a total capex of just 84M EUR  the half-year free cash flow result was 768M EUR for an FCFPS of 3.07 EUR per share. An excellent result and although the net debt didn't decrease (239M EUR in net financial debt excluding lease liabilities as of the end of June versus a net cash position of 29M EUR as of the end of last year) that's not a reason to be worried due to the working capital build-up. The company uses a net financial debt level of 464M EUR as it includes the future cash payments related to previously agreed-upon acquisitions with final buyout payments.Publicis Investor RelationsA guidance increase was the logical resultA very strong set of results in the first half of the year  and this allowed Publicis to hike its full-year outlook on all accounts. The company has now hiked its organic revenue growth rate from 4-5% to 6-7%. Additionally  it has also increased the metric that's the most important for my investment decisions: the free cash flow result.Publicis is now aiming to generate a free cash flow result of at least 1.5B EUR (compared to the previous guidance of 1.4B EUR) which would work out to be 6 EUR per share. Also keep in mind Publicis includes the tax payments on an as-is basis (which explains why its H1 FCF came in at 708M EUR which is lower than my number  mainly due to the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid).Publicis Investor RelationsThe full-year free cash flow upgrade doesn't really come as a surprise. This is what I wrote in my April article on Publicis:Publicis is now guiding for a full-year free cash flow result of 1.4B EUR. I think it may actually be able to do better than thatIt's still too early to discuss 2023 and the visibility for next year just isn't there so it will be interesting to see if we can get some more color on the 2023 expectations later this year.Investment thesisDespite the recent ex-dividend date which saw a 2.40 EUR dividend being detached from the shares  Publicis' share price is already trading above 50 EUR again. Not entirely unreasonable given the strong performance in the first half of the year and the recent guidance increase. I was a bit scared for the fallout from the Ukrainian war but Publicis' guidance seems to indicate I was too worried about this risk. Although this doesn't mean much when it comes to the visibility for 2023 and beyond  it does mean Publicis will end this year with a very strong balance sheet which will compensate for any potential visibility issues.I still have one put option I wrote a while ago and will now likely expire out of the money. I will very likely continue to write put options as long as the increased volatility levels keep the option premiums high. I am impressed with Publicis' H1 EPS and adjusted EPS and perhaps even more so with the free cash flow result.

As we look to our next horizon  2040  industries will no longer develop products but sustainable and personalized experiences centered around the consumer  patient and citizen.The experience economy goes hand in hand with circularity as it requires designing the entire experience life cycle upstream  integrating use with end of life. Circularity is about frugality – using only what’s necessary – and appreciating all things created by humankind will have an end: the raw materials that compose them can be repurposed  reused and recycled. This will revolutionize design and open up significant new possibilities we can’t yet imagine.Story continuesScience-based virtual twin experiences  powered by 3DEXPERIENCE  are unparalleled catalysts and enablers of this global transformation. Based on a multi-scale  multi-physics approach and incorporating real world evidence  our virtual twin experiences empower clients to imagine new methods  new materials and test new solutions. By providing continuity across the WHAT  the HOW and the USE  innovators can anticipate the recycling of products from their design and manufacturing to quantify the environmental impacts and optimize circularity.IFWE utilize the power of the virtual world to improve the real world  we can advance our purpose – to harmonize product  nature and life.”Financial SummaryIn millions of Euros except per share data and percentagesIFRS IFRS Q2 2022 Q2 2021 Change Change in constant currencies YTD 2022 YTD 2021 Change Change in constant currencies Total Revenue 1 383.9 1 160.8 19% 11% 2 708.5 2 333.7 16% 10% Software Revenue 1 250.1 1 050.7 19% 11% 2 455.6 2 118.5 16% 10% Operating Margin 22.5% 20.1% +2.4pts 23.9% 19.9% +4.0pts Diluted EPS * 0.09 0.14 (32)% 0.29 0.27 9%In millions of Euros except per share data and percentagesNon-IFRS Non-IFRS Q2 2022 Q2 2021 Change Change in constant currencies YTD 2022 YTD 2021 Change Change in constant currencies Total Revenue 1 384.0 1 161.5 19% 11% 2 708.6 2 335.1 16% 10% Software Revenue 1 250.2 1 051.3 19% 11% 2 455.8 2 119.7 16% 9% Operating Margin 32.0% 32.2% (0.2)pt 33.5% 33.0% +0.4pt Diluted EPS * 0.26 0.22 21% 11% 0.54 0.44 20% 13%* 2021 and 2022 figures have been presented in order to reflect the five-for-one share split on Dassault Systèmes’ share effected on July 7  2021Second Quarter 2022 Versus 2021 Financial Comparisons(unaudited  all revenue growth rates in constant currencies)Total Revenue: Total revenue grew 11%  IFRS and non-IFRS  to €1.38 billion.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2022  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within automotive  aerospace or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;current inflation forecasts  as well as uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of this trend  could adversely affect the financial condition of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and geopolitical crises in particular – could have consequences for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY130.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the third and fourth quarters 2022. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY132.2 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2022. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations. It is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for IFRS measurements.

We believe it is helpful to evaluate our growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in our business. Therefore  we provide percentage increases or decreases in our revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed by us “in constant currencies”  the results of the “prior” period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  we do believe these measures are critical to understanding our global revenue results and to compare with many of our competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  we are including this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods as well as for comparing non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates are expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group’s scope  Dassault Systèmes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth. In order to do so  the data relating to the scope is restated excluding acquisitions  from the date of the transaction  over a period of 12 months.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Systèmes’ Industries develop Solution Experiences  industry-focused offerings that deliver specific value to companies and users in a particular industry. We serve eleven industries structured into three sectors:Manufacturing industries Sector : Transportation & Mobility; Aerospace & Defense; Marine & Offshore; Industrial Equipment; High-Tech; Home & Lifestyle; Consumer Packaged Goods & Retail;Life Sciences & Healthcare Sector : Life Sciences & Healthcare;Infrastructure & Cities Sector : Infrastructure  Energy & Materials; Architecture  Engineering & Construction; Cities  Public & Business Services.Information on Product LinesOur product lines financial reporting include the following financial information:Industrial Innovation software revenue  comprised of our CATIA  ENOVIA  SIMULIA  DELMIA  GEOVIA  NETVIBES  and 3DEXCITE brands;Life Sciences software revenue  comprised of our MEDIDATA and BIOVIA brands;Mainstream Innovation software revenue  comprised of our CENTRIC PLM and 3DVIA brands  as well as our 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family which includes the SOLIDWORKS brand.3DEXPERIENCE Licenses and Software ContributionTo measure the progressive penetration of 3DEXPERIENCE software  we utilize the following ratios:for Licenses revenue  we calculate the percentage contribution by comparing total 3D EXPERIENCE Licenses revenue to Licenses revenue for all product lines except SOLIDWORKS and acquisitions (“related Licenses revenue”);for software revenue  the Group calculates the percentage contribution by comparing total 3DEXPERIENCE software revenue to software revenue for all product lines except SOLIDWORKS and acquisitions (“related software revenue”).Cloud RevenueCloud revenues correspond to revenue generated through a catalog of online services delivered by Dassault Systèmes via a cloud infrastructure hosted by Dassault Systèmes  or by third party providers of cloud computing infrastructure services.

8196,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/26/eutelsat_oneweb/,Eutelsat and OneWeb in multi-orbit merger,LEO and GEO orbit covered in satellite broadband handshake,"OneWeb and Eutelsat have signed a memorandum of understanding intended to create a mega multi-orbit satellite broadband provider.Unlike rival Starlink  which has thousands of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)  the combined company would operate satellites both in Geostationary Orbit (GEO) via the Eutelsat's 36-strong fleet and LEO – via OneWeb's constellation  which currently stands at 428 satellites.There are pros and cons to satellite locations: a GEO satellite has better coverage over a specific region while LEO satellites carry the promise of lower latency and are generally cheaper to build and launch  although more are needed. Combining the two should  in theory  deliver a best-of-both-worlds system depending on the challenges of integration and customer requirements.As for how the deal will work  the transaction values OneWeb at $3.4 billion (implying a value of €12 per Eutelsat share) and Eutelsat shareholders and OneWeb shareholders would each hold 50 percent of Eutelsat shares. Effectively  Eutelsat ends up owning 100 percent of OneWeb (excluding the UK government's share.)The UK government's stake is significant  since £500 million (c $600 million) of UK taxpayer cash was spent on OneWeb two years ago.Eutelsat itself has also invested heavily in OneWeb  and made an initial investment of $550 million in April 2021  and then spent another $165 million in October last year  taking its shareholding from 17.6 percent to 22.9 percent [PDF].The UK's Department for Business  Energy & Industrial Strategy said: ""The UK government will retain the special share and its exclusive rights over OneWeb – securing the company's future at the centre of the combined group's global LEO business  national security controls over the network  and first-preference rights over domestic industrial opportunities.""The latter point is significant. As well as national security needs  the UK is to be the ""preferred"" location for launches as well as procurement for commercial manufacturing. Unfortunately for UK businesses  this also means that the country will be competing against other states for OneWeb work  ""as usual for major European space projects "" observed Dr Bleddyn Bowen  Associate Professor in International Relations at the University of Leicester.The merger  which is expected to be complete by the first half of 2023 (subject to regulatory approvals and a nod from Eutelsat's shareholders)  is expected to generate combined revenues of €1.2 billion (c $1.22 billion). While OneWeb will continue to operate the LEO business and remain headquartered in the UK  France-based Eutelsat will continue to be listed on Euronext Paris and apply for admission to London Stock Exchange.And who knows  by the time that 2023 completion rolls around  OneWeb might finally have got some more of its proposed constellation off the ground. The last batch of satellites never left Baikonur after Russia's invasion of Ukraine  and OneWeb has since signed up several alternative launch operators  including SpaceX  to launch the remainder of its satellites.That's assuming SpaceX can find time in between launches to build the Starlink satellite constellation. The company launched another 53 of the satellites into orbit on July 24  SpaceX's sixth mission of the month. ®",neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,negative,0.01,0.08,0.91,True,English,"['multi-orbit merger', 'Eutelsat', 'OneWeb', 'mega multi-orbit satellite broadband provider', 'major European space projects', 'several alternative launch operators', 'national security controls', 'national security needs', 'Dr Bleddyn Bowen', 'London Stock Exchange', 'domestic industrial opportunities', 'Low Earth Orbit', 'UK taxpayer cash', 'global LEO business', 'Starlink satellite constellation', 'satellite locations', 'rival Starlink', 'GEO satellite', 'Industrial Strategy', 'Geostationary Orbit', '36-strong fleet', 'specific region', 'lower latency', 'worlds system', 'customer requirements', 'initial investment', 'exclusive rights', 'first-preference rights', 'latter point', 'preferred"" location', 'commercial manufacturing', 'other states', 'Associate Professor', 'International Relations', 'first half', 'regulatory approvals', 'combined revenues', 'Euronext Paris', 'last batch', 'sixth mission', 'UK government', 'The UK', 'UK businesses', 'special share', 'Eutelsat shares', 'France-based Eutelsat', 'OneWeb work', 'Eutelsat shareholders', 'LEO satellites', 'OneWeb shareholders', '428 satellites', 'memorandum', 'understanding', 'thousands', 'company', 'pros', 'coverage', 'promise', 'theory', 'challenges', 'integration', 'deal', 'transaction', 'value', '50 percent', '100 percent', 'stake', 'April', 'October', 'shareholding', '17.6 percent', '22.9 percent', 'Department', 'Energy', 'future', 'centre', 'group', 'network', 'launches', 'procurement', 'country', 'University', 'Leicester', 'merger', 'nod', 'admission', 'time', '2023 completion', 'ground', 'Baikonur', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'SpaceX', 'remainder', 'July', 'month']",2022-07-26,2022-07-26,theregister.com

So this continent has huge strengths ” he said.Some of its “structural weaknesses” he said are that European markets are more fragmented than the US. While he is not quite so sure that Europe could create its own Godzilla companies there are “many very material niche markets that are very big that allow European companies to be global peers ” he said.One of those niche markets is fintech  especially payment systems  which Europe has raised several big names including Klarna and Revolut. But the other big player will be deep tech  predicts Boujnah.“I do believe that in the semiconductors  in the telecom equipment  in the software side of the universe  above and beyond the usual buzzwords like that.“And the European deep tech technology skills and assets are going to make the difference in the years to come”.,negative,0.07,0.22,0.71,mixed,0.18,0.25,0.57,True,English,"['tech companies', 'stagnation fears', 'Euronext', 'Europe', 'European deep tech technology skills', 'high-quality technology projects', 'new technology initiative', 'homogeneous technology players', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'current economic climate', 'International Financial Forum', 'European member countries', 'several big names', 'strongest tech scene', 'other big player', 'specialised asset managers', 'European technology companies', 'European tech leaders', 'material niche markets', 'private equity funds', 'European tech companies', 'European markets', 'tech funds', 'European companies', 'other investors', 'big difference', 'rising prices', 'interest rates', 'Managing Board', 'smaller valuation', 'consistent progress', 'venture capitalists', 'United States', 'strong research', 'blue chip', 'huge strengths', 'structural weaknesses', 'global peers', 'payment systems', 'telecom equipment', 'software side', 'usual buzzwords', 'Godzilla companies', 'past 15 years', 'collective group', 'Stephane Boujnah', 'Creating Europe', 'start-ups', 'stagflation', 'Euronext', 'situation', 'CEO', 'Chairman', 'Euronews', 'Paris', 'outlook', 'bloc', 'June', 'bid', 'Nasdaq', 'sector', 'visibility', 'continent', 'reasons', 'creation', 'part', 'location', 'giants', 'Amazon', 'Google', 'academia', 'People', 'pipe', 'debt', 'sake', 'pensions', 'fintech', 'Klarna', 'Revolut', 'semiconductors', 'universe', 'assets']",2022-07-26,2022-07-26,euronews.com
