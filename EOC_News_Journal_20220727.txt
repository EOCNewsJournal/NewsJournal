Euroclear also serves as a central securities depository for major financial institutions involved in European markets.

European shares fell sharply on Thursday after China accelerated the depreciation of the yuan  sending currencies across the region reeling and domestic stock markets tumbling. Germany's DAX dropped 3.6 percent  while Britain's FTSE 100 weakened by 2.7 percent. REUTERS/Kai PfaffenbachA look at the day ahead in markets from Tommy Wilkes.The European corporate earnings season picks up pace on Tuesday and the evidence so far is that rising costs and slowing demand are beginning to bite.A few weeks back the big concern for traders was that the next leg lower for stock markets would be triggered by the rewriting of lofty earnings expectations.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterWhile this hasn't come to pass thanks to some businesses doing better than expected  the evidence on Tuesday suggests caution.Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.S) flagged a smaller-than-expected rise in second-quarter net profit and Logitech International (LOGN.S) reported a 38% fall in first-quarter adjusted profit and cut its full-year 2023 outlook.According to Goldman Sachs  around 34% of the European companies reporting results for the second quarter have missed consensus by at least 5%  the highest fraction of misses since the sovereign debt crisis in 2010.Trading was quiet across markets as investors brace for a slew of European companies to update this week as well as some of the big tech firms in the United States  including Microsoft on Tuesday.Stocks looked set for modest declines in both Europe and the United States  while the dollar steadied not far from two-decade highs.The start of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting  which concludes Wednesday  is also keeping traders on the sidelines with policymakers expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points. Market attention will be squarely focused on the future path of interest rates.Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:U.S. Federal Reserve starts two-day meetingU.S. May home price indexU.S. June new home sales dataU.S. 5-year Treasury auctionFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia issues July Non-manufacturing Business Outlook Survey for JulyNigeria  Hungarian central bank meetingsEurope earnings: UBS  Lindt  ITV  Unilever  Michelin  Deutsche Boerse  Vivendi  LVMH  Easyjet  UnicreditU.S. earnings: United Parcel Service Inc  General Electric  3M Company  Xerox Corp  Coca-Cola  McDonald’s  GM  Microsoft  Google  Boston PropertiesRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterEditing by Saikat Chatterjee;Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.,positive,0.5,0.35,0.15,negative,0.02,0.16,0.82,True,English,"['Earnings', 'rescue', 'Reuters', 'U.S. May home price index U.S. June new home sales data', 'U.S. 5-year Treasury auction Federal Reserve Bank', 'U.S. Federal Reserve', 'The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles', 'July Non-manufacturing Business Outlook Survey', 'The European corporate earnings season', 'U.S. earnings', 'Hungarian central bank meetings', 'two-day Federal Reserve meeting', 'United Parcel Service Inc', 'Swiss bank UBS', 'lofty earnings expectations', 'Styrofoam bull figures', 'FREE unlimited access', 'Reuters.com Register', 'second-quarter net profit', 'first-quarter adjusted profit', 'sovereign debt crisis', 'big tech firms', 'domestic stock markets', 'two-day meeting', 'full-year 2023 outlook', 'European shares', 'European companies', 'Europe earnings', 'United States', 'big concern', 'stock exchange', 'Kai Pfaffenbach', 'Tommy Wilkes', 'rising costs', 'slowing demand', 'next leg', 'Logitech International', 'Goldman Sachs', 'second quarter', 'highest fraction', 'modest declines', 'two-decade highs', 'interest rates', '75 basis points', 'Market attention', 'future path', 'Key developments', 'Philadelphia issues', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'General Electric', '3M Company', 'Xerox Corp', 'Boston Properties', 'Saikat Chatterjee', 'trading floor', 'counter', 'Frankfurt', 'Germany', 'Thursday', 'China', 'depreciation', 'yuan', 'currencies', 'region', 'DAX', 'Britain', 'FTSE', '2.7 percent', 'pace', 'Tuesday', 'evidence', 'traders', 'rewriting', 'businesses', 'caution', 'UBSG.', 'rise', 'LOGN', '38% fall', 'results', 'consensus', 'misses', 'investors', 'slew', 'Microsoft', 'Stocks', 'dollar', 'start', 'sidelines', 'policymakers', 'direction', 'Nigeria', 'Lindt', 'ITV', 'Unilever', 'Michelin', 'Vivendi', 'LVMH', 'Easyjet', 'Unicredit', 'Coca-Cola', 'McDonald', 'GM', 'Google', 'Editing', 'Standards']",2022-07-26,2022-07-27,reuters.com

For this reason also the second quarter clearly exceeds our expectations ” said Chief Financial Officer Gregor Pottmeyer.The company said it now expects 2022 net revenue to be significantly more than 3.8 billion euros and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to be significantly more than 2.2 billion euros.($1 = 0.9878 euros)(Reporting by Tom Sims and Marta OroszEditing by Chris Reese and Bernadette Baum),neutral,0.25,0.64,0.11,mixed,0.33,0.25,0.42,True,English,"['Q2 net profit', 'Deutsche Boerse', '10% rise', 'Chief Financial Officer Gregor Pottmeyer', 'financial market environment', 'Net profit', 'profit increase', 'high degree', 'second quarter', '2022 net revenue', 'Tom Sims', 'Marta OroszEditing', 'Chris Reese', 'Bernadette Baum', '311 million euros', '3.8 billion euros', '2.2 billion euros', 'interest rates', '0.9878 euros', 'shareholders', 'company', 'Analysts', 'Inflation', 'volatility', 'uncertainty', 'reason', 'expectations', 'earnings', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'EBITDA']",2022-07-26,2022-07-27,fxempire.com

Market attention will be squarely focused on the future path of interest rates.Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:U.S. Federal Reserve starts two-day meetingU.S. May home price indexU.S. June new home sales dataU.S. 5-year Treasury auctionFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia issues July Non-manufacturing Business Outlook Survey for JulyNigeria  Hungarian central bank meetingsEurope earnings: UBS  Lindt  ITV  Unilever  Michelin  Deutsche Boerse  Vivendi  LVMH  Easyjet  UnicreditU.S. earnings: United Parcel Service Inc  General Electric  3M Company  Xerox Corp  Coca-Cola  McDonald’s  GM  Microsoft  Google  Boston Properties(Editing by Saikat Chatterjee),neutral,0.29,0.64,0.07,negative,0.02,0.13,0.85,True,English,"['Marketmind', 'Earnings', 'rescue', 'U.S. May home price index U.S. June new home sales data', 'U.S. 5-year Treasury auction Federal Reserve Bank', 'U.S. Federal Reserve', 'July Non-manufacturing Business Outlook Survey', 'U.S. earnings', 'Hungarian central bank meetings', 'two-day Federal Reserve meeting', 'United Parcel Service Inc', 'Swiss bank UBS', 'second-quarter net profit', 'first-quarter adjusted profit', 'sovereign debt crisis', 'lofty earnings expectations', 'big tech firms', 'two-day meeting', 'full-year 2023 outlook', 'United States', 'big concern', 'Europe earnings', 'next leg', 'Logitech International', 'Goldman Sachs', 'European companies', 'second quarter', 'highest fraction', 'modest declines', 'two-decade highs', 'interest rates', '75 basis points', 'Market attention', 'future path', 'Key developments', 'Philadelphia issues', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'General Electric', '3M Company', 'Xerox Corp', 'Boston Properties', 'Saikat Chatterjee', 'stock markets', 'traders', 'rewriting', 'businesses', 'evidence', 'Tuesday', 'caution', 'rise', '38% fall', 'results', 'consensus', 'misses', 'Trading', 'investors', 'slew', 'Microsoft', 'Stocks', 'dollar', 'start', 'sidelines', 'policymakers', 'direction', 'Nigeria', 'Lindt', 'ITV', 'Unilever', 'Michelin', 'Vivendi', 'LVMH', 'Easyjet', 'Unicredit', 'Coca-Cola', 'McDonald', 'GM', 'Google']",2022-07-26,2022-07-27,fxempire.com

So this continent has huge strengths ” he said.Some of its “structural weaknesses” he said are that European markets are more fragmented than the US. While he is not quite so sure that Europe could create its own Godzilla companies there are “many very material niche markets that are very big that allow European companies to be global peers ” he said.One of those niche markets is fintech  especially payment systems  which Europe has raised several big names including Klarna and Revolut. But the other big player will be deep tech  predicts Boujnah.“I do believe that in the semiconductors  in the telecom equipment  in the software side of the universe  above and beyond the usual buzzwords like that.“And the European deep tech technology skills and assets are going to make the difference in the years to come”.,negative,0.08,0.37,0.54,mixed,0.18,0.25,0.57,True,English,"['tech companies', 'stagnation fears', 'Euronext', 'Europe', 'Euronews', 'European deep tech technology skills', 'high-quality technology projects', 'new technology initiative', 'homogeneous technology players', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'current economic climate', 'International Financial Forum', 'European member countries', 'several big names', 'strongest tech scene', 'other big player', 'specialised asset managers', 'European technology companies', 'European tech leaders', 'material niche markets', 'private equity funds', 'European tech companies', 'European markets', 'tech funds', 'European companies', 'other investors', 'big difference', 'rising prices', 'interest rates', 'Managing Board', 'smaller valuation', 'consistent progress', 'venture capitalists', 'United States', 'strong research', 'blue chip', 'huge strengths', 'structural weaknesses', 'global peers', 'payment systems', 'telecom equipment', 'software side', 'usual buzzwords', 'Godzilla companies', 'past 15 years', 'collective group', 'Stephane Boujnah', 'Creating Europe', 'start-ups', 'stagflation', 'Euronext', 'situation', 'CEO', 'Chairman', 'Euronews', 'Paris', 'outlook', 'bloc', 'June', 'bid', 'Nasdaq', 'sector', 'visibility', 'continent', 'reasons', 'creation', 'part', 'location', 'giants', 'Amazon', 'Google', 'academia', 'People', 'pipe', 'debt', 'sake', 'pensions', 'fintech', 'Klarna', 'Revolut', 'semiconductors', 'universe', 'assets']",2022-07-26,2022-07-27,euronews.com
8172,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/26/eutelsat-and-oneweb-agree-merger-to-create-european-satellite-juggernaut/,Eutelsat and OneWeb agree on merger to create European satellite juggernaut – TechCrunch,Two major players in the European satellite space are merging in a $3.4 billion all-share transaction  a move that is widely seen as a challenge to Elon...,Two major players in the European satellite space are merging in a $3.4 billion all-share transaction  a move that is widely seen as a challenge to Elon Musk’s SpaceX.Rumors emerged earlier this week that France’s Eutelsat was gearing up to buy its British rival OneWeb  and the duo have now confirmed these plans.Founded in 1977  Eutelsat is a long-established provider of satellite services for myriad industries  from broadcast television and aviation  to IoT and telecom. The Paris-based company  whose biggest shareholder is French state-owned investment bank Bpifrance  says it currently has 36 GEO (geostationary orbit) satellites in operation.OneWeb  meanwhile  is a newer entrant to the space  focused on low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites for delivering internet services. Although OneWeb is 10 years old  it only launched its first tranche of satellites into orbit in 2019  and a year later the London-based company filed for bankruptcy having raised $3 billion from a slew of investors including SoftBank  Qualcomm and Virgin. Later in 2020  OneWeb emerged from bankruptcy with backing from the U.K. government and India’s Bharti Global  with Eutelsat later buying a 24% stake in the company.Crowded spaceA number of notable players are battling it out in the burgeoning satellite space race  including Amazon via its Kuiper project that is expected to begin launching satellites later this year; and more notably Elon Musk-led SpaceX  which has been launching satellites at a rate of knots — the company now has more than 2 500 satellites in orbit and completed its 33rd launch of the year on Sunday  sending a further 53 into space.Moreover  SpaceX is already selling its Starlink-branded broadband service directly to consumers in several markets around the world.OneWeb  for its part  currently has 428 LEO satellites in orbit  and it has been ramping up its commercial agreements  including a deal with AT&T to deliver high-speed broadband to remote locations in the U.S. And this highlights one of the key differences between SpaceX’s Starlink and OneWeb — the former seems to be targeting consumers directly  whereas OneWeb is pursuing a B2B approach.Following its merger with Eutelsat  the duo are planning to double down on their existing partnership  which includes a global distribution agreement they entered into back in March. And today  the two companies revealed that they have signed a new commercial partnership that addresses the “European and global cruise markets.”Ultimately  Eutelsat and OneWeb are touting the complementary nature of their respective products as the big opportunity here: Eutelsat’s GEO satellites  which are higher altitude and thus higher latency  are better suited for things like weather forecasts and TV broadcasts. And OneWeb’s constellation of lower-altitude satellites are better for critical communications that require low-latency data transfers. Combined  the companies argue that they will be better positioned to target a broader array of use cases across the B2B and B2C spheres.The companies’ joint press release issued today reads:The operations of Eutelsat and OneWeb are highly complementary. A clear roadmap has been designed to develop over time a complementary GEO/LEO service including a common platform  hybrid terminals and a fully mutualized network creating a one-stop shop solution for customers  providing them with a unique offering and a seamless user experience.What’s also notable about this deal is that it sees both the French and U.K. governments formally coming together as joint shareholders in the new combined entity  though it’s not clear how much stakes they will each retain in the new company  or whether they will have seats on the board.The proposal notes that the transaction will see OneWeb shares exchanged with new shares issued by Eutelsat  with Eutelsat owning 100% of OneWeb when the deal closes — with the exception of what is referred to as the “special share” that the U.K. government will retain in OneWeb.OneWeb will continue to trade under its existing brand and remain headquartered in the U.K.  while Eutelsat will still operate from its HQ in France and remain listed on the Euronext stock exchange in Paris. Under the proposals  current Eutelsat CEO Eva Berneke would stay as CEO of the new combined company  while chairman Dominique D’Hinnin will also continue as head of the board. It’s not clear what role — if any — OneWeb CEO Neil Masterson would have at the new company.The transaction  if greenlighted by the usual regulatory bodies  is expected to close by the end of the first half of 2023 — so this potentially has another year or so until completion.,neutral,0.03,0.92,0.05,mixed,0.22,0.22,0.56,True,English,"['European satellite juggernaut', 'Eutelsat', 'OneWeb', 'merger', 'TechCrunch', 'current Eutelsat CEO Eva Berneke', 'chairman Dominique D’Hinnin', 'French state-owned investment bank', 'companies’ joint press release', 'burgeoning satellite space race', 'OneWeb CEO Neil Masterson', '36 GEO (geostationary orbit) satellites', 'low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites', 'low-latency data transfers', 'one-stop shop solution', 'seamless user experience', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'usual regulatory bodies', 'global distribution agreement', 'Starlink-branded broadband service', 'complementary GEO/LEO service', 'new combined entity', 'U.K. government', 'global cruise markets', 'Two major players', '$3.4 billion all-share transaction', 'new commercial partnership', 'new combined company', 'European satellite space', 'satellite services', '428 LEO satellites', 'GEO satellites', 'joint shareholders', 'two companies', 'Bharti Global', 'U.S.', 'notable players', 'several markets', 'commercial agreements', 'high-speed broadband', 'existing partnership', 'complementary nature', 'new shares', 'new company', 'Crowded space', 'Elon Musk', 'British rival', 'myriad industries', 'broadcast television', 'biggest shareholder', 'newer entrant', 'internet services', 'first tranche', 'Kuiper project', '33rd launch', 'AT&T', 'remote locations', 'key differences', 'respective products', 'big opportunity', 'higher altitude', 'higher latency', 'weather forecasts', 'TV broadcasts', 'lower-altitude satellites', 'critical communications', 'broader array', 'use cases', 'B2C spheres', 'clear roadmap', 'common platform', 'hybrid terminals', 'mutualized network', 'unique offering', 'special share', 'existing brand', 'first half', 'Paris-based company', 'London-based company', 'B2B approach', 'OneWeb shares', '2,500 satellites', 'move', 'challenge', 'SpaceX', 'Rumors', 'France', 'duo', 'plans', 'provider', 'aviation', 'IoT', 'telecom', 'operation', 'bankruptcy', 'slew', 'investors', 'SoftBank', 'Qualcomm', 'Virgin', 'India', '24% stake', 'number', 'Amazon', 'rate', 'knots', 'year', 'Sunday', 'consumers', 'world', 'deal', 'merger', 'March', 'things', 'constellation', 'time', 'customers', 'stakes', 'seats', 'board', 'proposal', 'exception', 'HQ', 'head', 'role', 'end', 'completion']",2022-07-26,2022-07-27,techcrunch.com

OneWeb is one of the two only global LEO networks and has experienced strong momentum over recent months  with service expected to be fully deployed in 2023.The transaction would represent a logical next step in the successful partnership between Eutelsat and OneWeb  started with Eutelsat's equity investment in OneWeb in April 2021 and deepened with the Global Distribution Agreement announced in March 2022. Eutelsat currently holds 23% of OneWeb's share capital  alongside a consortium of high-profile public and private investors.Under the terms of the transaction being discussed  Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders would each hold 50% of the combined group's shares.The transaction would be structured as a contribution by OneWeb's shareholders of their stake in OneWeb to Eutelsat in exchange for newly issued Eutelsat shares. Any combination would be subject to  among other conditions  approval by the requisite majority of Eutelsat shareholders and receipt of all relevant antitrust and regulatory (including foreign investment) approvals.There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement. Eutelsat will inform the market as soon as soon as there are any new developments.Related LinksEutelsat CommunicationsThe latest information about the Commercial Satellite IndustryThanks for being there;We need your help.

Importantly  Fixed Broadband and Mobile Connectivity businesses have delivered double-digit growth highlighting their long-term potential whereas our Broadcast business has shown an improvement in trend in the second semester. In parallel  all the components necessary to foster our Telecom Pivot are gradually being put in place  including a new organization  an integrated platform and adequate in-orbit resources which will enable us to address the massive long-term connectivity opportunity. For the first year of our investment  our cooperation with OneWeb has been strengthened with in particular  the conclusion of a global distribution agreement to address all connectivity verticals further strengthened by an exclusive commercial partnership. Looking ahead  Operating Verticals revenues for FY 2022-23 are expected between €1 150 and €1 180 million4 with a return to growth in FY 2023-24 fully reiterated. Cash generation will remain sustained with an Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow objective expected on average at €420 million per annum in the next couple of years. We are also renewing our commitment to strong shareholder returns with a recommended dividend maintained at a high level of €0.93 per share.”EBITDA  EBITDA margin  Net debt / EBITDA ratio  Cash Capex  Discretionary Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow are considered Alternative Performance Indicators.

Cumulative Reported DFCF above €2.2bn over the last 5 years.Net Debt / EBITDA ratio at 3.27x (versus 2.88x last year) ahead of phase 2 of C-Band proceeds.Putting all components in place to foster the Telecom PivotMassive long-term market opportunity for both B2C and B2B connectivity.Successful launch of our Eutelsat Advance managed services solutions with a promising commercial start  notably in Maritime.Reorganization along two business lines  Video and Connectivity to enhance customer-centricity  gain efficiency and favour return to growth  as part of Comete project.Substantial growth capacity entering service from FY 2023-24 with high level of pre-commitments.Closer cooperation with OneWeb which is making good progress despite Russian headwindInvestment closed with a further strengthening of the initial stake making Eutelsat OneWeb’s second largest shareholder.Global distribution partnership secured to address key connectivity verticals  deepening cooperation and showcasing operational synergies between the two companies.Exclusive commercial partnership agreement  with Eutelsat taking a firm commitment for some OneWeb’s capacity and benefitting from exclusive use over certain pre-determined sales regions and verticals  in particular continental Europe and Global cruise.Following the suspension of operations in Baikonur  OneWeb to resume satellite launches with SpaceX and New Space India.Continued commercial traction highlighting substantial long-term potential.Updated financial objectives including confirmed return to topline growth from FY 2023-24Operating Vertical revenues expected between €1 150 million and €1 180 million in FY 2022-23.Operating Vertical revenues expected to grow from FY 2023-24 on the back of the entry into service of new assets with substantial firm precommitments.Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow objective expected at an average of €420 million per year in FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24  representing a cumulative Adjusted DFCF generation of €1 361 million over three fiscal years (FY 2021-22  FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24) at a 1.00 €/$ rate.All objectives are set using a 1.00 €/$ rate.Recommended dividend of €0.93 per share  subject to AGM approvalDividend covered more than twice by Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow.Scrip dividend option to be proposed to shareholders.ANALYSIS OF REVENUES5In € millions FY 2020-21 FY 2021-22 Change Reported Like-for-like6 Broadcast 741.0 696.9 -6.0% -6.9% Data & Professional Video 161.4 158.5 -1.8% -4.2% Government Services 151.4 144.4 -4.6% -7.9% Fixed Broadband 80.2 68.7 -14.3% +36.0% Mobile Connectivity 67.2 79.9 +18.9% +15.0% Total Operating Verticals 1 201.2 1 148.3 -4.4% -3.8% Other Revenues7 32.7 3.3 -89.9% -11.8% Total 1 233.9 1 151.6 -6.7% -3.9% EUR/USD exchange rate 1.19 1.14Total revenues for FY 2021-22 stood at €1 152 million  down by 6.7% on a reported basis and by 3.9% like-for-like.Revenues of the five Operating Verticals (ie  excluding ‘Other Revenues’) stood at €1 148 million. They were down by 3.8% on a like-for-like basis excluding a positive currency effect of circa 2 points as well as a negative perimeter effect of circa 2.5 points from the disposal of Euro Broadband Infrastructure (EBI) on 30 April 2021  only partly offset by the consolidation of Bigblu Broadband Europe since 1st October 2020.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €293 million down 3.8% on a reported basis and by 3.3% like-for-like. Revenues of the five Operating Verticals stood at €295 million  down 3.1% year-on-year and up 1.5% quarter-on-quarter on a like-for-like basis.Unless otherwise stated  all variations indicated below are on a like-for-like basis  ie  at constant currency and perimeter.Broadcast (61% of revenues)FY 2021-22 Broadcast revenues were down 6.9% like-for-like to €697 million. They reflected predominantly the effect of the partial renewal of capacity with Nilesat at 7/8° West as well as lower revenues in Europe in the first half of the fiscal year due largely to the carry-forward effect of a slowdown in the pace of new business during the Covid period.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €174 million  down by 5.8% year-on-year. Excluding the 7/8° West impact  Broadcast revenues experienced a low-single-digit decline. Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were broadly stable for the second quarter in a row.Data & Professional Video (14% of revenues)FY 2021-22 Data & Professional Video revenues stood at €159 million  down by 4.2% year-on-year  a trend which is broadly in keeping with the previous fiscal year (-3.7%).Fixed Data  which accounts for more than two thirds of this vertical  is benefiting from higher volumes which partly offset a continued double-digit price pressure. Professional Video remains in structural decline  although it benefited from a robust performance in Occasional Use.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €41 million  down 5.8% year-on-year and 1.1% quarter-on-quarter.Government Services (12% of revenues)FY 2021-22 Government Services revenues stood at €144 million  down 7.9% year-on-year. This reflected the negative effect of US Government renewals  driven by the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan which led to a renewal rate of circa 75% during the fiscal year  as well as the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A. These headwinds were only partly offset by initial incremental revenues secured on EUTELSAT QUANTUM.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €36 million  down 12.9% year-on-year. They were stable quarter-on-quarter.Fixed Broadband (6% of revenues)FY 2021-22 Fixed Broadband revenues stood at €69 million  up 36.0% year-on-year. They reflected the contribution from the wholesale agreements with Orange  TIM and  from November 2021  Hispasat  the strong dynamic of our African operations and the ramp-up of the multi-beam agreement signed on EUTELSAT 65 West A with several Mexican service providers. Revenues also benefitted from a positive one-off in the Fourth Quarter amounting to circa €2.5 million. These tailwinds more than offset the erosion of the legacy business of Bigblu Broadband on the KA-SAT satellite.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €22 million  up 26.0% quarter-on-quarter and largely reflecting the above-mentioned one-off. They were up 39.2% on a year-on-year basis (+22.4% excluding the one-off).Mobile Connectivity (7% of revenues)FY 2021-22 Mobile Connectivity revenues stood at €80 million  up 15.0% year-on-year. Revenues reflected the carry-forward effect of the contract signed with Anuvu last year as well as the ongoing strong growth of Maritime  driven by the ramp-up of contracts with service providers signed in recent years and by the agreement inked earlier this year on EUTELSAT QUANTUM with a customer in the Middle East. These tailwinds more than offset the downsizing of a contract with a service provider in the Middle East.Fourth Quarter revenues stood at €23 million  up 16.4% year-on-year and 4.5% quarter-on-quarter.On the commercial front  Eutelsat has been selected by Telenor Maritime for in-orbit resources and managed services for cruise connectivity on several of its satellites. Under the agreement Eutelsat will deliver capacity on EUTELSAT 33E for coverage of the Mediterranean Sea  and on multiple satellites  together with its Eutelsat ADVANCE managed connectivity service  for coverage of the Caribbean Sea. This deal testifies to the strong momentum of the maritime connectivity business and showcases the compelling combination of Eutelsat's in-orbit resources and its Eutelsat ADVANCE solution.Other RevenuesOther Revenues amounted to €3 million versus €33 million a year earlier. They included a negative €12 million impact from hedging operations compared to a positive effect of €16 million last year.OPERATIONAL AND UTILIZED TRANSPONDERSThe number of operational transponders at 30 June 2022 stood at 1 361 units  down 16 units year-on-year  the latter reflecting principally the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A.The number of utilized transponders stood at 996 units  up 15 units year-on-year  reflecting principally the ramp-up of the maritime connectivity vertical  partially offset by the renewal campaigns with the US Government as well as the partial renewal with Nilesat.As a result  the fill rate stood at 73.2% compared with 71.2% a year ago.30 June 2021 30 June 2022 Operational transponders8 1 377 1 361 Utilized transponders9 981 996 Fill rate 71.2% 73.2% Note: Based on 36 MHz-equivalent transponders excluding high throughput capacityBACKLOGAt 30 June 2022 the backlog stood at €4.0 billion  down 7.5% compared to 30 June 2021  largely reflecting natural backlog consumption.The backlog was equivalent to 3.5 times 2021-22 revenues  with Broadcast representing 62%.30 June 2021 30 June 2022 Value of contracts (in billions of euros) 4.4 4.0 In years of revenues based on last fiscal year 3.5 3.5 Share of Broadcast 64% 62% Note: The backlog represents future revenues from capacity or service agreements and can include contracts for satellites under procurement.PROFITABILITYEBITDA stood at €862 million versus €922 million at 30 June 2021  down 6.5%. Despite lower revenues  the EBITDA margin is stable at 74.8% (75.0% at constant currency and excluding Hedging) versus 74.7% a year earlier.Opex were €26m lower than last fiscal year at constant currency reflecting the favorable effect of changes in perimeter  lower Bad Debt and continued strict cost discipline in the legacy businesses which more than offset additional costs for growth verticals. In the context of the LEAP 2 cost-saving program  €24 million savings are being achieved  in the high end of the 20-25 million annual savings target range.Group share of net income stood at €231 million versus €214 million in FY 2020-21  up by 7.8%. The net margin stood at 20% versus 17% last year. This reflected mainly:Lower depreciation and amortisation costs of -€482 million at 30 June 2022 compared with -€508 million a year earlier  as a result of the disposal of the KA-SAT satellite in May 2021 and of the end of the amortisation period of certain in-orbit assets  which more than offset the effect of the entry into service of KONNECT in November 2020 and of EUTELSAT QUANTUM in November 2021.of -€482 million at 30 June 2022 compared with -€508 million a year earlier  as a result of the disposal of the KA-SAT satellite in May 2021 and of the end of the amortisation period of certain in-orbit assets  which more than offset the effect of the entry into service of KONNECT in November 2020 and of EUTELSAT QUANTUM in November 2021. Other operating income of +€45 million versus -€67 million last year. FY 2021-22 included the $125m payment related to Phase I of C-Band proceeds  partly offset by some asset impairments recorded mostly in the first half.

Negative income from associates ((€72) million) reflecting the contribution of the stake in OneWeb since September.CASH FLOWNet cash flow from operating activities amounted to €801 million  €88 million lower than last year. This reflected the decrease in EBITDA as well as an unfavourable comparison basis for working capital requirement as FY 2020-21 benefitted from a catch up after the Covid crisis. Excluding the tax related to the phase I of C-Band proceeds  cash tax was lower than in previous year.Cash Capex10 amounted to €280 million (€63 million below FY 2020-21)  well within our €400m per annum envelope and not reflective of our long-term expectations. FY 2020-21 notably included anticipated leases and ECA repayments.Interest and other fees paid net of interest received amounted to €78 million  essentially unchanged versus last year (€80 million).As a result  Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow amounted to €443 million on a reported basis. At the €/$ rate which was set for financial objectives (1.20) and excluding the impact of hedging and one-off costs  Adjusted DFCF stood at €460 million  down 2.1% compared to the record high level of FY 2020-21  but well above our expected range of objectives (€400 to €430 million).Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow represented 38% of revenues.FINANCIAL STRUCTUREAt 30 June 2022 net debt stood at €2 814 million  a €159m increase versus end of June 2021. It mainly reflected  on one hand  the €443 million reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow and the first instalment of C-Band proceeds net of tax of €86 million  and on the other  the dividend payment of €222 million (including minority interests) and the outflow in respect of inorganic investments of €495m  mostly OneWeb. Other items (mostly variations related to leases  structured debt and the foreign exchange portion of the cross-currency swap) contributed to the decrease in net debt for a net impact of €28 million.As a result  the net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at 3.27x  0.39x higher compared to end-June 2021 (2.88x).The weighted average maturity of the Group’s debt stood at 4.3 years (5.0 years at end-June 2021) and the average cost of debt after hedging stood at 2.55% versus 2.4% in FY 2020-21. The Group’s liquidity position at the end of June 2022 including cash and undrawn credit lines stood at around €1.9 billion.DIVIDENDOn 25 July 2022 the Board of Directors agreed to recommend to the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders a dividend of €0.93 per share for FY 2021-22  unchanged versus last fiscal year.An option for shareholders to receive the entire dividend  either in cash or in new shares of the Company will be proposed.OUTLOOK AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVESWith a robust backlog  an industry-leading profitability and a proven ability to generate a high level of Free Cash Flow  Eutelsat is in a strong position to face the challenges of FY 2022-23  which is expected to be the last year of transition before a return to growth from FY 2023-24  driven by new in-orbit resources.Broadcast revenue trend is expected to materially improve in FY 2022-23 relative to FY 2021-22 (-6.9%). Nevertheless  while the impact of the Nilesat headwind will wash out from mid-October 2022  revenues will be negatively affected by the anticipated non-renewal of the capacity contract with Digitürk  leading to an overall mid-single digit decline for this application.Data & Professional Video revenue trend in FY 2022-23 will remain largely in keeping with the mid-single digit decline trend reported in FY 2021-22 (-4.2%).Government Services revenue will reflect  on one hand  the ramp-up of EUTELSAT QUANTUM  and on the other  the carry-forward effect of FY 2021-22 below-average renewals. The outturn of the fiscal year will also remain dependent on the outcome of future renewals.Fixed Broadband and Mobility will keep growing in FY 2022-23  although at a slower pace compared to the massive double-digit growth recorded in FY 2021-22 (respectively +36.0% and +15.0%)  ahead of the arrival of incremental capacity.Taking these elements into account  we expect to generate revenues from the five Operating Verticals of between €1 150-1 180 million in FY 2022-23  based on a €/$ rate of 1.00  representing a -4% like-for-like decline at mid-point versus FY 2021-22  in keeping with the trend of FY 2021-22. Thanks to new capacity including notably the firm precommitments secured on EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS and EUTELSAT 10B  revenues are expected to grow from FY 2023-24.Cash Capex11 will not exceed €400 million per annum for each of the next two fiscal years (FY 2022-23 / FY 2023-24).The Group will continue to leverage all measures to maximise cash generation with an objective of Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow expected at an average of €420 million per year at a €/$ rate of 1.00 for FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24. This is equivalent to a cumulative Adjusted DFCF generation of €1 361 million over three fiscal years at a 1.00 €/$ rate (FY 2021-22  FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24). Adjusted DFCF objectives exclude future payments related to the exclusive commercial partnership with OneWeb mentioned below.We remain committed to a sound financial structure and continue to target a medium-term net debt / EBITDA ratio of around 3x.A €0.93 per share dividend will be proposed to the upcoming AGM with a scrip option. Beyond that  the dividend policy is suspended in the context of the Oneweb transaction.This outlook is based on the nominal deployment plan outlined below. It assumes no material deterioration of revenues generated from Russian customers. It excludes the impact of the contemplated combination with OneWeb.COMETE PROJECTEutelsat has decided to adapt its organisation to better serve its strategic priorities  the evolution of its markets and the specific characteristics of each of its businesses.In this context  two distinct Business Units  Video and Connectivity  will be created and will integrate all the activities carried out by the current Sales Department  as well as the teams providing support for customer services  currently in the Technical Department. The new organisation  which is expected to be fully in place early in calendar year 2023  will place customer satisfaction at the heart of our operations  enable differentiated sales strategies per each sub-segment and increase collaboration between the relevant teams.This new organization will be instrumental to foster return to growth  enhance customer centricity  and ensure an optimized efficiency in the use of the resources of the company.FLEET DEPLOYMENTNominal deployment programCompared to the last quarterly update in May 2022  the entry into service of EUTELSAT 10B has been slightly delayed from the end of the first half of calendar 2023 to the third quarter of calendar year 2023.Satellite Orbital position Estimated entry into service (calendar year) Main applications Main geographic coverage Physical Transponders/ Spot beams Of which expansion EUTELSAT 10B 10° East Q3 2023 Mobile Connectivity EMEA Atlantic & Indian Ocean 12 Ku 10 C >100 Ku spot beams -48 Ku c. 35 Gbps EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13G 13° East H1 2023 Broadcast Europe MENA 80 Ku1 EGNOS payload EGNOS payload KONNECT VHTS To be confirmed H2 2023 Connectivity Europe ~230 Ka spot beams 500 Gbps EUTELSAT HOTBIRD 13F 13° East Q2/Q3 2023 Broadcast Europe MENA 80 Ku1 None EUTELSAT 36D 36° East H2 2024 Broadcast Government Africa  Russia  Europe 70 Ku UHF payload UHF payload 1 Nominal capacity corresponding to the specifications of the satellites.

These indicators are the object of reconciliation with the consolidated accounts.EBITDA  EBITDA margin and Net debt / EBITDA ratioEBITDA reflects the profitability of the Group before Interest  Tax  Depreciation and Amortisation. It is a frequently used indicator in the Fixed Satellite Services Sector and more generally the Telecom industry. The table below shows the calculation of EBITDA based on the consolidated P&L accounts for FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22:Twelve months ended June 30 (€ millions) 2021 2022 Operating income 347.2 424.8 + Depreciation and Amortisation 507.7 481.7 - Other operating income and expenses 67.0 -44.9 EBITDA 921.9 861.6The EBITDA margin is the ratio of EBITDA to revenues. It is calculated as follows:Twelve months ended June 30 (€ millions) 2021 2022 EBITDA 921.9 861.6 Revenues 1 233.9 1 151.6 EBITDA margin (as a % of revenues) 74.7% 74.8%The Net debt / EBITDA ratio is the ratio of net debt to last-twelve months EBITDA. It is calculated as follows:Twelve months ended June 30 (€ millions) 2021 2022 Last twelve months EBITDA 921.9 861.6 Closing net debt16 2 655.5 2 814.4 Net debt / EBITDA 2.88x 3.27xCash CapexThe Group on occasion operates capacity within the framework of leases  or finances all or part of certain satellite programs under export credit agreements or through other bank facilities  leading to outflows which are not reflected in the item “acquisition of satellites and other tangible or intangible assets”. Cash Capex including the outflows related to these elements is published in order to reflect the totality of Capital Expenditures undertaken in any financial year.In addition  in the event of a partial or total loss of a satellite  as previously reported cash Capex included investment in assets which are inoperable or partially inoperable  the amount of insurance proceeds is deducted from Cash Capex.Cash Capex therefore covers the acquisition of satellites and other tangible or intangible assets  payments in respect of export credit facilities or other bank facilities financing investments as well as payments related to lease liabilities. If applicable it is net from the amount of insurance proceeds.The table below shows the calculation of Cash Capex for FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22:Twelve months ended June 30 (€ millions) 2021 2022 Acquisitions of satellites  other property and equipment and intangible assets (183.4) (177.2) Insurance proceeds 6.6 - Repayments of ECA loans  lease liabilities and other bank facilities 17 (165.2) (102.3) Cash Capex (342.0) (279.5)Discretionary Free Cash Flow (DFCF)The Group communicates on Discretionary Free Cash Flow which reflects its ability to generate cash after the payment of interest and taxes. DFCF generally and principally serves the shareholder remuneration and debt reduction.Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash flow from operating activities less Cash Capex as well as Interest and other fees paid net of interest received. It excludes C-Band proceeds and attendant tax.Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow (as per financial objectives) is calculated at the €/$ rate assumed in financial objectives (1.20) and excludes one-off impacts such as Hedging  effects of changes in perimeter when relevant  and one-off costs related to specific projects in particular to the LEAP 2 program and to the move to new headquarters. The table below shows the calculation of Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow for FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 and its reconciliation with the Cash Flow statement:Twelve months ended June 30 (€ millions) 2021 2022 Net cash flows from operating activities 889.0 800.9 Cash Capex (as defined above) (342.0) (279.5) Interest and other fees paid net of interest received (80.0) (78.3) Reported Discretionary Free Cash Flow 467.1 443.2 Currency impact18 (3.2) (16.6) Hedging Impact (15.6) 11.8 One-off costs related to “LEAP 2” program and move to new headquarters 21.7 21.6 Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow 470.0 460.01 Dividend proposed at the next AGM.2 FY 2021-22 “Operating Verticals” revenues are converted at 1.20 €/$ rate.3 Please refer to Appendix 3 for more details on Alternative Performance Measures.4 Based on €/$ rate of 1.00 and on the nominal deployment plan outlined below. It assumes no material deterioration of revenues generated from Russian customers.5 The share of each application as a percentage of total revenues is calculated excluding “Other Revenues”.6 Change at constant currency and perimeter. The variation is calculated as follows: i) FY 2021-22 USD revenues are converted at FY 2020-21 rates; ii) the contribution of BigBlu Broadband Europe (BBB) from 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021 is excluded from FY 2021-22 revenues; iii) the contribution of Eurobroadband Infrastructure (EBI) is excluded from FY 2020-21 revenues; iv) Hedging revenues are excluded from Other Revenues.7 “Other Revenues” include mainly the impact of EUR/USD revenue currency hedging  the provision of various services or consulting/engineering fees and termination fees.8 Number of transponders on satellites in stable orbit  back-up capacity excluded.9 Number of transponders utilized on satellites in stable orbit.10 Please refer to Appendix 3 for more details on Alternative Performance Measures.11 Including capital expenditure and payments under existing export credit facilities and other bank facilities financing investments as well as payments related to lease liabilities.12 Operating expenses is defined as the sum of operating costs and of selling  general & administrative expenses.13 Forex portion.14 Mostly related to leases and structured debt.15 Change at constant currency and perimeter. The variation is calculated as follows: i) Q4 2021-22 USD revenues are converted at Q4 2020-21 rates; ii) the contribution of Eurobroadband Infrastructure (EBI) is excluded from Q4 2020-21 revenues; iii) Hedging impact is excluded from Other Revenues.16 Net debt includes all bank debt  bonds and all liabilities from lease agreements and structured debt as well as Forex portion of the cross-currency swap  less cash and cash equivalents (net of bank overdraft).

Eutelsat will combine its 36-strong fleet of GEO satellites with OneWeb’s constellation of 648 Low Earth Orbit satellites  of which 428 are currently in orbit.The transaction would be structured as an exchange of OneWeb shares by its shareholders (other than Eutelsat) with new shares issued by Eutelsat  such that  at closing  Eutelsat would own 100% of OneWeb (excluding the ‘Special Share’ of the UK Government). OneWeb shareholders would receive 230 million newly issued Eutelsat shares representing 50% of the enlarged share capital4.The potential transaction builds on the deepening collaboration between Eutelsat and OneWeb  begun with the equity stake acquired by Eutelsat in OneWeb in April 2021  the global distribution agreement between Eutelsat and OneWeb announced in March 2022  and the new exclusive commercial partnership5  addressing mainly the European and global cruise markets  signed today.Commenting on the combination  Dominique D’Hinnin  Eutelsat’s Chairman said “I am delighted to announce this new and significant step in the collaboration between Eutelsat and OneWeb. Bringing together our two businesses will deliver a global first  combining LEO constellations and GEO assets to seize the significant growth opportunity in Connectivity  and deliver to our customers solutions to their needs across an even wider range of applications. This combination will accelerate the commercialisation of OneWeb’s fleet  while enhancing the attractiveness of Eutelsat’s growth profile. In addition  the combination carries significant value creation potential  anchored on a balanced mix of revenue  cost and capex synergies. The strong support of strategic shareholders of both parties is a testament to the huge opportunity that this combination offers and the value that will be created for all its stakeholders. This is truly a game changer for our industry.”Sunil Bharti Mittal  OneWeb’s Executive Chairman said “Having played a pioneering role in providing connectivity in the emerging world  I am excited about the possibilities of connecting the unconnected. The combination of Eutelsat and OneWeb represents a significant development in that direction as well as a unique GEO/LEO combination. The positive early results of our service together with our strong pipeline represent a very exciting opportunity in the fast-growing satellite connectivity segment  especially for customers requiring a high speed  low latency experience. Our customers are actively seeking a combined GEO/LEO offering leading us towards this important step. Bharti  as the lead shareholder of OneWeb  along with other key shareholders  is looking forward to playing a meaningful role in providing expanded connectivity through the combination of OneWeb and Eutelsat.”Eva Berneke  Eutelsat’s Chief Executive Officer said “Our initial investment in OneWeb was underpinned by our strong belief that the future growth in Connectivity will be driven by both GEO and LEO capacity. This belief has intensified as our relationship with OneWeb has deepened  first by raising our stake in the company  and then with the global distribution agreement signed a few months ago. We are now moving to the next level  with a full combination that will ensure the potential of the GEO/LEO integration is fully realized  supported by compelling financial  strategic  and industrial logic. This ground-breaking combination will create a powerful global player with the financial strength and technical expertise to accelerate both OneWeb’s commercial deployment  and Eutelsat’s pivot to Connectivity. The combined entity will be geared towards profitable growth  with strong medium-term cash flow generation and a rapid deleveraging driven by strong forecast EBITDA growth. The benefits for our customers and strategic partners  who are at the center of our strategy  are both significant and unique. This is also a very exciting opportunity for our employees who will be key to the success of this transformation.”Neil Masterson  OneWeb’s Chief Executive Officer said “Just 20 months ago  OneWeb resumed its mission to connect the unconnected and remove the barriers to connectivity that hold back many of the world’s underserved economies and communities. Since then  we have turned this vision into reality and become the second largest low Earth orbit satellite operator in the world. Today’s announcement is another bold step in OneWeb’s remarkable journey. It is testament to the resilience  execution and innovation of our teams  the strong demand we have seen since launching our commercial services  and the close collaboration we have forged with our partners to provide high-speed  low latency connectivity for governments  businesses  and communities. This combination accelerates our mission to deliver connectivity that will change lives at scale and create a fast growing  well-funded company which will continue to create significant value for our shareholders.”A compelling market opportunityEutelsat and OneWeb will address the considerable Connectivity market opportunity  which is fueled by the growing needs of customers in both the B2B and B2C segments for consistent  reliable connectivity. These market segments are forecast to grow by three and five times respectively over the next decade  to reach a combined value of circa $16bn by 2030  with growth being served by both GEO HTS and LEO capacity6.Moreover  the combination of the network density  compelling economics and high throughput of GEO with the low latency and ubiquity of LEO  creates the optimal solution to address an even wider range of customer needs  thereby expanding the addressable market.A powerful combination  representing a game-changer in the industryThe operations of Eutelsat and OneWeb are highly complementary. A clear roadmap has been designed to develop over time a complementary GEO/LEO service including a common platform  hybrid terminals and a fully mutualized network creating a one-stop shop solution for customers  providing them with a unique offering and a seamless user experience.Tapping into significant revenue  cost and capex synergiesThe combination of Eutelsat with OneWeb is forecast to generate substantial value:Average annual revenue synergies are estimated at circa €150m after four years  with hybrid GEO/LEO offerings providing a premium service to customers as well as improving the fill rate.Synergies from joining organizational forces are expected to generate annual run-rate savings of over €80m pre-tax after five years  mostly through cost duplication avoidance.Capex optimization is expected to generate average savings estimated at circa €80m per annum  from year one. This would be achieved by leveraging the hybrid GEO/LEO satellite infrastructure and through the improved purchasing power of the combined entity.These sources of incremental value creation represent a balanced split between revenues  costs and capex. Taken together they equate to a net present value of over €1.5bn after tax (net of implementation costs).Value-creative pathway to robust  profitable growthThe transaction provides a platform for both entities to create value while transforming their respective growth profiles and cash generation potential.Combined entity would have revenues of circa €1.2bn and EBITDA of circa €0.7bn in FY22-23.Revenues are forecast to grow at low double-digit CAGR over the next decade.EBITDA is expected to grow at a mid-teen CAGR over the medium to long term  outpacing sales growth  with EBITDA margin levels moving gradually back in line with best-in-class GEO standards.The capex of the combined entity is estimated in average at some €725m to €875m  per annum  over the period FY23-24 - FY29-30.Well-funded investment programme and rapid deleveragingEutelsat’s strong cash flow generation will provide both visibility and funding to develop OneWeb’s fleet at minimal risk. Combined EBITDA – CAPEX  standing at circa -€0.2bn in FY22-23 is expected to be back in positive territory by FY24-25 - FY25-26 (depending on Gen-2 capex phasing).Eutelsat will temporarily suspend its dividend  and cash flow will be focused on the deployment of the Gen 2 constellation while maintaining a strong balance sheet.Leverage  which would stand at circa 4x net debt / EBITDA post transaction  is expected to be reduced on the back of strong EBITDA growth  backed by a disciplined financial policy  with an objective of leverage of circa 3x in the medium term.Eutelsat will pay its dividend in respect of FY21-22 with a scrip option. Thereafter  the dividend will be suspended for FY22-23 and FY23-24.Structure of the transactionThe transaction would be structured as an exchange of OneWeb shares for newly issued Eutelsat shares. This excludes the ‘Special Share’ in OneWeb which is retained by the UK Government together with the existing rights associated therewith. OneWeb shareholders would receive 230 million newly issued Eutelsat shares  representing 50% of Eutelsat’s enlarged share capital7.The number of new Eutelsat shares to be received by existing OneWeb shareholders would not be affected by the payment of the €0.93 per share dividend with a scrip option for FY 21-22 to be proposed at the upcoming AGM of Eutelsat.Trading under its existing name  OneWeb will continue to operate the LEO business  with OneWeb’s headquarters remaining in the UK.Eutelsat will continue to be headquartered and domiciled in France  listed on Euronext Paris and would apply for admission to the standard segment of the UK Official List of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange (subject to meeting the applicable eligibility requirements and the approval of the UK Financial Conduct Authority).A new balanced ownership and governanceThe combined entity will have a balanced ownership structure with a substantial free float alongside anchor public shareholders and supportive private investors.The Board of Directors of the combined group would consist of 15 members including ten independent directors. Seven directors  in addition to the CEO of Eutelsat  would be proposed by Eutelsat and its key shareholders and seven directors would be proposed by OneWeb and its key shareholders (the number of directors proposed by each of key Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders being commensurate to their shareholding in Eutelsat post transaction).It is contemplated that  post-closing  a shareholder agreement between Eutelsat key shareholders and OneWeb key shareholders which does not qualify as a concerted action be in place. It would in substance provide for the right for each party to propose 1 director (if its shareholding is at least 7.5%) and 2 directors (if its shareholding is at least 15%)  as well as a 6-month lock up period.Dominique D’Hinnin would be proposed as Chairman of the combined entity and Sunil Bharti Mittal as Co-Chairman (Vice-Président). Eva Berneke would continue as CEO of the combined entity.Indicative timetable and next stepsThe Memorandum of Understanding has been unanimously approved by each of Eutelsat’s and OneWeb’s board of directors and the envisaged transaction is fully supported by both parties’ long-term investors  namely Bpifrance  Fonds Stratégique de Participations  Bharti  HMG  SoftBank and Hanwha. CMA CGM  a shareholder of Eutelsat  is also supporting the proposed combination. It will be submitted to the French Eutelsat Works Council information and consultation process.The Memorandum of Understanding provides for customary exclusivity commitments by Eutelsat and key Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders.The transaction will be subject to clearance from relevant regulatory authorities.The transaction will also be conditional on approval by Eutelsat’s shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of Eutelsat  to take place by end of first half 2023. Bpifrance and Fonds Stratégique de Participations have undertaken to vote in favour of the transaction-related resolutions at this EGM  subject to usual conditions.The transaction is expected to close by the end of first half of 2023.AdvisorsEutelsat is assisted by d’Angelin & Co.

The Board of Directors of the Company  which met on the same day  decided to implement the share consolidation.Watch the video of Stéphane Le Roux  CEO of Spineway click hereImplementation of the share consolidationAt its meeting of July 25  2022  the Spineway Board of Directors decided to implement the reverse stock split of Spineway's share capital approved by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of July 25  2022 under the terms of its first resolution  at the rate of one (1) new share to be issued for forty thousand (40 000) existing shares to be consolidated. Taking into account the exchange parity retained  as a result of the consolidation  the number of outstanding shares will be divided by forty thousand (40 000). The par value of the Spineway share will be increased in proportion to the consolidation ratio and will increase from a ten thousandth (0.0001) of euro to four (4) euros.The purpose of this consolidation is to reduce the volatility of Spineway's share price  promote its stabilization and thus better reflect the Group's development prospects.This consolidation has no impact on the amount of share capital  only the par value of the share and  concomitantly  the number of shares in circulation are modified.The consolidation is therefore a purely technical adjustment  with no direct impact on the total value of the Spineway shares held by each shareholder. The mnemonic code (ALSPW) will remain unchanged. However  the ISIN code of the new SPINEWAY shares (post consolidation) will become FR001400BVK2.Story continuesGrouping methodsAll the terms and conditions of the business combination were approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting of July 25  2022 and are detailed in the notice of business combination which will be published in the Bulletin des Annonces Légales Obligatoires (BALO) on July 29  2022.The main terms are as follows:Basis of consolidation: exchange of forty thousand (40 000) existing shares with a par value of a ten thousandth (0.0001) of euro for one (1) new share with a par value of four (4) euros.Number of shares subject to the reverse split: all the shares comprising the capital of Spineway  i.e. twenty-three billion four hundred seventy-three million nine hundred twenty-one thousand and eight hundred seventy-four (23 473 921 874) shares.The number of shares subject to and to result from the reverse split will be increased  as the case may be  by the shares issued following the exercise of the rights of the beneficiaries of any securities giving access to the Company's share capital  or by the shares that would be issued as from the date of this notice.Number of post-consolidation shares: five hundred eighty-six thousand and eight hundred forty-eight (586 848) shares with a par value of four (4) euros each.Start date of the business combination: August 16  2022 .Effective date of the combination: September 14  2022 .Each shareholder will be automatically allocated  by his financial intermediary  one (1) new share for forty thousand (40 000) old shares held. The shareholders holding a number of shares multiple of forty thousand (40 000) will thus have no steps to take.Shareholders who do not hold a number of existing shares corresponding to a whole number of new shares must personally purchase or sell the fractional shares between August 16  2022 and September 14  2022 inclusive  in order to obtain a number of shares multiple of forty thousand (40 000).After this period  the new shares which could not be allotted individually and corresponding to fractional rights will be sold on the stock exchange by the account holder within 30 days from September 14  2022  in accordance with the provisions of articles L.228-6-1 and R.228-12 of the French Commercial Code and with market practice.

The PRIMAvera study aims to confirm the safety and clinical benefits provided by the Prima System and is the last clinical step before seeking market approval in Europe. The study was initiated in Q4 2020 in France where the first patient was implanted in March 2021. Pixium Vision has since established additional clinical sites and implanted patients in Germany as well as the UK and anticipates recruitment will be completed by the end of 2022 leading to a read-out of the PRIMAvera study primary endpoints around the end of 2023.""The PRIMAvera study has been making impressive progress with the implantation of patients in new clinical sites across Europe and we are very pleased to be joining these efforts to help bring the benefits of the innovative Prima System to those suffering from dry AMD "" said Dr. Koen van Overdam  Consultant Ophthalmologist and Vitreoretinal Surgeon at the Rotterdam Eye Hospital. ""The potential of the technology and the relative ease with which the small wireless implant can be surgically placed under the macula offer a real chance for patients who lost vision due to dry AMD and we look forward to contributing further to the PRIMAvera study.""Story continuesThe PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in the French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System.A total of 38 patients will be enrolled in the PRIMAvera study  an open-label  baseline-controlled  non-randomized  multi-center  prospective  single-arm pivotal trial. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline after 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

From February to June  retailer sales continued to improve strongly in line with the second half of 2021 with a sequential monthly acceleration  supported by the end of health restrictions and the economic rebound  reaching 92% of 2019 levels in February and March and up to 101% in the second quarter.Similarly  footfall continued to improve to reach the highest level since 2021 at c.90% of 2019 levels in May and June (10 percentage points better than in second-half 2021). High transformation rates and average basket sizes once again drove the increase in retailer sales.In all geographies  retailer sales and footfall were on a steady upwards trend from February to June.By segment  fashion confirmed its recovery over the first half and posted one of the strongest rebounds in the second quarter. Culture  gifts & leisure together with health & beauty experienced a sustained increase over the second quarter  with performances respectively above and on a par with 2019 levels. Household equipment continued to outperform over the first half. Lastly  food & beverage has posted solid rises since the beginning of the year with also a sharp acceleration between the first and second quarters.Leasing updateKlépierre recorded a dynamic first half in terms of leasing with 699 leases signed  including 516 renewals and re-lettings at an average 2.7% positive rental reversion. Strong retailer demand for Klépierre’s malls contributed to maintaining a high occupancy rate at 94.7%  up 50 basis points over one year with a sustained occupancy cost ratio of 12.4% (down 20 basis points over 6 months).Across its portfolio  Klépierre continued to adapt its mix  prioritizing the expansion of omnichannel retailers that are better suited to evolving consumer expectations. This translated into a sustained deal flow with banners such as Inditex (9 leases)  H&M (6 leases)  Calzedonia (17 leases)  Nike (3 leases)  Mango (1 lease)  Rituals (2 leases) and Pandora (2 leases). Greater emphasis has also been placed on dynamic segments like sports. Sneakers group Deichmann unveiled seven stores in Italy  Sweden and Spain  while JD Sports signed leases for the expansion of two stores in France and Italy. In addition  the Group signed an important deal for the opening of the first Nike stores in its Scandinavian malls at Emporia (Malmö  Sweden) and Bruun’s Galleri (Aarhus  Denmark). Lastly  the sportswear specialist  4F  and the Danish retailer  Hummel  joined malls in Poland and Denmark  respectively  while Adidas is set to unveil a brand-new boutique in Arcades (Paris region  France) in the second half of 2022.Convinced by the quality of the locations offered by the Group  a host of newcomers and on-trend concepts also chose Klépierre as part of their growth strategy. Jimmy Fairly  the hip eyewear specialist  is set to unveil its new flagship in France in the coming months  while the Chinese online retail platform  AliExpress  launched an offline concept in Spain in April. Likewise  household equipment specialist Tefal signed up for its first stores in Klépierre’s portfolio in France and Sweden  while several contracts were signed with Danish brand Flying Tiger Copenhagen  lifestyle brand Miniso and Chinese retailer Xiaomi. Leasing activity was also dense within the popular value retail segment  with the opening of new stores for Normal  Pepco  Xenos or HalfPrice. Lastly  with the normalization of the health situation  the Group also resumed its specialty leasing activities – especially pop-up stores – welcoming brands including Izipizi  Devialet  Jean-Paul Gaultier  Havaianas  Bons Baisers de Paname and Thermomix  all of which contributed to rejuvenating the retail offering and boosting footfall and sales in numerous shopping centers.Rent collectionAs of July 18  2022  Klépierre had collected 95% of invoiced rents and charges (96% collected for the first quarter). The Group is on track to achieve a collection rate of at least 96.7% for first-half 2022  only 1.7 percentage points below the 5-year average pre-pandemic level.Collection rates for 2020 and 2021 continued to improve  leading to additional income (reversal of provisions) in first-half 2022 for €38 million (one-off item).Net rental incomeNet rental income amounted to €501.3 million  up 56.4% on a reported basis  with the increase mainly attributable to lower rent abatements and provisions for credit losses  and higher variable revenue and other income for an aggregate amount of €197 million.On a like-for-like basis  net rental income increased by 66.7%.NET CURRENT CASH FLOWOver the first half of 2022  net current cash flow amounted to €428 million (total share)  or €1.32 per share  of which €0.12 relates to higher than anticipated rents collection for 2020 and 2021.Compared to the same period last year  the €0.60 per share improvement in net current cash flow(6) is mainly attributable to net rental income (€0.64) and a lower cost of debt (€0.02)  partially offset by higher current tax expenses (-€0.05).PORTFOLIO VALUE AND EPRA NET TANGIBLE ASSETS (NTA)Klépierre’s total portfolio value stood at €20 577 million(7) on a total share basis as of June 30  2022  up 0.8% like-for-like over 12 months and up 0.3% over 6 months. Overall  as of June 30  2022  the average EPRA Net Initial Yield for the shopping center portfolio stood at 5.2%  flat compared to December 31  2021.EPRA NTA(5) per share amounted to €30.60 compared to €31.20 as of December 2021. This slight decrease mainly reflected the payment in a single installment of the €1.70 per share distribution  partly offset by the 6-month cash flow (€1.32 per share). The increase in the like-for-like portfolio value had a positive impact of €0.28 per share  while foreign exchange and other items had a negative impact of €0.50 per share.DEBT AND FINANCINGAs of June 30  2022  consolidated net debt amounts to €8 124 million  versus €8 006 million six months ago. Considering the disposals closed early July  notably the €290 million assets in Norway (see the “Disposals” section below)  net debt stood at €7 867 million. The gross debt has an average maturity of 6.5 years.As of June 30  2022  the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio stood at 39.5% (compared to 38.7% as of December 31  2021) and 38.8% factoring in the recent disposals early July. Net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at 8.6x while ICR was at 10.0x. The hedging profile(8) remains solid with 88% of net debt hedged at fixed rates in 2022  breaking down as 69% fixed-rate debt and payer swaps and 19% caps and with a weighted average maturity of 4.8 years.Klépierre’s liquidity position(9) stood at €2.3 billion (including €1.8 billion of committed credit facilities) and covers all the Group’s refinancing needs until the end of 2024.DEVELOPMENTS AND DISPOSALSInvestmentsIn the first half of 2022  the Group focused on its main committed development projects: the extension of Gran Reno in Bologna (Italy)  the refurbishment and extension of Grand Place in Grenoble (France) and the development of five Primark megastores (31 000 sq.m. total) in Italy and France with most set to open by the end of the year.Total capital expenditure in the first half of 2022 amounted to €90.9 million  of which €57.7 million in development projects and €23.7 million in maintenance and refurbishment  mainly.PipelineEarly July  Klépierre successfully inaugurated the extension of Gran Reno (Bologna  Italy)  on budget and with better rents than expected. This operation finalized the full makeover of this flagship shopping center and was 98% let at opening. Perfectly illustrating the Group’s operational strategy  the 16 700 sq.m. extension hosts an outstanding set of retailers such as Sephora  New Balance  JD Sports  the Inditex brands  H&M  Tommy Hilfiger and Primark  together with a new food destination area. The full makeover of Gran Reno delivered a 7.6% yield on cost.The refurbishment of Grand Place  the leading retail destination in Grenoble (France)  was delivered in March 2022 with new store signings including Vans and Lego. In addition  the first stone was laid on the construction of the 16 200 sq.m. extension in May 2022  with completion scheduled for the end of 2023. Pre-leasing is well on track  with 82% of projected net rental income signed (68%) or under advanced negotiations (14%).DisposalsSince January 1  2022  the Group has closed or signed disposals for a total consideration of €470 million(10) at an average yield of 6.0%(11) and prices in line with appraised values (-0.4%). €431 million were closed to date mainly including the disposal  on July 1  2022  of three Norwegian properties (€290 million) as well as a few portfolios of retail properties in France.ACT FOR GOOD ®Since the beginning of the year  Klépierre has pressed ahead with its Act for Good® policy based on three pillars: Act for the Planet  Act for Territories and Act for People. This strategy demonstrates Klépierre’s intention to reconcile the requirements of operational excellence with environmental  societal and social performance and has already been largely recognized by several non-financial rating agencies. Thanks to the outstanding work put in day-in  day-out by Klépierre teams’ in making shopping centers more efficient and ever more environmentally ambitious  GRESB  MSCI  SBTi and CDP  ranked the Group as the leader in its sector. Amid tight energy supply and higher associated costs  Klépierre is also actively engaged in reducing its power consumption while supporting retailers in the same aim.The Group and its employees have also been highly committed to providing support to the people in Ukraine since the outbreak of war on February 24  2022. Klépierre’s teams promptly organized donations for refugees  and in our shopping centers in Europe  we also arranged for the collection of clothes  food and healthcare products from our retailers and visitors as well as from non-profits organizations. These were then shipped to Sadyba Best Mall in Warsaw (Poland) which became a logistics hub for the distribution of the donations to Ukraine.OUTLOOKFor 2022  the Group expects net current cash flow to reach at least €2.45 per share(2)  a 5.4% increase compared to the midpoint of the initial guidance.This updated guidance assumes that business operations are not impacted in H2 2022 by new Covid-related disruptions on our clients’ operations or by any major deterioration in the geopolitical situation. It does include disposals closed to date and a €0.12 profit per share booked in H1 2022 relating to higher rent collection for 2020 and 2021.RETAILER SALES AND FOOTFALL VERSUS 2019(A)Retailer sales Footfall January 2022 83% 78% February 2022 94% 83% March 2022 91% 82% April 2022 101% 85% May 2022 105% 90% June 2022 99% 89%(a) Change on a same store basis  excluding the impact of asset sales and acquisitions.TOTAL REVENUESIn millions of eurosTotal share Group share H1 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 H1 2021 France 226.8 144.1 185.4 117.4 Italy 107.2 76.4 106.0 75.6 Scandinavia 75.9 85.2 42.6 47.8 Iberia 63.0 53.9 63.0 53.9 Netherlands & Germany 53.8 43.6 53.2 42.8 Central Europe 32.2 29.9 32.2 29.9 Other countries 7.5 6.2 6.8 5.7 SHOPPING CENTER GROSS RENTAL INCOME 566.4 439.3 489.2 373.1 Other retail properties 10.9 5.1 10.9 5.1 TOTAL GROSS RENTAL INCOME 577.3 444.3 500.1 378.2 Management and development fees 36.5 31.1 35.1 29.3 TOTAL REVENUES 613.8 475.4 535.2 407.5 Equity-accounted companies* 41.2 30.9 39.7 29.1* Contributions from equity-accounted investees include investments in jointly controlled companies and investments in companies under significant influence.QUARTERLY NET RENTAL INCOME ON A TOTAL SHARE BASISH1 2022 2021 In millions of euros Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 France 119.0 79.2 109.5 100.1 43.6 45.6 Italy 53.1 45.5 70.5 48.2 36.1 22.9 Scandinavia 32.3 32.8 31.6 33.9 50.5 23.4 Iberia 29.8 27.4 29.9 33.5 22.9 19.8 Netherlands & Germany 22.9 14.1 23.8 28.8 23.1 3.8 Central Europe 12.7 17.4 12.5 18.7 10.4 9.6 Other countries 2.9 1.4 3.7 2.9 1.9 2.3 SHOPPING CENTERSNET RENTAL INCOME 272.5 217.8 281.5 266.0 188.5 127.3 Other retail properties 7.2 3.8 5.3 6.1 2.5 2.2 TOTAL NET RENTAL INCOME 279.8 221.5 286.8 272.1 191.0 129.6NET CURRENT CASH FLOWH1 2022 H1 2021 Change (Total share  in millions of euros) Gross rental income 577.3 444.3 +29.9% Rental and building expenses (76.0) (123.8) -38.6% Net rental income 501.3 320.6 +56.4% Management and other income 42.0 35.7 +17.6% General and administrative expenses (76.7) (71.4) +7.5% EBITDA 466.6 284.9 +63.8% Adjustments to calculate operating cash flow: Depreciation charge for right-of use assets(a) (4.0) (4.2) Employee benefits  stock option expense and non-current operating expenses/income (1.9) 0.0 IFRIC 21 impact 7.7 8.2 Operating cash flow 468.4 288.9 +62.1% Cost of net debt (58.1) (58.2) -0.2% Adjustments to calculate net current cash flow before taxes: Amortization of Corio debt mark-to-market (0.4) (1.9) Financial instrument close-out costs 6.8 1.7 Current cash flow before taxes 416.7 230.5 +80.8% Share in earnings of equity-accounted companies 28.5 17.6 +62.6% Current tax expense (17.6) 0.1 n.m.

Two still strongly diverging trends  with a +66.7% increase to €327.7 million for the refurbished vehicle segment  and a -65.7% contraction to €46.1 million for the pre-registered vehicle segment. The volumes of refurbished vehicles sold climbed +28.0%  with a further increase in the percentage of vehicles sourced from private owners  which now stands at 62%Growth driven by continued very high customer satisfaction (NPS of 69 at end-June 2022)  highlighting Aramis Group’s effective management of its competitive advantages and its teams’ constant commitment to ensuring the best products and servicesContinued rollout of the strategy  with the acquisition  subject to minor conditions precedent  of Onlinecars  the Austrian market leader for refurbished vehicle sales  and the inauguration of the second refurbishing center in France  in Saint-Pierre-Lès-NemoursMarket environment that remains uncertain  with sourcing difficulties and a certain wait-and-see attitude among consumers.

This performance is particularly notable as the automotive market continued to deteriorate over the period  becoming more volatile and uncertain. Alongside the pre-registered vehicle segment  which might not have reached its low point yet due to the major sourcing difficulties seen  the refurbished vehicle segment faces an increasingly wait-and-see attitude among consumers. In response to this market environment  Aramis Group is ensuring that its offering is appropriate and is working to protect its balance sheet and profitability. With its 21-year track record  a business model that has proven its resilience during previous crises  and the strategic and financial support of its majority shareholder Stellantis  it is approaching this cycle low with confidence. Aramis Group is moving forward with its strategy  continuing to ramp up its refurbishing capacities and pursue robust external growth  and is effectively positioned to capitalize on all the opportunities that will enable it to further consolidate its leadership in Europe for online refurbished vehicle sales”.2022 THIRD-QUARTER ACTIVITYDuring the third quarter of 2022  ended June 30  the Group recorded revenues of €458.0 million  up +20.1% from the third quarter of 2021.The automotive market became more complex over the period. On the refurbished vehicle segment  the Group’s strategic priority  which represented 89% of its B2C volumes in the third quarter of 2022  a certain wait-and-see approach among consumers has been seen over the past few weeks. On the pre-registered vehicle segment  the negative trend has accelerated  while the sourcing of this type of vehicle has become very complicated due to the continued shortage of new vehicles against a backdrop of persistent supply chain disruption (semiconductors  war in Ukraine  Covid-19).Overview of volumes and revenues2022 third-quarter B2C volumesIn units On a reported basis On a pro forma basis On a reported basis Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % Refurbished 18 357 14 346 +28.0% 51 742 35 763 +44.7% 51 742 29 914 +73.0% Pre-registered 2 232 8 851 -74.8% 10 064 23 055 -56.3% 10 064 23 055 -56.3% Total B2C volumes 20 589 23 197 -11.2% 61 806 58 818 +5.1% 61 806 52 969 +16.7%2022 third-quarter revenuesBy segmentIn million € On a reported basis On a pro forma basis On a reported basis Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % Refurbished 327.7 196.6 +66.7% 902.7 498.0 +81.2% 902.7 418.4 +115.8% Pre-registered 46.1 134.4 -65.7% 197.4 342.4 -42.4% 197.4 342.4 -42.4% Total B2C 373.7 331.0 +12.9% 1 100.1 840.5 +30.9% 1 100.1 760.7 +44.6% Total B2B 61.1 30.9 +97.7% 160.6 81.4 +97.5% 160.6 67.3 +138.7% Total Services 23.1 19.3 +19.5% 69.8 51.2 +36.3% 69.8 44.1 +58.3% Revenues 458.0 381.2 +20.1% 1 330.6 973.0 +36.7% 1 330.6 872.2 +52.6%By countryIn million € On a reported basis On a pro forma basis On a reported basis Q3 2022 Q3 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % 9M 2022 9M 2021 Change % France 196.6 194.9 +0.9% 555.9 496.9 +11.9% 555.9 496.9 +11.9% Belgium 62.3 53.5 +16.4% 178.7 140.5 +27.3% 178.7 140.4 +27.3% Spain 86.7 57.8 +50.0% 273.7 136.4 +100.7% 273.7 136.4 +100.7% United Kingdom 112.3 75.0 +49.7% 322.3 199.4 +61.6% 322.3 98.6 +227.0% Revenues 458.0 381.2 +20.1% 1 330.6 973.0 +36.7% 1 330.6 872.2 +52.6%Analysis of revenues by segmentB2C – sales of cars to private customers (82% of revenues)Revenues for the B2C segment – corresponding to sales of refurbished and pre-registered cars to private customers – totaled €373.7 million in the third quarter of 2022  up +12.9% from the third quarter of 2021.Revenues for the refurbished cars segment came to €327.7 million  with +66.7% growth versus the third quarter of 2021. 18 357 vehicles were delivered  up +28.0%  a robust level despite the used vehicle market slowdown. To be able to continue guaranteeing a wide selection of vehicles and the best level of customer satisfaction  Aramis Group has continued to ramp up its in-house refurbishing capacities  thanks in particular to the opening of a new center in France in Saint-Pierre-Lès-Nemours  south of the Paris Region. This site  which will complement the longstanding Donzère site located in the south of France  will make it possible to manage the Group’s delivery times  logistics costs and carbon footprint more effectively.Revenues for the pre-registered cars segment came to €46.1 million  down -65.7% from the third quarter of 2021. Sourcing conditions saw a further deterioration during the quarter due to the limited progress recorded on the normalization of new car production. As a result  only 2 232 units were able to be sold during the third quarter of 2022  which is -74.8% lower than the same period in 2021.B2B – sales of cars to professional customers (13% of revenues)Revenues for the B2B segment climbed to €61.1 million  driven by very strong growth of +97.7% compared with the third quarter of 2021. This growth is a result of the increased sourcing of vehicles from private owners  some of which are resold to professionals (mainly vehicles over eight years old or 150 000 km).Services (5% of revenues)Lastly  services generated €23.1 million of revenues  up +19.5% compared with the third quarter of 2021. Financing solutions penetration rate increased in France and fell somewhat in the United Kingdom in a context of rising interest rates. On average across the Group  the penetration rate continued to rise and is now close to 50%.Acquisition of Onlinecars in AustriaLast June  Aramis Group announced the acquisition  subject to minor conditions precedent  particularly concerning antitrust aspects  to acquire all the capital of Onlinecars  the Austrian market leader for refurbished vehicle sales  with more than 10 000 used vehicles sold in 2021  revenues of over €200 million and an EBITDA margin of over 3%.The acquisition of Onlinecars will open up a number of operational synergies with Aramis Group and extensive opportunities for sharing experience  as achieved with the Group’s previous acquisitions. Aramis Group will enable in particular Onlinecars to benefit from its industrial flow management and refurbishing process optimization expertise  as well as its know-how and the tools from its technological and data platform. Alongside this  Onlinecars will help consolidate the major network of suppliers and brands built up by Aramis Group  which represents one of its many competitive advantages.The transaction is fully financed through an increase in Aramis Group’s credit lines with Stellantis  which willcontinue to be a powerful support to Aramis Group's development  accompanying its strategic internationalexpansion.OUTLOOKIn a volatile market  Aramis Group is adopting its product and service offering  accelerating inventory rotation and keeping its cost structure under control  to protect its balance sheet and profitability.Over the coming quarters  the Group expects:Its sales volumes on the pre-registered vehicle segment to remain very low;Its sales volumes on the refurbished vehicle segment to continue growing  driven by the underlying market trends (including the essential positioning of vehicle-based mobility and the digital transformation underway for the distribution of cars)  independently from the potential deferral of certain purchases by households;Sales prices to remain high  although they are stabilizing in the third quarter of 2022;The gross profit per unit (GPU) to contract  decreasing in the second half of 2022 to an average level around -10% below that achieved in the first half of 2022 (€2 311 as a reminder)  before stabilizing at around €2 150 per unit on average  in line with the objectives communicated at the time of its IPO.2022 full-year objectives are adjusted as follows:Revenues of over €1.7 billion (unchanged);Growth of around +40% in refurbished vehicle volumes (vs. over +45% previously);Negative adjusted EBITDA between -€10 and -€12 million (vs. positive figure previously).These objectives are on a like-for-like basis  i.e. they do not include the impact of Onlinecars  which will be consolidated from the start of the Group’s next fiscal year2.***Next financial information:2022 full-year results: December 1  2022 (after market close)About Aramis GroupAramis Group is the leading European B2C platform for online used car sales  operating the Aramisauto  Cardoen  Clicars and CarSupermarket brands  in France  Belgium  Spain and the UK respectively.

Fuel prices surged  in a context of post-COVID economic recovery combined with a decline in supply since the onset of the conflict in Ukraine. Excluding the impact of fuel prices  revenue is stable (+1 %). The half-year was characterised by the good availability of the facilities and the maintenance shutdowns were carried out under very good conditions.Story continuesThe availability rate was 90.1% in the first half of 2022  compared with 87.5% in the first half of 2021; power generation from thermal facilities reached 740 GWh  compared with 952 GWh in the first half of 2021  reflecting the sharp decline in call rates by EDF on Reunion Island in particular  in connection with the high prices of coal and CO 2 .EBITDA for the period came to €81.7 million  slightly up on the €80.3 million of the first half of 2021.Construction and development of projectsWork continues on converting Albioma’s Bois-Rouge power station to 100% biomassThe conversion of the Bois-Rouge power plant to 100% biomass moved ahead smoothly in the half year. Tranche 3 is scheduled to be restarted at the end of the year  operating with 100% biomass.Green light for the conversion of the Albioma Le Gol plant to 100% biomassNew riders were signed with EDF after a favourable opinion from the French energy regulator (Commission de Régulation de l’Énergie) on 24 February 2022  validating the rider to the power purchase agreement and establishing the cost of the complete project to convert Albioma’s Le Gol power plant on Reunion Island to biomass as well as the extension of its operation to 2044. At the same time  additional financing was secured on 18 May 2022  allowing preparatory work to be launched during the first half of the year.The Group continues to develop its projects  focusing particularly give up coal in the overseas territories over the course of the next few years.Solar powerStable production and commissioning of new facilitiesDespite highly adverse sunshine conditions  particularly in French Guiana  performances of the photovoltaic plants were stable in the first half of 2022. Production of photovoltaic electricity in the period reached 60 GWh.EBITDA for the first half of 2022 came to €15.3 million  slightly down on the first half of 2021 (€16.4 million). This performance integrates the downward revision of tariffs for solar power purchase agreements concluded between 2006 and 2010. Discussions are underway with the Energy Regulation Commission (CRE) in the context of the safeguard clause for two plants.New facilities were commissioned  mainly in France and Mayotte.BrazilThermal biomassProduction down in the first half yearProduction was down  at 156 GWh  for the period  compared with 228 GWh in the first half of 2021. This decrease is the result of a technical incident that led to a shutdown of the Esplanada power plant in May and a shortened 2021 inter-campaign for the Vale Do Parana power plant  which operated exceptionally in January and February 2021 in order to use the stock of bagasse accumulated before its commissioning.The macro-economic situation was marked by the appreciation of the real/euro exchange rate during the first half of the year and the increase in financing costs. Electricity prices on the spot market are at a low level due to the high rainfall observed during the half-year.EBITDA totalled €1.2 million for the period  as against €3.3 million in the first half of 2021.TurkeyGeothermal energyImprovement in yields and acquisition of a second unitThe Gümüskoÿ power plant performed well during the half-year. Production reached 25 GWh  up by more than 30% compared with the same period of last year  thanks to the optimisation works carried out in 2021.On 14 February 2022  the Group completed the acquisition of a second geothermal power plant (Kuyucak) in Turkey  becoming its sole shareholder. Commissioned in late 2017  this plant  with a gross installed capacity of 18 MW  operates under a licence valid until 2042  with scope to extend for an additional 10-year period. It produces electricity from five production wells for a net exported production at the end of 2021 of 83 GWh. The plant benefits from a dollarised feed-in tariff of around USD 118/MWh until the end of 2022 and a tariff of USD 105/MWh between 2023 and 2027. Production amounted to 49 GWh in the half-year.EBITDA reached €5.3 million for the period  as against €1.0 million in the first half of 2021.The acquisition of this second plant strengthens Albioma's entry into the geothermal business. The Group will benefit from the synergies between the neighbouring Gümüşköy and Kuyucak plants and will be able to capitalise on the teams’ expertise to roll it out in new regions.Friendly takeover offer initiated by KKRFollowing the receipt of all required regulatory approvals  the takeover offer for Albioma shares and BSAAR warrants initiated by KKR earlier this year opened on 23 June 2022.The Offer was deemed compliant by the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des marchés financiers - AMF) on 21 June 2022 and all the documents relating to the operation have been made available to the public.

Sustained momentum for new contract wins in largely underpenetrated markets   such as the SME markets in France and Germany   propelled by the deployment of carefully tailored sales channels   as notably demonstrated by the success of the online sales platforms now available in 14 countries. An ambitious ESG policy   with non-financial indicators in line with the 2022-2030 targets. Solutions contributing to a better world   as illustrated by the new global Move for Good program designed to accompany fleet and mobility clients on their green transition.Edenred is better poised than ever to generate sustainable and profitable growth in a new macro-economic contextDrawing on its strong sales momentum and a platform that is ever-more attractive thanks to technology investments  Edenred is ready to capture opportunities from structural trends  such as more widespread digitalization and radical changes in the working world.Edenred should also benefit from a favorable macro-economic context  with rising inflation making its solutions even more attractive and driving additional revenue for the Group  notably due to higher interest rates.In view of these factors  the Group is targeting record-high EBITDA of between €770 million and €820 million for full-year 20221  versus €670 million in 2021.***Bertrand Dumazy  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Edenred  said: “Thanks to very tangible growth momentum in the second quarter  Edenred delivered a record performance in the first half of 2022  with a strong increase in earnings. Operating revenue grew by double digits across all of the Group’s business lines and regions  and EBITDA came in at an all-time high for a first half. These results show how Edenred is leveraging the unique benefits of its digital platform to continue its market penetration in a new macro-economic environment. The solutions the Group offers are attracting more and more clients who view them as an opportunity to increase their employees’ purchasing power  encourage more responsible behaviors or tighten their cost control. Edenred is now better poised than ever to pursue its sustainable and profitable growth trajectory in the second half of the year and beyond. The Group is continuing to step up its technology investments  which have made it the leading innovator in its markets. In light of these achievements  we are confident in our prospects for the second half of 2022 and are targeting record-high EBITDA of between €770 million and €820 million for the full year.”Turkey is now qualified as a hyperinflationary economy. The Group has therefore applied IAS 29 – Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies to its operations in this country since January 1  2022.FIRST-HALF 2022 RESULTSAt its meeting on July 25  2022  the Board of Directors reviewed the Group’s interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30  2022.First-half 2022 key financial metrics:(in € millions) First-half 2022 First-half 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Operating revenue 891 736 +20.9% +17.3% Other revenue (A) 31 21 +49.1% +46.5% Total revenue 922 757 +21.7% +18.1% EBITDA 365 295 +23.6% +22.0% Operating EBIT (B) 264 211 +25.2% +24.3% EBIT (A + B) 295 232 +27.3% +26.3% Net profit  Group share 170 133 +27.5%Total revenue of €922 millionTotal revenue for first-half 2022 amounted to €922 million  up 21.7% as reported compared with first-half 2021. This year-on-year increase includes a favorable 4.0% currency effect and a slightly negative 0.4% scope effect. On a like-for-like basis  total revenue was up 18.1%.In the second quarter  total revenue rose by 25.7% as reported and by 20.4% like-for-like  with growth accelerating versus the first quarter of the year  when total revenue increased by 17.6% as reported and by 15.7% like-for-like.Operating revenue: €891 millionOperating revenue for the first six months of 2022 came to €891 million  up 20.9% as reported. The currency effect was a favorable 4.1% and the scope effect was a slightly negative 0.5%. On a like-for-like basis  the increase in operating revenue was 17.3% year on year.Second-quarter operating revenue totaled €465 million  up 24.5% as reported and 19.2% like-for-like.This solid performance came on the back of an excellent start to the year and strong growth in operating revenue during the first quarter. It clearly shows the Group’s ability to keep up a sustained pace of growth  with double-digit growth figures recorded across all of its business lines and regions. By fully leveraging its digital platform  the Group has continued to penetrate its markets by capitalizing on its stand-out technology assets and sales expertise. For example  thanks to the online sales platforms it has developed in 14 countries  the Group saw a more-than 50% increase in the number of new contracts it won with SMEs in the first half of 2022 versus the first six months of 2021.Edenred’s first-half 2022 performance was also boosted by a favorable macro-economic environment  notably the current high rates of inflation. This has made the Group’s solutions even more attractive  as clients see them as a way of increasing their employees’ purchasing power  through the Employee Benefits offering  and tightening control of their fleet management costs  through Fleet & Mobility Solutions.Operating revenue by business line(in € millions) First-half 2022 First-half 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 528 448 +17.7% +15.7% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 252 190 +32.3% +24.0% Complementary Solutions 111 98 +13.6% +11.4% Total 891 736 +20.9% +17.3%The Employee Benefits business line generated €528 million in operating revenue in first-half 2022  representing an increase of 17.7% as reported (+15.7% like-for-like) and accounting for 59% of the consolidated total.The Group continued to penetrate its markets during the period  fueled by strong sales activity  both with key accounts and in the particularly fast-growing SME segment. Drawing on a broader portfolio of solutions resulting from its Beyond Food strategy  and amid radical changes in the working world  Edenred is fully meeting the needs of its clients  who are seeking to strengthen their employer brand and employee engagement. In France  for example  the Group has a comprehensive range of digital solutions for food  incentives and mobility  with 7 million employees benefiting from them. These solutions provide employers with an effective means to boost each employee’s purchasing power by up to €5 000 per year  while adapting to new consumption patterns  which have become more digital and more responsible.This momentum has led to an increase in the benefits granted to employees  particularly in countries where the public authorities have raised the statutory maximum face value of benefits  such as in Romania and Turkey for meal benefits.In the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business line  which accounted for 28% of the Group’s business  operating revenue came to €252 million in the first half of the year  up 32.3% as reported over the period (+24.0% like-for-like).This strong year-on-year growth reflects brisk sales momentum  especially in the vastly underpenetrated SME segment. It also reflects the successful deployment of the Beyond Fuel strategy  notably through the maintenance management solution in Latin America. Thanks to this fully digital offering  with a broad portfolio of services such as dashboards  customized maintenance plans and dedicated mobile apps  Edenred provides a first-class user experience for fleet managers  drivers and repair shops in the network. In light of the success of this offering in Brazil (more than 400 000 vehicles managed and orders up by over 20% in the first half of 2022)  Edenred has begun to roll it out to Mexico and Argentina as well.The Complementary Solutions business line  which includes Corporate Payment Services  Incentive & Rewards and Public Social Programs  generated operating revenue of €111 million in first-half 2022  representing 13% of the Group total. This figure was up 13.6% year on year as reported (+11.4% like-for-like)  despite a high basis of comparison for the first quarter due to the specific earmarked funds programs set up during the first quarter of 2021 amid the health crisis.Growth for this business line reflects the good performance of Corporate Payment Services in North America  operated through CSI  driven by new contracts won through its direct and indirect sales channels  and the continued recovery in sales volumes generated by clients in the media and hospitality segments.The sharp rise in Complementary Services operating revenue is also the result of Edenred’s ability to develop new value-added services for its stakeholders  such as in the United Arab Emirates  where the salary advance offering is meeting the growing needs of the 500 000 users of the C3Pay mobile app.Operating revenue by region(in € millions) First-half 2022 First-half 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 551 475 +16.0% +15.7% Latin America 270 204 +32.5% +16.9% Rest of the World 70 58 +20.5% +31.3% Total 891 736 +20.9% +17.3%In Europe   operating revenue amounted to €551 million in first-half 2022  an increase of 16.0% as reported and of 15.7% like-for-like. In the second quarter  operating revenue was up 18.1% as reported and 18.0% like-for-like. Europe represented 62% of Group operating revenue.In France  operating revenue amounted to €150 million  representing an increase of 11.2% both as reported and like-for-like. In the second quarter  operating revenue growth was 12.2% as reported and like-for-like. This performance was notably led by robust growth for Employee Benefits solutions  fueled by contract wins for the Ticket Restaurant® offering – the market’s digital leader with a market share of over 40% – as well as the broader range of solutions integrated into the MyEdenred mobile app. Fleet & Mobility Solutions also drove up operating revenue  propelled by ongoing high demand  notably in the SME segment.Operating revenue in Europe excluding France totaled €401 million in first-half 2022  up 17.8% as reported (+17.5% like-for-like). Second-quarter operating revenue rose by 20.3% as reported (+20.2% like-for-like). This sustained growth is the result of the growing attractiveness of the solutions offered by the Group in its various business lines. In Employee Benefits  Ticket Restaurant® meal benefits once again delivered robust growth  boosted by an increase in face values introduced by clients in the current inflationary context  and the Beyond Food strategy continued to be a success. Performance for the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business line was driven by strong sales momentum in the SME segment.Operating revenue in Latin America amounted to €270 million  up 32.5% as reported in the first half (+16.9% like-for-like)  with a 38.0% reported increase in the second quarter (+17.2% like-for-like). The region represented 30% of total consolidated operating revenue in first-half 2022.In Brazil  operating revenue growth came to 17.1% like-for-like in the first six months of the year  including a 17.7% increase in the second quarter. This robust year-on-year growth reflects the strong momentum of the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business  led notably by the success of the Beyond Fuel offering  which was underpinned by a sharp increase in demand for maintenance and toll management solutions. Employee Benefits also contributed to growth in Brazil  spurred by the ongoing success of the partnership with Itaú Unibanco and the rollout of the multi-benefit offering.In Hispanic Latin America  operating revenue rose by 16.4% like-for-like  with a 16.3% increase in the second quarter. The recovery in the Employee Benefits business continued in the region in the second quarter  while in Fleet & Mobility Solutions growth was driven by the gradual rollout of the Beyond Fuel offering with its toll solutions.In the Rest of the World   operating revenue amounted to €70 million  up 20.5% as reported and 31.3% like-for-like over the period. Second-quarter operating revenue rose by 26.9% as reported (+36.7% like-for-like).This performance was notably driven by the success of digital solutions proposed in countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. In North America  CSI’s Corporate Payment Services business saw strong sales momentum  notably buoyed by a recovery in volumes for its historical portfolio  as well as the ramp-up of distribution partnerships entered into with several banks.Other revenue: €31 millionFor the six months ended June 30  2022  other revenue came to €31 million  representing an increase of 49.1% as reported and of 46.5% like-for-like. This solid growth notably reflects the continued increase in float  resulting from the high level of business during the first half of the year. Other revenue also benefited from the rise in interest rates compared with first-half 2021  notably in Latin America and in European countries outside the euro zone.EBITDA: €365 millionIn first-half 2022  EBITDA amounted to €365 million  up 23.6% as reported and 22.0% like-for-like.The EBITDA margin came in at 39.6%  up 0.6 of a percentage point compared with first-half 2021. On a like-for-like basis  the EBITDA margin was 1.3 percentage points higher year on year  demonstrating Edenred’s ability to capitalize on its operating leverage while continuing to invest in technology and innovation to help drive the Group’s growth.Net profit: €170 millionNet profit  Group share amounted to €170 million versus €133 million in first-half 2021  a 27.5% increase primarily driven by growth in EBITDA.Net profit takes into account other income and expenses for a net expense of €9 million (versus a net expense of €7 million in first-half 2021)  a net financial expense of €17 million (versus €9 million in 2021)2  a net income tax expense of €84 million (versus €73 million in 2021)  and €(16) million attributable to non-controlling interests (versus €(14) million in 2021).Strong cash flow generationEdenred’s business model generates significant cash flows  delivering funds from operations before other income and expenses (FFO) of €299 million in first-half 2022  up 17.5% as reported.At June 30  2022  Edenred had net debt of €1.06 billion  versus €1.45 billion at end-June 2021. This sharp year-on-year decrease in net debt notably reflects free cash flow generation of €767 million over the twelve months ended June 30  2022  €269 million returned to shareholders  and a negative €45 million impact of currency effects and non-recurring items.Robust financial positionEdenred therefore enjoys a robust financial position with a high level of liquidity and a solid balance sheet. In April 2022  Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed the Group’s BBB+ Strong Investment Grade rating and upgraded its outlook from stable to positive.Ongoing commitment to ESG and non-financial performanceIn the first half of 2022  Edenred continued to put its commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) into practice.One of the ways it does this is by deploying solutions that encourage more responsible behaviors. For example  in June  the Group launched “Move for Good”  a global green and sustainable mobility program for its clients in the transportation and mobility sector  which is based on four pillars: awareness  reduction and avoidance  offsetting  and preservation. Also  in the first half of the year  the Group rolled out its Agri digital solution in Cameroon to support local agriculture – serving 600 000 farmers – and broadened its range of value-added services that support financial inclusion in the United Arab Emirates  including a salary advance system.At the same time  the Group continued to implement its “Ideal” CSR policy through the policy’s three main components  “People  Planet and Progress”  and is well on the way to achieving its targets for 2030. In April  Edenred’s commitment to CSR was recognized once again  when it was assigned a rating of 79 out of 100 by S&P Global Ratings  well above the global average for the other companies assessed. This rating notably highlights how the Group’s ESG goals are underpinned by a strong corporate culture and effective strategic planning and decision-making processes.Edenred will further strengthen its CSR commitments  notably those related to the climate  at the Capital Markets Day to be held in October 2022.OUTLOOKIn the first half of 2022  Edenred once again proved its capacity to leverage the benefits of its digital platform  thanks to its ongoing strong sales and innovation momentum.In an environment accelerating new structural trends  such as increased digitalization among stakeholders (clients  partner merchants and users)  radical transformations in the working world and the beginning of a new era of greener mobility  Edenred is ideally positioned to seize the opportunities arising from these changes.At the same time  the Group expects to continue benefiting from a favorable macro-economic context that is further enhancing the attractiveness of its offerings. This can be seen both in Employee Benefits  against a backdrop of “talent wars” for employers and a desire by both governments and companies to protect workers’ purchasing power  and in Fleet & Mobility Solutions  where fleet managers are looking to tighten control over their expenses.Edenred is therefore better poised than ever to generate sustainable and profitable growth. The Group is targeting full-year EBITDA of between €770 million and €820 million3 for 2022  versus €670 million in 2021.In addition  Edenred has an investment capacity of between €1.5 billion and €2.0 billion to be able to carry out any external growth transactions.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAREdenred strengthens its toll offering in Brazil with the acquisition of GreenpassOn February 22  Edenred announced that it had acquired a 51% controlling interest in Greenpass  an issuer of electronic toll solutions in Brazil. The deal strengthens Edenred’s position in this business as well as its technology and sales capabilities in an attractive market offering significant cross-selling potential with its client base. It is fully in line with the Group’s Beyond Fuel strategy to develop new non-fuel fleet and mobility services  enhancing its value proposition for fleet managers and expanding its addressable market.UTA Edenred partners with ChargePointOn April 5  Edenred announced a partnership with ChargePoint  a leading electric vehicle charging network provider in Europe and in the USA. This partnership enables customers of UTA Edenred  a leading mobility service provider in Europe  to access over 240 000 public electric charge points across 32 European countries. Edenred supports fleet managers in the transition towards electric vehicle usage  notably through the introduction of an all-in-one  fully integrated solution that combines an electric vehicle charging solution with UTA Edenred’s proven energy  toll and maintenance services.Edenred launches “Move for Good”  a global program that accompanies its clients on their green transitionOn June 15  Edenred launched “Move for Good”  a global sustainability program enabling its transportation and mobility clients to mitigate their environmental impact  while promoting biodiversity preservation. Already operational in some European and Latin American countries  this program will be deployed by Edenred globally.UPCOMING EVENTSOctober 20  2022: Third-quarter 2022 revenueOctober 25  2022: Capital Markets Day in LondonAbout EdenredEdenred  the everyday companion for people at work  is a leading digital platform for services and payments which connects over 50 million users and 2 million partner merchants in 45 countries via approximately 900 000 corporate clients.Edenred offers specific-purpose payment solutions for food (such as meal benefits)  incentives (such as gift cards  employee engagement platforms)  mobility (such as multi-energy  maintenance  toll  parking and commuter solutions) and corporate payments (such as virtual cards).True to the Group’s purpose  “Enrich connections.

This indicator reflects the Group’s business performance.Changes in activity (like-for-like or organic growth) represent changes in amounts between the current period and the comparative period  adjusted for currency effects and for the impact of acquisitions and/or disposals.The impact of acquisitions is eliminated from the amount reported for the current period. The impact of disposals is eliminated from the amount reported for the comparative period. The sum of these two amounts is known as the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation or the scope effect.The calculation of changes in activity is translated at the exchange rate applicable in the comparative period and divided by the adjusted amount for the comparative period.The currency effect is the difference between the amount for the reported period translated at the exchange rate for the reported period and the amount for the reported period translated at the exchange rate applicable in the comparative period.Business volume:Business volume comprises total issue volume of Employee Benefits  Incentive and Rewards  Public Social Program solutions and Corporate Payment Services  plus the transaction volume of Fleet & Mobility Solutions and other solutions.Issue volume:Issue volume is the total face value of the funds preloaded on all of the payment solutions issued by Edenred to its corporate and public sector clients.Transaction volume:Transaction volume represents the total value of the transactions paid for with payment instruments  at the time of the transaction.b) Alternative performance measurement indicators included in the June 30  2022 Interim Financial ReportThe alternative performance measurement indicators outlined below are presented and reconciled with accounting data in the Annual Financial Report.Indicator Reference note in Edenred’s 2022 condensed interim consolidated financial statements Operating revenueOperating revenue corresponds to: operating revenue generated by prepaid vouchers managed by Edenred and operating revenue from value-added services such as incentive programs  human services and event-related services.It corresponds to the amount billed to the client company and is recognized on delivery of the solutions. Other revenueOther revenue is interest generated by investing cash over the period between:the issue date and the reimbursement date for vouchers and the loading date and the redeeming date for cards. The interest represents a component of operating revenue and as such is included in the determination of total revenue. EBITDAThis aggregate corresponds to total revenue (operating revenue and other revenue) less operating expenses. Operating EBITThis aggregate corresponds to EBIT adjusted for other revenue.As per the consolidated financial statements  operating EBIT as of June 30  2022 amounted to €264 million  comprising: plus €295 million in EBITminus €31 million in other revenue.

Raising non-IFRS diluted EPS target to 14%-16% growth to €1.08-€1.10Bernard Charlès  Dassault Systèmes’ Vice Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer commented:“The experience economy and the circular economy are converging: this will mark the coming decades. As we look to our next horizon  2040  industries will no longer develop products but sustainable and personalized experiences centered around the consumer  patient and citizen.The experience economy goes hand in hand with circularity as it requires designing the entire experience life cycle upstream  integrating use with end of life. Circularity is about frugality – using only what’s necessary – and appreciating all things created by humankind will have an end: the raw materials that compose them can be repurposed  reused and recycled. This will revolutionize design and open up significant new possibilities we can’t yet imagine.Story continuesScience-based virtual twin experiences  powered by 3DEXPERIENCE  are unparalleled catalysts and enablers of this global transformation. Based on a multi-scale  multi-physics approach and incorporating real world evidence  our virtual twin experiences empower clients to imagine new methods  new materials and test new solutions. By providing continuity across the WHAT  the HOW and the USE  innovators can anticipate the recycling of products from their design and manufacturing to quantify the environmental impacts and optimize circularity.IFWE utilize the power of the virtual world to improve the real world  we can advance our purpose – to harmonize product  nature and life.”Financial SummaryIn millions of Euros except per share data and percentagesIFRS IFRS Q2 2022 Q2 2021 Change Change in constant currencies YTD 2022 YTD 2021 Change Change in constant currencies Total Revenue 1 383.9 1 160.8 19% 11% 2 708.5 2 333.7 16% 10% Software Revenue 1 250.1 1 050.7 19% 11% 2 455.6 2 118.5 16% 10% Operating Margin 22.5% 20.1% +2.4pts 23.9% 19.9% +4.0pts Diluted EPS * 0.09 0.14 (32)% 0.29 0.27 9%In millions of Euros except per share data and percentagesNon-IFRS Non-IFRS Q2 2022 Q2 2021 Change Change in constant currencies YTD 2022 YTD 2021 Change Change in constant currencies Total Revenue 1 384.0 1 161.5 19% 11% 2 708.6 2 335.1 16% 10% Software Revenue 1 250.2 1 051.3 19% 11% 2 455.8 2 119.7 16% 9% Operating Margin 32.0% 32.2% (0.2)pt 33.5% 33.0% +0.4pt Diluted EPS * 0.26 0.22 21% 11% 0.54 0.44 20% 13%* 2021 and 2022 figures have been presented in order to reflect the five-for-one share split on Dassault Systèmes’ share effected on July 7  2021Second Quarter 2022 Versus 2021 Financial Comparisons(unaudited  all revenue growth rates in constant currencies)Total Revenue: Total revenue grew 11%  IFRS and non-IFRS  to €1.38 billion.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2022  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within automotive  aerospace or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;current inflation forecasts  as well as uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of this trend  could adversely affect the financial condition of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and geopolitical crises in particular – could have consequences for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY130.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the third and fourth quarters 2022. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY132.2 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2022. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations. It is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for IFRS measurements.

We believe it is helpful to evaluate our growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in our business. Therefore  we provide percentage increases or decreases in our revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed by us “in constant currencies”  the results of the “prior” period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  we do believe these measures are critical to understanding our global revenue results and to compare with many of our competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  we are including this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods as well as for comparing non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates are expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group’s scope  Dassault Systèmes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth. In order to do so  the data relating to the scope is restated excluding acquisitions  from the date of the transaction  over a period of 12 months.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Systèmes’ Industries develop Solution Experiences  industry-focused offerings that deliver specific value to companies and users in a particular industry. We serve eleven industries structured into three sectors:Manufacturing industries Sector : Transportation & Mobility; Aerospace & Defense; Marine & Offshore; Industrial Equipment; High-Tech; Home & Lifestyle; Consumer Packaged Goods & Retail;Life Sciences & Healthcare Sector : Life Sciences & Healthcare;Infrastructure & Cities Sector : Infrastructure  Energy & Materials; Architecture  Engineering & Construction; Cities  Public & Business Services.Information on Product LinesOur product lines financial reporting include the following financial information:Industrial Innovation software revenue  comprised of our CATIA  ENOVIA  SIMULIA  DELMIA  GEOVIA  NETVIBES  and 3DEXCITE brands;Life Sciences software revenue  comprised of our MEDIDATA and BIOVIA brands;Mainstream Innovation software revenue  comprised of our CENTRIC PLM and 3DVIA brands  as well as our 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family which includes the SOLIDWORKS brand.3DEXPERIENCE Licenses and Software ContributionTo measure the progressive penetration of 3DEXPERIENCE software  we utilize the following ratios:for Licenses revenue  we calculate the percentage contribution by comparing total 3D EXPERIENCE Licenses revenue to Licenses revenue for all product lines except SOLIDWORKS and acquisitions (“related Licenses revenue”);for software revenue  the Group calculates the percentage contribution by comparing total 3DEXPERIENCE software revenue to software revenue for all product lines except SOLIDWORKS and acquisitions (“related software revenue”).Cloud RevenueCloud revenues correspond to revenue generated through a catalog of online services delivered by Dassault Systèmes via a cloud infrastructure hosted by Dassault Systèmes  or by third party providers of cloud computing infrastructure services.

8196,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/26/eutelsat_oneweb/,Eutelsat and OneWeb in multi-orbit merger,LEO and GEO orbit covered in satellite broadband handshake,"OneWeb and Eutelsat have signed a memorandum of understanding intended to create a mega multi-orbit satellite broadband provider.Unlike rival Starlink  which has thousands of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)  the combined company would operate satellites both in Geostationary Orbit (GEO) via the Eutelsat's 36-strong fleet and LEO – via OneWeb's constellation  which currently stands at 428 satellites.There are pros and cons to satellite locations: a GEO satellite has better coverage over a specific region while LEO satellites carry the promise of lower latency and are generally cheaper to build and launch  although more are needed. Combining the two should  in theory  deliver a best-of-both-worlds system depending on the challenges of integration and customer requirements.As for how the deal will work  the transaction values OneWeb at $3.4 billion (implying a value of €12 per Eutelsat share) and Eutelsat shareholders and OneWeb shareholders would each hold 50 percent of Eutelsat shares. Effectively  Eutelsat ends up owning 100 percent of OneWeb (excluding the UK government's share.)The UK government's stake is significant  since £500 million (c $600 million) of UK taxpayer cash was spent on OneWeb two years ago.Eutelsat itself has also invested heavily in OneWeb  and made an initial investment of $550 million in April 2021  and then spent another $165 million in October last year  taking its shareholding from 17.6 percent to 22.9 percent [PDF].The UK's Department for Business  Energy & Industrial Strategy said: ""The UK government will retain the special share and its exclusive rights over OneWeb – securing the company's future at the centre of the combined group's global LEO business  national security controls over the network  and first-preference rights over domestic industrial opportunities.""The latter point is significant. As well as national security needs  the UK is to be the ""preferred"" location for launches as well as procurement for commercial manufacturing. Unfortunately for UK businesses  this also means that the country will be competing against other states for OneWeb work  ""as usual for major European space projects "" observed Dr Bleddyn Bowen  Associate Professor in International Relations at the University of Leicester.The merger  which is expected to be complete by the first half of 2023 (subject to regulatory approvals and a nod from Eutelsat's shareholders)  is expected to generate combined revenues of €1.2 billion (c $1.22 billion). While OneWeb will continue to operate the LEO business and remain headquartered in the UK  France-based Eutelsat will continue to be listed on Euronext Paris and apply for admission to London Stock Exchange.And who knows  by the time that 2023 completion rolls around  OneWeb might finally have got some more of its proposed constellation off the ground. The last batch of satellites never left Baikonur after Russia's invasion of Ukraine  and OneWeb has since signed up several alternative launch operators  including SpaceX  to launch the remainder of its satellites.That's assuming SpaceX can find time in between launches to build the Starlink satellite constellation. The company launched another 53 of the satellites into orbit on July 24  SpaceX's sixth mission of the month. ®",neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,negative,0.01,0.08,0.91,True,English,"['multi-orbit merger', 'Eutelsat', 'OneWeb', 'mega multi-orbit satellite broadband provider', 'major European space projects', 'several alternative launch operators', 'national security controls', 'national security needs', 'Dr Bleddyn Bowen', 'London Stock Exchange', 'domestic industrial opportunities', 'Low Earth Orbit', 'UK taxpayer cash', 'global LEO business', 'Starlink satellite constellation', 'satellite locations', 'rival Starlink', 'GEO satellite', 'Industrial Strategy', 'Geostationary Orbit', '36-strong fleet', 'specific region', 'lower latency', 'worlds system', 'customer requirements', 'initial investment', 'exclusive rights', 'first-preference rights', 'latter point', 'preferred"" location', 'commercial manufacturing', 'other states', 'Associate Professor', 'International Relations', 'first half', 'regulatory approvals', 'combined revenues', 'Euronext Paris', 'last batch', 'sixth mission', 'UK government', 'The UK', 'UK businesses', 'special share', 'Eutelsat shares', 'France-based Eutelsat', 'OneWeb work', 'Eutelsat shareholders', 'LEO satellites', 'OneWeb shareholders', '428 satellites', 'memorandum', 'understanding', 'thousands', 'company', 'pros', 'coverage', 'promise', 'theory', 'challenges', 'integration', 'deal', 'transaction', 'value', '50 percent', '100 percent', 'stake', 'April', 'October', 'shareholding', '17.6 percent', '22.9 percent', 'Department', 'Energy', 'future', 'centre', 'group', 'network', 'launches', 'procurement', 'country', 'University', 'Leicester', 'merger', 'nod', 'admission', 'time', '2023 completion', 'ground', 'Baikonur', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'SpaceX', 'remainder', 'July', 'month']",2022-07-26,2022-07-27,theregister.com

In addition  the Company reaffirmed its intent to initiate a quarterly dividend in the second half of 2023.Doug Pferdehirt  Chair and CEO of TechnipFMC  stated  “ Our debt reduction reached an important milestone in the quarter  providing us with the flexibility to initiate shareholder distributions as evidenced by the new share repurchase program. We firmly believe that our shares are undervalued  and this action underscores our confidence in the long-term outlook for our Company.”Pferdehirt continued  “ I am very pleased with our operational performance in the quarter  which drove total Company adjusted EBITDA of $187 million. We also experienced continued strength in Subsea inbound. Orders for the first half of the year grew to $3.8 billion  a book-to-bill of 1.4  with iEPCI™  direct awards and subsea services representing approximately 70 percent of total orders.”“ Earlier this month  we announced the award of an integrated front end engineering and design (iFEED™) contract by Equinor for the BM-C-33 project offshore Brazil. This includes an option to proceed with a direct award to our Company for the iEPCI™ phase of the project. Upon final investment decision  this would be one of the single largest integrated awards to date for the industry. This will also be the first time Equinor uses our configure-to-order production systems and further underscores our view that more than 50 percent of our tree orders will be Subsea 2.0™ over the next two years.”Pferdehirt added  “ In the first half of the year  TechnipFMC was awarded 117 subsea trees. This is nearly double the volume of trees we sold in all of 2021 and serves as further indication that the industry is in full growth mode. This underlying strength is also displayed in our Subsea Opportunities List  which increased by 20 percent in value sequentially and now represents an opportunity set of $24 billion for the industry.”“ Based on our results  the growing project pipeline  and the active dialogue with our large and expanding customer base  we expect full-year Subsea orders will be up as much as 40 percent versus the prior year  above our previous forecast of 30 percent  with orders now approaching $7 billion in 2022.”“ In Surface Technologies  we saw solid growth in North America sales and profitability  and we continue to move pricing higher as needed to ensure we earn an acceptable return on our investments. Outside of North America  we have received our first in-country orders for the new facility in Saudi Arabia  setting the stage for improved financial performance as we ramp-up production in the second half of the year.”Pferdehirt concluded  “ We remain focused on delivering on our commitments. The reduction in gross debt in the period was another step forward in restoring our balance sheet to our targeted capital structure. We have initiated shareholder distributions  with our near-term actions focused on value-accretive share repurchases. Finally  we reaffirmed our full-year guidance for 2022 and remain confident that our internal initiatives coupled with the strong market backdrop provide us with a clear path to achieve Subsea EBITDA of more than $1 billion by 2025.”_____________________1 Please refer to the Company’s press release issued July 27  2022  titled TechnipFMC Announces $400 Million Share Repurchase Authorization.

The board of directors believes that it is in the interest of all shareholders that senior executives  employees and other key individuals  which are deemed to be important for the group´s development in the US  have a long-term interest in a growth of the company´s share price. Through the proposed program  a long- term ownership commitment is created  which is expected to stimulate an increased interest in the business and the company's performance in general. Furthermore  the program is expected to increase the possibility of recruiting competent personnel in the US.In order to secure the company´s commitments according to the performance share program 2022/2025 and secure related costs  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants in accordance with what appears in item 16a and 16b.A presentation of other incentive programs  preparation of the proposal  costs for the programs and effects on key performance measures etc. are described below.Item 16a: Resolution to adopt a performance share programThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to adopt a Performance Share Program 2022/2025 according to the following guidelines.Performance Share Program 2022/2025 shall include a maximum of 40 000 Performance Shares in two different series- Series 1 and Series 2 to facilitate the recruitment of new employees during the first six (6) month of the program.

The performance target corresponds to an average annual growth rate of the company´s share price (""CAGR"") of 14 percent. At an average CAGR that meets or exceeds the performance target  participants are awarded 100 percent of the Performance Share rights. At an average CAGR below the performance target  participants are awarded 0 percent of the performance stock rights. The starting value of the performance target for Series 1 shall be measured during the twenty (20) days of trading following the publication of Biovica´s financial report for the first quarter of 2022. The end value of Series 1 performance target shall be measured from 1 September to 30 September 2025. For Serie 2 Performance Shares  the average CAGR shall be measured during the twenty (20) days of trading following the publication of Biovica´s financial report for the third quarter of 2022. The end value of Serie 2 performance target shall be measured 1 February through 28 February 2026 (collectively  ""measurement period"").The number of Performance Share rights to be allocated to each participant shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.Provided that performance share rights  both Series  have been earned and that the performance target for the measurement period has been achieved  each Performance Share right entitles the holder to  during the period  no earlier than three years after the participants sign the option agreement regarding the staff options in accordance with the restrictions stated in point 6 above and according to the company´s decision  either (a) acquire one (1) share at a price corresponding to the quota value or the share (the company´s current quota is approximately SEK 0.7 per share) or (b) obtain free of charge a warrant that entitles the subscription of one (1) share in the company to a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the share.Performance Share Program 2022/2025 must be offered on one or several occasions to (i) all current and future senior executives and other employees in the US group up to and including 30 April 2023  and (ii) the current and future key individuals who (personally or through the company) are active in the US group as of the mentioned date and whom the board appoints based on their importance to the group. Employees refer to full- time and part-time employees as well as consultants but not hourly employees.

An employee or consultant who has resigned their employment/consulting assignment or has been dismissed as of the mentioned date but is still employed  shall also not be considered an employee.Senior executives and other employees within the company and the group in the US will  within the framework of the Performance Share Program 2022/2025  be offered performance shares divided into three different categories as follows.Persons within the management  consisting of one person  may be offered a maximum of 5 000 performance shares each and a maximum of 5 000 performance shares in total. A maximum of seven other key individuals within the group  may be offered a maximum of 3 750 performance shares and a maximum of 26 250 performance shares in total  and Employees within the group consisting of up to seven people  may be offered to subscribe for a maximum of 1 250 performance shares and a maximum of 8 750 performance shares in total.Performance Shares offered to the categories above  which are not accepted by the categories above  may later be offered to existing (who do not subscribe for their full offered share) and future senior executives or other employees of the group in the US within the framework of the now proposed principled for allocation. Oversubscription cannot take place. If any person within the above- mentioned categories does not subscribe for his full share  such share can be transferred to another category. The company´s board of directors shall not be covered by the performance share program 2022/2025.Application to participate in the performance share program 2022/2025 of Series 1 must have been received by the company no later than 15 September 2022  and the corresponding for Series 2 no later than 15 February 2023  with the right for the board to extend this deadline.

If a participant ceases to be an employee or terminates his/her employment/ consulting agreement with the group before a vesting date  the already vested performance shares may be exercised at the ordinary time for exercise as described below  but further vesting will not take place. If the employee's employment/consultant agreement ceases due to dismissal from the employer's side  however  also vested options will lapse  unless the board of directors decides otherwise on a case-by-case basis.The holder of Series 1 performance share rights can use assigned and earned Performance Share rights during the vesting period 1 September 2025  through 15 September 2025. The corresponding period for the Series 2 Performance Share rights is during the vesting period through 15 February 2026.

However  the rights according to earned Performance Shares are transferred to the estate in the event of the participant´s death.Participation in the Performance Share Program 2022/2025 presupposes that such participation can legally take place  and that  according to the company´s assessment  such participation can take place with reasonable administrative costs and financial contributions.The Performance Shares must be regulated in special agreements with the respective participants. The board shall be responsible for the design and management of the performance share program 2022/2025 within the framework of the main conditions and guidelines stated above.

Finally  the board has the right to  in extraordinary cases  limit the scope of or prematurely terminate the Performance Share Program 2022/2025 in whole or in part.Item 16b: Resolution to issue warrants and approval of transfer of warrantsIn order to enable the delivery of B shares according to the Performance Share Program 2022/2025 and secure related costs (primarily social security contributions) the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants of series 2022/2025:3 and approval of the transfer of warrants of series 2022/2025:3.The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 40 000 warrants  as a result of which the company's share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 2 666.67.The warrants shall entail the right to subscribe for new B shares in the company.For the issue  the following conditions shall apply:The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  accrue to the company and the subsidiary and other group companies.The warrants are issued free of charge and must be subscribed on a special subscription list no later than 31 October 2022. The board have the right to extend the subscription period.Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new class B share in the company during the period from registration to and including 15 September 2025  or the earlier day that follows from the terms of the warrants. The board have the right to extend the time for share subscription if participants are prevented from subscribing for shares at the end of the subscription period due to the EU's market abuse regulation.Each warrant gives the right to subscribe for a new B share in the company against cash payment according to a subscription price that corresponds to the share's quota value.A new share subscribed for by exercising a warrant carries the right to a dividend for the first time on the record date for the dividend that falls closest after the new shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and the shares have been entered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.The purpose of the issue and the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is to ensure delivery of shares to participants in the program within the framework of the Performance Share Program 2022/2025.The full terms and conditions for the warrants are available at the Company no later than three weeks before the meeting  which means  that the subscription price and the number of shares that the warrant entitles to subscription may be recalculated in certain cases.The board of directors  or the person that the board of directors may appoint  shall be authorized to make minor adjustment necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.The board of directors further proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve that the company  the subsidiary or another group company may transfer warrants to participants in the Performance Share Program 2022/2025 free of charge in connection with the exercise of performance shares in accordance with the conditions or otherwise dispose of the warrants to secure the Company's commitments and costs due to the Performance Share Program 2022/2025.The board of directors shall not have the right to dispose the warrants for any other purpose than to secure the Company's commitments and costs in connection with the performance share program 2022/2025.Preparation of incentive programs etc. (it is noted that this is not a topic for resolution)Proposal on Incentive Program 2022/2026  Incentive Program 2022/2026  Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025-6 and Performance Share Program 2022/2025 has been prepared by external advisors in consultation with the remuneration committee  the board of directors and Coeli Asset Mgmt.Valuation and Costs and effects on key figuresIncentive Program 2022/2025Transfer of the warrants (except to the subsidiary) shall be made at a price equal to the warrant's fair market value  which means no social fees should arise for the company group in connection with the subscription and transfer of warrants. The warrants fair market value  according to a preliminary valuation based on the market value of the underlying share of SEK 31.8  SEK 6.13 per warrant  assuming an exercise price of SEK 47.7 per share. The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for the valuation  assuming a risk free interest rate of 1.8 percent and a volatility of 45 percent  taking into account that no dividends and other distributions to shareholders are expected during the period of the program.In order to facilitate participation in the Incentive Program 2022/2025  the Company shall subsidize the participants' acquisition of warrants. The subsidy  before deduction of income tax  shall correspond to 100% of the option premium paid  and is paid as an extra cash compensation in connection with the warrants being transferred to the participants. Based on an option premium of SEK 6.13 per option  the total costs for the subsidy  excluding social security contributions  are expected to amount to a maximum of SEK 1 471 200.As the warrants are subscribed for and transferred at fair market value  it is the Company´s assessment that there will be no social fees for the Company as a result of the subscriptions and transfers. The costs will therefore consist only of minimal costs for the implementation and administration of Incentive program 2022/2025.Incentive Program 2022/2026Transfer of the warrants shall be made at a price equal to the warrant's fair market value  which means no social fees should arise for the company group in connection with the subscription and transfer of warrants. The warrants fair market value  according to a preliminary valuation based on the market value of the underlying share of SEK 31.8  SEK 7.77 per warrant  assuming an exercise price of SEK 47.7 per share. The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for the valuation  assuming a risk free interest rate of 1.7 percent and a volatility of 45 percent  taking into account that no dividends and other distributions to shareholders are expected during the period of the program.As the warrants are subscribed for and transferred at fair market value  it is the Company´s assessment that there will be no social fees for the Company as a result of the subscriptions and transfers. The costs will therefore consist only of minimal costs for the implementation and administration of Incentive program 2022/2026.Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025-6Costs related to Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025-6 will be recognized in accordance with IFRS 2  which means that the stock options are expensed as personnel costs during the vesting period.Based on the assumption that 100 percent of the options in the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025-6 will be allotted and an annual employee turnover rate of 0 percent  meaning that 120 000 stock options will vest  the estimated total accounting salary costs for the options will amount to approximately SEK 735 600 during the time period 2022-2026  based on the actual value of the options at the time of calculation. The options do not have a market value since they are not transferable. However  the board of directors  with assistance of an independent valuator  has calculated a theoretical value of the options in accordance with the Black Scholes formula. The calculations have been based on a by the board of directors estimated share price of SEK 31.8 per share  a risk-free interest rate of 1.8 percent and an assumed volatility of 45 percent. In accordance with this valuation  the value of the options in the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 is approximately SEK 6.13 per option. Limitations in the disposal rights have not been taken into consideration in the valuation.Upon a positive development of the share price  the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025-6 may entail costs in the form of social security contributions. The total costs for social security contributions will depend on the employment form of the participant  the number of options that will be vested and on the value of the benefit that the participant finally will receive  i.e. on the value of the options when exercised 2025-6  but also in which countries the participants are resident and what rates that apply for social security contributions in these countries. Based on the assumption that 120 000 options in Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025-6 will be vested  an assumed share price of SEK 65 when the options are exercised and an assumed average social security rate of approximately 22 percent  the total costs for social security contributions will amount to approximately SEK 0.9 million.The Company's entire costs for social security contributions are proposed to be hedged through a directed issue of warrants in accordance with item 15b.The total cost for Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025-6 will be distributed over the years 2022-2026.Given the above assumptions  including an assumed share price of 65 at the time of exercise of the options  and that the program had been introduced in 2020/2021 instead  it is calculated that the key figure earnings per share for full year 2021/2022 would have decreased from SEK -2 11 to SEK -2 15.It shall be noted that all calculations above are preliminary  based on assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of what costs Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025-6 may entail. Actual costs may therefore deviate from what has been stated above.Performance Share Program 2022/2025Costs related to the Performance Share Program 2022/2025 will be reported in accordance with IFRS 2  which means that the Performance Shares shall be expensed as a personnel cost over the vesting period without affecting the company's cash flow.If performance share rights are exercised  Performance Share Program 2022/2025 will in addition entail costs in the form of social security contributions. The total costs for social security contributions depend partly on the participant's employment relationship  partly on how many performance share rights are earned  and partly on the value of the benefit that the participant ultimately receives  ie. the value of the performance share rights upon exercise in 2025. Social security contributions will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period. The company intends to hedge the entire exposure to social security contributions through an issue of warrants in the manner set out in the Board's proposal in accordance with item16(b) above  which may be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the performance share rights. If the Company chooses to implement such hedging measures  the social security contributions will not affect the Company's cash flow.Based on the assumption that all 40 000 Performance Shares included in the Performance Share Program 2022/2025 are allotted  an assumed share price of SEK 65 when exercising the performance share rights and an assumed average percentage for social security contributions of approximately 22 percent  the total costs for the program  including social security contributions  are estimated to amount to SEK 3 200 000  which corresponds to approximately 8 percent of the Company's total annual salary costs for employees (including social security contributions) calculated on salary costs for the financial year 2021/2022.The total costs for the Performance Share Program 2022/2025 will be distributed over the years 2022-2025.

At this time  all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode  and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation.Let me now hand the floor over to Mr. Jan Strecker.Jan StreckerWelcome  ladies and gentlemen  and thank you for joining us today to go through our second quarter 2022 results. With me are Theodor Weimer  CEO; and Gregor Pottmeyer  CFO. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation today  and afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions. The presentation material for this call has been sent out via e-mail and can also be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual  the conference call will be recorded and is available for replay afterwards.With this  let me now hand over to you  Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Welcome  ladies and gentlemen. Since we gave you a comprehensive update on our strategy and outlook at the recent Investor Day just less than 4 weeks ago  let me focus mainly on our results today. And by the way  the numbers speak anyways for themselves  if I may say so. Overall  the development in the first half of 2022 significantly exceeded our initial expectations  while the development in the first quarter was mainly driven by the outbreak of the terrible war in Ukraine. The second quarter was increasingly influenced by the beginning cycle of rising interest rates. This is the new area I was referring to at our Investor Day  which adds additional cyclical opportunities to our consistent delivery of strong secular growth.In the first half of this year  the secular and cyclical growth contribution was almost equally strong  and we saw some additional growth from M&A. In total  net revenues increased by 20% and amounted to more than €2 billion  the EBITDA increased by 22% to around €1.3 billion. Secular net revenue growth at 8% was again slightly above our guidance. This was particularly driven by financial derivatives with product innovation and stronger double-digit growth in OTC clearing  and growing demand for ESG-related products in Data & Analytics  and the further increase of market share in commodities.Cyclical net revenue growth also amounted to around 8% was mainly driven by higher volatility in almost all asset classes. Accordingly  our clients hedging needs increased significantly. Financial derivatives with strong growth in index [ph] and fixed income products were the biggest contributor to cyclical growth  followed by Security Services with a jump in net interest income. In addition  the situation in European gas markets fueled the activity in commodities.M&A contributed another 3% to our net revenue growth. This was mainly driven by the contribution of the remaining 2 months of ISS  which we started to consolidate in March last year. As we explained at Investor Day on June 29  we are generally expecting our organic operating costs to increase to support our secular growth vision. But continuous improvement is also a key measure for us to capture efficiencies  and thus offset normal levels of inflation. But from a cost development point of view last year and the current year are definitely not normal periods. Last year  you manage the organic operating cost growth to zero  because cyclical headwinds. This year we have significant cyclical tailwinds and loss  a little bit more flexibility to invest.Furthermore  we have faced with an unprecedented environment resulting in slightly elevated levels of inflation  adjusted for M&A and FX effects. Our operating cost in the first half increased by 6% which we think is a fair outcome. The overall development in the first half  but far exceeded our initial expectations for 2022. And therefore  we are meanwhile expecting to significantly exceed our initial guidance for the full year.With that  let me now hand over to you  Gregor  to present the financial results in greater detail.Gregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On Page 2  we saw the results for the first 6 months in detail. All segments have contributed double-digit growth rates to the overall net revenue development. The Data & Analytics and Trading & Clearing segments even achieved organic net revenue growth rates of around 20%. As part of the net revenue  the net interest income across the group has roughly doubled compared to the previous year. On the one hand  this was driven by higher collateral levels in financial derivatives and commodities. On the other hand  the NII of security services has started to meaningfully benefit from higher U.S. interest rates.I will explain the 6% constant currency organic operating costs increase in more detail in a moment. But overall  the cost development is broadly in line with our expectation. This has also helped us to achieve solid operating leverage. And  as expected  the operating leverage was slightly stronger on an organic basis.In terms of the operating costs in the first half of 2022 on Page 3  we saw several different drivers. First  M&A effects  which amounted to 6%  they were still mainly driven by the IFS acquisition. Second  the stronger U.S. dollar was added in a 2% operating cost increase  but was obviously also beneficial to the net revenue development. This brings us to the more meaningful constant currency organic operating costs.On the one hand  it was driven by slightly higher inflationary effects from building operations  general purchasing  and higher staff costs. On the other hand  we had to increase the provisions for variable and share-based compensation in light of the favorable financial development  and relative share price performance.This brings me to the details of the second quarter results on Page 4 of the presentation. We saw continued strong net revenue costs  mainly driven by secular and cyclical developments. Last year numbers include the €40 million euro gain on the full purchase of Fund Centre. Without that  the net revenue growth would have been north of 20% and the cyclical costs would have been double-digit. The M&A effect has been minor in the second quarter  since they were only driven by some of the smaller  more recent acquisitions.The explanations I just provided on the half year one operating costs development can also be applied to the second quarter. The constant currency organic operating costs increased by 6%  this was mainly driven by some inflationary pressures  and higher variable and share-based compensation. Then besides from financial investments includes a partial reversal of the gains we booked in the first quarter on the FairX disposal by Nodal in the U.S.We received Coinbase shares as a compensation that’s a 6-month lockup period. But for the first half of 2022  a solid gain remains in our books. The financial result includes 2 one-off effects. First  the interest expenses on our bonds are slightly higher  because we refinanced the corporate bond maturing in October already in March. Second  it includes around €6 million of interest on additional tax provisions we made in the second quarter.I’m now turning to the quarterly results of the segments  starting with Data & Analytics on Page 5. We saw a solid double-digit organic net revenue growth across all business lines. This was driven by as a continuing trend towards ESG  a good new client pipeline and higher market activity for the index licensing business. The other line  which is mainly the ISS Market Intelligence business  included some inorganic costs from the acquisition of Discovery Data. The EBITDA in the previous year’s quarter included a gain of around €10 million from the revaluation of the stake in Clarity AI. Adjusted for the Clarity AI effect  the EBITDA increased 27%.Let me turn to Slide 6 in the Trading & Clearing segment. The Trading & Clearing segment continues to benefit from higher volatility and increased client hedging needs. The financial derivatives business of Eurex was driven by a higher double-digit cost in index derivatives  interest rate derivatives  the OTC clearing  and in particular  higher margin fees  amounted to €27 million in the second quarter  also slightly down compared to the very strong first quarter.Commodities continued their strong year-over-year cost due to volatile gas prices and higher margin fees. The cash equities business includes a gain of €13 million relating to the deconsolidation of Tradegate Exchange. Due to a capital restructuring  our stakes declined to 43%. Although  the previous year’s net revenue in the cash equities business included a positive effect of around €7 million  relating to the sale of the Regulatory Reporting Hub. As a result of higher volatility  demand for foreign exchange product was significantly higher compared to previous quarters  and net revenue increased by 27%.In the Fund Services segment  which you’ll find on Page 7  the previous year quarter included the book gain from the full purchase of Fund Centre. On an adjusted basis  our net revenue increased by 14%. This includes continued organic growth  despite a clearly more challenging environment from a market performance point of view. This was possible  because of onboarding of new clients and portfolios. In addition  the acquisition of Kneip added around €6 million of net revenue in the other line item of the segment. It is also encouraging to see that the momentum of new partnerships continued. We’ve recently entered into an agreement with Italian online program Directa to provide Italian retail investors access to our global funds portfolio.Our Securities Services segment on Slide 8  delivered a very good performance in the second quarter. Headwinds from equity market performance and lower retail participation  they are overcompensated by solid leverage of fixed income issuance activity and some FX effect on assets under custody denominated in U.S. dollar. In addition  we are now starting to see a more meaningful impact from the recent rate hikes in the net interest income.Besides higher rates  also the cash balances are still significantly exceeding last year’s level. With the current trajectory of interest rates in the U.S. and now also in Europe  we would expect even higher close rate for the third quarter. The other line item declined slightly because of the REGIS-TR disposal in the first quarter.The last page of today’s presentation shows our guidance for 2022. As Theodor mentioned  the development in the first half by far exceeded our initial expectation for 2022. There is a performance so far  we are trading around €150 million above our initial net revenue expectation. Therefore  meanwhile  we expect to significantly exceed our guidance for the full year. You are probably wondering why we are not narrowing down our expectation a little bit more. But there are still 6 months left to the year  though there could be both cyclical headwinds as well as further tailwinds affecting the growth we are currently expecting.This concludes our presentation. We are now looking forward to your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. Over to you.Haley TamGood afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a good set of results. Since I’m restricted to one question  can I actually ask about the Data & Analytics segment  I think the resilience of the index revenue  there was a lot better than I was expecting given the market trends we’ve seen during the first half. So I wondered if you could help me understand  what it is that drove I suppose first of all the stability in the AUM and exchange traded index funds during the period  and whether you expect that to continue.But secondly  I’m not sure I’m familiar with why your stock exchange licenses business would have gone up with increased market volatility  and whether that is a subscription business. So we can expect that to continue? Or that there’s any sort of cyclical nature to that  that’d be great to help me understand? Thank you very much.Theodor WeimerYeah  thanks  Haley  for the question. In both questions  I can give you one answer. So our index business what we show here  where we continue to get basically a license for providing for the stock in the tax business. So that’s really very closely related to each other. So the more U.S. derivatives contracts are traded  the higher license fee income is on continuous side. And therefore  yes  there is some cyclical component included here.Haley TamSuper. Thank you.OperatorSo we’re coming to the next question  and it comes from Michael Werner from UBS.Michael WernerThank you for the presentation. My question is on the FX tailwinds to the revenue side  you highlighted the underlying organic growth on costs. I was just wondering if you could provide what the year-on-year revenue growth would have been in the constant currency world. And particularly  whether the – what the 8% secular revenue growth in Q2 would have been in a constant currency world? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerAll right. So with regard to the FX tailwind on revenues  so overall  we have a positive EBITDA impact  if we say on the cost side  it’s a roughly a 2% impact on the revenue  it’s roughly a 1% to 2% and FX on the cost side is more 2% to 3%. So overall  it’s positive if the U.S. dollar is stronger compared to the euro.The second question  the 8% secular growth on a constant portfolio basis  I think  it is a constant portfolio basis  because we say overall  the 20% cost in the first half year  we said its 8% secular  8% cyclical  and roughly 3% is M&A. So we already exclude the impact here. If your question goes into direction  whether it’s also an FX impact onto secular growth  then it could be this number I’ve done in my mind  but it could be maybe 1% lower.Gregor PottmeyerPretty much  Gregor.OperatorThe next question comes from Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonHi. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on the results. I guess just looking at the outlook. And just this also sort of goes back to the cost question. I’m trying to figure out how much of the revenue beat is going to drop through to EBITDA. So I guess  at the moment consensus is just shy of €4 billion of revenues  and €2.35 billion of EBITDA  so close to a sort of one-for-one drop through. But given your comments around some of the inflationary and FX pressures  I guess it feels like some of those cost pressures endure into the second half. And so there would be some offset. Is there a good way for us to think about that sort of that drop through from there?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Thanks  Bruce. Obviously  for the expected question around our operating leverage even if you don’t take this word. I think we are fully able to show operating leverage for our existing core business  right? So if you would just take the Eurex core numbers  where you have clearly a big increase in the EBITDA margin. And if I would just do that for the Eurex core business. And you see it and it’s documented in our Clearstream Security Services business where we have basically doubled an increase in EBITDA compared to the revenue  so here you’ll see that we are fully able to deliver the operating leverage.Why you don’t see the significant impact here on group level  so there are basically three elements to explain. So on EBITDA margin level  so the first impact is out of the impact in our equity results  right? So in the first half year is even on a constant basis  or I think it’s two times €32 million. But last year  we made for the full year some €85 million. And currently  I do not expect another €50 million for that. So that’s number one. So let’s impact here out of tailwinds in the equity result.Secondly  our M&A is dilutive for our overall business  right? So we acquire business. So let’s take the biggest one  the ISS  there’s a margin of today roughly 30%. And that’s obviously below the 60% or 50% plus you have in our existing businesses. So these are basically the reasons by on group level and we already anticipated that  when we gave our guidance in Compass 2019  where we say  look  we want to grow on our top line is 10%. And it’s basically the same on our bottom line. So basically  the cost increase is compatible with that  so that we have a constant EBITDA margin. And again  the main impact M&A slightly diluted  and secondly  the onetimers we have in our equity results.Bruce HamiltonGot it. Ando so just a follow-up  though  in the second half  do you expect that the FX headwinds on costs and the inflationary pressures those will persist? So we’ll be running a bit higher than the 5% organic  that’s probably here to stay for the second half? Or would there be any change?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. So from a cost development perspective  I think the M&A contribution will obviously go down  so on a constant portfolio basis. Secondly  the FX impact will increase assuming that we will continue to see that kind of that strong U.S. dollar compared to the euro. So my expectation is that this will increase and basically the organic portfolio constant FX will be the same like in the first half year.Bruce HamiltonGot it. Thank you.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Philip Middleton from the Bank of America.Philip MiddletonYeah. Thanks very much. And as always  we’re all asking the same thing. So if we could just return to the costs for a minute? I think you just said that you expect that the 3% and the 3% effectively representing the inflationary impact for this year  and the share payments to roll through into the next half  just to check that’s correct. And secondly  if it is  when you’re talking about the first component of that  there was some – there was a bit at – the end you tacked on and general inflation. How important is general inflation in that figure compared to the investing to build new services  which is obviously something you’ve always said you’ll do when you’ve got the headroom to do it?Theodor WeimerYeah  so thanks for this question. So  obviously  the general inflation is higher than in previous years  there’s no doubt. There’s pressure – more inflationary pressure on the salary side  even if you hire new people. The inflationary pressure  obviously  in our energy costs  if you all know that  but it’s across all cost segments. And so you can see usually our inflation was in the range of 2% to 3%  now it’s roughly 1 percentage point higher it’s 3% to 4%. And therefore  we are even lower than  let’s say  it’s 8% what you see in the markets general. So  yes  the general inflation is higher than originally expected.With regard to your first question  so what we show is organic cost on a constant portfolio and constant FX basis  so it’s a 6% roughly in the first half year. Yes  I said  I expect basically is the same for the – roughly the same for the – increase for the second half year  because owners we basically built provision on the current level and we would have to do basically the same now  and from a share price development also higher than compare to the first half year. So this would be most probably a comparable number [for the main tool] [ph] for the product general inflation.Philip MiddletonOkay. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Johannes Thormann  HSBC.Johannes ThormannGood afternoon  everybody. First of all  a question on Clearstream  you elaborated the strengths of customer revenues also did you in a fix effect? Can you quantify this effect? And also looking at the decline of settlement fees over the last quarter. This has been the weakest level since many quarters. Is this the bottom? Or do you feel it could continue to decline? And just on your next Fund Services customer migration  can you elaborate a bit more how you’re progressing with that? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  obviously  for the – starting with the second question on the Front Services migration. So we are proceeding as planned? So we told you that both parts of the Clearstream business  so the Fund Service business and Security Services business  we will show it more on an autonomous more and more independent basis  so that you have higher strategic flexibility here  for instance  going into partnerships. And so we are proceeding as expected and hope that the majority of the work we will have done at the end of the year  or beginning of next year.Your first question around the customer revenues here. Yes  there’s obviously in the FX impact you asked  yes  there is a positive FX impact for our dollar-denominated custody. I don’t have the exact number  Jan.Jan StreckerAround 15% of the assets under custody  and the ICD  which are denominated in U.S. dollar.Gregor PottmeyerOkay. Jan has a precise number  right? And with regard to the decline in the settlement process  so as in the first quarter  where we see some decrease in the retail segment  and that’s the main driver for the reduction in the settlement area.Johannes ThormannOkay. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Benjamin Goy  Deutsche Bank. Over to you.Benjamin GoyYes. Hi  good afternoon. Just staying with Fund Services and to better understand  because your assets under custody are down roughly 7% since the peak  which  if you look at many asset managers is actually quite good. So could you quantify the inflows from new business you have whether it’s new clients  whether they bring on more business  rather than just a simple mark-to-market? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Thanks  Benjamin  first of all  the question on the Fund Service topic. And it’s worth to elaborate a little bit. So currently  you show a 14% growth number. But there are also positive elements out of our Kneip acquisition. So on organic basis  it’s 6% basically. And now you could argue  oh  why is it just a single-digit number? I thought it’s a double-digit number. And therefore  there are two or three elements to explain it. So the first is  what we elaborated in our speaking notes is that market performance on the equity level specifically are obviously lower. And currently  that’s roughly a headwind of 4 to 5 percentage points here. So that’s the first way we have some cyclical headwinds.Secondly  we currently see some reluctance from – as you already mentioned  some reluctance from investors and asset managers to really invest in the fund space  due to the uncertainty of the markets. But we expect that at a certain point of time  and this will also disappear. And firstly  our customer onboarding process  so still it’s a great pipeline and it’s continued to be very successful. But to show  on a constant basis  continued success here in onboarding on a quarterly basis  I think it’s a little bit challenging. And therefore  we can promise you  we are likely on there  and it’s a strong customer pipeline.And overall  from a secular perspective  we are convinced that we are able to deliver double-digit growth also for the next quarters and years.Benjamin GoyUnderstood. Thank you.Jan StreckerAll right. There are no further questions in the pipeline. So we would like to conclude the call today. There’s anything else then please feel free to reach out to us directly anytime.

At this time  all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode  and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation.Let me now hand the floor over to Mr. Jan Strecker.Jan StreckerWelcome  ladies and gentlemen  and thank you for joining us today to go through our second quarter 2022 results. With me are Theodor Weimer  CEO; and Gregor Pottmeyer  CFO. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation today  and afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions. The presentation material for this call has been sent out via e-mail and can also be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual  the conference call will be recorded and is available for replay afterwards.With this  let me now hand over to you  Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Welcome  ladies and gentlemen. Since we gave you a comprehensive update on our strategy and outlook at the recent Investor Day just less than 4 weeks ago  let me focus mainly on our results today. And by the way  the numbers speak anyways for themselves  if I may say so. Overall  the development in the first half of 2022 significantly exceeded our initial expectations  while the development in the first quarter was mainly driven by the outbreak of the terrible war in Ukraine. The second quarter was increasingly influenced by the beginning cycle of rising interest rates. This is the new area I was referring to at our Investor Day  which adds additional cyclical opportunities to our consistent delivery of strong secular growth.In the first half of this year  the secular and cyclical growth contribution was almost equally strong  and we saw some additional growth from M&A. In total  net revenues increased by 20% and amounted to more than €2 billion  the EBITDA increased by 22% to around €1.3 billion. Secular net revenue growth at 8% was again slightly above our guidance. This was particularly driven by financial derivatives with product innovation and stronger double-digit growth in OTC clearing  and growing demand for ESG-related products in Data & Analytics  and the further increase of market share in commodities.Cyclical net revenue growth also amounted to around 8% was mainly driven by higher volatility in almost all asset classes. Accordingly  our clients hedging needs increased significantly. Financial derivatives with strong growth in index [ph] and fixed income products were the biggest contributor to cyclical growth  followed by Security Services with a jump in net interest income. In addition  the situation in European gas markets fueled the activity in commodities.M&A contributed another 3% to our net revenue growth. This was mainly driven by the contribution of the remaining 2 months of ISS  which we started to consolidate in March last year. As we explained at Investor Day on June 29  we are generally expecting our organic operating costs to increase to support our secular growth vision. But continuous improvement is also a key measure for us to capture efficiencies  and thus offset normal levels of inflation. But from a cost development point of view last year and the current year are definitely not normal periods. Last year  you manage the organic operating cost growth to zero  because cyclical headwinds. This year we have significant cyclical tailwinds and loss  a little bit more flexibility to invest.Furthermore  we have faced with an unprecedented environment resulting in slightly elevated levels of inflation  adjusted for M&A and FX effects. Our operating cost in the first half increased by 6% which we think is a fair outcome. The overall development in the first half  but far exceeded our initial expectations for 2022. And therefore  we are meanwhile expecting to significantly exceed our initial guidance for the full year.With that  let me now hand over to you  Gregor  to present the financial results in greater detail.Gregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On Page 2  we saw the results for the first 6 months in detail. All segments have contributed double-digit growth rates to the overall net revenue development. The Data & Analytics and Trading & Clearing segments even achieved organic net revenue growth rates of around 20%. As part of the net revenue  the net interest income across the group has roughly doubled compared to the previous year. On the one hand  this was driven by higher collateral levels in financial derivatives and commodities. On the other hand  the NII of security services has started to meaningfully benefit from higher U.S. interest rates.I will explain the 6% constant currency organic operating costs increase in more detail in a moment. But overall  the cost development is broadly in line with our expectation. This has also helped us to achieve solid operating leverage. And  as expected  the operating leverage was slightly stronger on an organic basis.In terms of the operating costs in the first half of 2022 on Page 3  we saw several different drivers. First  M&A effects  which amounted to 6%  they were still mainly driven by the IFS acquisition. Second  the stronger U.S. dollar was added in a 2% operating cost increase  but was obviously also beneficial to the net revenue development. This brings us to the more meaningful constant currency organic operating costs.On the one hand  it was driven by slightly higher inflationary effects from building operations  general purchasing  and higher staff costs. On the other hand  we had to increase the provisions for variable and share-based compensation in light of the favorable financial development  and relative share price performance.This brings me to the details of the second quarter results on Page 4 of the presentation. We saw continued strong net revenue costs  mainly driven by secular and cyclical developments. Last year numbers include the €40 million euro gain on the full purchase of Fund Centre. Without that  the net revenue growth would have been north of 20% and the cyclical costs would have been double-digit. The M&A effect has been minor in the second quarter  since they were only driven by some of the smaller  more recent acquisitions.The explanations I just provided on the half year one operating costs development can also be applied to the second quarter. The constant currency organic operating costs increased by 6%  this was mainly driven by some inflationary pressures  and higher variable and share-based compensation. Then besides from financial investments includes a partial reversal of the gains we booked in the first quarter on the FairX disposal by Nodal in the U.S.We received Coinbase shares as a compensation that’s a 6-month lockup period. But for the first half of 2022  a solid gain remains in our books. The financial result includes 2 one-off effects. First  the interest expenses on our bonds are slightly higher  because we refinanced the corporate bond maturing in October already in March. Second  it includes around €6 million of interest on additional tax provisions we made in the second quarter.I’m now turning to the quarterly results of the segments  starting with Data & Analytics on Page 5. We saw a solid double-digit organic net revenue growth across all business lines. This was driven by as a continuing trend towards ESG  a good new client pipeline and higher market activity for the index licensing business. The other line  which is mainly the ISS Market Intelligence business  included some inorganic costs from the acquisition of Discovery Data. The EBITDA in the previous year’s quarter included a gain of around €10 million from the revaluation of the stake in Clarity AI. Adjusted for the Clarity AI effect  the EBITDA increased 27%.Let me turn to Slide 6 in the Trading & Clearing segment. The Trading & Clearing segment continues to benefit from higher volatility and increased client hedging needs. The financial derivatives business of Eurex was driven by a higher double-digit cost in index derivatives  interest rate derivatives  the OTC clearing  and in particular  higher margin fees  amounted to €27 million in the second quarter  also slightly down compared to the very strong first quarter.Commodities continued their strong year-over-year cost due to volatile gas prices and higher margin fees. The cash equities business includes a gain of €13 million relating to the deconsolidation of Tradegate Exchange. Due to a capital restructuring  our stakes declined to 43%. Although  the previous year’s net revenue in the cash equities business included a positive effect of around €7 million  relating to the sale of the Regulatory Reporting Hub. As a result of higher volatility  demand for foreign exchange product was significantly higher compared to previous quarters  and net revenue increased by 27%.In the Fund Services segment  which you’ll find on Page 7  the previous year quarter included the book gain from the full purchase of Fund Centre. On an adjusted basis  our net revenue increased by 14%. This includes continued organic growth  despite a clearly more challenging environment from a market performance point of view. This was possible  because of onboarding of new clients and portfolios. In addition  the acquisition of Kneip added around €6 million of net revenue in the other line item of the segment. It is also encouraging to see that the momentum of new partnerships continued. We’ve recently entered into an agreement with Italian online program Directa to provide Italian retail investors access to our global funds portfolio.Our Securities Services segment on Slide 8  delivered a very good performance in the second quarter. Headwinds from equity market performance and lower retail participation  they are overcompensated by solid leverage of fixed income issuance activity and some FX effect on assets under custody denominated in U.S. dollar. In addition  we are now starting to see a more meaningful impact from the recent rate hikes in the net interest income.Besides higher rates  also the cash balances are still significantly exceeding last year’s level. With the current trajectory of interest rates in the U.S. and now also in Europe  we would expect even higher close rate for the third quarter. The other line item declined slightly because of the REGIS-TR disposal in the first quarter.The last page of today’s presentation shows our guidance for 2022. As Theodor mentioned  the development in the first half by far exceeded our initial expectation for 2022. There is a performance so far  we are trading around €150 million above our initial net revenue expectation. Therefore  meanwhile  we expect to significantly exceed our guidance for the full year. You are probably wondering why we are not narrowing down our expectation a little bit more. But there are still 6 months left to the year  though there could be both cyclical headwinds as well as further tailwinds affecting the growth we are currently expecting.This concludes our presentation. We are now looking forward to your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. Over to you.Haley TamGood afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a good set of results. Since I’m restricted to one question  can I actually ask about the Data & Analytics segment  I think the resilience of the index revenue  there was a lot better than I was expecting given the market trends we’ve seen during the first half. So I wondered if you could help me understand  what it is that drove I suppose first of all the stability in the AUM and exchange traded index funds during the period  and whether you expect that to continue.But secondly  I’m not sure I’m familiar with why your stock exchange licenses business would have gone up with increased market volatility  and whether that is a subscription business. So we can expect that to continue? Or that there’s any sort of cyclical nature to that  that’d be great to help me understand? Thank you very much.Theodor WeimerYeah  thanks  Haley  for the question. In both questions  I can give you one answer. So our index business what we show here  where we continue to get basically a license for providing for the stock in the tax business. So that’s really very closely related to each other. So the more U.S. derivatives contracts are traded  the higher license fee income is on continuous side. And therefore  yes  there is some cyclical component included here.Haley TamSuper. Thank you.OperatorSo we’re coming to the next question  and it comes from Michael Werner from UBS.Michael WernerThank you for the presentation. My question is on the FX tailwinds to the revenue side  you highlighted the underlying organic growth on costs. I was just wondering if you could provide what the year-on-year revenue growth would have been in the constant currency world. And particularly  whether the – what the 8% secular revenue growth in Q2 would have been in a constant currency world? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerAll right. So with regard to the FX tailwind on revenues  so overall  we have a positive EBITDA impact  if we say on the cost side  it’s a roughly a 2% impact on the revenue  it’s roughly a 1% to 2% and FX on the cost side is more 2% to 3%. So overall  it’s positive if the U.S. dollar is stronger compared to the euro.The second question  the 8% secular growth on a constant portfolio basis  I think  it is a constant portfolio basis  because we say overall  the 20% cost in the first half year  we said its 8% secular  8% cyclical  and roughly 3% is M&A. So we already exclude the impact here. If your question goes into direction  whether it’s also an FX impact onto secular growth  then it could be this number I’ve done in my mind  but it could be maybe 1% lower.Gregor PottmeyerPretty much  Gregor.OperatorThe next question comes from Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonHi. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on the results. I guess just looking at the outlook. And just this also sort of goes back to the cost question. I’m trying to figure out how much of the revenue beat is going to drop through to EBITDA. So I guess  at the moment consensus is just shy of €4 billion of revenues  and €2.35 billion of EBITDA  so close to a sort of one-for-one drop through. But given your comments around some of the inflationary and FX pressures  I guess it feels like some of those cost pressures endure into the second half. And so there would be some offset. Is there a good way for us to think about that sort of that drop through from there?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Thanks  Bruce. Obviously  for the expected question around our operating leverage even if you don’t take this word. I think we are fully able to show operating leverage for our existing core business  right? So if you would just take the Eurex core numbers  where you have clearly a big increase in the EBITDA margin. And if I would just do that for the Eurex core business. And you see it and it’s documented in our Clearstream Security Services business where we have basically doubled an increase in EBITDA compared to the revenue  so here you’ll see that we are fully able to deliver the operating leverage.Why you don’t see the significant impact here on group level  so there are basically three elements to explain. So on EBITDA margin level  so the first impact is out of the impact in our equity results  right? So in the first half year is even on a constant basis  or I think it’s two times €32 million. But last year  we made for the full year some €85 million. And currently  I do not expect another €50 million for that. So that’s number one. So let’s impact here out of tailwinds in the equity result.Secondly  our M&A is dilutive for our overall business  right? So we acquire business. So let’s take the biggest one  the ISS  there’s a margin of today roughly 30%. And that’s obviously below the 60% or 50% plus you have in our existing businesses. So these are basically the reasons by on group level and we already anticipated that  when we gave our guidance in Compass 2019  where we say  look  we want to grow on our top line is 10%. And it’s basically the same on our bottom line. So basically  the cost increase is compatible with that  so that we have a constant EBITDA margin. And again  the main impact M&A slightly diluted  and secondly  the onetimers we have in our equity results.Bruce HamiltonGot it. Ando so just a follow-up  though  in the second half  do you expect that the FX headwinds on costs and the inflationary pressures those will persist? So we’ll be running a bit higher than the 5% organic  that’s probably here to stay for the second half? Or would there be any change?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. So from a cost development perspective  I think the M&A contribution will obviously go down  so on a constant portfolio basis. Secondly  the FX impact will increase assuming that we will continue to see that kind of that strong U.S. dollar compared to the euro. So my expectation is that this will increase and basically the organic portfolio constant FX will be the same like in the first half year.Bruce HamiltonGot it. Thank you.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Philip Middleton from the Bank of America.Philip MiddletonYeah. Thanks very much. And as always  we’re all asking the same thing. So if we could just return to the costs for a minute? I think you just said that you expect that the 3% and the 3% effectively representing the inflationary impact for this year  and the share payments to roll through into the next half  just to check that’s correct. And secondly  if it is  when you’re talking about the first component of that  there was some – there was a bit at – the end you tacked on and general inflation. How important is general inflation in that figure compared to the investing to build new services  which is obviously something you’ve always said you’ll do when you’ve got the headroom to do it?Theodor WeimerYeah  so thanks for this question. So  obviously  the general inflation is higher than in previous years  there’s no doubt. There’s pressure – more inflationary pressure on the salary side  even if you hire new people. The inflationary pressure  obviously  in our energy costs  if you all know that  but it’s across all cost segments. And so you can see usually our inflation was in the range of 2% to 3%  now it’s roughly 1 percentage point higher it’s 3% to 4%. And therefore  we are even lower than  let’s say  it’s 8% what you see in the markets general. So  yes  the general inflation is higher than originally expected.With regard to your first question  so what we show is organic cost on a constant portfolio and constant FX basis  so it’s a 6% roughly in the first half year. Yes  I said  I expect basically is the same for the – roughly the same for the – increase for the second half year  because owners we basically built provision on the current level and we would have to do basically the same now  and from a share price development also higher than compare to the first half year. So this would be most probably a comparable number [for the main tool] [ph] for the product general inflation.Philip MiddletonOkay. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Johannes Thormann  HSBC.Johannes ThormannGood afternoon  everybody. First of all  a question on Clearstream  you elaborated the strengths of customer revenues also did you in a fix effect? Can you quantify this effect? And also looking at the decline of settlement fees over the last quarter. This has been the weakest level since many quarters. Is this the bottom? Or do you feel it could continue to decline? And just on your next Fund Services customer migration  can you elaborate a bit more how you’re progressing with that? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  obviously  for the – starting with the second question on the Front Services migration. So we are proceeding as planned? So we told you that both parts of the Clearstream business  so the Fund Service business and Security Services business  we will show it more on an autonomous more and more independent basis  so that you have higher strategic flexibility here  for instance  going into partnerships. And so we are proceeding as expected and hope that the majority of the work we will have done at the end of the year  or beginning of next year.Your first question around the customer revenues here. Yes  there’s obviously in the FX impact you asked  yes  there is a positive FX impact for our dollar-denominated custody. I don’t have the exact number  Jan.Jan StreckerAround 15% of the assets under custody  and the ICD  which are denominated in U.S. dollar.Gregor PottmeyerOkay. Jan has a precise number  right? And with regard to the decline in the settlement process  so as in the first quarter  where we see some decrease in the retail segment  and that’s the main driver for the reduction in the settlement area.Johannes ThormannOkay. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Benjamin Goy  Deutsche Bank. Over to you.Benjamin GoyYes. Hi  good afternoon. Just staying with Fund Services and to better understand  because your assets under custody are down roughly 7% since the peak  which  if you look at many asset managers is actually quite good. So could you quantify the inflows from new business you have whether it’s new clients  whether they bring on more business  rather than just a simple mark-to-market? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Thanks  Benjamin  first of all  the question on the Fund Service topic. And it’s worth to elaborate a little bit. So currently  you show a 14% growth number. But there are also positive elements out of our Kneip acquisition. So on organic basis  it’s 6% basically. And now you could argue  oh  why is it just a single-digit number? I thought it’s a double-digit number. And therefore  there are two or three elements to explain it. So the first is  what we elaborated in our speaking notes is that market performance on the equity level specifically are obviously lower. And currently  that’s roughly a headwind of 4 to 5 percentage points here. So that’s the first way we have some cyclical headwinds.Secondly  we currently see some reluctance from – as you already mentioned  some reluctance from investors and asset managers to really invest in the fund space  due to the uncertainty of the markets. But we expect that at a certain point of time  and this will also disappear. And firstly  our customer onboarding process  so still it’s a great pipeline and it’s continued to be very successful. But to show  on a constant basis  continued success here in onboarding on a quarterly basis  I think it’s a little bit challenging. And therefore  we can promise you  we are likely on there  and it’s a strong customer pipeline.And overall  from a secular perspective  we are convinced that we are able to deliver double-digit growth also for the next quarters and years.Benjamin GoyUnderstood. Thank you.Jan StreckerAll right. There are no further questions in the pipeline. So we would like to conclude the call today. There’s anything else then please feel free to reach out to us directly anytime.

[Today's] announcement is another bold step in OneWeb's remarkable journey. It is testament to the resilience  execution and innovation of our teams  the strong demand we have seen since launching our commercial services  and the close collaboration we have forged with our partners to provide high-speed  low latency connectivity for governments  businesses  and communities. This combination accelerates our mission to deliver connectivity that will change lives at scale and create a fast growing  well-funded company which will continue to create significant value for our shareholders.""Eutelsat Communications (Euronext Paris: ETL) and key OneWeb shareholders have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the objective of creating a leading global player in Connectivity through the combination of both companies in an all-share transaction. Eutelsat will combine its 36-strong fleet of GEO satellites with OneWeb's constellation of 648 Low Earth Orbit satellites  of which 428 are currently in orbit.The transaction would be structured as an exchange of OneWeb shares by its shareholders (other than Eutelsat) with new shares issued by Eutelsat  such that  at closing  Eutelsat would own 100% of OneWeb (excluding the 'Special Share' of the UK Government). OneWeb shareholders would receive 230 million newly issued Eutelsat shares representing 50% of the enlarged share capital4.The potential transaction builds on the deepening collaboration between Eutelsat and OneWeb  begun with the equity stake acquired by Eutelsat in OneWeb in April 2021  the global distribution agreement between Eutelsat and OneWeb announced in March 2022  and the new exclusive commercial partnership5  addressing mainly the European and global cruise markets  signed today.Commenting on the combination  Dominique D'Hinnin  Eutelsat's Chairman said ""I am delighted to announce this new and significant step in the collaboration between Eutelsat and OneWeb. Bringing together our two businesses will deliver a global first  combining LEO constellations and GEO assets to seize the significant growth opportunity in Connectivity  and deliver to our customers solutions to their needs across an even wider range of applications.""This combination will accelerate the commercialisation of OneWeb's fleet  while enhancing the attractiveness of Eutelsat's growth profile. In addition  the combination carries significant value creation potential  anchored on a balanced mix of revenue  cost and capex synergies. The strong support of strategic shareholders of both parties is a testament to the huge opportunity that this combination offers and the value that will be created for all its stakeholders. This is truly a game changer for our industry.""Sunil Bharti Mittal  OneWeb's Executive Chairman said ""Having played a pioneering role in providing connectivity in the emerging world  I am excited about the possibilities of connecting the unconnected. The combination of Eutelsat and OneWeb represents a significant development in that direction as well as a unique GEO/LEO combination.""The positive early results of our service together with our strong pipeline represent a very exciting opportunity in the fast-growing satellite connectivity segment  especially for customers requiring a high speed  low latency experience. Our customers are actively seeking a combined GEO/LEO offering leading us towards this important step. Bharti  as the lead shareholder of OneWeb  along with other key shareholders  is looking forward to playing a meaningful role in providing expanded connectivity through the combination of OneWeb and Eutelsat.""Eva Berneke  Eutelsat's Chief Executive Officer said ""Our initial investment in OneWeb was underpinned by our strong belief that the future growth in Connectivity will be driven by both GEO and LEO capacity. This belief has intensified as our relationship with OneWeb has deepened  first by raising our stake in the company  and then with the global distribution agreement signed a few months ago. We are now moving to the next level  with a full combination that will ensure the potential of the GEO/LEO integration is fully realized  supported by compelling financial  strategic  and industrial logic.""This ground-breaking combination will create a powerful global player with the financial strength and technical expertise to accelerate both OneWeb's commercial deployment  and Eutelsat's pivot to Connectivity. The combined entity will be geared towards profitable growth  with strong medium-term cash flow generation and a rapid deleveraging driven by strong forecast EBITDA growth. The benefits for our customers and strategic partners  who are at the center of our strategy  are both significant and unique. This is also a very exciting opportunity for our employees who will be key to the success of this transformation.""Neil Masterson  OneWeb's Chief Executive Officer said ""Just 20 months ago  OneWeb resumed its mission to connect the unconnected and remove the barriers to connectivity that hold back many of the world's underserved economies and communities. Since then  we have turned this vision into reality and become the second largest low Earth orbit satellite operator in the world. Today's announcement is another bold step in OneWeb's remarkable journey.""It is testament to the resilience  execution and innovation of our teams  the strong demand we have seen since launching our commercial services  and the close collaboration we have forged with our partners to provide high-speed  low latency connectivity for governments  businesses  and communities. This combination accelerates our mission to deliver connectivity that will change lives at scale and create a fast growing  well-funded company which will continue to create significant value for our shareholders.""A compelling market opportunityEutelsat and OneWeb will address the considerable Connectivity market opportunity  which is fueled by the growing needs of customers in both the B2B and B2C segments for consistent  reliable connectivity. These market segments are forecast to grow by three and five times respectively over the next decade  to reach a combined value of circa $16bn by 2030  with growth being served by both GEO HTS and LEO capacity6.Moreover  the combination of the network density  compelling economics and high throughput of GEO with the low latency and ubiquity of LEO  creates the optimal solution to address an even wider range of customer needs  thereby expanding the addressable market.A powerful combination  representing a game-changer in the industryThe operations of Eutelsat and OneWeb are highly complementary. A clear roadmap has been designed to develop over time a complementary GEO/LEO service including a common platform  hybrid terminals and a fully mutualized network creating a one-stop shop solution for customers  providing them with a unique offering and a seamless user experience.Tapping into significant revenue  cost and capex synergiesThe combination of Eutelsat with OneWeb is forecast to generate substantial value:Average annual revenue synergies are estimated at circa euro 150m after four years  with hybrid GEO/LEO offerings providing a premium service to customers as well as improving the fill rate.Synergies from joining organizational forces are expected to generate annual run-rate savings of over euro 80m pre-tax after five years  mostly through cost duplication avoidance.Capex optimization is expected to generate average savings estimated at circa euro 80m per annum  from year one. This would be achieved by leveraging the hybrid GEO/LEO satellite infrastructure and through the improved purchasing power of the combined entity.These sources of incremental value creation represent a balanced split between revenues  costs and capex. Taken together they equate to a net present value of over euro 1.5bn after tax (net of implementation costs).Value-creative pathway to robust  profitable growthThe transaction provides a platform for both entities to create value while transforming their respective growth profiles and cash generation potential.Combined entity would have revenues of circa euro 1.2bn and EBITDA of circa euro 0.7bn in FY22-23.Revenues are forecast to grow at low double-digit CAGR over the next decade.EBITDA is expected to grow at a mid-teen CAGR over the medium to long term  outpacing sales growth  with EBITDA margin levels moving gradually back in line with best-in-class GEO standards.The capex of the combined entity is estimated in average at some euro 725m to euro 875m  per annum  over the period FY23-24 - FY29-30.Well-funded investment programme and rapid deleveragingEutelsat's strong cash flow generation will provide both visibility and funding to develop OneWeb's fleet at minimal risk. Combined EBITDA - CAPEX  standing at circa - euro 0.2bn in FY22-23 is expected to be back in positive territory by FY24-25 - FY25-26 (depending on Gen-2 capex phasing).Eutelsat will temporarily suspend its dividend  and cash flow will be focused on the deployment of the Gen 2 constellation while maintaining a strong balance sheet.Leverage  which would stand at circa 4x net debt / EBITDA post transaction  is expected to be reduced on the back of strong EBITDA growth  backed by a disciplined financial policy  with an objective of leverage of circa 3x in the medium term.Eutelsat will pay its dividend in respect of FY21-22 with a scrip option. Thereafter  the dividend will be suspended for FY22-23 and FY23-24.Structure of the transactionThe transaction would be structured as an exchange of OneWeb shares for newly issued Eutelsat shares. This excludes the 'Special Share' in OneWeb which is retained by the UK Government together with the existing rights associated therewith. OneWeb shareholders would receive 230 million newly issued Eutelsat shares  representing 50% of Eutelsat's enlarged share capital7.The number of new Eutelsat shares to be received by existing OneWeb shareholders would not be affected by the payment of the euro 0.93 per share dividend with a scrip option for FY 21-22 to be proposed at the upcoming AGM of Eutelsat.Trading under its existing name  OneWeb will continue to operate the LEO business  with OneWeb's headquarters remaining in the UK.Eutelsat will continue to be headquartered and domiciled in France  listed on Euronext Paris and would apply for admission to the standard segment of the UK Official List of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange (subject to meeting the applicable eligibility requirements and the approval of the UK Financial Conduct Authority).A new balanced ownership and governanceThe combined entity will have a balanced ownership structure with a substantial free float alongside anchor public shareholders and supportive private investors.The Board of Directors of the combined group would consist of 15 members including ten independent directors. Seven directors  in addition to the CEO of Eutelsat  would be proposed by Eutelsat and its key shareholders and seven directors would be proposed by OneWeb and its key shareholders (the number of directors proposed by each of key Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders being commensurate to their shareholding in Eutelsat post transaction).It is contemplated that  post-closing  a shareholder agreement between Eutelsat key shareholders and OneWeb key shareholders which does not qualify as a concerted action be in place. It would in substance provide for the right for each party to propose 1 director (if its shareholding is at least 7.5%) and 2 directors (if its shareholding is at least 15%)  as well as a 6-month lock up period.Dominique D'Hinnin would be proposed as Chairman of the combined entity and Sunil Bharti Mittal as Co-Chairman (Vice-President). Eva Berneke would continue as CEO of the combined entity.Indicative timetable and next stepsThe Memorandum of Understanding has been unanimously approved by each of Eutelsat's and OneWeb's board of directors and the envisaged transaction is fully supported by both parties' long-term investors  namely Bpifrance  Fonds Strategique de Participations  Bharti  HMG  SoftBank and Hanwha. CMA CGM  a shareholder of Eutelsat  is also supporting the proposed combination. It will be submitted to the French Eutelsat Works Council information and consultation process.The Memorandum of Understanding provides for customary exclusivity commitments by Eutelsat and key Eutelsat and OneWeb shareholders.The transaction will be subject to clearance from relevant regulatory authorities.The transaction will also be conditional on approval by Eutelsat's shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of Eutelsat  to take place by end of first half 2023. Bpifrance and Fonds Strategique de Participations have undertaken to vote in favour of the transaction-related resolutions at this EGM  subject to usual conditions.The transaction is expected to close by the end of first half of 2023.AdvisorsEutelsat is assisted by d'Angelin and Co.

This kind of decision is always difficult  and we will do our best to assist affected employees.We have pioneering solutions  services and software that are key enablers in helping confront the current challenges faced by the food value chain which include inflation  labor scarcity and rising complexity. While continuously innovating to maintain our leadership in the industry  we proactively moved forward in the middle of the pandemic and ramped up sales and service coverage around the world ahead of the growth curve. We also decided to meet our customers in person and demonstrate our leadership at leading tradeshows in the quarter  where our poultry  meat and fish industries introduced over 25 new solutions that automate  digitize  and optimize food processing sustainably. Sales and marketing cost is peaking at 14% in second quarter and will move towards the 2023 target of 12%.We have actively raised prices in recent quarters. In hindsight we were too late to raise prices when faced with the inflationary environment last year. The all-time high orders reflect our strong brand and market position  being able to pass on costs in an inflationary environment that demands more automation and sustainable use of raw materials.In light of the volatility in current market conditions  we have revised our year-end 2023 EBIT target to a run-rate of 14-16% from the previously stated 16%. There is full focus and firm commitment to drive the performance improvements needed  centered on actions around productivity  procurement  and pricing. Pricing  both in the actions already enacted and in our ongoing pricing discipline  will filter into a higher revenue base. To increase productivity and ramp up revenues  we are refining our operating model to create a scalable growth platform with a sustainable cost structure. Stepping up short-term profitability and robust cash flow are key elements to fuel our ambition to become the one-stop-shop in this highly attractive growth industry and support our target of 50% of total revenues deriving from the recurring service and software business.The acquisition of Wenger  a global leader in processing solutions for the high growth markets of pet food  plant-based proteins  and aqua feed  is a platform investment which will form the fourth segment in Marel’s business model. The acquisition is expected to be margin and earnings enhancing.”Financial performanceWenger  a strategic platform acquisition successfully closed in Q2The acquisition of Wenger  a global leader in extrusion and dryer solutions focused on pet food  plant-based proteins and aqua feed  was successfully closed for a total investment of USD 540m on 9 June 2022.A platform investment into new and attractive growth markets. Led by Jesper Hjortshøj  former VP Business Development and VP Prepared Foods  this fourth business segment is reported under other in 2Q22  and as of 3Q22 will be part of segment reporting  alongside poultry  meat and fish.With over 60% of revenues from pet food  the company has a global leading position within their focus market segments and Wenger has in recent years made its mark on the fast-growing  plant-based protein consumer market with best-in-class solutions positioned right at the center point of the value chain. Wenger enjoys a strong foothold in the North American market and over 40% of revenues are recurring service and maintenance revenues. Wenger’s revenues have organically grown approximately 5% 2017-2021; revenues in 2022 are expected to be USD 190 million and EBITDA is expected to be USD 32-35 million.The two companies have complementary technology and product portfolios  where Marel will add capabilities  such as weighing  sorting  inspection  low-pressure forming and thermal treatment to strengthen the value proposition.In the 21 days since closing the transaction  Wenger accounted for around 2.9% of Marel’s total revenues in 2Q22.Third sequential quarter of record orders receivedThe demand for Marel’s pioneering solutions is on the rise evidenced by record orders received and a very strong pipeline. Need for automation and digitalization investments in food processing is accelerated by the pandemic  geopolitical tensions  rising inflation and labor scarcity.Third sequential quarter of record orders received in 2Q22 of EUR 471.8m up 11.9% QoQ and 27.1% YoY (1Q22: 421.7m  2Q21: 371.3m).

EBITDA and EBITDA margin in Q2 2021 were impacted by a net €2 million of share-based compensation and expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam. Excluding these expenses  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 18.2% year-over-year  or 8.3% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.0%  compared to 21.2% in the second quarter of 2021.As disclosed in the UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). In prior years  these revenues were recognised when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters  with a benefit of €98 million in revenue and €17 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022.In addition  as previously disclosed  Q2 2021 benefited from a catch-up payment from a digital service provider (the ""DSP Catch-Up Payment"")  amounting to €41 million in revenue and €26 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Excluding the Change in Society Accounting and DSP Catch-Up Payment  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.1% in Q2 2022  compared to 20.3% in Q2 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.H1 2022 ResultsIn the half year ended June 30  2022 (""H1 2022"")  UMG's revenues of €4 734 million increased by 23.6%  or 16.9% in constant currency  compared to the half year ended June 30  2021 (""H1 2021""). This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 27.4% to €2 608 million in H1 2022  reflecting higher revenues and revenue mix. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to 55.1% from 53.4% driven by higher artist costs from a greater proportion of Music Publishing revenues in H1 2022 as well as the impact of the DSP Catch-Up Payment and a previously disclosed exceptional recovery of an advance provision and release of historic royalties (the ""Exceptional Recovery and Release"") in the first quarter of 2021 (with a €20 million impact) that all benefited artists costs relative to revenues in the prior year period.Operating profit improved 11.8% year-over-year  or 6.7% in constant currency  to €765 million in H1 2022 driven by the growth in revenues. EBITDA amounted to €960 million  an increase of 16.8%  or 11.1% in constant currency  compared to H1 2021  also as a result of the growth in revenues.EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of €2 million during H1 2022 and by €3 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during H1 2021. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 was €962 million  up 16.6% compared to H1 2021  or 11.0% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 1.2pp year-over-year to 20.3%.Revenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 benefited from the Change in Society Accounting discussed above  amounting to €144 million in revenue and €34 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Revenue for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment described above  while EBITDA for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment and the Exceptional Recovery and Release described above.Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2% in H1 2022  compared to 20.6% in H1 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for H1 2022 amounted to €241 million compared to €452 million in H1 2021  resulting in EPS of €0.13 in H1 2022  compared to €0.25 in H1 2021. The decline in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was due to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment) and other financial investments that was an expense in H1 2022 of €567 million compared to a net expense in H1 2021 of €170 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments amongst other items  amounted to €763 million in H1 2022  compared to €578 million in H1 2021  resulting in Adjusted EPS of €0.42 in H1 2022  compared to €0.32 in H1 2021. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in EBITDA and a decline in interest and income tax expense  both driven by a €100 million benefit from two tax litigations finalized in H1 2022.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and equivalents  at the end of H1 2022 was €2 283 million compared to €2 010 million at December 31  2021.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved to €605 million in H1 2022 compared to €470 million in H1 2021  an increase of 28.7%  mainly as a result of the growth in EBITDA and favourable working capital movements. Royalty advance payments  net of recoupments grew to €223 million in H1 2022 from €130 million in H1 2021  due to the timing of major artist renewals partly offset by higher recoupment.Free cash flow decreased to €104 million in H1 2022 compared to €280 million in H1 2021  mainly as a result of the timing of catalogue acquisitions (-€221 million)  whilst the prior half year benefited from the disposal of Alamo Records (-€102 million). This was partly offset by the improvement in net cash provided by operating activities (+€122 million).UMG's dividend policy is to pay a dividend of 50% of adjusted net profit. UMG's Board of Directors declared an interim dividend for H1 2022 of €435 million  or €0.24 per share. The ex-dividend date will be on October 5  2022  the record date will be on October 6  2022 and the payment date will be on October 28  2022.Recorded MusicThree Months EndedJune 30 %%Six Months EndedJune 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.

It was the highest Q2 revenue in the group’s history.Activities outside of France are growing quickly as the rollout of fiber-optic networks is getting underway in most of the countries where Solutions 30 operates. In France  performance continues to be impacted by the operational transition linked to the maturity of certain markets and a high basis for comparison.Solutions 30’s consolidated half-year revenue for 2022 amounted to €444.4 million  up +0.7% (-1.5% on an organic basis). Revenue is stabilizing at a high level due to record deals the group signed in the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021. The COVID crisis fueled an urgent need to deploy ultra-fast broadband in France and resulted in record growth rates of over 20% for Solutions 30.Revenue by regionFrance: In the second quarter of 2022  Solutions 30 had revenue of €105.2 million  down 18.0% due to a high basis of comparison with the same quarter in 2021.With €74.7 million in revenue  the telecom business is down 18.4% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Solutions 30 is pursuing its operational transition in a market that has matured after five years of exponential growth. In addition  the geographical redeployment of one of the group’s major contracts is weighing on the operational efficiency of the French subsidiaries  especially in the southern half of France. The new parameters of this contract have added constraints on Solutions 30 and its competitors  and the Group must review its processes and methods  recruit and train its staff to obtain new authorizations  while readjusting its structures locally and preparing for the future. These adjustments  which were initiated in the second half of 2021  have continued to impact the group’s profitability  and EBITDA in France will be lower than in the second half of 2021.Story continuesFor the energy business  revenue reached €12.9 million  compared with €21.1 million a year earlier  a decline of 39% due to the end of smart electricity meter deployments in France. Activities related to electric mobility and renewable energies have been delayed due to supply chain problems and are not yet compensating for this fall in revenue.The IT business posted revenue of €11.9 million  up 9% for the quarter  while the security and payments business generated €5.7 million in revenue  compared to €4.7 million a year earlier.Over the first six months of the year  revenue amounted to €221.9 million  down 17.9%.Benelux: Revenue in the second quarter of 2022 amounted to €51.8 million compared to €37.9 million a year earlier  representing organic growth of 36.7%.The telecoms business  which grew organically by 29.7%  generated quarterly revenue of €37.4 million. The ramp-up of the contracts signed with Fiberklaar and Open Dutch Fiber in the second half of 2021 is continuing at a steady pace and sales continue to deliver  as evidenced by the recent contract signed with Unifiber.Revenue for the energy business amounted to €10.2 million  compared with €5.4 million a year earlier  representing purely organic growth of 90.9%. The deployment of smart meters in Flanders on behalf of Fluvius began during the first quarter of 2021 and is now fully developed.For the IT business  revenue was up 7.6% to €2.3 million  compared with €2.1 million a year earlier. Quarterly revenue from the retail and security businesses was €1.9 million compared to €1.6 million for the second quarter of 2021.Over the entire first half of 2022  revenue rose by 31.5% to €98.5 million.In all other countries  the group posted quarterly revenue of €64.8 million  an increase of 29.9% (18.7% organic growth) compared to the same period in 2021.In Germany  revenue amounted to €15.1 million compared to €15.3 million the previous year. The return to growth is expected in the second half of 2022  when the efforts made by the group to adapt its organization should begin to bear fruit.In Italy  revenue grew by 59% in the second quarter of 2022 to €18.4 million  driven by the deployment of TIM’s ultra-fast infrastructure deployments in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley.In Iberia  revenue grew by 8% to €14.4 million  thanks to strong momentum in the telecoms business (fiber and 5G mobile networks).In Poland  the group posted revenue of €8 million  up 34% (19% organic growth). The integration of Sirtel is proceeding well and the group continues to gain market share in this region  as demonstrated by the extension of the services the group provides to Orange.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 posted quarterly revenue of €8.7 million  up 152% (20% organic growth)  thanks to the excellent momentum in the telecoms sector and the start-up of new ultra-fast Internet and 5G deployment programs.In all of these countries  the group posted revenue of €124 million for the first half of 2022  an increase of 29.2% (18.9% organic growth) compared to the first half of 2021.Strengthening governance  risk management  and complianceSolutions 30 continues to consolidate its internal structures and in the first half of the year implemented strengthened and standardized governance  risk management  and compliance procedures.The group has published new ethics and compliance policies  and has launched an awareness and training program for its teams throughout Europe. The group’s subcontractors and suppliers are subject to systematic controls  and a dedicated team is responsible for monitoring the integrity and reliability of the group’s partners.This work is helping to transform Solutions 30. While maintaining its agility and strong entrepreneurial values  Solutions 30 is consolidating its commitments to high ethical standards  compliance  and the environment  as well as its role in society.To support this change  the Supervisory Board has decided to strengthen the powers of its committees. The Strategy Committee has been renamed the Strategy and ESG Committee. It has five independent members: Jean-Paul Cottet (President)  Caroline Tissot  Francesco Serafini  Pascale Mourvillier  and Thomas Kremer  the latter two newly appointed. With its new remit  this committee will be responsible for ensuring that environmental  social  and governance criteria are integrated into the group’s strategy with the aim of achieving sustainable and responsible growth.The Audit Committee has been renamed the Audit  Risk and Compliance Committee. It has three independent members: Yves Kerveillant (President)  Pascale Mourvillier  and now Thomas Kremer. The committee is responsible for overseeing the relevance of financial information and the reliability of risk management and internal control processes. It has been significantly strengthened by the arrival of Pascale Mourvillier and Thomas Kremer over the past six months.OutlookThe group’s operational transition in France and the ramp-up of contracts will weigh on margins in the first half of 2022  which will be lower than in the second half of 2021. In the second half of 2022  growth is expected to accelerate  although it will remain below 10% as volumes fall due to supply chain difficulties affecting certain fiber-optic markets and activities related to the energy transition. However  the group’s EBITDA should start to improve as costs from the ramp-up of new contracts are absorbed and operational processes return to normal in France.In addition  in light of current inflation  Solutions 30 has been increasing its rates  both on its new contracts and on its existing contracts  and some of these revised rates have already had an impact on Q2 revenue. The group has also taken measures to control operating costs with the aim of preserving a solid financial structure with very little debt. Such a structure will support its ability to finance its growth  increase its agility  strengthen its competitive advantages  and preserve its future capacity to pursue consolidation in its sector.In conclusion  in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty  Solutions 30 is adapting but remains cautious while maintaining its course. Organic growth and operational execution are the two priorities. As illustrated by the signature of major new contracts in several countries—especially in Belgium and Poland—the growth of activities outside France will continue in the months and years to come. In the longer term  Solutions 30 has solid growth drivers and an effective model to self-finance its development  both of which will enable it to consolidate its position at the heart of the digital transformation and the energy transition.Upcoming event2022 HY Earnings Report September 28  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

This performance was  in particular  reached thanks to the very dynamic growth in Merchant Services with a steady expansion of acquiring volumes  a solid merchants count deployment  and numerous new large merchant wins and partnerships.This strong business trends coupled with cost optimization plans  integration synergies and operating leverage  allowed the Group to deliver a 80 basis points margin expansion led  as planned  by a very significant improvement in Merchant Services profitability.In parallel  we continued to execute our strategic initiatives during the semester with the closing of three acquisitions (Axepta Italy  ANZ commercial acquiring business in Australia  and Eurobank Merchant Acquiring in Greece) which will  from now on  significantly contribute to our Merchant Services success. The disposal process of TSS is fully on track  with closing confirmed for the second half of the year. This will provide Worldline with further financial flexibility to seize consolidation opportunities in our strong M&A pipeline.Story continuesThanks to this very strong start of the year  we fully confirm our 2022 annual guidance  and reiterate our 2024 ambition to establish Worldline as a premium global Paytech at the heart of the European payment ecosystem.”H1 2022 key figuresIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Revenue* 2 020 1 794 +12.6% OMDA* 468 401 +16.7% % of revenue 23.2% 22.3% +80 bps Net income Group share from continued operations** 53 53 +0.4% % of statutory revenue from continued operations 2.6% 3.1% Normalized net income Group share from continued operations** 213 169 +26.2% % of statutory revenue from continued operations 10.5% 10.0% Free cash flow (FCF) from continued operations 229 143 +60.4% OMDA to FCF conversion rate*** 49.0% 37.3% Closing net debt (before IFRS 5)* 3 456 2 939* H1 2021 at constant scope and exchange rates** H1 2021 amounts restated in application of IFRS 5*** H1 2021 conversion rate calculated on H1 2021 statutory OMDA from continued operationsWorldline’s H1 2022 revenue reached € 2 020 million  representing a solid +12.6% revenue organic growth (of which +13.5% in Q2). This achievement was reached thanks  in particular  to the continuous growth acceleration in Merchant Services reflecting the widespread and rapid shift towards digital payments as well as the Group’s strong positioning following the acquisition of Ingenico. Mobility & e-Transactional Services also contributed to growth acceleration  delivering a strong +10.3% organic growth in Q2 after having delivered +8.4% in Q1. Financial Services was up by +3.0% in Q2 (+2.5% in Q1) despite the temporary impact from the price decrease conceded by the Group for the successful synchronous renewals of historical large contracts of Equens done in Q4 2021.This strong execution also materialized in the Group’s Operating Margin before Depreciation and Amortization (OMDA) reaching € 468 million in H1 2022; representing 23.2% of revenue  an improvement by +80 basis points compared to H1 2021 at constant scope and exchange rates. This profitability improvement was led in particular by Merchant Services posting +310 basis points thanks to the acceleration of revenue growth fostering operating leverage; synergies from Ingenico; and effects of transversal productivity improvement actions.Net loss Group share amounted to €-42 million  including a €-96 million loss attributable to discontinued operations. Net income Group share from continued operations reached € 53 million  stable year-on-year. Normalized net income Group share from continued operations (excluding unusual and infrequent items  Group share  net of tax) reached € 213 million  increasing by +26.2% or € 44 million compared to H1 2021 Normalized net income Group share (restated in application of IFRS 5).Normalized diluted EPS was € 0.76 in H1 2021 compared to € 0.59 in H1 2021 (restated in application of IFRS 5).Free cash flow from continued operations in H1 2021 was € 229 million  representing a 49.0% cash conversion of OMDA (free cash flow divided by OMDA)  in line with the expected half-yearly pattern of 2022.Group Net debt before IFRS 5 amounted to € 3 456 million at the end of June 2022  reflecting free cash flow generated over the semester on one side  as well as the cash-out for the acquisitions closed during the period on the other side.Focus on Q2 2022 revenue performanceIn € million Q2 2022 Q2 2021* Organic change Merchant Services 751 639 +17.6% Financial Services 235 228 +3.0% Mobility & e-Transactional Services 95 86 +10.3% Worldline 1 081 952 +13.5%* at constant scope and exchange ratesWorldline’s Q2 2022 revenue reached € 1 081 million  representing a strong +13.5% organic growth with all Global Business Lines contributing to growth acceleration.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services’ revenue in Q2 2022 reached € 751 million  representing an strong organic growth by +17.6%  led in particular by the strong acquiring MSV growth and new merchants gained. The growth was mainly led by:Commercial Acquiring showed a strong double-digit growth trending towards 30%  for almost all geographies and customer segments with strong dynamics and a good cash-to-card conversion trend;Payment Acceptance also contributed to the growth of Merchant Services thanks to mid-single-digit organic growth. Growth was spread in all geographies with strong volumes for SMBs and large retailers. While benefiting from a significant recovery of travel related volumes  digital commerce (representing almost half of the acceptance business) faced a more difficult situation due to the impact of the stop of Russian activities; andDigital Services grew at a high single-digit  led by a strong recovery in Germany compensating as anticipated some limited delays in POS supply during the quarter.Merchant Services performance reflects a very strong development of market positions all along the semester  notably in commercial acquiring  as illustrated by the following business KPI:Worldline’s acquiring merchant base continued to steadily grow with c. 60 000 new merchants onboarded on the Group platform over the first semester of the year  reaching 1.2 million merchants as of end of June 2022 (including Axepta Italy and Handelsbanken merchants in both H1 2022 and H1 2021). It represents a +10% increase over the semester led by a strong dynamic in both instore (+9%) and online (+14%) merchants count.Acquired MSV also continued to expand with an overall acquiring MSV reaching € 147 billion in H1 2022  up +30% versus H1 2021 and up +28% versus H1 2019. This H1 2022 MSV performance has been fuelled by market share gains in both instore (+30%) and online (+31%).During the second quarter of the year  commercial activity in Merchant Services has been strong with numerous wins for both upsell with existing clients and contracts with large new merchants such as  among others  Myra  Eram  Alpiq  Icelandair  TUI Cruises  Iberostar  or Milanoo.In Q2  Worldline continued to play actively its orchestrator role of the payment industry with numerous partnerships signed such as the one with SoftPos  enlarging Worldline offering with a new value proposition for micro merchants with mobile Tap & Pay payment solution on Android mobile devices  with Casio for the simplification of the card acceptance in Japan leveraging Casio front-end positioning on the ECR market while combining it with Vesca NSP positioning  and with .planet through a joint offering providing full-service end-to-end integrated payment solution for hospitality  featuring omnichannel capabilities and DCC services.Financial ServicesFinancial Services delivered a +3.0% organic growth in Q2 2022  a slight acceleration compared to Q1 2022 (+2.5%)  with solid revenue flows partly compensating the temporary impact from the price decrease conceded by the Group for the renewals of historical large contracts of Equens in Q4 2021. As a results  Q2 2022 revenue reached € 235 million with the following performance by division:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing altogether) benefitted from improved volume trends over the quarter and a decent level of project activities. Nevertheless  these two units decreased organically due to price reductions conceded at renewal time of large processing contracts  as planned and already disclosed;Account Payments grew at a double-digit rate in Q2  supported by increased volumes and strong project demand  notably in Germany;Digital Banking delivered a mid-single digit organic growth led by higher authentications volumes related to ecommerce transactions due to enforcement of the PSD2 regulation compensating for lower iDeal volumes in the Netherlands.During the second quarter  several Financial Services contracts were signed or renewed by Worldline  and in particular with DFM  a financing partner for enterprises within the mobility sector which chose Worldline to be their Instant Payments and Clearing & Settlement mechanism partner  and with Aegon Bank N.V. for back-office processing for handling Instant payments  SEPA batch payments and multi-currency payments. Worldline also renewed for 5 years its contract with Credit Agricole Payment Services for the management of the ACS service (Access Control Server)  enabling issuing banks to manage 3DSecure processes and to authenticate cardholders during online payments. Finally  Worldline partnered with two fintechs in the Financial Services space; manager.one to offer to corporate cardholders a seamless experience for managing their business expenses  and Algoan to offer next-level credit assessment solution for lenders & service providers.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached € 95 million in Q2 2022  up organically by +10.3%  accelerating after +8.4% in Q1. Growth was spread in each of the three divisions:Trusted Digitization in particular strongly grew double-digit with several new projects and improving volumes in France  as well as higher volumes in Tax collection and digital healthcare in Latin America. The division also benefited from more support and project activity on eHealth solutions in Germany and increasing activity in Spain.e-Ticketing also grew at a double-digit rate thanks to higher transportation volumes and fare collection in the UK and as well as in Latin America where the activity also benefited from ticket tariff increases.e-Consumer & Mobility growth was supported in particular by the ramp-up of newly signed Contact contracts and the sale of solutions for connected vehicles.Commercial activity in Mobility & e-Transactional Services was strong in Q2  notably with a 6-year duration agreement with GTR  the UK’s largest railway operator delivering 24% of all passenger rail journeys has awarded Worldline with for the continued support of their booking office and on-board ticket issuing systems. Worldline was also selected by a large French metropole to build and operate the first project in France to incentive drivers to use more ecological virtuous transport mode  with a target of reducing up to 7% the traffic during peak hours  relieving the traffic and improving the air quality. In Trusted Services  GIE Sesam Vitale  the French public operator in charge of digitizing reimbursements covered by public health insurance in France has chosen Worldline to set up a large-scale SecNumCloud project  for the hosting and operation of the mobile application replacing the existing card centric system.H1 2022 OMDA performance per Global Business LineOMDA OMDA % In € million H1 2022 H1 2021* Organic change H1 2022 H1 2021* Organic change Merchant Services 352 264 +33.1% 25.5% 22.4% +310 bps Financial Services 123 129 -5.0% 26.8% 29.0% -220 bps Mobility & e-Transactional Services 26 25 +2.6% 13.9% 14.9% -90 bps Corporate costs -32 -18 +82.7% -1.6% -1.0% -60 bps Worldline 468 401 +16.7% 23.2% 22.3% +80 bps* at constant scope and exchange ratesMerchant ServicesMerchant Services’ OMDA in H1 2022 amounted to € 352 million  25.5% of revenue  representing a strong improvement by +310 basis points.

They fear the tape could eat into lucrative revenues from trading data — possibly even pushing smaller exchanges out of business.This is an existential question for exchanges  both large and small  because they make much of their money from selling data.Exchanges say they have a better idea — a “post-trade” shares tape where information on prices is published with a 15-minute delay — as they lobby hard against more extensive versions.Yet those arguments may now be falling short. Both EU capitals and now the leading MEP working on the legislation are discussing a real-time tape with at least some pre-trade information on bids and offers before a trade takes place. Polish MEP Danuta Hübner says the tape would only be of value to investors if it includes pre-trade data  according to an explanatory note seen by POLITICO recently.Accordingly  ""it is essential that the equity tape contains real-time  pre-trade information  necessary to inform investors’ trading decisions "" says the note  which provides an overview of Hübner’s draft report.Exchanges and other trading venues face mandatory submissions to the tape in exchange for a slice of the revenues generated from subscriptions from investors.Hübner's plans would still offer some relief to smaller stock exchanges  which would be exempt from those submissions under certain conditions. However  they could also choose to opt in and gain a larger proportion of the revenues.Meanwhile  EU capitals are reviewing a proposal put forward by the French Council presidency in June that would also include voluntary pre-trade contributions.The pre-trade inclusion is a major blow for the larger exchanges  such as Deutsche Börse and Euronext  where that data forms a bigger part of their revenues. As they see it  a consolidated tape that hoovers up pre-trade data would dent their business models.It also goes further than the European Commission's initial proposals for a shares tape with post-trade information as close to real-time as possible amid concerns there may not be enough commercial demand.""We will continue to advocate for a package of market structure measures which bolster transparency  alongside a well-calibrated [tape] "" said a spokesperson for the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE)  the leading industry body. ""But not one that publishes pre-trade data  creating an illusory view of the market  ripe for arbitrage by major institutional players to the detriment of retail investors.""Political minefieldThe fight over the tape has turned into one of the thorniest issues in financial services policy. The legislation has become a political minefield in Brussels  as national interests combine forces with competing industry lobbies to create political blocks.Germany and a large number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe support the exchanges lobby due to fears about the impact of the tape on their domestic exchanges  which can be crucially important to local economies.On the other side are countries like the Netherlands and Ireland  which support an ambitious ticker tape on grounds it'll boost transparency across disparate markets and help the EU achieve one of its major political goals: a capital markets union where investment flows freely across borders.But it's not as simple as being for and against. The debate is also complicated by another bitter fight between exchanges and investment banks over how much trading should take place on “lit” or “dark” markets. (""Lit"" refers to trading done in the open and on exchanges  while ""dark"" trades are done confidentially  in private ""dark pools"" or facilitated by investment banks.)Exchanges generally oppose the growth in dark trading on grounds that it should only be available for large block trades that could move the market. The industry lobby wants the EU to force some of the trading that investment banks conduct internally with clients back to public markets.""While we agree with the need to address liquidity fragmentation  the tape is not the solution "" said the FESE spokesman. ""Only a proper market structure can address fragmentation. In fact  the issue is the extent to which banks are able to internalise trading on their own books.""Investment banks  meanwhile  argue the EU needs a variety of trading venues  and warn against imposing ""undue restrictions"" that could damage liquidity and limit investors' choices.""Banks  as market makers  are an essential part of this ecosystem  committing their balance sheets to provide liquidity to financial markets "" said Adam Farkas  chief executive at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME). ""This intermediation is vital to help support market depth and liquidity throughout changing market conditions.""Hübner tries to strike a balance in her draft report. In a concession to exchanges  she proposes creating more transparency before trades take place by increasing the threshold for the use of price waivers and limiting investment banks’ ability to quote below that level for their own internal trading systems. But she would also scrap existing caps on dark trading  which she describes as of “limited utility” — a move favored by investment banks.Eking out some winsHübner's compromise on dark trading isn't the only example where exchanges have been able to hold some ground. They also may come out ahead in a related fight over ""payment for order flow"" (PFOF) — an innovation that allows online apps to offer retail investors a commission-free service while earning money by directing their share orders to select brokers.Exchanges have been backing a Commission proposal to ban PFOF altogether  which may again move trades away from public markets. Brussels had pitched the ban within its capital markets reforms due to concerns over conflicts of interest after the practice came under scrutiny during the GameStop trading frenzy in the U.S.Among EU capitals  Germany — home to many of the fintech platforms using PFOF — has been unyielding in its opposition to a ban. But it's now finding itself increasingly isolated as other countries back the ban.The French presidency initially tried to keep everyone happy by marrying the continued use of PFOF with a pre-trade tape to test the value the model provides for investors  but there was opposition from both sides and the proposal quickly died.For her part  Hübner is keeping the ban on the table. So while the exchanges stare down the momentum behind a more ambitious tape  they won't lose out completely if more trading is hauled back into the light.",negative,0.02,0.08,0.91,negative,0.01,0.09,0.9,True,English,"['EU ticker tape', 'Stock exchanges', 'worst nightmare', 'support', 'Polish MEP Danuta Hübner', 'French Council presidency', 'Deutsche Börse', 'enough commercial demand', 'major institutional players', 'competing industry lobbies', 'voluntary pre-trade contributions', 'financial services policy', 'private ""dark pools', 'leading industry body', 'capital markets union', 'market structure measures', 'large block trades', 'proper market structure', 'major political goals', 'European Securities Exchanges', 'disparate trading venues', 'other trading venues', 'investors’ trading decisions', 'smaller stock exchanges', 'ambitious ticker tape', 'EU stock trades', 'real-time, pre-trade information', 'leading MEP', 'dark"" trades', 'major blow', 'disparate markets', 'industry lobby', 'ambitious plan', 'European Commission', 'large number', 'other side', 'financial markets', 'dark” markets', 'pre-trade inclusion', 'Political minefield', 'political blocks', 'smaller exchanges', 'public markets', 'dark trading', 'price feed', 'Daniel Roland/AFP', 'Getty Images', 'existential question', 'post-trade” shares', '15-minute delay', 'extensive versions', 'pre-trade data', 'draft report', 'larger proportion', 'bigger part', 'initial proposals', 'post-trade information', 'illusory view', 'thorniest issues', 'national interests', 'local economies', 'undue restrictions', 'market makers', 'essential part', 'balance sheets', 'Adam Farkas', 'chief executive', 'retail investors', ""investors' choices"", 'larger exchanges', 'exchanges lobby', 'domestic exchanges', 'consolidated tape', 'real-time tape', 'equity tape', 'shares tape', 'EU capitals', 'trading data', 'greatest fears', 'explanatory note', 'mandatory submissions', 'business models', 'bitter fight', 'FESE spokesman', 'investment banks', 'Eastern Europe', 'lucrative revenues', 'liquidity fragmentation', 'calls', 'momentum', 'Brussels', 'money', 'idea', 'prices', 'arguments', 'legislation', 'bids', 'offers', 'place', 'value', 'POLITICO', 'overview', 'slice', 'subscriptions', 'plans', 'relief', 'conditions', 'June', 'Euronext', 'concerns', 'package', 'transparency', 'spokesperson', 'Federation', 'arbitrage', 'detriment', 'forces', 'Germany', 'countries', 'Central', 'impact', 'Netherlands', 'Ireland', 'grounds', 'borders', 'debate', 'open', 'growth', 'clients', 'need', 'solution', 'fact', 'extent', 'books', 'variety', 'ecosystem', 'Association', 'AFME']",2022-07-26,2022-07-27,politico.eu

Improving our financial performance across the portfolio  growing our footprint in gas and industrial in Asia and China and accelerating towards new energies and sustainable feedstocks in Europe.EBITDA of EUR 433 million (HY1 2021: EUR 403 million). Adjusted for EUR 25 million positive currency translation effects  EBITDA increased by EUR 5 million. Positive revenue developments were offset by higher costs related to surging energy and utility prices. Growth project contribution in the first half 2022 continued to support EBITDA development.Costs of EUR 340 million (HY1 2021: EUR 301 million) due to surging energy prices (EUR 17 million)  currency translation effect (EUR 13 million) and cost for growth projects and business development.Proportional occupancy rate of 86% (HY1 2021: 88%) due to continued soft storage markets for oil compared to last year. There was an improvement from Q1 2022 (84%) driven mainly by Europe and Africa performance.EBIT of EUR 257 million (HY1 2021: EUR 245 million)  adjusted for EUR 18 million positive currency translation effects  EBIT decreased by EUR 6 million. Depreciation charges were higher in HY1 2022 compared to HY1 2021 mainly due to an increase in commissioned assets.Proportional operating cash return of 11.4% driven by lower operating capex during HY1 2022.Net profit attributable to holders of ordinary shares of EUR 128 million (HY1 2021: EUR 149 million). Tax charges increased as a result of the reversal of the deferred tax assets in the Netherlands.The senior net debt : EBITDA ratio is 2.86 at the end of HY1 2022  within our previously communicated ambition to keep senior net debt to EBITDA in the range of around 2.5-3.0x.Exceptional items HY1 2022:Vopak has recorded asset impairment charges of EUR 468 million.The valuations for impaired assets take into account: Impact on long-term financial projections for revenue and current dynamics related to inflation pressure  utility prices  labor and material costs and among others transition in the energy market associated with the Russia-Ukraine war. Vopak's proactive approach to repurpose some of its existing assets in line with the strategic priorities in which the growth of the company will be focused on its industrial and gas terminals  and accelerate towards new energies and sustainable feedstocks. The most recent energy transition scenarios in the OECD countries and a revised asset valuation methodology for oil assets.A breakdown of the total impairment charges is stated below: Europoort - EUR 240 million: By accelerating into new energies and repurposing some of its assets  Vopak Energy Terminal in Rotterdam (Europoort) will reduce its capacity by 2030 and will use the available land for new energy investments. Over time  this will reduce Vopak's exposure in oil assets in line with our ambition to increase the relative exposure of industrials  gas and new energies. Transition in the energy markets is expected to impact the long term revenue prospects of Europoort’s current activities  in addition to current dynamics related to inflation pressure  utility prices  labor and material costs. Botlek - EUR 190 million: Botlek terminal is below Vopak’s minimum return levels which is driven by lower revenue projections in addition to challenging conditions related to among others inflation pressure  utility prices and labor costs. SPEC LNG Colombia - EUR 36 million: Due to weather conditions in recent years which have brought a significant amount of rain in Colombia  hydropower has been available as the main source of power  which resulted in a reduced utilization of the FSRU. In addition  the tight FSRU market associated with the Russia - Ukraine war is leading to the opportunity to reduce FSRU costs becoming remote. As a result of the above there is a decrease in dividend expectations. This exceptional charge is recorded under Result joint ventures and associates in the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.For more details on the exceptional items reference is made to note 4 of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.These non-cash exceptional charges have no impact on the leverage ratio and covenants level.R oyal Vopak Chief Executive Officer Dick Richelle comments:“In the first half of 2022  we announced Vopak’s strategic priorities and financial framework on which we acted accordingly. These priorities are:- Improve the performance of our portfolio- Grow our base in industrial and gas terminals- Accelerate towards new energies and sustainable feedstocksWe revised our assets value and booked asset impairment charges of EUR 468 million. This has no impact on the execution of our strategy  dividend policy or leverage ratio target. We are focused on executing and accelerating the energy transition by taking a proactive approach towards repurposing some of our existing assets.We improved the performance of our portfolio by reporting an EBITDA of EUR 433 million. We closed the sale of our 4 Canadian terminals emphasizing our strong focus on cash generation across the portfolio.We are advancing well in growing our base in industrial and gas. The successful completion of the Indian joint venture with Aegis  positions us as the largest storage provider for LPG and chemicals in India. On LNG  our Gate terminal is fulfilling an important role in the energy security of Northwest Europe and we were able to increase its sendout capacity by 30%. In China we expanded again our industrial terminal capacity. In total we now have a global network of 15 industrial terminals.We are making progress in accelerating towards new energies and sustainable feedstocks. Particularly in Rotterdam we announced some important milestones as our opportunities for developing hydrogen infrastructure are accelerating. This builds  among others  on our strong base of ammonia storage at several strategic locations around the world. We are investigating together with partners to develop a liquid hydrogen supply chain from Portugal to Rotterdam. Together with partners we are developing an import terminal for ammonia as a hydrogen carrier in Rotterdam. These new energy projects are an integral part of our ambitious Sustainable Roadmap.We improved our results in the first half in the volatile energy market environment and have momentum in execution towards our strategic priorities. With a growing world population and at the same time the need for decarbonization  we foresee a rising demand for our independent infrastructure solutions. We have a unique global network of strategic locations  highly competent people and long term partnerships. We will continue transforming our portfolio and position our company in leading locations towards more sustainable forms of energy and feedstocks.”Q2 2022 key events :On 25 May 2022  Vopak announced the successful completion of the Indian partnership with Aegis. Aegis Vopak Terminals will become the largest independent storage provider company for LPG and chemicals in India.On 30 June 2022  Vopak successfully renewed its EUR 1 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility (RCF) with a syndicate of 12 international relationship banks. The new RCF is linked to our performance on three key topics from Vopak’s sustainability roadmap: our safety performance  gender diversity in senior management and the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions.In the second quarter  the Caojing industrial terminal in Shanghai (China) commissioned 65 000 cbm of new storage capacity  of which 40 800 cbm relates to ammonia storage.Other key developments:Regrettably  a tragic incident occurred at our Caojing terminal  in China on 6 July 2022. A Vopak employee fell into water and drowned. An extensive tripod investigation to determine the root cause is currently being conducted. Safety is and will remain our first and foremost priority.On 6 July 2022  Gate terminal announced that it will take 3 initiatives to further strengthen its position in the security of supply of Northwest Europe. The terminal will increase its truck loading capabilities and send-out capacity  and initiate an open season for an additional 4 BCM per annum.Vopak has signed an agreement with partners to study the feasibility of producing  liquifying and transporting green hydrogen from Portugal to the Netherlands  where it would then be stored and distributed for sale. The consortium envisions hydrogen being produced by electrolysis from renewable power in the industrial zone of the Sines port. Then the hydrogen is liquified and shipped via a liquid hydrogen carrier to the port of Rotterdam for distribution and sale. The aim is to deliver a first shipment of liquid hydrogen from Sines to Rotterdam by 2027.Vopak and Gasunie will jointly develop future open access hydrogen import terminal infrastructure through a cooperation agreement. Terminal infrastructure is essential for importing green hydrogen to reach the European Green Deal targets. As part of that agreement  Gasunie  HES International (HES) and Vopak will be working together to develop an import terminal for green ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. The terminal  which will operate on the Maasvlakte under the name ACE Terminal  will be operational from 2026.Portfolio items :In April 2022  Vopak completed the sale of its 33% shareholding in German LNG Terminal GmbH  as a result an impairment reversal of EUR 3.8 million was recorded.In May 2022  Vopak completed the earlier announced divestment of its 100% shareholding in Vopak Terminals of Canada Inc. and Vopak Terminals of Eastern Canada Inc. As a result  an exceptional gain of EUR 5.7 million was recognized.Looking ahead:Vopak aims to improve the performance of the portfolio and targets an operating cash return of at least 10% by 2025. Current expectation for FY 2022 operating cash return is around 9.5%  subject to market conditions and currency exchange. Operating cash return is defined as proportional operating cash flow over average proportional capital employed and reflects the increased importance of free cash flow and joint ventures in our portfolio.Vopak expects to deliver EBITDA (excluding exceptional items) in the range of EUR 830 million to EUR 850 million in FY 2022 factoring continued volatility in the energy market  inflation and utility prices pressure subject to market conditions and currency exchange.Given the surging energy and utility prices  and currency exchange movements we expect to manage the 2022 cost base including additional costs for new growth projects around EUR 690 million in line with EUR 645 million which as previously communicated was subject to currency exchange and utilities price movements.In 2022  growth investments are expected to be below EUR 300 million. The allocation of these investments will be through existing committed projects  new business development and pre-FID (Final Investment Decision) feasibility studies in new energies including hydrogen.For the period 2020-2022  Vopak expects to be at the higher end of the range EUR 750 million to EUR 850 million for sustaining and service improvement capex  subject to additional discretionary decisions  policy changes and regulatory requirements.As part of the strategic direction for the period 2020-2022  Vopak indicated to invest annually up to a maximum of EUR 45 million in IT capex  to complete Vopak’s digital terminal management system. We expect to complete the roll out of our Vopak Terminal System to our terminal network and joint ventures by the end of 2023.Vopak aims to generate strong cash flow and is committed to a disciplined allocation of capital by targeting a robust balance sheet. Vopak’s strategy  dividend policy and leverage ratio target are unchanged.Impact of the Russia-Ukraine war:The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a major humanitarian drama and we sympathize with the people who are now suffering from the violence of war.Vopak is monitoring the situation closely and is fully committed to adhere to relevant sanctions laws and regulations. As governments try to ensure energy security and affordability  Vopak follows applicable government regulations with regard to energy imports from Russia.The Russia-Ukraine war and the international sanction regimes make the market situation volatile and uncertain. Direct impact is assessed to be mainly in Vopak's Europoort terminal and to be limited on Vopak’s group level. There is  however  an indirect exposure through factors such as utility prices  inflation  market conditions and exchange rates which was considered during the individual asset revaluation performed in the second quarter of 2022.Impact of Covid-19 pandemic in 2022:The pandemic spread of Covid-19 remains an impactful event in several regions around the world  such as China. Our first priority in the Covid-19 response continues to be to protect the health and well-being of our people  their families and the communities in which we operate. Also in times of crisis  Vopak plays an important role within society by storing vital products with care.Financial calendar11 November 2022 Publication of 2022 third-quarter interim update15 February 2023 Publication of 2022 annual results26 April 2023 Publication of 2023 first-quarter interim update26 April 2023 Annual General Meeting2 August 2023 Publication of 2023 half year results3 November 2023 Publication of 2023 third-quarter interim updateDisclaimerAny statement  presentation or other information contained herein that relates to future events  goals or conditions is  or should be considered  a forward-looking statement.

We are very satisfied with this performance  which was achieved despite a particularly high basis of comparison in 2021 and a very unsettled macroeconomic environment. Adjusted like-for-like growth even accelerated in the second quarter  led by the structural digitalization of our market and the Group's robust and diversified client portfolio.The strong recovery of TLScontact's visa application management business also contributed to this good performance. The Group’s recent strategic acquisitions in the United States  Health Advocate and Senture  were successfully integrated and made a significant contribution to first-half revenue growth. Thus  despite the sharp decline in the contribution of Covid support contracts to first-half 2022 revenue  EBITA margin continued to improve in line with the annual target.On the strength of this encouraging first half  taking into account the uncertain economic environment and ever-present health risk  we confirm our 2022 targets of like-for-like revenue growth of more than +5%  or more than +10% excluding the impact of the Covid support contracts  and a 30-basis point increase in EBITA margin.""INTERIM FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS€ millions H1 2022 H1 2021 €1=US$1.09 €1=US$1.21 Revenue 3 946 3 431 Reported growth +15.0% Like-for-like growth +5.5% Like-for-like change excluding non-recurring items* +12.9% EBITDA before non-recurring items 792 678 % of revenue 20.1% 19.8% EBITA before non-recurring items 566 479 % of revenue 14.3% 14.0% EBIT 438 398 Net profit – Group share 274 255 Diluted earnings per share (€) 4.60 4.31 Net free cash flow 325 333* Excluding the impact of the change in revenue from Covid support contractsFIRST-HALF AND SECOND-QUARTER 2022 REVENUEConsolidated revenueFirst half 2022 revenue came in at €3 946 million  representing a year-on-year increase of +5.5% at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation (like-for-like) and of +15.0% as reported. Reported revenue was lifted by the +€159 million positive currency effect  stemming mainly from the rise in the US dollar against the euro. Changes in the scope of consolidation had a +€160 million positive impact  reflecting the consolidation of Health Advocate from July 1  2021 and of Senture from January 1  2022.Like-for-like growth in first-half 2022 was particularly strong given the negative impact of lower revenue from Covid support contracts (down -€266 million compared with first-half 2021)  which was expected. Adjusted for this non-recurring impact  like-for-like growth stood at +12.9% for the period. The very strong momentum was driven by structural digitalization of the market and by the Group’s robust and diversified client portfolio. Growth in the social media  healthcare  and travel sectors was particularly brisk. The Specialized Services activity also enjoyed sustained growth  helped by the resounding recovery of TLScontact’s visa application management business.Revenue for the second quarter of 2022 amounted to €1 984 million  up +15.4%  including a favorable currency effect linked mainly to the rise in the US dollar against the euro and a scope effect linked to the consolidation of Health Advocate and Senture in the Group's accounts. Growth was +4.5% on a like-for-like basis compared to second-quarter 2021. This performance  which came on the back of +6.5% like-for-like growth in first-quarter 2022  was very satisfactory given the sharp drop in the contribution of Covid support contracts. Adjusted for this non-recurring impact  like-for-like growth was +14.5% in second-quarter 2022 versus +11.1% in the first quarter  reflecting increased momentum across both of the Group's activities.Revenue by activityH1 2022 H1 2021 % change € millions Like-for-like Reported CORE SERVICES & D.I.B.S.* 3 412 3 075 +3.8% +10.9% English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP) 1 175 992 +1.2% +18.5% Ibero-LATAM 1 098 895 +17.0% +22.6% Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA) 875 977 -9.5% -10.4% India 264 211 +18.0% +24.8% SPECIALIZED SERVICES 534 356 +19.3% +50.1% TOTAL 3 946 3 431 +5.5% +15.0% Adjusted like-for-like growth** +12.9%Q2 2022 Q2 2021 % change € millions Like-for-like Reported CORE SERVICES & D.I.B.S.* 1 700 1 539 +2.2% +10.5% English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP) 576 484 +0.5% +18.9% Ibero-LATAM 573 454 +17.7% +26.2% Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA) 416 495 -15.3% -16.0% India 135 106 +18.9% +28.0% SPECIALIZED SERVICES 284 180 +22.9% +57.7% TOTAL 1 984 1 719 +4.5% +15.4% Adjusted like-for-like growth** +14.5%* Digital Integrated Business Services** Excluding the impact of the change in revenue from Covid support contractsCore Services & Digital Integrated Business Services (D.I.B.S.)Core Services & D.I.B.S. revenue amounted to €3 412 million in first-half 2022  a year-on-year increase of +3.8%. Reported growth came to +10.9%  with the difference versus like-for-like growth primarily attributable to the rise against the euro in the US dollar and most other currencies including the Brazilian real  the Indian rupee  the pound sterling  the Mexican peso and the Colombian peso. In addition  reported growth includes the contribution of Senture  which has been consolidated in the Group's financial statements from January 1  2022.Second-quarter 2022 revenue rose by +2.2% like-for-like versus the prior-year period. The slower growth compared to first-quarter 2022 (+5.4%) was mainly due to the sharply lower contribution of Covid support contracts to Group revenue. Excluding the impact of Covid support contracts  the Core Services & D.I.B.S. activity delivered double-digit growth in first-half 2022  with an acceleration in the second quarter compared to the first. This solid momentum was supported by further structural digitalization of the market and the Group’s robust client portfolio spread across a wide variety of sectors. The Group performed particularly well in the social media  online entertainment and food services  healthcare and travel sectors.English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP)EWAP region revenue came to €1 175 million in first-half 2022  up +1.2% like-for-like. The reported increase of +18.5% was primarily attributable to favorable currency effects – corresponding to the rise against the euro in the US dollar and  to a lesser extent  in the Indian rupee as well as in the pound sterling– and the positive impact of consolidating Senture from January 1  2022.Second-quarter 2022 revenue was globally stable versus the first quarter  rising by +0.5% like-for-like. Growth was dampened by the sharp decline in the revenue contribution of Covid support contracts in the United Kingdom. Excluding Covid support contracts  like-for-like growth was in the double digits.After staging a recovery in the second half of 2021  the North American market continued to enjoy renewed momentum in first-half 2022  both in the domestic market and in the Philippines (offshore). In particular  revenue in the social media  online entertainment  travel and financial services sectors grew at a brisk pace.Ibero-LATAMFirst-half 2022 revenue for the Ibero-LATAM region amounted to €1 098 million  a year-on-year increase of +17.0% like-for-like. The reported increase of +22.6% mainly reflected the rise in the US dollar  Brazilian real  Mexican peso and Colombian peso against the euro. Like-for-like revenue growth in the second quarter came to +17.7%.Business in the region grew at a rapid pace throughout the first half against a high basis of comparison  particularly in the social media  online entertainment  healthcare  financial services and travel sectors.Growth rates were high in all the countries of the region in the first half  led by Argentina  Peru  Dominican Republic and Guatemala (nearshore activities)  as well as in Honduras and Nicaragua  where the Group recently launched operations. Multilingual activities in Spain and Portugal  on behalf of global leaders of the digital economy  continue to expand rapidly.Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA)Revenue in the CEMEA region amounted to €875 million in first-half 2022  a year-on-year decline of -9.5% like-for-like and of -10.4% as reported  with the difference corresponding to negative currency effects due to the depreciation of the Turkish lira against the euro. Revenue contracted by -15.3% in second-quarter 2022 on a like-for-like basis  due to the sharp decline in the contribution from Covid support contracts in the Netherlands  France and Germany.Excluding the impact of the Covid support contracts  first-half 2022 business growth in the region was strong  with the start-up of new contracts driving a clear acceleration in the second quarter compared with the first. Business with multinational clients  particularly in the travel  automotive  financial services and online entertainment sectors  was brisk over the period. This was particularly the case in Romania  Egypt  Poland and the German-speaking market (domestic activities excluding Covid support contracts and nearshore activities).IndiaIn first-half 2022  operations in India generated €264 million in revenue  up +18.0% like-for-like from the prior-year period and by +24.8% as reported  taking into account the positive currency effect corresponding to the appreciation of the Indian rupee against the euro. Like-for-like revenue growth in the second quarter came to +18.9%.Offshore activities  which are the region’s main source of revenue and include high value-added solutions  continued to grow rapidly. They benefited from the dynamism of the Group’s client base of global leaders in the buoyant travel  consumer electronics  healthcare  internet  online entertainment and e-tailing sectors. Revenue in the automotive sector also grew rapidly during the period.Specialized ServicesRevenue from Specialized Services stood at €534 million in first-half 2022  a year-on-year increase of +19.3% like-for-like and of +50.1% as reported. The difference between like-for-like and reported growth stemmed from a favorable currency effect linked to the increase in value of the US dollar against the euro and a positive scope effect due to the consolidation of Health Advocate in the consolidated financial statements since July 1  2021. Like-for-like revenue growth in second-quarter 2022 came to +22.9%.Faster revenue growth in the second quarter was mainly due to the resounding recovery in TLScontact volumes and also reflected the very favorable prior-period basis of comparison. In particular  UK visa applications managed by TLScontact in first-half 2022 exceeded pre-crisis levels. Business in the Schengen area continued to trend upwards  but remained below pre-crisis levels  primarily due to the dearth of inbound travelers from China. The recovery in revenue is expected to continue in the second half of the year  albeit at a slower pace than in the first half due to the higher basis of comparison.LanguageLine Solutions  the main contributor to Specialized Services revenue  grew at a satisfactory rate  especially in the healthcare sector which accounts for more than half of its revenue  although growth rates were dampened by a high basis of comparison  especially in the spring 2021. The basis of comparison will be lower in the second half.The rapid growth of debt collection activities in North America (AllianceOne) during the first half of the year was supported by the robust business momentum enjoyed since last year  particularly in nearshore activities.FIRST-HALF 2022 RESULTSEBITDA before non-recurring items stood at €792 million for first-half 2022  up +16.7% from the prior-year period.EBITA before non-recurring items rose by +18.2% to €566 million from €479 million in first-half 2021  representing a margin of 14.3% versus 14.0% in the prior-year period. The improved margin was primarily attributable to the stability of margin rates in the Core Services & D.I.B.S activities  despite the negative effect of the sharply lower contribution of Covid support contracts  and higher Specialized Services margins  lifted by the resounding recovery of TLScontact’s activities. Reported margins were also boosted by the rise in the dollar against the euro with a positive transaction effect linked to the Group's offshore activities and a positive translation effect (mix).Earnings by activityEBITA before non-recurring items H1 2022 H1 2021 € millions CORE SERVICES & D.I.B.S.* 398 374 % of revenue 11.7% 12.2% English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP) 97 57 % of revenue 8.2% 5.7% Ibero-LATAM 133 113 % of revenue 12.1% 12.7% Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA) 83 138 % of revenue 9.5% 14.1% India 46 35 % of revenue 17.5% 16.7% Holding companies 39 31 SPECIALIZED SERVICES 168 105 % of revenue 31.5% 29.4% TOTAL 566 479 % of revenue 14.3% 14.0%* Digital Integrated Business ServicesCore Services & D.I.B.S.For Core Services & D.I.B.S.  EBITA before non-recurring items came to €398 million in first-half 2022  versus €374 million in the prior-year period. EBITA margin stood at 11.7% versus 12.2% in first-half 2021  reflecting contrasting trends by region  with some regions particularly affected by the lower contribution from Covid support contracts.English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP)The EWAP region generated EBITA before non-recurring items of €97 million in first-half 2022  compared with €57 million in the prior year period. EBITA margin rose sharply  to 8.2% from 5.7% in first-half 2021. The increase in margins mainly reflected the renewed momentum in the North American market observed in late 2021 and confirmed throughout the first half of 2022  in particular for offshore activities in the Philippines.Ibero-LATAMEBITA before non-recurring items in the Ibero-LATAM region rose to €133 million in first-half 2022 from €113 million in the prior-year period. while EBITA margin stood at 12.1%  versus 12.7% in 2021. The period-on-period decline was due to the development costs incurred for the opening and the ramp up of numerous new sites to support the rapid pace of business growth  especially in Peru and Colombia.Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA)EBITA before non-recurring items in the CEMEA region came to 83 million in first-half 2022  versus €138 million in first-half 2021  yielding a margin of 9.5% versus 14.1% one year earlier. The decline in EBITA margin was mainly due to the sharp drop in the contribution from Covid support contracts in the Netherlands  France and Germany  which had a very positive impact on the region's margin in first-half 2021.IndiaEBITA before non-recurring items in the India region rose to €46 million in first-half 2022 from €35 million the year before. EBITA margin rose to 17.5% from 16.7% in first-half 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the very rapid growth in the highly profitable offshore activity.Specialized ServicesSpecialized Services EBITA before non-recurring items came to €168 million in first-half 2022  versus €105 million in the same period of 2021. EBITA margin expanded to 31.5% from 29.4% in first-half 2021.This good performance mainly reflects the return of TLScontact's operating margins to levels close to those achieved pre-Covid-19  following a strong recovery in business volumes  satisfactory growth in premium ancillary services and implementation of cost-cutting measures during the crisis. TLScontact's margins were very low in first-half 2021  because the travel restrictions and border closures imposed since March 2020 were not lifted until May 2021.LanguageLine Solutions continued to enjoy high margins in first-half 2022  reflecting satisfactory business growth backed by an efficient business model based on entirely home-based interpreters  unrivaled technological tools and a very assertive marketing process.Other income statement itemsEBIT amounted to €438 million  versus €398 million one year earlier. It included in particular:• €70 million in amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions;• the €51 million book cost of performance share plans.The financial result represented a net expense of €52 million  versus €44 million one year earlier.Income tax expense came to €112 million  corresponding to an effective tax rate of 29.1%  versus 28.1% in the prior-year period.Net profit – Group share totaled €274 million  versus €255 million in first-half 2021  while diluted earnings per share came to €4.60  versus €4.31.Cash flows and financial structureNet free cash flow after lease expenses  interest and tax paid amounted to €325 million  versus €333 million the year before.The change in consolidated working capital requirement was an outflow of €40 million in first-half 2022  compared with an outflow of €38 million in the year earlier period.Net capital expenditure amounted to €150 million  or 3.8% of revenue  versus €98 million and 2.9% in first-half 2021. The increase corresponds to expenditure to develop a hybrid model combining work-from-home and on-site solutions throughout the world (see Operating Highlights).After paying €194 million in dividends  net debt stood at €2 633 million at June 30  2022.OPERATING HIGHLIGHTSExpansion of the global footprint and deployment of work-from-home solutionsIn first-half 2022  Teleperformance continued to deploy its global expansion strategy in the structurally growing outsourced customer and citizen experience management market despite the uncertain economic context.

The main changes were as follows:The c ore exposure effect was a positive 25 million euros in first-half 2022 versus a positive 75 million euros in first-half 2021  reflecting higher average copper prices over the period before the decrease in late June.Reorganization costs amounted to 19 million euros in first-half 2022 versus 33 million euros in first-half 2021. In 2022  this amount mainly included costs from the conversion of the Charleston plant in the United States as well as costs related to new transformation actions launched during the period.Net asset impairment represented an expense of 13 million euros in first-half 2022 versus an expense of 15 million euros in first-half 2021. In the first semester of 2022  the impairment losses were related to tangible assets in Ukraine: this impairment derives from the update of the discount rate used  whereas no change was made to the flows in the business plan. In the first six months of 2021  impairment losses for 15 million euros were recorded relative to tangible assets in Lebanon.Net gain on asset s disposals amounted to 54 million euros in first-half 2022  mainly related to the sale of the Hanover property in Germany  with a net impact of 55 million euros.Other operating income and expenses represented net income of 38 million euros  compared with a net expense of 19 million euros in first-half 2021. The main items are the net asset impairments and the net gain on asset disposals mentioned above.Net financial expense amounted to 14 million euros in first-half 2022 compared with 34 million euros during the same period last year. The increase is mainly related to the swing in impairment on certain financial investments (positive for 5 million euros in the first six-months of 2022 versus a negative 13 million euros in first-half 2021)  as well as to the positive hyperinflation impact from Turkey for 3 million euros.The Group’s net income landed at 199 million euros for first-half 2022  versus net income of 81 million euros for the comparative period. The 2022 figure corresponds to 250 million euros in income before taxes (versus 133 million euros in first-half 2021). Income tax expense stood at 51 million euros  in line with the tax expense of 52 million euros in first-half 2021  as part of 2022 income before taxes is not fully taxed in some countries with deferred tax losses.The Group ended the period with attributable net income of 197 million euros versus attributable net income of 81 million euros in first-half 2021.Net debt increased to 346 million euros at June 30  2022  from 74 million euros at December 31st  2021  reflecting in particular:Cash from operations of +271 million euros;Reorganization cash outflows of -33 million euros  one third of which was related to the European reorganization plan announced at the end of January 2019;Capital expenditures for -126 million euros  a large part of which was related to the strategic investments made at the Halden plant;Net cash outflows of -259 million euros for M&A operations  of which mainly -257 million euros for the acquisition of Centelsa group;Investing flows of +64 million euros of which +60 million euros for the sale of the Hanover real estate;A -69 million euros negative change in working capital due to the reversal of the positive impact of cash collection in the Generation & Transmission segment in 2021 and the working capital impact of the positive organic growth and the impact of copper price increases over the period;Cash outflows of -115 million euros related to financing and equity activities  including interest payments of -19 million euros  the acquisition of Nexans shares for -42 million euros in view of the capital increase reserved for employees  the Group dividend payment for -54 million euros;A -7 million euros negative impact corresponding to new lease liabilities;A positive impact of +1 million euros for favorable foreign exchange fluctuations during the six-month period.III.

On top of usual seasonal movements  operating margin and free cash flow were impacted in H1 by inflation and supply chain-related headwinds. We expect a significant improvement in both metrics in the second half  supported by improvement actions launched earlier in the year  on our cost structure and contract portfolio. In consequence  we are fully confident of achieving our full-year objectives. We have successfully secured our debt financing; our envisioned transformation plan is now fully funded for the interim period before the contemplated split into two listed entities  and our liquidity is significantly strengthened.”€MH1 H1 VariationVariation at constant currency2022 2021 Revenue 5 563 5 424 +2.6% -0.6% Operating Margin 59 302 In % of revenue 1.1% 5.6% -450 bps -460 bps OMDA 369 633 In % of revenue 6.6% 11.7% -510 bps Normalized Net income (loss) -119 162 Net income (loss) -503 -129 Free Cash Flow -555 -369 Net debt 1 792 1 129H1 2022 performance highlightsAtos is currently benefitting from a renewed commercial momentum  with a sharp rebound in order entry in Q2  at €2.8 billion compared with € 2.0 billion in Q1  and a strong sequential improvement in book-to-bill  at 101% in Q2 compared with 72% in Q1. Order entry included several high-profile contracts with existing and new customers  including a supercomputer as part of the EuroHPC program (the 6th awarded to Atos  out of 8 in total in the program). This ramp-up of commercial traction underpins the revenue growth acceleration expected in H2  and indicates strong customer support of Atos envisioned transformation plan  as more than €0.6 billion of new orders were signed post announcement.Revenue was € 5 563 million in H1 2022  slightly down -0.6% at constant currency. On an organic basis  revenue decreased -2.1%  with a continued sequential improvement in Q2  at -1.9% compared to -2.4% in Q1. Tech Foundations reported a much more contained decrease than in FY21  at -2.6% at constant currency  thanks to renewed focus under the Group’s new governance. The Evidian perimeter grew +2.0% with robust trends in Digital and Cybersecurity and a temporary low level of HPC sales driven by cyclicality and supply chain challenges. Acquisitions contributed +1.6% to the Group’s revenue growth. Foreign exchange contributed +3.1%  mainly reflecting the appreciation of the American Dollar and the Pound Sterling against the Euro over the period.Operating margin was € 59 million  or 1.1% of revenue. On top of usual seasonality  it was impacted by high inflation (salaries  energy costs) and supply chain tensions  whilst the first benefits of the performance improvement actions launched in H1 are expected to unfold in H2. Operating margin was also hampered by the hiring of more than 16 000 new employees  mainly in Digital and BDS  and predominantly in offshore and nearshore countries  in anticipation of the growth expected in the second half  and in order to ensure the conditions for future success. H1 operating margin was consistent with the back-end loaded delivery embedded in the Group’s full-year objectives.Free cash flow was €-555 million in H1 2022  driven by operating margin  working capital seasonality and costs related to restructuring and reorganizations planned at the beginning of the year  which are being executed swiftly.Net debt was €-1 792 million at the end of June 2022. The Group’s liquidity remained strong  with €3.5 billion of gross cash and €2.3 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility.Financing of Atos’ transformation plan successfully securedAtos announces that it has successfully secured a new debt package  which will provide the Group with the funding it needs during the interim period before a potential split into two listed companies  and significantly reinforces its liquidity.Atos has already received commitment from banks (subject to documentation) for the conversion of €1.5 billion out of a total of €2.4 billion of revolving credit facility commitment into an unsecured term loan with a maturity of 18 months with two 6-month extensions at the Group’s option. A €900 million revolving credit facility is maintained  maturing in 2025. Atos expects to sign the final documentation in the next few days.As part of this process  the net debt/ OMDA financial covenant is reset at 3.75x and will be tested annually.The success of this financing demonstrates banking partners’ strong support of the Group’s strategy and marks an important milestone in its envisioned transformation plan.The interim period is fully financed ahead of the envisioned split into two listed entities  and the Group’s liquidity is significantly strengthened.On July 13  2022  S&P Global lowered Atos’ credit rating to BB. This new rating  which takes into account the envisioned transformation plan presented on June 14  still provides a favorable framework for the setup of an adequate and sustainable capital structure. It also allows Atos to continue to have access to a wide range of debt financing instruments  thus maintaining the flexibility needed to optimize its capital structure.As highlighted by S&P Global’s statement  Atos’ liquidity is strong and its financial policy is supportive. In particular  S&P Global stated that Atos' planned liquidity should provide the Group with the means to deliver its transformation plan  with its now secured €1.5 billion term loan and  €900 million revolving credit facility  reduced commercial paper utilization  and €700 million in non-core assets disposals.H2 outlookRevenue growth at constant currency is expected to turn positive in H2  underpinned by the renewed commercial momentum observed in Q2  and the Group’s success in securing the right talents in H1.Operating margin is expected to increase markedly as the benefits of performance improvement actions launched earlier in the year will materialize in H2. Such actions are focused on structure costs (including the unwinding of the Spring organization  a reduction in subcontracting  selective hirings and strengthened cost discipline)  underperforming contracts and pricing. Additionally  Atos expects an uptick in operating margin in its hardware-intensive businesses  primarily HPC  driven by volume recovery and secured components supply.Free cash flow  excluding additional costs of the transformation plan  is expected to improve significantly as a direct consequence of operating margin recovery  supported by positive seasonal working capital effects.2022 objectives confirmed and refinedAtos reiterates that its FY22 performance will be back-end loaded  and refines its full-year objectives.Revenue growth objective is unchanged  at -0.5% to +1.5% at constant currency.Operating margin is expected at the lower end of the 3% to 5% range.Free cash flow is expected at the lower end of the €-150 million to €200 million range excluding additional impacts of the envisioned transformation plan. Such additional impacts are estimated around €-250 million  including the cost of financing  in line with information communicated at Atos Capital Markets Day in June.Progress in Atos’ value-creating separation projectThe in-depth analysis of the separation project announced on June 14  2022  is progressing to plan.The launch of the consultation of the Group’s employee representative bodies is scheduled for early September  in line with the envisioned timetable.The interim period before the envisioned separation into two listed entities is now fully financed.The Company and its Board of Directors are convinced that this project is the most value-creating for all its stakeholders  considering notably the potential synergies between BDS and Digital  and prospects for improving Tech Foundation's operational performance.As announced on July 13  2022  Atos appointed a new management to ensure a successful execution of the strategic transformation project under consideration. Nourdine Bihmane is co-CEO and in charge of the Tech Foundations business  Philippe Oliva is co-CEO and in charge of the Evidian Perimeter and Diane Galbe is Senior Executive Vice President in charge of strategic projects and support functions.In addition  the Group appointed a consultative ad hoc Committee within the Board of Directors  in charge of overseeing the study and implementation of the strategic project by the management team. This committee is composed of a majority of independent directors and is chaired by René Proglio.Human resourcesTotal headcount stood at 112 180 at the end of June 2022  up +2.8% compared to 109 135 at the end of December 2021 (+2.1% organically).In H1 2022  Atos hired 16 089 new employees (gross)  of which 7 855 in Q2  mainly in Digital and BDS  and predominantly in offshore and nearshore countries  in order to support the growth expected in the second half of the year and to ensure the conditions for future success. Atos also welcomed Cloudreach’s 742 employees.Operating Margin to Operating Income(in € million) H1 2022 H1 2021 Operating margin 59 302 Staff reorganization -73 -79 Rationalization and associated costs -33 -42 Integration and acquisition costs -18 -22 Amortization of intangible assets (PPA from acquisitions) -67 -79 Equity based compensation -11 -33 Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets -91 Other items -64 -164 Operating income (loss) -298 -118Operating income was a loss of €-298 million in the first half of 2022  compared to €-118 million in the first half of 2021.Staff reorganization  rationalization  and integration costs amounted to €-124 million in the first half of 2022 decreasing compared to €-143 million in the first half of 2021. In H1 2022  Atos executed swiftly on cost optimization measures and reorganizations planned at the beginning of the year (for a total estimated annual cost of €-150 million).Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets for €-91 million in the first half of 2022  related to the impairment of assets associated with disposal groups classified as held for sale.Other items amounted to €-64 million in the first half of 2022  compared to €-164 million in the first half of 2021. They included €-32 million related to the impairment of current assets related to the Russian business classified as held for sale.Operating income to Net income Group shareNet financial expense amounted to €-129 million in the first half of 2022  compared to €-3 million in the first half of 2021. They included mainly €-109 million related to the disposal of Worldline shares in June  for net proceeds of €219 million  and €-13 million of net cost of financial debt.The tax charge was €-77 million in the first half of 2022.As a result of the above  Net income (Group share) was a loss of €-503 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €-129 million in the first half of 2021.Basic EPS and diluted EPS amounted to €-4.55  compared to €-1.18 in the first half of 2021.The normalized net income (Group share) excluding unusual  abnormal and infrequent items (net of tax) was a loss of €-119 million  compared to an income of €162 million in the first half of 2021.Normalized basic EPS and normalized diluted EPS amounted to €-1.07  compared to € 1.48 in the first half of 2021.Free cash flow and net debt(in € million) H1 2022 H1 2021 Operating Margin before Depreciation and Amortization (OMDA) 369 633 Capital expenditures -123 -154 Lease payments -207 -183 Change in working capital requirement -383 -394 Cash from operation (CFO) -344 -98 Tax paid -21 -46 Net cost of financial debt paid -13 -13 Reorganization  Rationalization & Integration costs -113 -147 Other changes -64 -66 Free Cash Flow (FCF) -555 -369In the first half of 2022  free cash flow was €-555 million. On top of usual seasonality  whereby free cash flow is significantly lower in H1 than in H2  H1 2022 free cash flow primarily reflects the low level of OMDA recorded over the period  at €369 million  compared to €633 million in H1 2021.The seasonal working capital outflow was €-383 million  primarily driven by a decrease in customer advanced payments.Reorganization  rationalization and integration costs amounted to €-113 million and were primarily composed of staff reorganization costs.Other items below free cash flow amounted to €-11 million and included mainly acquisitions net of the disposal of Worldline shares for €-92 million and the impact of foreign exchange fluctuation effects for €+98 million.As a result  the Group’s net debt position as of the end of June 2022 was €-1 792 million compared to €-1 226 million at the end of December 2021.BacklogFull backlog at the end of June 2022  amounted to €22.6 billion  down €1.6 billion at constant currency compared to the end of December 2021  including €0.9 billion of corrections pertaining to prior periods  and representing 2.0 years of revenue. The full qualified pipeline was €7.1 billion  slightly up compared to the end of December 2021 and representing 7.6 months of revenue.Condensed consolidated financial statementAtos’ Board of Directors in its meeting held on July 26  2022  has reviewed the Group half-year consolidated financial statements closed at June 30  2022.

Small variances may arise once fully integrated into the Group’s reporting systems.The revenue of the Tech Foundations business  including UCC  decreased by -2.6% in H1 2022 at constant currency (-2.0% excluding UCC). This is a strong sequential improvement compared to 2021  where revenue declined -11.4% over the full year (including UCC)  evidencing the momentum that started to build up quickly within the newly formed Tech Foundations business line. The infrastructure business reported a much more contained revenue decline than last year  reaping the first benefits from renewed focus under the Group’s new organization. Professional services delivered robust growth  benefitting from high structural demand. Digital workplace services and BPO were stable due to refocusing actions and UCC contracted due to persisting supply chain tensions. The deliberate gradual wind down of the value-added resale business continued into H1 2022. Revenue in top 30 accounts increased by 2 2% reflecting the success of the playbook deployed across these accounts. Operating margin was-1.0%  in line with that of FY21.Earlier in the month  Atos was positioned by Gartner for the second time as a global leader in the 2022 Magic Quadrant for data center outsourcing and hybrid infrastructure managed services  and recognized for its completeness of vision and ability to execute.The Evidian perimeter (Digital and Big Data & Cybersecurity) grew +2.0% in H1 2022 at constant currency. Growth in Digital was driven by the contribution of recent acquisitions that enriched the Group’s offerings  particularly in multi-cloud services  as well as robust organic trends in the applications and cloud businesses  notably in Americas  although mitigated by volume reductions with a large customer  and a decrease in value-added resale. Cybersecurity continued on its above-market growth trajectory. As anticipated  Advanced Computing contracted due to a reduction in HPC sales  reflecting the deal flow cyclicality in this business  compounded by supply chain tensions.Operating margin was 3.5% in H1 2022  impacted by the shortfall in HPC revenue  as well as an increase in staff cost. FY22 operating margin is expected to be back-end loaded  and will benefit in H2 from the aforementioned performance improvement actions.Order entry in HPC was strong in H1  indicating a recovery as soon as in H2. With the award of the MareNostrum5 supercomputer contract by EuroHPC JU for the Barcelona Supercomputing Center  Atos’ BullSequana X HPC range will be used in six out of the eight EuroHPC supercomputing centers.In July 2022  Atos was positioned as a Visionary in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud IT Transformation Services  2022  Worldwide  based on its completeness of vision and ability to execute.H1 2022 performance by Regional Business UnitRevenue Operating margin Operating margin % In € million H1 2022 H1 2021* Evolution at constant currency H1 2022 H1 2021* H1 2022 H1 2021* Americas 1 353 1 348 +0.4% 73 159 5.4% 11.8% Northern Europe & APAC 1 625 1 625 +0.0% 28 113 1.7% 7.0% Central Europe 1 258 1 280 -1.7% -30 24 -2.4% 1.9% Southern Europe 1 198 1 231 -2.7% 40 46 3.4% 3.7% Others & Global structures 129 111 +15.9% -52 -24 NA NA Total 5 563 5 594 -0.6% 59 317 1.1% 5.7% * At constant currencyAmericas revenue was up +0.4% at constant currency  driven by the contribution of recent acquisitions in multi-cloud services and product lifecycle management. Trends were robust in digital  in particular with the ramp up of a new contract with a major hospital chain. This was offset by a revenue decrease in Tech Foundations  driven by infrastructure and UCC services  as well as fluctuations in the advanced computing business. Operating margin was significantly lower than in H1 2021  primarily due to high personal costs inflation and a less favorable contract mix.Northern Europe & APAC’s revenue was stable at constant currency compared to H1 2021. Revenue growth turned positive in Q2  driven by a good momentum in Digital  particularly with public sector and defense customers  as well as in BDS. Tech Foundations activities were slightly down in H1 but improved sequentially between Q1 and Q2. Robust growth in digital workplace was offset by a decline in the BPO business  following the reassessment of a large contract in the UK in Q4 2021. Operating margin was lower than in H1 2021  impacted by the aforementioned BPO contract reassessment and underperforming contracts in the process of being right-sized.Central Europe’s revenue decreased by -1.7% at constant currency  impacted by the termination of an underperforming contract with a telecom operator  as part of the Group’s performance improvement actions  and low activity levels in HPC and UCC. Excluding these items  revenue was stable with a marked improvement between Q1 and Q2  driven by robust growth in Digital. The decline in Tech Foundations’ activities (excluding UCC) was much more contained than last year. Operating margin was negative  as anticipated  due to salary inflation and challenging delivery of some projects.Southern Europe’s revenue decreased by -2.7% at constant currency  due to fluctuations in the HPC business  and to the continued deliberate wind down of value-added resale. Excluding these two activities  which are minor revenue contributors  the RBU turned in a modest revenue growth in H1. Momentum in Digital was robust. Tech Foundations improved  with a more decline than last year  as contract renewals and new wins provided some resilience. Operating margin remained broadly in line with H1 2021  as operational improvements compensated for the impacts of salary inflation and of two underperforming contracts.Others  which encompass Middle East  Africa  Major Events as well as two cost centers: the Group’s global delivery centers and global structures. Revenue grew +15.9% at constant currency supported by business related to the Beijing Olympics. Operating margin  structurally negative  decreased year-on-year due to under-absorption of global delivery centers’ fixed costs.Revenue and operating margin at constant scope and exchange rates reconciliationIn € million H1 2022 H1 2021 % change Statutory revenue 5 563 5 424 +2.6% Exchange rates effect 170 Revenue at constant exchange rates 5 563 5 594 -0.6% Scope effect 84 Exchange rates effect on acquired/disposed perimeters 5 Revenue at constant scope and exchange rates 5 563 5 683 -2.1% Statutory operating margin 59 302 -80.4% Exchange rates effect 16 Operating margin at constant exchange rates 59 317 -81.3% Scope effect -5 Exchange rates effect on acquired/disposed perimeters 0 Operating margin at constant scope and exchange rates 59 313 -81.1% as % of revenue 1.1% 5.5%Scope effects amounted to € 89 million for revenue and € -5 million for operating margin.

Our tube business continues to operate in a highly favorable environment  particularly in North America. Our iron ore mine has reopened but is still operating below typical production levels  and this situation is now assumed to continue for the remainder of the year. Nevertheless  at this stage in the year  we are confident in quantifying our EBITDA outlook for FY 2022  with an expected performance between €650 to €750 million. Adjusted for the normal operation of the mine  EBITDA would have been approximately €1.0 billion. Free Cash Flow in the Second Quarter remained in negative territory  reflecting temporary investments in inventories to satisfy strong business demand. It will be positive in the Second Half as working capital stabilizes at current levels.Story continuesWe continue to progress our ‘New Vallourec’ transformation plan  with the plant closure process launched in Germany and other European reorganization measures underway. Furthermore  I am delighted to welcome new leaders to the Executive Committee to complete the team which will drive the transformation of Vallourec.”KEY DATAFirst-half 2022 First-half 2021 Change In € million Q2 2022 Q2 2021 Change 828 739 12.0% Production shipped (k tonnes) 433 381 13.6% 2 060 1 544 33.4% Revenue 1 144 842 35.9% 205 228 €(23)m EBITDA 160 148 €12m 10.0% 14.8% (4.8)p.p.

The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  and to a lesser extent in EA-MEA as well as the higher contribution both in Industry in EA-MEA and South America was partially offset by the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the mine operations.Sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A) at €98 million or 8.6% of revenue versus 9.6% in Q2 2021.Adjusted for the regular operation of the iron ore mine and actual iron ore prices for Q2 2022  the normalized level of EBITDA would have been approximately €240 million.Operating income was negative at €(358) million  compared to a positive €200 million in Q2 2021  resulting mainly from the provisions related to the adaptation measures (European social plans and associated fees) and  to a lesser extent  provisions for non-recurring costs related to the incident at the mine. Moreover  Q2 2021 included a positive one-off €70m gain related to the Reisholz land and building sale.Financial income was negative at €(8) million  compared with €(93) million in Q2 2021; net interest expenses in Q2 2022 at €(22) million  and reflecting the new balance sheet structure  were partially offset by ‘other financial income’.Income tax was reduced to €(48) million compared to €(60) million in Q2 2021  reflecting lower earnings from the mine and a recovery in activity in North America.This resulted in negative net income  Group share  of €(415) million  compared to a positive €51 million in Q2 2021.H1 2022 consolidated results analysisIn H1 2022  EBITDA amounted to €205 million  a €23 million decrease year-on-year  to stand at 10.0% of revenue  reflecting:An industrial margin of €383 million or 18.6% of revenue  down €28 million compared with H1 2021. The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  and to a lesser extent in EA-MEA as well as the higher contribution both in Industry in EA-MEA and South America was more than offset by the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the mine operations.Sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A) of €183 million  or 8.9% of revenue  versus €158 million and 10.2% of revenue in H1 2021.Adjusted for the regular operation of the iron ore mine and actual iron ore prices for H1 2022  the normalized level of EBITDA would have been approximately €370 million.Operating income was negative at €(375) million compared with a positive €227 million in H1 2021  resulting mainly from the provisions related to the adaptation measures (European social plans and associated fees) and  to a lesser extent  provisions for non-recurring costs related to the incident at the mine (H1 2021 was positively impacted by a non-recurring €70m gain related to the above-mentioned real estate asset disposals).Financial income was negative at €(21) million  compared with €(175) million in H1 2021; net interest expenses in H1 2022 at €(45) million reflecting the new balance sheet structure  were partially offset by other financial income.Income tax amounted to €(51) million mainly related to Brazil and North America.As a result  net income  Group share  amounted to €(450) million  compared to €(42) million in H1 2021.CASH FLOW & FINANCIAL POSITIONCash flow from operating activitiesIn Q2 2022  cash flow from operating activities improved to €41 million  compared to €(15) million in Q2 2021; It included cash-out related to the adaptation measures of €22 million  lower income tax paid  as well as lower financial expenses.H1 cash flow from operating activities was positive at €61 million compared to €(2) million in H1 2021. The improvement was related to lower income tax and adaptation measures cash-out  as well as reduced financial expenses.Operating working capital requirementIn Q2 2022  the operating working capital requirement increased by €(187) million  versus an increase of €(92) million in Q2 2021  reflecting higher forward volume expectations and raw-material price increases. The net working capital requirement stood at 117 days of sales  compared to 101 days in Q2 2021.For H1 2022  the operating working capital requirement increased by €(403) million versus an increase of €(139) million in H1 2021.CapexCapital expenditure was €(25) million in Q2 2022  compared with €(28) million in Q2 2021  and €(59) million in H1 2022 compared to €(56) million in H1 2021.For the full year it is expected to be slightly above €200 million.Free cash flowAs a result  in Q2 2022  free cash flow was negative at €(171) million versus €(135) million in Q2 2021.Free cash flow for H1 2022 was negative €(401) million after €403 million working capital build in H1  compared with €(197) million in H1 2021.For the Second Half of 2022 free cash flow is expected to be positive.Asset disposals & other itemsIn Q2 2022  asset disposals & other items amounted to €(5) million compared with €1 780 million in Q2 2021. This included the recognition of the financial restructuring  the cash-in from the Reisholz building and land disposal for €71 million and from the Valinox Nucléaire SAS disposal for €12 million.For H1 2022  they amounted to €(30) million.Net debt and liquidityAs of June 30  2022  net debt stood at €1 389 million  compared with €1 213 million at March 31  2022. As of June 30  2022  gross debt amounted to €1 754 million including €81 million of fair value adjustment under IFRS 9 (which will be reversed over the life of the debt). Long-term debt amounted to €1 379 million and short-term debt totaled €375 million.Net debt at year-end 2022 is projected below the level of end-June thanks to positive free cash flow.As of June 30  2022  lease debt stood at €61 million following the application of IFRS 5 standards  compared with €50 million on March 31  2022.The liquidity position was strong at €752 million  with cash amounting to €365 million and an undrawn committed Revolving Credit Facility of €387 million.UPDATE ON PAU BRANCO MINEOn January 8  2022  following exceptionally heavy rainfall in Minas Gerais State (Brazil)  some material from the waste pile associated with the operations of Vallourec’s Pau Branco mine slid into a rainwater dam (the Lisa Dam) causing it to overflow resulting in the interruption of traffic on a nearby highway. There were no casualties and the structure of the dam was not affected. As a result of this incident  however  the operations of the mine were temporarily suspended.On May 4  2022  Vallourec partially restarted operations  using an alternative waste pile. Under these conditions  volumes extracted in H1 2022 amounted to approximately 1.1 million tonnes.In the Full Year 2022  Vallourec now assumes an annual production of 2.6 million tonnes  which informs its EBITDA outlook.Meanwhile  Vallourec continues discussions with the authorities regarding the use of other alternative waste piles to continue production. The Group is also working as fast as possible on additional safeguarding measures including drainage system reinforcement and the stabilization of the soft soil layers  in order to resume normal operations using the original waste pile  subject to the validation by the state mining and environmental authorities. Those normal operations are expected not before Q2 2023 following the full release of the Cachoeirinha Pile.PROGRESS ON ‘NEW VALLOUREC’Foundations of the New VallourecReshape industrial footprintIn May 2022  Vallourec announced the initiation of the closure process of its German tube plants and the transfer of the German rolling activity for Oil & Gas to Brazil. This process will take place over the next two years and will include the sale of land and buildings. The transfer will require approximately €120 million of capex in the Brazil operations to support the transition of premium tubular volume from Europe by end 2023.The closure of the German operations implies further rationalization of other European operations involved in the finishing of tubes rolled in Germany. This rationalization will entail the consolidation of all the European threading activities in a single location in Aulnoye  France. The Group has also launched the closure processes of the heat treatment line at Saint-Saulve (France) and the threading line at Bellshill (Scotland). Elsewhere  Vallourec completed the sale of Vallourec Bearing Tubes. The Aulnoye Competence Center will lead the ‘one R&D’ organization.Streamline overheads to lower breakeven and increase efficiencyVallourec will simplify its organization by streamlining its structure in all regions (North America  South America and Eastern Hemisphere) and by further downsizing the headquarter functions  which will be primarily focused on strategy and expertise.The Group will also benefit from higher productivity by implementing automation for all transactional processes and consolidating support functions in larger  Shared Services Centers  to leverage the Company’s scale.Finally  support functions will be located close to production sites and the Group will focus on value-creating projects.These combined initiatives will lead to €230 million of recurring EBITDA and €250 million in ongoing cash up-lift. The execution is expected to be finalized at end of Q1 2024. The associated headcount reduction3 should be approximately 2 950.The implementation of these measures is subject to consultation of the competent employee representative bodies.The indicative profile for the ‘one-off’ cash flows of this project shows that the bulk of the cash outflows (severance and other one-off costs) are concentrated at the beginning of 2024  while the main cash inflows (sale of land  buildings  working capital and other) are expected in the early part 2023. Consequently  the restructuring is not expected to impair liquidity.Further reinforcement of Executive CommitteeFollowing the nomination in May of Ulrika Wising as Senior Vice President Energy Transition  Vallourec has made four further senior appointments to reinforce the Executive Committee tasked with executing the ‘New Vallourec’ transformation strategy.Enrico Schiappacasse as Senior Vice President Group Strategy and Development: On June 1  2022  Vallourec announced the appointment of Enrico Schiappacasse as Senior Vice President Group Strategy and Development. He took office on June 1  2022. Enrico was previously Vice President of the Oil and Gas Business Unit at Prysmian Group  world leader in the energy and telecom cable systems industry.Nathalie Joannes as General Counsel: On July 1  2022  Vallourec announced the appointment of Nathalie Joannes as General Counsel for the Group. Prior to joining Vallourec  Nathalie was Executive Vice President Legal and Compliance & General Counsel at LEO Pharma. Nathalie has successfully built international legal  risk management and compliance teams in listed and private companies worldwide. She has been a member of the New York Bar since 1987.Ludovic Oster as Chief Human Resources Officer: On July 1  2022  Vallourec announced the appointment of Ludovic Oster as Chief Human Resources Officer. Since August 2018  he has been Chief Human Resources Officer at Elior Group where he contributed to the implementation of the group's strategy  particularly through the alignment and commitment of teams  the development of human resources and organizational efficiency.Pierre d'Archemont as Senior Vice President South America: On July 8  2022  Vallourec announced the appointment of Pierre d'Archemont as Senior Vice President South America. He took up his position on July 14  2022. He occupied the position of Regional VP Brazil and Argentina in charge of the operational and financial turnaround of Visteon since 2014.New Vallourec industrial footprint in 2024Vallourec’s new industrial footprint is designed to support its value-over-volume strategy through a reduction of approximately 700 000 tonnes of unprofitable capacity in Europe and a focus on low-cost production regions with a significantly reduced carbon footprint.Following the completion of the reshaping of its industrial footprint  Vallourec industrial footprint will consist of:750 000 tonnes of competitive rolling capacity in North America which will be supported by steel production capacity of 750 000 tonnes.1 100 000 tonnes of low-cost rolling capacity in Brazil  effectively limited by steel production of 950 000 tonnes.Unchanged rolling capacity of 600 000 tonnes in the Eastern Hemisphere (China) operations.2022 OUTLOOKOil & GasIn North America  the highly favorable market conditions should continue into H2 2022  in both price and volume terms. Market very tight in terms of available supply.In EA-MEA  volumes expected to continue to recover modestly in the coming quarters; cost increases will be passed onto customers.In South America  volumes are expected to increase leading to margin improvement throughout the year.Industry & OtherIn Europe  the outlook for volumes is neutral in a softer market; price increases are expected to fully offset cost inflation.In Brazil  the outlook for volumes is neutral relative to currently elevated levels  with price increases fully offsetting cost inflation.Vallourec has partially restarted the mining operations. Assumptions for H2 2022 assume production of approximately 1.5 million tonnes  bringing the total for the year to 2.6 million tonnes. H2 2022 consensus estimates for iron ore average prices stand at approximately US$120 per tonne4.Based on these market trends and assumptions we are quantifying our EBITDA outlook for FY 2022 which is now expected in a range of €650 to €750 million. On a normalized basis (for full production at the iron ore mine) EBITDA would have been estimated at approximately €1 billion5.OtherCapex is expected to be slightly above €200 million  including approximately €50 million for the preparation of the transfer of operations from Germany to Brazil.Information and Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release may include forward-looking statements.

They include changes in Group structure  the impairment of goodwill and brands and  where material  of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets  restructuring costs and disputes.“Recurring operating income” is therefore a major indicator for the Group  defined as the difference between operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses. This intermediate line item is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can therefore be used as a way to estimate recurring performance. This indicator is presented in a manner that is consistent and stable over the long term in order to ensure the continuity and relevance of financial information.EBITDAThe Group uses EBITDA to monitor its operating performance. This financial indicator corresponds to recurring operating income plus net charges to depreciation  amortization and provisions on non-current operating assets recognized in recurring operating income.Free cash flow from operations  available cash flow from operations and available cash flowThe Group uses an intermediate line item  “Free cash flow from operations”  to monitor its financial performance. This financial indicator measures net operating cash flow less net operating investments (defined as acquisitions and disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets).The Group has also defined a new indicator  “Available cash flow from operations”  in order to take into account capitalized fixed lease payments (repayments of principal and interest) pursuant to IFRS 16  and thereby reflect all of its operating cash flows.“Available cash flow” therefore corresponds to available cash flow from operations plus interest and dividends received  less interest paid and equivalent (excluding leases).Net debtNet debt is one of the Group’s main financial indicators  and is defined as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Consequently  the cost of net debt corresponds to all financial income and expenses associated with these items  including the impact of derivative instruments used to hedge the fair value of borrowings. Borrowings include put options granted to minority interests.Effective tax rate on recurring incomeThe effective tax rate on recurring income corresponds to the effective tax rate excluding tax effects relating to other non-recurring operating income and expenses.Attachment,positive,0.9,0.05,0.05,positive,0.67,0.27,0.07,True,English,"['VERY STRONG PERFORMANCES', 'FIRST HALF', 'Kering', 'THE', '2022', 'substantial Free cash flow', 'ongoing brand elevation strategy', 'François-Henri Pinault', 'Yves Saint Laurent', 'Recurring operating income', 'VERY STRONG PERFORMANCES', 'Recurring operating margin', 'first six months', 'exchange rate basis', 'strong double-digit increase', 'Group operating income', 'Operating performance', 'Net income', 'solid performances', 'FIRST HALF', 'comparable basis', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'Covid-related measures', 'second quarter', 'local customers', 'nascent rebound', 'macro uncertainty', 'great shape', 'short-term challenges', 'new opportunities', 'ambitious strategies', 'tremendous prospects', 'currency effects', 'new record', 'Financial indicators', 'Bottega Veneta', 'comparable scope', 'North America', 'Southeast Asia', 'new highs', 'perfect execution', 'high level', 'retail network', 'Western Europe', 'Other Houses', 'The Group', 'last year', 'topline momentum', 'Comparable change', 'Kering Eyewear', '2022 Group revenue', 'higher sales', 'world', 'impact', 'China', 'engagement', 'markets', 'tourism', 'period', 'advantage', 'brands', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'difference', 'commerce', 'success', 'resumption', 'growth', 'operations', 'Story', '€ millions', 'H1', 'Gucci', 'Corporate', 'Eliminations', 'Wholesale', 'Japan', 'lockdowns', 'orders', 'Asia-Pacific', '34']",2022-07-27,2022-07-27,finance.yahoo.com

The widespread growth we are producing throughout UMG demonstrates that our strategy is progressing as planned  underscoring the strength and resilience of our business and our ability to deliver for our artists and our shareholders alike.""""We're driving incremental revenue and EBITDA through a range of compelling monetization opportunities  which in turn enables us to thoughtfully reinvest in the business's long-term growth""  said Boyd Muir  UMG's EVP  CFO and President of Operations.UMG ResultsThree Months EndedJune 30 %%Six Months EndedJune 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.

Constant currency change is calculated by taking current year results and comparing against prior year results restated at current year rates.Q2 2022 ResultsRevenue for the second quarter of 2022 (""Q2 2022"") was €2 535 million  an increase of 25.4% year-over-year  or 17.3% in constant currency. UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all had strong revenue growth  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter grew 18.7% year-over-year  or 8.8% in constant currency  to €507 million  driven by revenue growth. EBITDA margin was 20.0%  compared to 21.1% in the second quarter of 2021 (""Q2 2021""). EBITDA and EBITDA margin in Q2 2021 were impacted by a net €2 million of share-based compensation and expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam. Excluding these expenses  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 18.2% year-over-year  or 8.3% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.0%  compared to 21.2% in the second quarter of 2021.As disclosed in the UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). In prior years  these revenues were recognised when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters  with a benefit of €98 million in revenue and €17 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022.In addition  as previously disclosed  Q2 2021 benefited from a catch-up payment from a digital service provider (the ""DSP Catch-Up Payment"")  amounting to €41 million in revenue and €26 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Excluding the Change in Society Accounting and DSP Catch-Up Payment  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.1% in Q2 2022  compared to 20.3% in Q2 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.H1 2022 ResultsIn the half year ended June 30  2022 (""H1 2022"")  UMG's revenues of €4 734 million increased by 23.6%  or 16.9% in constant currency  compared to the half year ended June 30  2021 (""H1 2021""). This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 27.4% to €2 608 million in H1 2022  reflecting higher revenues and revenue mix. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to 55.1% from 53.4% driven by higher artist costs from a greater proportion of Music Publishing revenues in H1 2022 as well as the impact of the DSP Catch-Up Payment and a previously disclosed exceptional recovery of an advance provision and release of historic royalties (the ""Exceptional Recovery and Release"") in the first quarter of 2021 (with a €20 million impact) that all benefited artists costs relative to revenues in the prior year period.Operating profit improved 11.8% year-over-year  or 6.7% in constant currency  to €765 million in H1 2022 driven by the growth in revenues. EBITDA amounted to €960 million  an increase of 16.8%  or 11.1% in constant currency  compared to H1 2021  also as a result of the growth in revenues.EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of €2 million during H1 2022 and by €3 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during H1 2021. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 was €962 million  up 16.6% compared to H1 2021  or 11.0% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 1.2pp year-over-year to 20.3%.Revenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 benefited from the Change in Society Accounting discussed above  amounting to €144 million in revenue and €34 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Revenue for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment described above  while EBITDA for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment and the Exceptional Recovery and Release described above.Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2% in H1 2022  compared to 20.6% in H1 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for H1 2022 amounted to €241 million compared to €452 million in H1 2021  resulting in EPS of €0.13 in H1 2022  compared to €0.25 in H1 2021. The decline in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was due to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment) and other financial investments that was an expense in H1 2022 of €567 million compared to a net expense in H1 2021 of €170 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments amongst other items  amounted to €763 million in H1 2022  compared to €578 million in H1 2021  resulting in Adjusted EPS of €0.42 in H1 2022  compared to €0.32 in H1 2021. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in EBITDA and a decline in interest and income tax expense  both driven by a €100 million benefit from two tax litigations finalized in H1 2022.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and equivalents  at the end of H1 2022 was €2 283 million compared to €2 010 million at December 31  2021.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved to €605 million in H1 2022 compared to €470 million in H1 2021  an increase of 28.7%  mainly as a result of the growth in EBITDA and favourable working capital movements. Royalty advance payments  net of recoupments grew to €223 million in H1 2022 from €130 million in H1 2021  due to the timing of major artist renewals partly offset by higher recoupment.Free cash flow decreased to €104 million in H1 2022 compared to €280 million in H1 2021  mainly as a result of the timing of catalogue acquisitions (-€221 million)  whilst the prior half year benefited from the disposal of Alamo Records (-€102 million). This was partly offset by the improvement in net cash provided by operating activities (+€122 million).UMG's dividend policy is to pay a dividend of 50% of adjusted net profit. UMG's Board of Directors declared an interim dividend for H1 2022 of €435 million  or €0.24 per share. The ex-dividend date will be on October 5  2022  the record date will be on October 6  2022 and the payment date will be on October 28  2022.Recorded MusicThree Months EndedJune 30 %%Six Months EndedJune 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.

The widespread growth we are producing throughout UMG demonstrates that our strategy is progressing as planned  underscoring the strength and resilience of our business and our ability to deliver for our artists and our shareholders alike.""""We're driving incremental revenue and EBITDA through a range of compelling monetization opportunities  which in turn enables us to thoughtfully reinvest in the business's long-term growth""  said Boyd Muir  UMG's EVP  CFO and President of Operations.UMG ResultsThree Months EndedJune 30 %%Six Months EndedJune 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.

Constant currency change is calculated by taking current year results and comparing against prior year results restated at current year rates.Q2 2022 ResultsRevenue for the second quarter of 2022 (""Q2 2022"") was €2 535 million  an increase of 25.4% year-over-year  or 17.3% in constant currency. UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all had strong revenue growth  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter grew 18.7% year-over-year  or 8.8% in constant currency  to €507 million  driven by revenue growth. EBITDA margin was 20.0%  compared to 21.1% in the second quarter of 2021 (""Q2 2021""). EBITDA and EBITDA margin in Q2 2021 were impacted by a net €2 million of share-based compensation and expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam. Excluding these expenses  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 18.2% year-over-year  or 8.3% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.0%  compared to 21.2% in the second quarter of 2021.As disclosed in the UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). In prior years  these revenues were recognised when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters  with a benefit of €98 million in revenue and €17 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022.In addition  as previously disclosed  Q2 2021 benefited from a catch-up payment from a digital service provider (the ""DSP Catch-Up Payment"")  amounting to €41 million in revenue and €26 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Excluding the Change in Society Accounting and DSP Catch-Up Payment  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.1% in Q2 2022  compared to 20.3% in Q2 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.H1 2022 ResultsIn the half year ended June 30  2022 (""H1 2022"")  UMG's revenues of €4 734 million increased by 23.6%  or 16.9% in constant currency  compared to the half year ended June 30  2021 (""H1 2021""). This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 27.4% to €2 608 million in H1 2022  reflecting higher revenues and revenue mix. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to 55.1% from 53.4% driven by higher artist costs from a greater proportion of Music Publishing revenues in H1 2022 as well as the impact of the DSP Catch-Up Payment and a previously disclosed exceptional recovery of an advance provision and release of historic royalties (the ""Exceptional Recovery and Release"") in the first quarter of 2021 (with a €20 million impact) that all benefited artists costs relative to revenues in the prior year period.Operating profit improved 11.8% year-over-year  or 6.7% in constant currency  to €765 million in H1 2022 driven by the growth in revenues. EBITDA amounted to €960 million  an increase of 16.8%  or 11.1% in constant currency  compared to H1 2021  also as a result of the growth in revenues.EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of €2 million during H1 2022 and by €3 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during H1 2021. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 was €962 million  up 16.6% compared to H1 2021  or 11.0% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 1.2pp year-over-year to 20.3%.Revenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 benefited from the Change in Society Accounting discussed above  amounting to €144 million in revenue and €34 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Revenue for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment described above  while EBITDA for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment and the Exceptional Recovery and Release described above.Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2% in H1 2022  compared to 20.6% in H1 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for H1 2022 amounted to €241 million compared to €452 million in H1 2021  resulting in EPS of €0.13 in H1 2022  compared to €0.25 in H1 2021. The decline in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was due to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment) and other financial investments that was an expense in H1 2022 of €567 million compared to a net expense in H1 2021 of €170 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments amongst other items  amounted to €763 million in H1 2022  compared to €578 million in H1 2021  resulting in Adjusted EPS of €0.42 in H1 2022  compared to €0.32 in H1 2021. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in EBITDA and a decline in interest and income tax expense  both driven by a €100 million benefit from two tax litigations finalized in H1 2022.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and equivalents  at the end of H1 2022 was €2 283 million compared to €2 010 million at December 31  2021.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved to €605 million in H1 2022 compared to €470 million in H1 2021  an increase of 28.7%  mainly as a result of the growth in EBITDA and favourable working capital movements. Royalty advance payments  net of recoupments grew to €223 million in H1 2022 from €130 million in H1 2021  due to the timing of major artist renewals partly offset by higher recoupment.Free cash flow decreased to €104 million in H1 2022 compared to €280 million in H1 2021  mainly as a result of the timing of catalogue acquisitions (-€221 million)  whilst the prior half year benefited from the disposal of Alamo Records (-€102 million). This was partly offset by the improvement in net cash provided by operating activities (+€122 million).UMG's dividend policy is to pay a dividend of 50% of adjusted net profit. UMG's Board of Directors declared an interim dividend for H1 2022 of €435 million  or €0.24 per share. The ex-dividend date will be on October 5  2022  the record date will be on October 6  2022 and the payment date will be on October 28  2022.Recorded MusicThree Months EndedJune 30 %%Six Months EndedJune 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.
