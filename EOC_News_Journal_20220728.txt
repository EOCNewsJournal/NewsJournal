The program represents 14 percent of the Company's outstanding shares at yesterday‚Äôs closing price. In addition  the Company reaffirmed its intent to initiate a quarterly dividend in the second half of 2023.Doug Pferdehirt  Chair and CEO of TechnipFMC  stated  ‚Äú Our debt reduction reached an important milestone in the quarter  providing us with the flexibility to initiate shareholder distributions as evidenced by the new share repurchase program. We firmly believe that our shares are undervalued  and this action underscores our confidence in the long-term outlook for our Company.‚ÄùPferdehirt continued  ‚Äú I am very pleased with our operational performance in the quarter  which drove total Company adjusted EBITDA of $187 million. We also experienced continued strength in Subsea inbound. Orders for the first half of the year grew to $3.8 billion  a book-to-bill of 1.4  with iEPCI‚Ñ¢  direct awards and subsea services representing approximately 70 percent of total orders.‚Äù‚Äú Earlier this month  we announced the award of an integrated front end engineering and design (iFEED‚Ñ¢) contract by Equinor for the BM-C-33 project offshore Brazil. This includes an option to proceed with a direct award to our Company for the iEPCI‚Ñ¢ phase of the project. Upon final investment decision  this would be one of the single largest integrated awards to date for the industry. This will also be the first time Equinor uses our configure-to-order production systems and further underscores our view that more than 50 percent of our tree orders will be Subsea 2.0‚Ñ¢ over the next two years.‚ÄùPferdehirt added  ‚Äú In the first half of the year  TechnipFMC was awarded 117 subsea trees. This is nearly double the volume of trees we sold in all of 2021 and serves as further indication that the industry is in full growth mode. This underlying strength is also displayed in our Subsea Opportunities List  which increased by 20 percent in value sequentially and now represents an opportunity set of $24 billion for the industry.‚Äù‚Äú Based on our results  the growing project pipeline  and the active dialogue with our large and expanding customer base  we expect full-year Subsea orders will be up as much as 40 percent versus the prior year  above our previous forecast of 30 percent  with orders now approaching $7 billion in 2022.‚Äù‚Äú In Surface Technologies  we saw solid growth in North America sales and profitability  and we continue to move pricing higher as needed to ensure we earn an acceptable return on our investments. Outside of North America  we have received our first in-country orders for the new facility in Saudi Arabia  setting the stage for improved financial performance as we ramp-up production in the second half of the year.‚ÄùPferdehirt concluded  ‚Äú We remain focused on delivering on our commitments. The reduction in gross debt in the period was another step forward in restoring our balance sheet to our targeted capital structure. We have initiated shareholder distributions  with our near-term actions focused on value-accretive share repurchases. Finally  we reaffirmed our full-year guidance for 2022 and remain confident that our internal initiatives coupled with the strong market backdrop provide us with a clear path to achieve Subsea EBITDA of more than $1 billion by 2025.‚Äù_____________________1 Please refer to the Company‚Äôs press release issued July 27  2022  titled TechnipFMC Announces $400 Million Share Repurchase Authorization.

At this time  all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode  and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation.Let me now hand the floor over to Mr. Jan Strecker.Jan StreckerWelcome  ladies and gentlemen  and thank you for joining us today to go through our second quarter 2022 results. With me are Theodor Weimer  CEO; and Gregor Pottmeyer  CFO. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation today  and afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions. The presentation material for this call has been sent out via e-mail and can also be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual  the conference call will be recorded and is available for replay afterwards.With this  let me now hand over to you  Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Welcome  ladies and gentlemen. Since we gave you a comprehensive update on our strategy and outlook at the recent Investor Day just less than 4 weeks ago  let me focus mainly on our results today. And by the way  the numbers speak anyways for themselves  if I may say so. Overall  the development in the first half of 2022 significantly exceeded our initial expectations  while the development in the first quarter was mainly driven by the outbreak of the terrible war in Ukraine. The second quarter was increasingly influenced by the beginning cycle of rising interest rates. This is the new area I was referring to at our Investor Day  which adds additional cyclical opportunities to our consistent delivery of strong secular growth.In the first half of this year  the secular and cyclical growth contribution was almost equally strong  and we saw some additional growth from M&A. In total  net revenues increased by 20% and amounted to more than ‚Ç¨2 billion  the EBITDA increased by 22% to around ‚Ç¨1.3 billion. Secular net revenue growth at 8% was again slightly above our guidance. This was particularly driven by financial derivatives with product innovation and stronger double-digit growth in OTC clearing  and growing demand for ESG-related products in Data & Analytics  and the further increase of market share in commodities.Cyclical net revenue growth also amounted to around 8% was mainly driven by higher volatility in almost all asset classes. Accordingly  our clients hedging needs increased significantly. Financial derivatives with strong growth in index [ph] and fixed income products were the biggest contributor to cyclical growth  followed by Security Services with a jump in net interest income. In addition  the situation in European gas markets fueled the activity in commodities.M&A contributed another 3% to our net revenue growth. This was mainly driven by the contribution of the remaining 2 months of ISS  which we started to consolidate in March last year. As we explained at Investor Day on June 29  we are generally expecting our organic operating costs to increase to support our secular growth vision. But continuous improvement is also a key measure for us to capture efficiencies  and thus offset normal levels of inflation. But from a cost development point of view last year and the current year are definitely not normal periods. Last year  you manage the organic operating cost growth to zero  because cyclical headwinds. This year we have significant cyclical tailwinds and loss  a little bit more flexibility to invest.Furthermore  we have faced with an unprecedented environment resulting in slightly elevated levels of inflation  adjusted for M&A and FX effects. Our operating cost in the first half increased by 6% which we think is a fair outcome. The overall development in the first half  but far exceeded our initial expectations for 2022. And therefore  we are meanwhile expecting to significantly exceed our initial guidance for the full year.With that  let me now hand over to you  Gregor  to present the financial results in greater detail.Gregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On Page 2  we saw the results for the first 6 months in detail. All segments have contributed double-digit growth rates to the overall net revenue development. The Data & Analytics and Trading & Clearing segments even achieved organic net revenue growth rates of around 20%. As part of the net revenue  the net interest income across the group has roughly doubled compared to the previous year. On the one hand  this was driven by higher collateral levels in financial derivatives and commodities. On the other hand  the NII of security services has started to meaningfully benefit from higher U.S. interest rates.I will explain the 6% constant currency organic operating costs increase in more detail in a moment. But overall  the cost development is broadly in line with our expectation. This has also helped us to achieve solid operating leverage. And  as expected  the operating leverage was slightly stronger on an organic basis.In terms of the operating costs in the first half of 2022 on Page 3  we saw several different drivers. First  M&A effects  which amounted to 6%  they were still mainly driven by the IFS acquisition. Second  the stronger U.S. dollar was added in a 2% operating cost increase  but was obviously also beneficial to the net revenue development. This brings us to the more meaningful constant currency organic operating costs.On the one hand  it was driven by slightly higher inflationary effects from building operations  general purchasing  and higher staff costs. On the other hand  we had to increase the provisions for variable and share-based compensation in light of the favorable financial development  and relative share price performance.This brings me to the details of the second quarter results on Page 4 of the presentation. We saw continued strong net revenue costs  mainly driven by secular and cyclical developments. Last year numbers include the ‚Ç¨40 million euro gain on the full purchase of Fund Centre. Without that  the net revenue growth would have been north of 20% and the cyclical costs would have been double-digit. The M&A effect has been minor in the second quarter  since they were only driven by some of the smaller  more recent acquisitions.The explanations I just provided on the half year one operating costs development can also be applied to the second quarter. The constant currency organic operating costs increased by 6%  this was mainly driven by some inflationary pressures  and higher variable and share-based compensation. Then besides from financial investments includes a partial reversal of the gains we booked in the first quarter on the FairX disposal by Nodal in the U.S.We received Coinbase shares as a compensation that‚Äôs a 6-month lockup period. But for the first half of 2022  a solid gain remains in our books. The financial result includes 2 one-off effects. First  the interest expenses on our bonds are slightly higher  because we refinanced the corporate bond maturing in October already in March. Second  it includes around ‚Ç¨6 million of interest on additional tax provisions we made in the second quarter.I‚Äôm now turning to the quarterly results of the segments  starting with Data & Analytics on Page 5. We saw a solid double-digit organic net revenue growth across all business lines. This was driven by as a continuing trend towards ESG  a good new client pipeline and higher market activity for the index licensing business. The other line  which is mainly the ISS Market Intelligence business  included some inorganic costs from the acquisition of Discovery Data. The EBITDA in the previous year‚Äôs quarter included a gain of around ‚Ç¨10 million from the revaluation of the stake in Clarity AI. Adjusted for the Clarity AI effect  the EBITDA increased 27%.Let me turn to Slide 6 in the Trading & Clearing segment. The Trading & Clearing segment continues to benefit from higher volatility and increased client hedging needs. The financial derivatives business of Eurex was driven by a higher double-digit cost in index derivatives  interest rate derivatives  the OTC clearing  and in particular  higher margin fees  amounted to ‚Ç¨27 million in the second quarter  also slightly down compared to the very strong first quarter.Commodities continued their strong year-over-year cost due to volatile gas prices and higher margin fees. The cash equities business includes a gain of ‚Ç¨13 million relating to the deconsolidation of Tradegate Exchange. Due to a capital restructuring  our stakes declined to 43%. Although  the previous year‚Äôs net revenue in the cash equities business included a positive effect of around ‚Ç¨7 million  relating to the sale of the Regulatory Reporting Hub. As a result of higher volatility  demand for foreign exchange product was significantly higher compared to previous quarters  and net revenue increased by 27%.In the Fund Services segment  which you‚Äôll find on Page 7  the previous year quarter included the book gain from the full purchase of Fund Centre. On an adjusted basis  our net revenue increased by 14%. This includes continued organic growth  despite a clearly more challenging environment from a market performance point of view. This was possible  because of onboarding of new clients and portfolios. In addition  the acquisition of Kneip added around ‚Ç¨6 million of net revenue in the other line item of the segment. It is also encouraging to see that the momentum of new partnerships continued. We‚Äôve recently entered into an agreement with Italian online program Directa to provide Italian retail investors access to our global funds portfolio.Our Securities Services segment on Slide 8  delivered a very good performance in the second quarter. Headwinds from equity market performance and lower retail participation  they are overcompensated by solid leverage of fixed income issuance activity and some FX effect on assets under custody denominated in U.S. dollar. In addition  we are now starting to see a more meaningful impact from the recent rate hikes in the net interest income.Besides higher rates  also the cash balances are still significantly exceeding last year‚Äôs level. With the current trajectory of interest rates in the U.S. and now also in Europe  we would expect even higher close rate for the third quarter. The other line item declined slightly because of the REGIS-TR disposal in the first quarter.The last page of today‚Äôs presentation shows our guidance for 2022. As Theodor mentioned  the development in the first half by far exceeded our initial expectation for 2022. There is a performance so far  we are trading around ‚Ç¨150 million above our initial net revenue expectation. Therefore  meanwhile  we expect to significantly exceed our guidance for the full year. You are probably wondering why we are not narrowing down our expectation a little bit more. But there are still 6 months left to the year  though there could be both cyclical headwinds as well as further tailwinds affecting the growth we are currently expecting.This concludes our presentation. We are now looking forward to your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. Over to you.Haley TamGood afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a good set of results. Since I‚Äôm restricted to one question  can I actually ask about the Data & Analytics segment  I think the resilience of the index revenue  there was a lot better than I was expecting given the market trends we‚Äôve seen during the first half. So I wondered if you could help me understand  what it is that drove I suppose first of all the stability in the AUM and exchange traded index funds during the period  and whether you expect that to continue.But secondly  I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm familiar with why your stock exchange licenses business would have gone up with increased market volatility  and whether that is a subscription business. So we can expect that to continue? Or that there‚Äôs any sort of cyclical nature to that  that‚Äôd be great to help me understand? Thank you very much.Theodor WeimerYeah  thanks  Haley  for the question. In both questions  I can give you one answer. So our index business what we show here  where we continue to get basically a license for providing for the stock in the tax business. So that‚Äôs really very closely related to each other. So the more U.S. derivatives contracts are traded  the higher license fee income is on continuous side. And therefore  yes  there is some cyclical component included here.Haley TamSuper. Thank you.OperatorSo we‚Äôre coming to the next question  and it comes from Michael Werner from UBS.Michael WernerThank you for the presentation. My question is on the FX tailwinds to the revenue side  you highlighted the underlying organic growth on costs. I was just wondering if you could provide what the year-on-year revenue growth would have been in the constant currency world. And particularly  whether the ‚Äì what the 8% secular revenue growth in Q2 would have been in a constant currency world? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerAll right. So with regard to the FX tailwind on revenues  so overall  we have a positive EBITDA impact  if we say on the cost side  it‚Äôs a roughly a 2% impact on the revenue  it‚Äôs roughly a 1% to 2% and FX on the cost side is more 2% to 3%. So overall  it‚Äôs positive if the U.S. dollar is stronger compared to the euro.The second question  the 8% secular growth on a constant portfolio basis  I think  it is a constant portfolio basis  because we say overall  the 20% cost in the first half year  we said its 8% secular  8% cyclical  and roughly 3% is M&A. So we already exclude the impact here. If your question goes into direction  whether it‚Äôs also an FX impact onto secular growth  then it could be this number I‚Äôve done in my mind  but it could be maybe 1% lower.Gregor PottmeyerPretty much  Gregor.OperatorThe next question comes from Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonHi. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on the results. I guess just looking at the outlook. And just this also sort of goes back to the cost question. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how much of the revenue beat is going to drop through to EBITDA. So I guess  at the moment consensus is just shy of ‚Ç¨4 billion of revenues  and ‚Ç¨2.35 billion of EBITDA  so close to a sort of one-for-one drop through. But given your comments around some of the inflationary and FX pressures  I guess it feels like some of those cost pressures endure into the second half. And so there would be some offset. Is there a good way for us to think about that sort of that drop through from there?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Thanks  Bruce. Obviously  for the expected question around our operating leverage even if you don‚Äôt take this word. I think we are fully able to show operating leverage for our existing core business  right? So if you would just take the Eurex core numbers  where you have clearly a big increase in the EBITDA margin. And if I would just do that for the Eurex core business. And you see it and it‚Äôs documented in our Clearstream Security Services business where we have basically doubled an increase in EBITDA compared to the revenue  so here you‚Äôll see that we are fully able to deliver the operating leverage.Why you don‚Äôt see the significant impact here on group level  so there are basically three elements to explain. So on EBITDA margin level  so the first impact is out of the impact in our equity results  right? So in the first half year is even on a constant basis  or I think it‚Äôs two times ‚Ç¨32 million. But last year  we made for the full year some ‚Ç¨85 million. And currently  I do not expect another ‚Ç¨50 million for that. So that‚Äôs number one. So let‚Äôs impact here out of tailwinds in the equity result.Secondly  our M&A is dilutive for our overall business  right? So we acquire business. So let‚Äôs take the biggest one  the ISS  there‚Äôs a margin of today roughly 30%. And that‚Äôs obviously below the 60% or 50% plus you have in our existing businesses. So these are basically the reasons by on group level and we already anticipated that  when we gave our guidance in Compass 2019  where we say  look  we want to grow on our top line is 10%. And it‚Äôs basically the same on our bottom line. So basically  the cost increase is compatible with that  so that we have a constant EBITDA margin. And again  the main impact M&A slightly diluted  and secondly  the onetimers we have in our equity results.Bruce HamiltonGot it. Ando so just a follow-up  though  in the second half  do you expect that the FX headwinds on costs and the inflationary pressures those will persist? So we‚Äôll be running a bit higher than the 5% organic  that‚Äôs probably here to stay for the second half? Or would there be any change?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. So from a cost development perspective  I think the M&A contribution will obviously go down  so on a constant portfolio basis. Secondly  the FX impact will increase assuming that we will continue to see that kind of that strong U.S. dollar compared to the euro. So my expectation is that this will increase and basically the organic portfolio constant FX will be the same like in the first half year.Bruce HamiltonGot it. Thank you.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Philip Middleton from the Bank of America.Philip MiddletonYeah. Thanks very much. And as always  we‚Äôre all asking the same thing. So if we could just return to the costs for a minute? I think you just said that you expect that the 3% and the 3% effectively representing the inflationary impact for this year  and the share payments to roll through into the next half  just to check that‚Äôs correct. And secondly  if it is  when you‚Äôre talking about the first component of that  there was some ‚Äì there was a bit at ‚Äì the end you tacked on and general inflation. How important is general inflation in that figure compared to the investing to build new services  which is obviously something you‚Äôve always said you‚Äôll do when you‚Äôve got the headroom to do it?Theodor WeimerYeah  so thanks for this question. So  obviously  the general inflation is higher than in previous years  there‚Äôs no doubt. There‚Äôs pressure ‚Äì more inflationary pressure on the salary side  even if you hire new people. The inflationary pressure  obviously  in our energy costs  if you all know that  but it‚Äôs across all cost segments. And so you can see usually our inflation was in the range of 2% to 3%  now it‚Äôs roughly 1 percentage point higher it‚Äôs 3% to 4%. And therefore  we are even lower than  let‚Äôs say  it‚Äôs 8% what you see in the markets general. So  yes  the general inflation is higher than originally expected.With regard to your first question  so what we show is organic cost on a constant portfolio and constant FX basis  so it‚Äôs a 6% roughly in the first half year. Yes  I said  I expect basically is the same for the ‚Äì roughly the same for the ‚Äì increase for the second half year  because owners we basically built provision on the current level and we would have to do basically the same now  and from a share price development also higher than compare to the first half year. So this would be most probably a comparable number [for the main tool] [ph] for the product general inflation.Philip MiddletonOkay. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Johannes Thormann  HSBC.Johannes ThormannGood afternoon  everybody. First of all  a question on Clearstream  you elaborated the strengths of customer revenues also did you in a fix effect? Can you quantify this effect? And also looking at the decline of settlement fees over the last quarter. This has been the weakest level since many quarters. Is this the bottom? Or do you feel it could continue to decline? And just on your next Fund Services customer migration  can you elaborate a bit more how you‚Äôre progressing with that? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  obviously  for the ‚Äì starting with the second question on the Front Services migration. So we are proceeding as planned? So we told you that both parts of the Clearstream business  so the Fund Service business and Security Services business  we will show it more on an autonomous more and more independent basis  so that you have higher strategic flexibility here  for instance  going into partnerships. And so we are proceeding as expected and hope that the majority of the work we will have done at the end of the year  or beginning of next year.Your first question around the customer revenues here. Yes  there‚Äôs obviously in the FX impact you asked  yes  there is a positive FX impact for our dollar-denominated custody. I don‚Äôt have the exact number  Jan.Jan StreckerAround 15% of the assets under custody  and the ICD  which are denominated in U.S. dollar.Gregor PottmeyerOkay. Jan has a precise number  right? And with regard to the decline in the settlement process  so as in the first quarter  where we see some decrease in the retail segment  and that‚Äôs the main driver for the reduction in the settlement area.Johannes ThormannOkay. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Benjamin Goy  Deutsche Bank. Over to you.Benjamin GoyYes. Hi  good afternoon. Just staying with Fund Services and to better understand  because your assets under custody are down roughly 7% since the peak  which  if you look at many asset managers is actually quite good. So could you quantify the inflows from new business you have whether it‚Äôs new clients  whether they bring on more business  rather than just a simple mark-to-market? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Thanks  Benjamin  first of all  the question on the Fund Service topic. And it‚Äôs worth to elaborate a little bit. So currently  you show a 14% growth number. But there are also positive elements out of our Kneip acquisition. So on organic basis  it‚Äôs 6% basically. And now you could argue  oh  why is it just a single-digit number? I thought it‚Äôs a double-digit number. And therefore  there are two or three elements to explain it. So the first is  what we elaborated in our speaking notes is that market performance on the equity level specifically are obviously lower. And currently  that‚Äôs roughly a headwind of 4 to 5 percentage points here. So that‚Äôs the first way we have some cyclical headwinds.Secondly  we currently see some reluctance from ‚Äì as you already mentioned  some reluctance from investors and asset managers to really invest in the fund space  due to the uncertainty of the markets. But we expect that at a certain point of time  and this will also disappear. And firstly  our customer onboarding process  so still it‚Äôs a great pipeline and it‚Äôs continued to be very successful. But to show  on a constant basis  continued success here in onboarding on a quarterly basis  I think it‚Äôs a little bit challenging. And therefore  we can promise you  we are likely on there  and it‚Äôs a strong customer pipeline.And overall  from a secular perspective  we are convinced that we are able to deliver double-digit growth also for the next quarters and years.Benjamin GoyUnderstood.

Since then  we have turned this vision into reality and become the second largest low Earth orbit satellite operator in the world. [Today's] announcement is another bold step in OneWeb's remarkable journey. It is testament to the resilience  execution and innovation of our teams  the strong demand we have seen since launching our commercial services  and the close collaboration we have forged with our partners to provide high-speed  low latency connectivity for governments  businesses  and communities. This combination accelerates our mission to deliver connectivity that will change lives at scale and create a fast growing  well-funded company which will continue to create significant value for our shareholders.""Eutelsat Communications (Euronext Paris: ETL) and key OneWeb shareholders have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the objective of creating a leading global player in Connectivity through the combination of both companies in an all-share transaction. Eutelsat will combine its 36-strong fleet of GEO satellites with OneWeb's constellation of 648 Low Earth Orbit satellites  of which 428 are currently in orbit.The transaction would be structured as an exchange of OneWeb shares by its shareholders (other than Eutelsat) with new shares issued by Eutelsat  such that  at closing  Eutelsat would own 100% of OneWeb (excluding the 'Special Share' of the UK Government). OneWeb shareholders would receive 230 million newly issued Eutelsat shares representing 50% of the enlarged share capital4.The potential transaction builds on the deepening collaboration between Eutelsat and OneWeb  begun with the equity stake acquired by Eutelsat in OneWeb in April 2021  the global distribution agreement between Eutelsat and OneWeb announced in March 2022  and the new exclusive commercial partnership5  addressing mainly the European and global cruise markets  signed today.Commenting on the combination  Dominique D'Hinnin  Eutelsat's Chairman said ""I am delighted to announce this new and significant step in the collaboration between Eutelsat and OneWeb. Bringing together our two businesses will deliver a global first  combining LEO constellations and GEO assets to seize the significant growth opportunity in Connectivity  and deliver to our customers solutions to their needs across an even wider range of applications.""This combination will accelerate the commercialisation of OneWeb's fleet  while enhancing the attractiveness of Eutelsat's growth profile. In addition  the combination carries significant value creation potential  anchored on a balanced mix of revenue  cost and capex synergies. The strong support of strategic shareholders of both parties is a testament to the huge opportunity that this combination offers and the value that will be created for all its stakeholders. This is truly a game changer for our industry.""Sunil Bharti Mittal  OneWeb's Executive Chairman said ""Having played a pioneering role in providing connectivity in the emerging world  I am excited about the possibilities of connecting the unconnected. The combination of Eutelsat and OneWeb represents a significant development in that direction as well as a unique GEO/LEO combination.""The positive early results of our service together with our strong pipeline represent a very exciting opportunity in the fast-growing satellite connectivity segment  especially for customers requiring a high speed  low latency experience. Our customers are actively seeking a combined GEO/LEO offering leading us towards this important step. Bharti  as the lead shareholder of OneWeb  along with other key shareholders  is looking forward to playing a meaningful role in providing expanded connectivity through the combination of OneWeb and Eutelsat.""Eva Berneke  Eutelsat's Chief Executive Officer said ""Our initial investment in OneWeb was underpinned by our strong belief that the future growth in Connectivity will be driven by both GEO and LEO capacity. This belief has intensified as our relationship with OneWeb has deepened  first by raising our stake in the company  and then with the global distribution agreement signed a few months ago. We are now moving to the next level  with a full combination that will ensure the potential of the GEO/LEO integration is fully realized  supported by compelling financial  strategic  and industrial logic.""This ground-breaking combination will create a powerful global player with the financial strength and technical expertise to accelerate both OneWeb's commercial deployment  and Eutelsat's pivot to Connectivity. The combined entity will be geared towards profitable growth  with strong medium-term cash flow generation and a rapid deleveraging driven by strong forecast EBITDA growth. The benefits for our customers and strategic partners  who are at the center of our strategy  are both significant and unique. This is also a very exciting opportunity for our employees who will be key to the success of this transformation.""Neil Masterson  OneWeb's Chief Executive Officer said ""Just 20 months ago  OneWeb resumed its mission to connect the unconnected and remove the barriers to connectivity that hold back many of the world's underserved economies and communities. Since then  we have turned this vision into reality and become the second largest low Earth orbit satellite operator in the world. Today's announcement is another bold step in OneWeb's remarkable journey.""It is testament to the resilience  execution and innovation of our teams  the strong demand we have seen since launching our commercial services  and the close collaboration we have forged with our partners to provide high-speed  low latency connectivity for governments  businesses  and communities. This combination accelerates our mission to deliver connectivity that will change lives at scale and create a fast growing  well-funded company which will continue to create significant value for our shareholders.""A compelling market opportunityEutelsat and OneWeb will address the considerable Connectivity market opportunity  which is fueled by the growing needs of customers in both the B2B and B2C segments for consistent  reliable connectivity. These market segments are forecast to grow by three and five times respectively over the next decade  to reach a combined value of circa $16bn by 2030  with growth being served by both GEO HTS and LEO capacity6.Moreover  the combination of the network density  compelling economics and high throughput of GEO with the low latency and ubiquity of LEO  creates the optimal solution to address an even wider range of customer needs  thereby expanding the addressable market.A powerful combination  representing a game-changer in the industryThe operations of Eutelsat and OneWeb are highly complementary. A clear roadmap has been designed to develop over time a complementary GEO/LEO service including a common platform  hybrid terminals and a fully mutualized network creating a one-stop shop solution for customers  providing them with a unique offering and a seamless user experience.Tapping into significant revenue  cost and capex synergiesThe combination of Eutelsat with OneWeb is forecast to generate substantial value:Average annual revenue synergies are estimated at circa euro 150m after four years  with hybrid GEO/LEO offerings providing a premium service to customers as well as improving the fill rate.Synergies from joining organizational forces are expected to generate annual run-rate savings of over euro 80m pre-tax after five years  mostly through cost duplication avoidance.Capex optimization is expected to generate average savings estimated at circa euro 80m per annum  from year one. This would be achieved by leveraging the hybrid GEO/LEO satellite infrastructure and through the improved purchasing power of the combined entity.These sources of incremental value creation represent a balanced split between revenues  costs and capex. Taken together they equate to a net present value of over euro 1.5bn after tax (net of implementation costs).Value-creative pathway to robust  profitable growthThe transaction provides a platform for both entities to create value while transforming their respective growth profiles and cash generation potential.Combined entity would have revenues of circa euro 1.2bn and EBITDA of circa euro 0.7bn in FY22-23.Revenues are forecast to grow at low double-digit CAGR over the next decade.EBITDA is expected to grow at a mid-teen CAGR over the medium to long term  outpacing sales growth  with EBITDA margin levels moving gradually back in line with best-in-class GEO standards.The capex of the combined entity is estimated in average at some euro 725m to euro 875m  per annum  over the period FY23-24 - FY29-30.Well-funded investment programme and rapid deleveragingEutelsat's strong cash flow generation will provide both visibility and funding to develop OneWeb's fleet at minimal risk. Combined EBITDA - CAPEX  standing at circa - euro 0.2bn in FY22-23 is expected to be back in positive territory by FY24-25 - FY25-26 (depending on Gen-2 capex phasing).Eutelsat will temporarily suspend its dividend  and cash flow will be focused on the deployment of the Gen 2 constellation while maintaining a strong balance sheet.Leverage  which would stand at circa 4x net debt / EBITDA post transaction  is expected to be reduced on the back of strong EBITDA growth  backed by a disciplined financial policy  with an objective of leverage of circa 3x in the medium term.Eutelsat will pay its dividend in respect of FY21-22 with a scrip option. Thereafter  the dividend will be suspended for FY22-23 and FY23-24.Structure of the transactionThe transaction would be structured as an exchange of OneWeb shares for newly issued Eutelsat shares.

This kind of decision is always difficult  and we will do our best to assist affected employees.We have pioneering solutions  services and software that are key enablers in helping confront the current challenges faced by the food value chain which include inflation  labor scarcity and rising complexity. While continuously innovating to maintain our leadership in the industry  we proactively moved forward in the middle of the pandemic and ramped up sales and service coverage around the world ahead of the growth curve. We also decided to meet our customers in person and demonstrate our leadership at leading tradeshows in the quarter  where our poultry  meat and fish industries introduced over 25 new solutions that automate  digitize  and optimize food processing sustainably. Sales and marketing cost is peaking at 14% in second quarter and will move towards the 2023 target of 12%.We have actively raised prices in recent quarters. In hindsight we were too late to raise prices when faced with the inflationary environment last year. The all-time high orders reflect our strong brand and market position  being able to pass on costs in an inflationary environment that demands more automation and sustainable use of raw materials.In light of the volatility in current market conditions  we have revised our year-end 2023 EBIT target to a run-rate of 14-16% from the previously stated 16%. There is full focus and firm commitment to drive the performance improvements needed  centered on actions around productivity  procurement  and pricing. Pricing  both in the actions already enacted and in our ongoing pricing discipline  will filter into a higher revenue base. To increase productivity and ramp up revenues  we are refining our operating model to create a scalable growth platform with a sustainable cost structure. Stepping up short-term profitability and robust cash flow are key elements to fuel our ambition to become the one-stop-shop in this highly attractive growth industry and support our target of 50% of total revenues deriving from the recurring service and software business.The acquisition of Wenger  a global leader in processing solutions for the high growth markets of pet food  plant-based proteins  and aqua feed  is a platform investment which will form the fourth segment in Marel‚Äôs business model. The acquisition is expected to be margin and earnings enhancing.‚ÄùFinancial performanceWenger  a strategic platform acquisition successfully closed in Q2The acquisition of Wenger  a global leader in extrusion and dryer solutions focused on pet food  plant-based proteins and aqua feed  was successfully closed for a total investment of USD 540m on 9 June 2022.A platform investment into new and attractive growth markets. Led by Jesper Hjortsh√∏j  former VP Business Development and VP Prepared Foods  this fourth business segment is reported under other in 2Q22  and as of 3Q22 will be part of segment reporting  alongside poultry  meat and fish.With over 60% of revenues from pet food  the company has a global leading position within their focus market segments and Wenger has in recent years made its mark on the fast-growing  plant-based protein consumer market with best-in-class solutions positioned right at the center point of the value chain. Wenger enjoys a strong foothold in the North American market and over 40% of revenues are recurring service and maintenance revenues. Wenger‚Äôs revenues have organically grown approximately 5% 2017-2021; revenues in 2022 are expected to be USD 190 million and EBITDA is expected to be USD 32-35 million.The two companies have complementary technology and product portfolios  where Marel will add capabilities  such as weighing  sorting  inspection  low-pressure forming and thermal treatment to strengthen the value proposition.In the 21 days since closing the transaction  Wenger accounted for around 2.9% of Marel‚Äôs total revenues in 2Q22.Third sequential quarter of record orders receivedThe demand for Marel‚Äôs pioneering solutions is on the rise evidenced by record orders received and a very strong pipeline. Need for automation and digitalization investments in food processing is accelerated by the pandemic  geopolitical tensions  rising inflation and labor scarcity.Third sequential quarter of record orders received in 2Q22 of EUR 471.8m up 11.9% QoQ and 27.1% YoY (1Q22: 421.7m  2Q21: 371.3m).

The Biobank is ‚Ä¶,NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Medidata  a Dassault Syst√®mes company  is supporting the White House Cancer Moonshot initiative by working with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to enroll patients in the Cancer Moonshot Biobank. The Biobank is a project designed to better understand how cancer develops and grows  and why some cancers stop responding to treatment. People with cancer are asked to donate tumor tissue  blood samples  and health data to find discoveries that improve cancer treatments and increase survival.Medidata  Theradex Oncology  and NCI are helping enroll patients in the Biobank across more than 100 clinical sites in the U.S. This team works together to engage and educate study volunteers  accurately and securely collect patient information in the clinical trial  and enroll patients in the project.

Constant currency change is calculated by taking current year results and comparing against prior year results restated at current year rates.Q2 2022 ResultsRevenue for the second quarter of 2022 (""Q2 2022"") was ‚Ç¨2 535 million  an increase of 25.4% year-over-year  or 17.3% in constant currency. UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all had strong revenue growth  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter grew 18.7% year-over-year  or 8.8% in constant currency  to ‚Ç¨507 million  driven by revenue growth. EBITDA margin was 20.0%  compared to 21.1% in the second quarter of 2021 (""Q2 2021""). EBITDA and EBITDA margin in Q2 2021 were impacted by a net ‚Ç¨2 million of share-based compensation and expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam. Excluding these expenses  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 18.2% year-over-year  or 8.3% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.0%  compared to 21.2% in the second quarter of 2021.As disclosed in the UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). In prior years  these revenues were recognised when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters  with a benefit of ‚Ç¨98 million in revenue and ‚Ç¨17 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022.In addition  as previously disclosed  Q2 2021 benefited from a catch-up payment from a digital service provider (the ""DSP Catch-Up Payment"")  amounting to ‚Ç¨41 million in revenue and ‚Ç¨26 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Excluding the Change in Society Accounting and DSP Catch-Up Payment  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.1% in Q2 2022  compared to 20.3% in Q2 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.H1 2022 ResultsIn the half year ended June 30  2022 (""H1 2022"")  UMG's revenues of ‚Ç¨4 734 million increased by 23.6%  or 16.9% in constant currency  compared to the half year ended June 30  2021 (""H1 2021""). This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 27.4% to ‚Ç¨2 608 million in H1 2022  reflecting higher revenues and revenue mix. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to 55.1% from 53.4% driven by higher artist costs from a greater proportion of Music Publishing revenues in H1 2022 as well as the impact of the DSP Catch-Up Payment and a previously disclosed exceptional recovery of an advance provision and release of historic royalties (the ""Exceptional Recovery and Release"") in the first quarter of 2021 (with a ‚Ç¨20 million impact) that all benefited artists costs relative to revenues in the prior year period.Operating profit improved 11.8% year-over-year  or 6.7% in constant currency  to ‚Ç¨765 million in H1 2022 driven by the growth in revenues. EBITDA amounted to ‚Ç¨960 million  an increase of 16.8%  or 11.1% in constant currency  compared to H1 2021  also as a result of the growth in revenues.EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨2 million during H1 2022 and by ‚Ç¨3 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during H1 2021. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 was ‚Ç¨962 million  up 16.6% compared to H1 2021  or 11.0% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 1.2pp year-over-year to 20.3%.Revenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 benefited from the Change in Society Accounting discussed above  amounting to ‚Ç¨144 million in revenue and ‚Ç¨34 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Revenue for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment described above  while EBITDA for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment and the Exceptional Recovery and Release described above.Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2% in H1 2022  compared to 20.6% in H1 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for H1 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨241 million compared to ‚Ç¨452 million in H1 2021  resulting in EPS of ‚Ç¨0.13 in H1 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨0.25 in H1 2021. The decline in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was due to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment) and other financial investments that was an expense in H1 2022 of ‚Ç¨567 million compared to a net expense in H1 2021 of ‚Ç¨170 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments amongst other items  amounted to ‚Ç¨763 million in H1 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨578 million in H1 2021  resulting in Adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨0.42 in H1 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨0.32 in H1 2021. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in EBITDA and a decline in interest and income tax expense  both driven by a ‚Ç¨100 million benefit from two tax litigations finalized in H1 2022.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and equivalents  at the end of H1 2022 was ‚Ç¨2 283 million compared to ‚Ç¨2 010 million at December 31  2021.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved to ‚Ç¨605 million in H1 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨470 million in H1 2021  an increase of 28.7%  mainly as a result of the growth in EBITDA and favourable working capital movements. Royalty advance payments  net of recoupments grew to ‚Ç¨223 million in H1 2022 from ‚Ç¨130 million in H1 2021  due to the timing of major artist renewals partly offset by higher recoupment.Free cash flow decreased to ‚Ç¨104 million in H1 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨280 million in H1 2021  mainly as a result of the timing of catalogue acquisitions (-‚Ç¨221 million)  whilst the prior half year benefited from the disposal of Alamo Records (-‚Ç¨102 million).

It was the highest Q2 revenue in the group‚Äôs history.Activities outside of France are growing quickly as the rollout of fiber-optic networks is getting underway in most of the countries where Solutions 30 operates. In France  performance continues to be impacted by the operational transition linked to the maturity of certain markets and a high basis for comparison.Solutions 30‚Äôs consolidated half-year revenue for 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨444.4 million  up +0.7% (-1.5% on an organic basis). Revenue is stabilizing at a high level due to record deals the group signed in the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021. The COVID crisis fueled an urgent need to deploy ultra-fast broadband in France and resulted in record growth rates of over 20% for Solutions 30.Revenue by regionFrance: In the second quarter of 2022  Solutions 30 had revenue of ‚Ç¨105.2 million  down 18.0% due to a high basis of comparison with the same quarter in 2021.With ‚Ç¨74.7 million in revenue  the telecom business is down 18.4% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Solutions 30 is pursuing its operational transition in a market that has matured after five years of exponential growth. In addition  the geographical redeployment of one of the group‚Äôs major contracts is weighing on the operational efficiency of the French subsidiaries  especially in the southern half of France. The new parameters of this contract have added constraints on Solutions 30 and its competitors  and the Group must review its processes and methods  recruit and train its staff to obtain new authorizations  while readjusting its structures locally and preparing for the future. These adjustments  which were initiated in the second half of 2021  have continued to impact the group‚Äôs profitability  and EBITDA in France will be lower than in the second half of 2021.Story continuesFor the energy business  revenue reached ‚Ç¨12.9 million  compared with ‚Ç¨21.1 million a year earlier  a decline of 39% due to the end of smart electricity meter deployments in France. Activities related to electric mobility and renewable energies have been delayed due to supply chain problems and are not yet compensating for this fall in revenue.The IT business posted revenue of ‚Ç¨11.9 million  up 9% for the quarter  while the security and payments business generated ‚Ç¨5.7 million in revenue  compared to ‚Ç¨4.7 million a year earlier.Over the first six months of the year  revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨221.9 million  down 17.9%.Benelux: Revenue in the second quarter of 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨51.8 million compared to ‚Ç¨37.9 million a year earlier  representing organic growth of 36.7%.The telecoms business  which grew organically by 29.7%  generated quarterly revenue of ‚Ç¨37.4 million. The ramp-up of the contracts signed with Fiberklaar and Open Dutch Fiber in the second half of 2021 is continuing at a steady pace and sales continue to deliver  as evidenced by the recent contract signed with Unifiber.Revenue for the energy business amounted to ‚Ç¨10.2 million  compared with ‚Ç¨5.4 million a year earlier  representing purely organic growth of 90.9%. The deployment of smart meters in Flanders on behalf of Fluvius began during the first quarter of 2021 and is now fully developed.For the IT business  revenue was up 7.6% to ‚Ç¨2.3 million  compared with ‚Ç¨2.1 million a year earlier. Quarterly revenue from the retail and security businesses was ‚Ç¨1.9 million compared to ‚Ç¨1.6 million for the second quarter of 2021.Over the entire first half of 2022  revenue rose by 31.5% to ‚Ç¨98.5 million.In all other countries  the group posted quarterly revenue of ‚Ç¨64.8 million  an increase of 29.9% (18.7% organic growth) compared to the same period in 2021.In Germany  revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨15.1 million compared to ‚Ç¨15.3 million the previous year. The return to growth is expected in the second half of 2022  when the efforts made by the group to adapt its organization should begin to bear fruit.In Italy  revenue grew by 59% in the second quarter of 2022 to ‚Ç¨18.4 million  driven by the deployment of TIM‚Äôs ultra-fast infrastructure deployments in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley.In Iberia  revenue grew by 8% to ‚Ç¨14.4 million  thanks to strong momentum in the telecoms business (fiber and 5G mobile networks).In Poland  the group posted revenue of ‚Ç¨8 million  up 34% (19% organic growth). The integration of Sirtel is proceeding well and the group continues to gain market share in this region  as demonstrated by the extension of the services the group provides to Orange.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 posted quarterly revenue of ‚Ç¨8.7 million  up 152% (20% organic growth)  thanks to the excellent momentum in the telecoms sector and the start-up of new ultra-fast Internet and 5G deployment programs.In all of these countries  the group posted revenue of ‚Ç¨124 million for the first half of 2022  an increase of 29.2% (18.9% organic growth) compared to the first half of 2021.Strengthening governance  risk management  and complianceSolutions 30 continues to consolidate its internal structures and in the first half of the year implemented strengthened and standardized governance  risk management  and compliance procedures.The group has published new ethics and compliance policies  and has launched an awareness and training program for its teams throughout Europe. The group‚Äôs subcontractors and suppliers are subject to systematic controls  and a dedicated team is responsible for monitoring the integrity and reliability of the group‚Äôs partners.This work is helping to transform Solutions 30. While maintaining its agility and strong entrepreneurial values  Solutions 30 is consolidating its commitments to high ethical standards  compliance  and the environment  as well as its role in society.To support this change  the Supervisory Board has decided to strengthen the powers of its committees. The Strategy Committee has been renamed the Strategy and ESG Committee. It has five independent members: Jean-Paul Cottet (President)  Caroline Tissot  Francesco Serafini  Pascale Mourvillier  and Thomas Kremer  the latter two newly appointed. With its new remit  this committee will be responsible for ensuring that environmental  social  and governance criteria are integrated into the group‚Äôs strategy with the aim of achieving sustainable and responsible growth.The Audit Committee has been renamed the Audit  Risk and Compliance Committee. It has three independent members: Yves Kerveillant (President)  Pascale Mourvillier  and now Thomas Kremer. The committee is responsible for overseeing the relevance of financial information and the reliability of risk management and internal control processes. It has been significantly strengthened by the arrival of Pascale Mourvillier and Thomas Kremer over the past six months.OutlookThe group‚Äôs operational transition in France and the ramp-up of contracts will weigh on margins in the first half of 2022  which will be lower than in the second half of 2021. In the second half of 2022  growth is expected to accelerate  although it will remain below 10% as volumes fall due to supply chain difficulties affecting certain fiber-optic markets and activities related to the energy transition. However  the group‚Äôs EBITDA should start to improve as costs from the ramp-up of new contracts are absorbed and operational processes return to normal in France.In addition  in light of current inflation  Solutions 30 has been increasing its rates  both on its new contracts and on its existing contracts  and some of these revised rates have already had an impact on Q2 revenue. The group has also taken measures to control operating costs with the aim of preserving a solid financial structure with very little debt. Such a structure will support its ability to finance its growth  increase its agility  strengthen its competitive advantages  and preserve its future capacity to pursue consolidation in its sector.In conclusion  in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty  Solutions 30 is adapting but remains cautious while maintaining its course. Organic growth and operational execution are the two priorities. As illustrated by the signature of major new contracts in several countries‚Äîespecially in Belgium and Poland‚Äîthe growth of activities outside France will continue in the months and years to come. In the longer term  Solutions 30 has solid growth drivers and an effective model to self-finance its development  both of which will enable it to consolidate its position at the heart of the digital transformation and the energy transition.Upcoming event2022 HY Earnings Report September 28  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

This performance was  in particular  reached thanks to the very dynamic growth in Merchant Services with a steady expansion of acquiring volumes  a solid merchants count deployment  and numerous new large merchant wins and partnerships.This strong business trends coupled with cost optimization plans  integration synergies and operating leverage  allowed the Group to deliver a 80 basis points margin expansion led  as planned  by a very significant improvement in Merchant Services profitability.In parallel  we continued to execute our strategic initiatives during the semester with the closing of three acquisitions (Axepta Italy  ANZ commercial acquiring business in Australia  and Eurobank Merchant Acquiring in Greece) which will  from now on  significantly contribute to our Merchant Services success. The disposal process of TSS is fully on track  with closing confirmed for the second half of the year. This will provide Worldline with further financial flexibility to seize consolidation opportunities in our strong M&A pipeline.Story continuesThanks to this very strong start of the year  we fully confirm our 2022 annual guidance  and reiterate our 2024 ambition to establish Worldline as a premium global Paytech at the heart of the European payment ecosystem.‚ÄùH1 2022 key figuresIn ‚Ç¨ million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Revenue* 2 020 1 794 +12.6% OMDA* 468 401 +16.7% % of revenue 23.2% 22.3% +80 bps Net income Group share from continued operations** 53 53 +0.4% % of statutory revenue from continued operations 2.6% 3.1% Normalized net income Group share from continued operations** 213 169 +26.2% % of statutory revenue from continued operations 10.5% 10.0% Free cash flow (FCF) from continued operations 229 143 +60.4% OMDA to FCF conversion rate*** 49.0% 37.3% Closing net debt (before IFRS 5)* 3 456 2 939* H1 2021 at constant scope and exchange rates** H1 2021 amounts restated in application of IFRS 5*** H1 2021 conversion rate calculated on H1 2021 statutory OMDA from continued operationsWorldline‚Äôs H1 2022 revenue reached ‚Ç¨ 2 020 million  representing a solid +12.6% revenue organic growth (of which +13.5% in Q2). This achievement was reached thanks  in particular  to the continuous growth acceleration in Merchant Services reflecting the widespread and rapid shift towards digital payments as well as the Group‚Äôs strong positioning following the acquisition of Ingenico. Mobility & e-Transactional Services also contributed to growth acceleration  delivering a strong +10.3% organic growth in Q2 after having delivered +8.4% in Q1. Financial Services was up by +3.0% in Q2 (+2.5% in Q1) despite the temporary impact from the price decrease conceded by the Group for the successful synchronous renewals of historical large contracts of Equens done in Q4 2021.This strong execution also materialized in the Group‚Äôs Operating Margin before Depreciation and Amortization (OMDA) reaching ‚Ç¨ 468 million in H1 2022; representing 23.2% of revenue  an improvement by +80 basis points compared to H1 2021 at constant scope and exchange rates. This profitability improvement was led in particular by Merchant Services posting +310 basis points thanks to the acceleration of revenue growth fostering operating leverage; synergies from Ingenico; and effects of transversal productivity improvement actions.Net loss Group share amounted to ‚Ç¨-42 million  including a ‚Ç¨-96 million loss attributable to discontinued operations. Net income Group share from continued operations reached ‚Ç¨ 53 million  stable year-on-year. Normalized net income Group share from continued operations (excluding unusual and infrequent items  Group share  net of tax) reached ‚Ç¨ 213 million  increasing by +26.2% or ‚Ç¨ 44 million compared to H1 2021 Normalized net income Group share (restated in application of IFRS 5).Normalized diluted EPS was ‚Ç¨ 0.76 in H1 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨ 0.59 in H1 2021 (restated in application of IFRS 5).Free cash flow from continued operations in H1 2021 was ‚Ç¨ 229 million  representing a 49.0% cash conversion of OMDA (free cash flow divided by OMDA)  in line with the expected half-yearly pattern of 2022.Group Net debt before IFRS 5 amounted to ‚Ç¨ 3 456 million at the end of June 2022  reflecting free cash flow generated over the semester on one side  as well as the cash-out for the acquisitions closed during the period on the other side.Focus on Q2 2022 revenue performanceIn ‚Ç¨ million Q2 2022 Q2 2021* Organic change Merchant Services 751 639 +17.6% Financial Services 235 228 +3.0% Mobility & e-Transactional Services 95 86 +10.3% Worldline 1 081 952 +13.5%* at constant scope and exchange ratesWorldline‚Äôs Q2 2022 revenue reached ‚Ç¨ 1 081 million  representing a strong +13.5% organic growth with all Global Business Lines contributing to growth acceleration.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services‚Äô revenue in Q2 2022 reached ‚Ç¨ 751 million  representing an strong organic growth by +17.6%  led in particular by the strong acquiring MSV growth and new merchants gained. The growth was mainly led by:Commercial Acquiring showed a strong double-digit growth trending towards 30%  for almost all geographies and customer segments with strong dynamics and a good cash-to-card conversion trend;Payment Acceptance also contributed to the growth of Merchant Services thanks to mid-single-digit organic growth. Growth was spread in all geographies with strong volumes for SMBs and large retailers. While benefiting from a significant recovery of travel related volumes  digital commerce (representing almost half of the acceptance business) faced a more difficult situation due to the impact of the stop of Russian activities; andDigital Services grew at a high single-digit  led by a strong recovery in Germany compensating as anticipated some limited delays in POS supply during the quarter.Merchant Services performance reflects a very strong development of market positions all along the semester  notably in commercial acquiring  as illustrated by the following business KPI:Worldline‚Äôs acquiring merchant base continued to steadily grow with c. 60 000 new merchants onboarded on the Group platform over the first semester of the year  reaching 1.2 million merchants as of end of June 2022 (including Axepta Italy and Handelsbanken merchants in both H1 2022 and H1 2021). It represents a +10% increase over the semester led by a strong dynamic in both instore (+9%) and online (+14%) merchants count.Acquired MSV also continued to expand with an overall acquiring MSV reaching ‚Ç¨ 147 billion in H1 2022  up +30% versus H1 2021 and up +28% versus H1 2019. This H1 2022 MSV performance has been fuelled by market share gains in both instore (+30%) and online (+31%).During the second quarter of the year  commercial activity in Merchant Services has been strong with numerous wins for both upsell with existing clients and contracts with large new merchants such as  among others  Myra  Eram  Alpiq  Icelandair  TUI Cruises  Iberostar  or Milanoo.In Q2  Worldline continued to play actively its orchestrator role of the payment industry with numerous partnerships signed such as the one with SoftPos  enlarging Worldline offering with a new value proposition for micro merchants with mobile Tap & Pay payment solution on Android mobile devices  with Casio for the simplification of the card acceptance in Japan leveraging Casio front-end positioning on the ECR market while combining it with Vesca NSP positioning  and with .planet through a joint offering providing full-service end-to-end integrated payment solution for hospitality  featuring omnichannel capabilities and DCC services.Financial ServicesFinancial Services delivered a +3.0% organic growth in Q2 2022  a slight acceleration compared to Q1 2022 (+2.5%)  with solid revenue flows partly compensating the temporary impact from the price decrease conceded by the Group for the renewals of historical large contracts of Equens in Q4 2021. As a results  Q2 2022 revenue reached ‚Ç¨ 235 million with the following performance by division:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing altogether) benefitted from improved volume trends over the quarter and a decent level of project activities. Nevertheless  these two units decreased organically due to price reductions conceded at renewal time of large processing contracts  as planned and already disclosed;Account Payments grew at a double-digit rate in Q2  supported by increased volumes and strong project demand  notably in Germany;Digital Banking delivered a mid-single digit organic growth led by higher authentications volumes related to ecommerce transactions due to enforcement of the PSD2 regulation compensating for lower iDeal volumes in the Netherlands.During the second quarter  several Financial Services contracts were signed or renewed by Worldline  and in particular with DFM  a financing partner for enterprises within the mobility sector which chose Worldline to be their Instant Payments and Clearing & Settlement mechanism partner  and with Aegon Bank N.V. for back-office processing for handling Instant payments  SEPA batch payments and multi-currency payments. Worldline also renewed for 5 years its contract with Credit Agricole Payment Services for the management of the ACS service (Access Control Server)  enabling issuing banks to manage 3DSecure processes and to authenticate cardholders during online payments. Finally  Worldline partnered with two fintechs in the Financial Services space; manager.one to offer to corporate cardholders a seamless experience for managing their business expenses  and Algoan to offer next-level credit assessment solution for lenders & service providers.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached ‚Ç¨ 95 million in Q2 2022  up organically by +10.3%  accelerating after +8.4% in Q1. Growth was spread in each of the three divisions:Trusted Digitization in particular strongly grew double-digit with several new projects and improving volumes in France  as well as higher volumes in Tax collection and digital healthcare in Latin America. The division also benefited from more support and project activity on eHealth solutions in Germany and increasing activity in Spain.e-Ticketing also grew at a double-digit rate thanks to higher transportation volumes and fare collection in the UK and as well as in Latin America where the activity also benefited from ticket tariff increases.e-Consumer & Mobility growth was supported in particular by the ramp-up of newly signed Contact contracts and the sale of solutions for connected vehicles.Commercial activity in Mobility & e-Transactional Services was strong in Q2  notably with a 6-year duration agreement with GTR  the UK‚Äôs largest railway operator delivering 24% of all passenger rail journeys has awarded Worldline with for the continued support of their booking office and on-board ticket issuing systems. Worldline was also selected by a large French metropole to build and operate the first project in France to incentive drivers to use more ecological virtuous transport mode  with a target of reducing up to 7% the traffic during peak hours  relieving the traffic and improving the air quality. In Trusted Services  GIE Sesam Vitale  the French public operator in charge of digitizing reimbursements covered by public health insurance in France has chosen Worldline to set up a large-scale SecNumCloud project  for the hosting and operation of the mobile application replacing the existing card centric system.H1 2022 OMDA performance per Global Business LineOMDA OMDA % In ‚Ç¨ million H1 2022 H1 2021* Organic change H1 2022 H1 2021* Organic change Merchant Services 352 264 +33.1% 25.5% 22.4% +310 bps Financial Services 123 129 -5.0% 26.8% 29.0% -220 bps Mobility & e-Transactional Services 26 25 +2.6% 13.9% 14.9% -90 bps Corporate costs -32 -18 +82.7% -1.6% -1.0% -60 bps Worldline 468 401 +16.7% 23.2% 22.3% +80 bps* at constant scope and exchange ratesMerchant ServicesMerchant Services‚Äô OMDA in H1 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨ 352 million  25.5% of revenue  representing a strong improvement by +310 basis points.

Improving our financial performance across the portfolio  growing our footprint in gas and industrial in Asia and China and accelerating towards new energies and sustainable feedstocks in Europe.EBITDA of EUR 433 million (HY1 2021: EUR 403 million). Adjusted for EUR 25 million positive currency translation effects  EBITDA increased by EUR 5 million. Positive revenue developments were offset by higher costs related to surging energy and utility prices. Growth project contribution in the first half 2022 continued to support EBITDA development.Costs of EUR 340 million (HY1 2021: EUR 301 million) due to surging energy prices (EUR 17 million)  currency translation effect (EUR 13 million) and cost for growth projects and business development.Proportional occupancy rate of 86% (HY1 2021: 88%) due to continued soft storage markets for oil compared to last year. There was an improvement from Q1 2022 (84%) driven mainly by Europe and Africa performance.EBIT of EUR 257 million (HY1 2021: EUR 245 million)  adjusted for EUR 18 million positive currency translation effects  EBIT decreased by EUR 6 million. Depreciation charges were higher in HY1 2022 compared to HY1 2021 mainly due to an increase in commissioned assets.Proportional operating cash return of 11.4% driven by lower operating capex during HY1 2022.Net profit attributable to holders of ordinary shares of EUR 128 million (HY1 2021: EUR 149 million). Tax charges increased as a result of the reversal of the deferred tax assets in the Netherlands.The senior net debt : EBITDA ratio is 2.86 at the end of HY1 2022  within our previously communicated ambition to keep senior net debt to EBITDA in the range of around 2.5-3.0x.Exceptional items HY1 2022:Vopak has recorded asset impairment charges of EUR 468 million.The valuations for impaired assets take into account: Impact on long-term financial projections for revenue and current dynamics related to inflation pressure  utility prices  labor and material costs and among others transition in the energy market associated with the Russia-Ukraine war. Vopak's proactive approach to repurpose some of its existing assets in line with the strategic priorities in which the growth of the company will be focused on its industrial and gas terminals  and accelerate towards new energies and sustainable feedstocks. The most recent energy transition scenarios in the OECD countries and a revised asset valuation methodology for oil assets.A breakdown of the total impairment charges is stated below: Europoort - EUR 240 million: By accelerating into new energies and repurposing some of its assets  Vopak Energy Terminal in Rotterdam (Europoort) will reduce its capacity by 2030 and will use the available land for new energy investments. Over time  this will reduce Vopak's exposure in oil assets in line with our ambition to increase the relative exposure of industrials  gas and new energies. Transition in the energy markets is expected to impact the long term revenue prospects of Europoort‚Äôs current activities  in addition to current dynamics related to inflation pressure  utility prices  labor and material costs. Botlek - EUR 190 million: Botlek terminal is below Vopak‚Äôs minimum return levels which is driven by lower revenue projections in addition to challenging conditions related to among others inflation pressure  utility prices and labor costs. SPEC LNG Colombia - EUR 36 million: Due to weather conditions in recent years which have brought a significant amount of rain in Colombia  hydropower has been available as the main source of power  which resulted in a reduced utilization of the FSRU. In addition  the tight FSRU market associated with the Russia - Ukraine war is leading to the opportunity to reduce FSRU costs becoming remote. As a result of the above there is a decrease in dividend expectations. This exceptional charge is recorded under Result joint ventures and associates in the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.For more details on the exceptional items reference is made to note 4 of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.These non-cash exceptional charges have no impact on the leverage ratio and covenants level.R oyal Vopak Chief Executive Officer Dick Richelle comments:‚ÄúIn the first half of 2022  we announced Vopak‚Äôs strategic priorities and financial framework on which we acted accordingly. These priorities are:- Improve the performance of our portfolio- Grow our base in industrial and gas terminals- Accelerate towards new energies and sustainable feedstocksWe revised our assets value and booked asset impairment charges of EUR 468 million. This has no impact on the execution of our strategy  dividend policy or leverage ratio target. We are focused on executing and accelerating the energy transition by taking a proactive approach towards repurposing some of our existing assets.We improved the performance of our portfolio by reporting an EBITDA of EUR 433 million. We closed the sale of our 4 Canadian terminals emphasizing our strong focus on cash generation across the portfolio.We are advancing well in growing our base in industrial and gas. The successful completion of the Indian joint venture with Aegis  positions us as the largest storage provider for LPG and chemicals in India. On LNG  our Gate terminal is fulfilling an important role in the energy security of Northwest Europe and we were able to increase its sendout capacity by 30%. In China we expanded again our industrial terminal capacity. In total we now have a global network of 15 industrial terminals.We are making progress in accelerating towards new energies and sustainable feedstocks. Particularly in Rotterdam we announced some important milestones as our opportunities for developing hydrogen infrastructure are accelerating. This builds  among others  on our strong base of ammonia storage at several strategic locations around the world. We are investigating together with partners to develop a liquid hydrogen supply chain from Portugal to Rotterdam. Together with partners we are developing an import terminal for ammonia as a hydrogen carrier in Rotterdam. These new energy projects are an integral part of our ambitious Sustainable Roadmap.We improved our results in the first half in the volatile energy market environment and have momentum in execution towards our strategic priorities. With a growing world population and at the same time the need for decarbonization  we foresee a rising demand for our independent infrastructure solutions. We have a unique global network of strategic locations  highly competent people and long term partnerships. We will continue transforming our portfolio and position our company in leading locations towards more sustainable forms of energy and feedstocks.‚ÄùQ2 2022 key events :On 25 May 2022  Vopak announced the successful completion of the Indian partnership with Aegis. Aegis Vopak Terminals will become the largest independent storage provider company for LPG and chemicals in India.On 30 June 2022  Vopak successfully renewed its EUR 1 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility (RCF) with a syndicate of 12 international relationship banks. The new RCF is linked to our performance on three key topics from Vopak‚Äôs sustainability roadmap: our safety performance  gender diversity in senior management and the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions.In the second quarter  the Caojing industrial terminal in Shanghai (China) commissioned 65 000 cbm of new storage capacity  of which 40 800 cbm relates to ammonia storage.Other key developments:Regrettably  a tragic incident occurred at our Caojing terminal  in China on 6 July 2022. A Vopak employee fell into water and drowned. An extensive tripod investigation to determine the root cause is currently being conducted. Safety is and will remain our first and foremost priority.On 6 July 2022  Gate terminal announced that it will take 3 initiatives to further strengthen its position in the security of supply of Northwest Europe. The terminal will increase its truck loading capabilities and send-out capacity  and initiate an open season for an additional 4 BCM per annum.Vopak has signed an agreement with partners to study the feasibility of producing  liquifying and transporting green hydrogen from Portugal to the Netherlands  where it would then be stored and distributed for sale. The consortium envisions hydrogen being produced by electrolysis from renewable power in the industrial zone of the Sines port. Then the hydrogen is liquified and shipped via a liquid hydrogen carrier to the port of Rotterdam for distribution and sale. The aim is to deliver a first shipment of liquid hydrogen from Sines to Rotterdam by 2027.Vopak and Gasunie will jointly develop future open access hydrogen import terminal infrastructure through a cooperation agreement. Terminal infrastructure is essential for importing green hydrogen to reach the European Green Deal targets. As part of that agreement  Gasunie  HES International (HES) and Vopak will be working together to develop an import terminal for green ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. The terminal  which will operate on the Maasvlakte under the name ACE Terminal  will be operational from 2026.Portfolio items :In April 2022  Vopak completed the sale of its 33% shareholding in German LNG Terminal GmbH  as a result an impairment reversal of EUR 3.8 million was recorded.In May 2022  Vopak completed the earlier announced divestment of its 100% shareholding in Vopak Terminals of Canada Inc. and Vopak Terminals of Eastern Canada Inc. As a result  an exceptional gain of EUR 5.7 million was recognized.Looking ahead:Vopak aims to improve the performance of the portfolio and targets an operating cash return of at least 10% by 2025. Current expectation for FY 2022 operating cash return is around 9.5%  subject to market conditions and currency exchange. Operating cash return is defined as proportional operating cash flow over average proportional capital employed and reflects the increased importance of free cash flow and joint ventures in our portfolio.Vopak expects to deliver EBITDA (excluding exceptional items) in the range of EUR 830 million to EUR 850 million in FY 2022 factoring continued volatility in the energy market  inflation and utility prices pressure subject to market conditions and currency exchange.Given the surging energy and utility prices  and currency exchange movements we expect to manage the 2022 cost base including additional costs for new growth projects around EUR 690 million in line with EUR 645 million which as previously communicated was subject to currency exchange and utilities price movements.In 2022  growth investments are expected to be below EUR 300 million. The allocation of these investments will be through existing committed projects  new business development and pre-FID (Final Investment Decision) feasibility studies in new energies including hydrogen.For the period 2020-2022  Vopak expects to be at the higher end of the range EUR 750 million to EUR 850 million for sustaining and service improvement capex  subject to additional discretionary decisions  policy changes and regulatory requirements.As part of the strategic direction for the period 2020-2022  Vopak indicated to invest annually up to a maximum of EUR 45 million in IT capex  to complete Vopak‚Äôs digital terminal management system. We expect to complete the roll out of our Vopak Terminal System to our terminal network and joint ventures by the end of 2023.Vopak aims to generate strong cash flow and is committed to a disciplined allocation of capital by targeting a robust balance sheet. Vopak‚Äôs strategy  dividend policy and leverage ratio target are unchanged.Impact of the Russia-Ukraine war:The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a major humanitarian drama and we sympathize with the people who are now suffering from the violence of war.Vopak is monitoring the situation closely and is fully committed to adhere to relevant sanctions laws and regulations. As governments try to ensure energy security and affordability  Vopak follows applicable government regulations with regard to energy imports from Russia.The Russia-Ukraine war and the international sanction regimes make the market situation volatile and uncertain. Direct impact is assessed to be mainly in Vopak's Europoort terminal and to be limited on Vopak‚Äôs group level. There is  however  an indirect exposure through factors such as utility prices  inflation  market conditions and exchange rates which was considered during the individual asset revaluation performed in the second quarter of 2022.Impact of Covid-19 pandemic in 2022:The pandemic spread of Covid-19 remains an impactful event in several regions around the world  such as China. Our first priority in the Covid-19 response continues to be to protect the health and well-being of our people  their families and the communities in which we operate. Also in times of crisis  Vopak plays an important role within society by storing vital products with care.Financial calendar11 November 2022 Publication of 2022 third-quarter interim update15 February 2023 Publication of 2022 annual results26 April 2023 Publication of 2023 first-quarter interim update26 April 2023 Annual General Meeting2 August 2023 Publication of 2023 half year results3 November 2023 Publication of 2023 third-quarter interim updateDisclaimerAny statement  presentation or other information contained herein that relates to future events  goals or conditions is  or should be considered  a forward-looking statement.

We are very satisfied with this performance  which was achieved despite a particularly high basis of comparison in 2021 and a very unsettled macroeconomic environment. Adjusted like-for-like growth even accelerated in the second quarter  led by the structural digitalization of our market and the Group's robust and diversified client portfolio.The strong recovery of TLScontact's visa application management business also contributed to this good performance. The Group‚Äôs recent strategic acquisitions in the United States  Health Advocate and Senture  were successfully integrated and made a significant contribution to first-half revenue growth. Thus  despite the sharp decline in the contribution of Covid support contracts to first-half 2022 revenue  EBITA margin continued to improve in line with the annual target.On the strength of this encouraging first half  taking into account the uncertain economic environment and ever-present health risk  we confirm our 2022 targets of like-for-like revenue growth of more than +5%  or more than +10% excluding the impact of the Covid support contracts  and a 30-basis point increase in EBITA margin.""INTERIM FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS‚Ç¨ millions H1 2022 H1 2021 ‚Ç¨1=US$1.09 ‚Ç¨1=US$1.21 Revenue 3 946 3 431 Reported growth +15.0% Like-for-like growth +5.5% Like-for-like change excluding non-recurring items* +12.9% EBITDA before non-recurring items 792 678 % of revenue 20.1% 19.8% EBITA before non-recurring items 566 479 % of revenue 14.3% 14.0% EBIT 438 398 Net profit ‚Äì Group share 274 255 Diluted earnings per share (‚Ç¨) 4.60 4.31 Net free cash flow 325 333* Excluding the impact of the change in revenue from Covid support contractsFIRST-HALF AND SECOND-QUARTER 2022 REVENUEConsolidated revenueFirst half 2022 revenue came in at ‚Ç¨3 946 million  representing a year-on-year increase of +5.5% at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation (like-for-like) and of +15.0% as reported. Reported revenue was lifted by the +‚Ç¨159 million positive currency effect  stemming mainly from the rise in the US dollar against the euro. Changes in the scope of consolidation had a +‚Ç¨160 million positive impact  reflecting the consolidation of Health Advocate from July 1  2021 and of Senture from January 1  2022.Like-for-like growth in first-half 2022 was particularly strong given the negative impact of lower revenue from Covid support contracts (down -‚Ç¨266 million compared with first-half 2021)  which was expected. Adjusted for this non-recurring impact  like-for-like growth stood at +12.9% for the period. The very strong momentum was driven by structural digitalization of the market and by the Group‚Äôs robust and diversified client portfolio. Growth in the social media  healthcare  and travel sectors was particularly brisk. The Specialized Services activity also enjoyed sustained growth  helped by the resounding recovery of TLScontact‚Äôs visa application management business.Revenue for the second quarter of 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨1 984 million  up +15.4%  including a favorable currency effect linked mainly to the rise in the US dollar against the euro and a scope effect linked to the consolidation of Health Advocate and Senture in the Group's accounts. Growth was +4.5% on a like-for-like basis compared to second-quarter 2021. This performance  which came on the back of +6.5% like-for-like growth in first-quarter 2022  was very satisfactory given the sharp drop in the contribution of Covid support contracts. Adjusted for this non-recurring impact  like-for-like growth was +14.5% in second-quarter 2022 versus +11.1% in the first quarter  reflecting increased momentum across both of the Group's activities.Revenue by activityH1 2022 H1 2021 % change ‚Ç¨ millions Like-for-like Reported CORE SERVICES & D.I.B.S.* 3 412 3 075 +3.8% +10.9% English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP) 1 175 992 +1.2% +18.5% Ibero-LATAM 1 098 895 +17.0% +22.6% Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA) 875 977 -9.5% -10.4% India 264 211 +18.0% +24.8% SPECIALIZED SERVICES 534 356 +19.3% +50.1% TOTAL 3 946 3 431 +5.5% +15.0% Adjusted like-for-like growth** +12.9%Q2 2022 Q2 2021 % change ‚Ç¨ millions Like-for-like Reported CORE SERVICES & D.I.B.S.* 1 700 1 539 +2.2% +10.5% English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP) 576 484 +0.5% +18.9% Ibero-LATAM 573 454 +17.7% +26.2% Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA) 416 495 -15.3% -16.0% India 135 106 +18.9% +28.0% SPECIALIZED SERVICES 284 180 +22.9% +57.7% TOTAL 1 984 1 719 +4.5% +15.4% Adjusted like-for-like growth** +14.5%* Digital Integrated Business Services** Excluding the impact of the change in revenue from Covid support contractsCore Services & Digital Integrated Business Services (D.I.B.S.)Core Services & D.I.B.S. revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨3 412 million in first-half 2022  a year-on-year increase of +3.8%. Reported growth came to +10.9%  with the difference versus like-for-like growth primarily attributable to the rise against the euro in the US dollar and most other currencies including the Brazilian real  the Indian rupee  the pound sterling  the Mexican peso and the Colombian peso. In addition  reported growth includes the contribution of Senture  which has been consolidated in the Group's financial statements from January 1  2022.Second-quarter 2022 revenue rose by +2.2% like-for-like versus the prior-year period. The slower growth compared to first-quarter 2022 (+5.4%) was mainly due to the sharply lower contribution of Covid support contracts to Group revenue. Excluding the impact of Covid support contracts  the Core Services & D.I.B.S. activity delivered double-digit growth in first-half 2022  with an acceleration in the second quarter compared to the first. This solid momentum was supported by further structural digitalization of the market and the Group‚Äôs robust client portfolio spread across a wide variety of sectors. The Group performed particularly well in the social media  online entertainment and food services  healthcare and travel sectors.English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP)EWAP region revenue came to ‚Ç¨1 175 million in first-half 2022  up +1.2% like-for-like. The reported increase of +18.5% was primarily attributable to favorable currency effects ‚Äì corresponding to the rise against the euro in the US dollar and  to a lesser extent  in the Indian rupee as well as in the pound sterling‚Äì and the positive impact of consolidating Senture from January 1  2022.Second-quarter 2022 revenue was globally stable versus the first quarter  rising by +0.5% like-for-like. Growth was dampened by the sharp decline in the revenue contribution of Covid support contracts in the United Kingdom. Excluding Covid support contracts  like-for-like growth was in the double digits.After staging a recovery in the second half of 2021  the North American market continued to enjoy renewed momentum in first-half 2022  both in the domestic market and in the Philippines (offshore). In particular  revenue in the social media  online entertainment  travel and financial services sectors grew at a brisk pace.Ibero-LATAMFirst-half 2022 revenue for the Ibero-LATAM region amounted to ‚Ç¨1 098 million  a year-on-year increase of +17.0% like-for-like. The reported increase of +22.6% mainly reflected the rise in the US dollar  Brazilian real  Mexican peso and Colombian peso against the euro. Like-for-like revenue growth in the second quarter came to +17.7%.Business in the region grew at a rapid pace throughout the first half against a high basis of comparison  particularly in the social media  online entertainment  healthcare  financial services and travel sectors.Growth rates were high in all the countries of the region in the first half  led by Argentina  Peru  Dominican Republic and Guatemala (nearshore activities)  as well as in Honduras and Nicaragua  where the Group recently launched operations. Multilingual activities in Spain and Portugal  on behalf of global leaders of the digital economy  continue to expand rapidly.Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA)Revenue in the CEMEA region amounted to ‚Ç¨875 million in first-half 2022  a year-on-year decline of -9.5% like-for-like and of -10.4% as reported  with the difference corresponding to negative currency effects due to the depreciation of the Turkish lira against the euro. Revenue contracted by -15.3% in second-quarter 2022 on a like-for-like basis  due to the sharp decline in the contribution from Covid support contracts in the Netherlands  France and Germany.Excluding the impact of the Covid support contracts  first-half 2022 business growth in the region was strong  with the start-up of new contracts driving a clear acceleration in the second quarter compared with the first. Business with multinational clients  particularly in the travel  automotive  financial services and online entertainment sectors  was brisk over the period. This was particularly the case in Romania  Egypt  Poland and the German-speaking market (domestic activities excluding Covid support contracts and nearshore activities).IndiaIn first-half 2022  operations in India generated ‚Ç¨264 million in revenue  up +18.0% like-for-like from the prior-year period and by +24.8% as reported  taking into account the positive currency effect corresponding to the appreciation of the Indian rupee against the euro. Like-for-like revenue growth in the second quarter came to +18.9%.Offshore activities  which are the region‚Äôs main source of revenue and include high value-added solutions  continued to grow rapidly. They benefited from the dynamism of the Group‚Äôs client base of global leaders in the buoyant travel  consumer electronics  healthcare  internet  online entertainment and e-tailing sectors. Revenue in the automotive sector also grew rapidly during the period.Specialized ServicesRevenue from Specialized Services stood at ‚Ç¨534 million in first-half 2022  a year-on-year increase of +19.3% like-for-like and of +50.1% as reported. The difference between like-for-like and reported growth stemmed from a favorable currency effect linked to the increase in value of the US dollar against the euro and a positive scope effect due to the consolidation of Health Advocate in the consolidated financial statements since July 1  2021. Like-for-like revenue growth in second-quarter 2022 came to +22.9%.Faster revenue growth in the second quarter was mainly due to the resounding recovery in TLScontact volumes and also reflected the very favorable prior-period basis of comparison. In particular  UK visa applications managed by TLScontact in first-half 2022 exceeded pre-crisis levels. Business in the Schengen area continued to trend upwards  but remained below pre-crisis levels  primarily due to the dearth of inbound travelers from China. The recovery in revenue is expected to continue in the second half of the year  albeit at a slower pace than in the first half due to the higher basis of comparison.LanguageLine Solutions  the main contributor to Specialized Services revenue  grew at a satisfactory rate  especially in the healthcare sector which accounts for more than half of its revenue  although growth rates were dampened by a high basis of comparison  especially in the spring 2021. The basis of comparison will be lower in the second half.The rapid growth of debt collection activities in North America (AllianceOne) during the first half of the year was supported by the robust business momentum enjoyed since last year  particularly in nearshore activities.FIRST-HALF 2022 RESULTSEBITDA before non-recurring items stood at ‚Ç¨792 million for first-half 2022  up +16.7% from the prior-year period.EBITA before non-recurring items rose by +18.2% to ‚Ç¨566 million from ‚Ç¨479 million in first-half 2021  representing a margin of 14.3% versus 14.0% in the prior-year period. The improved margin was primarily attributable to the stability of margin rates in the Core Services & D.I.B.S activities  despite the negative effect of the sharply lower contribution of Covid support contracts  and higher Specialized Services margins  lifted by the resounding recovery of TLScontact‚Äôs activities. Reported margins were also boosted by the rise in the dollar against the euro with a positive transaction effect linked to the Group's offshore activities and a positive translation effect (mix).Earnings by activityEBITA before non-recurring items H1 2022 H1 2021 ‚Ç¨ millions CORE SERVICES & D.I.B.S.* 398 374 % of revenue 11.7% 12.2% English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP) 97 57 % of revenue 8.2% 5.7% Ibero-LATAM 133 113 % of revenue 12.1% 12.7% Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA) 83 138 % of revenue 9.5% 14.1% India 46 35 % of revenue 17.5% 16.7% Holding companies 39 31 SPECIALIZED SERVICES 168 105 % of revenue 31.5% 29.4% TOTAL 566 479 % of revenue 14.3% 14.0%* Digital Integrated Business ServicesCore Services & D.I.B.S.For Core Services & D.I.B.S.  EBITA before non-recurring items came to ‚Ç¨398 million in first-half 2022  versus ‚Ç¨374 million in the prior-year period. EBITA margin stood at 11.7% versus 12.2% in first-half 2021  reflecting contrasting trends by region  with some regions particularly affected by the lower contribution from Covid support contracts.English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP)The EWAP region generated EBITA before non-recurring items of ‚Ç¨97 million in first-half 2022  compared with ‚Ç¨57 million in the prior year period. EBITA margin rose sharply  to 8.2% from 5.7% in first-half 2021. The increase in margins mainly reflected the renewed momentum in the North American market observed in late 2021 and confirmed throughout the first half of 2022  in particular for offshore activities in the Philippines.Ibero-LATAMEBITA before non-recurring items in the Ibero-LATAM region rose to ‚Ç¨133 million in first-half 2022 from ‚Ç¨113 million in the prior-year period. while EBITA margin stood at 12.1%  versus 12.7% in 2021. The period-on-period decline was due to the development costs incurred for the opening and the ramp up of numerous new sites to support the rapid pace of business growth  especially in Peru and Colombia.Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA)EBITA before non-recurring items in the CEMEA region came to 83 million in first-half 2022  versus ‚Ç¨138 million in first-half 2021  yielding a margin of 9.5% versus 14.1% one year earlier. The decline in EBITA margin was mainly due to the sharp drop in the contribution from Covid support contracts in the Netherlands  France and Germany  which had a very positive impact on the region's margin in first-half 2021.IndiaEBITA before non-recurring items in the India region rose to ‚Ç¨46 million in first-half 2022 from ‚Ç¨35 million the year before. EBITA margin rose to 17.5% from 16.7% in first-half 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the very rapid growth in the highly profitable offshore activity.Specialized ServicesSpecialized Services EBITA before non-recurring items came to ‚Ç¨168 million in first-half 2022  versus ‚Ç¨105 million in the same period of 2021. EBITA margin expanded to 31.5% from 29.4% in first-half 2021.This good performance mainly reflects the return of TLScontact's operating margins to levels close to those achieved pre-Covid-19  following a strong recovery in business volumes  satisfactory growth in premium ancillary services and implementation of cost-cutting measures during the crisis. TLScontact's margins were very low in first-half 2021  because the travel restrictions and border closures imposed since March 2020 were not lifted until May 2021.LanguageLine Solutions continued to enjoy high margins in first-half 2022  reflecting satisfactory business growth backed by an efficient business model based on entirely home-based interpreters  unrivaled technological tools and a very assertive marketing process.Other income statement itemsEBIT amounted to ‚Ç¨438 million  versus ‚Ç¨398 million one year earlier. It included in particular:‚Ä¢ ‚Ç¨70 million in amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions;‚Ä¢ the ‚Ç¨51 million book cost of performance share plans.The financial result represented a net expense of ‚Ç¨52 million  versus ‚Ç¨44 million one year earlier.Income tax expense came to ‚Ç¨112 million  corresponding to an effective tax rate of 29.1%  versus 28.1% in the prior-year period.Net profit ‚Äì Group share totaled ‚Ç¨274 million  versus ‚Ç¨255 million in first-half 2021  while diluted earnings per share came to ‚Ç¨4.60  versus ‚Ç¨4.31.Cash flows and financial structureNet free cash flow after lease expenses  interest and tax paid amounted to ‚Ç¨325 million  versus ‚Ç¨333 million the year before.The change in consolidated working capital requirement was an outflow of ‚Ç¨40 million in first-half 2022  compared with an outflow of ‚Ç¨38 million in the year earlier period.Net capital expenditure amounted to ‚Ç¨150 million  or 3.8% of revenue  versus ‚Ç¨98 million and 2.9% in first-half 2021. The increase corresponds to expenditure to develop a hybrid model combining work-from-home and on-site solutions throughout the world (see Operating Highlights).After paying ‚Ç¨194 million in dividends  net debt stood at ‚Ç¨2 633 million at June 30  2022.OPERATING HIGHLIGHTSExpansion of the global footprint and deployment of work-from-home solutionsIn first-half 2022  Teleperformance continued to deploy its global expansion strategy in the structurally growing outsourced customer and citizen experience management market despite the uncertain economic context.

On top of usual seasonal movements  operating margin and free cash flow were impacted in H1 by inflation and supply chain-related headwinds. We expect a significant improvement in both metrics in the second half  supported by improvement actions launched earlier in the year  on our cost structure and contract portfolio. In consequence  we are fully confident of achieving our full-year objectives. We have successfully secured our debt financing; our envisioned transformation plan is now fully funded for the interim period before the contemplated split into two listed entities  and our liquidity is significantly strengthened.‚Äù‚Ç¨MH1 H1 VariationVariation at constant currency2022 2021 Revenue 5 563 5 424 +2.6% -0.6% Operating Margin 59 302 In % of revenue 1.1% 5.6% -450 bps -460 bps OMDA 369 633 In % of revenue 6.6% 11.7% -510 bps Normalized Net income (loss) -119 162 Net income (loss) -503 -129 Free Cash Flow -555 -369 Net debt 1 792 1 129H1 2022 performance highlightsAtos is currently benefitting from a renewed commercial momentum  with a sharp rebound in order entry in Q2  at ‚Ç¨2.8 billion compared with ‚Ç¨ 2.0 billion in Q1  and a strong sequential improvement in book-to-bill  at 101% in Q2 compared with 72% in Q1. Order entry included several high-profile contracts with existing and new customers  including a supercomputer as part of the EuroHPC program (the 6th awarded to Atos  out of 8 in total in the program). This ramp-up of commercial traction underpins the revenue growth acceleration expected in H2  and indicates strong customer support of Atos envisioned transformation plan  as more than ‚Ç¨0.6 billion of new orders were signed post announcement.Revenue was ‚Ç¨ 5 563 million in H1 2022  slightly down -0.6% at constant currency. On an organic basis  revenue decreased -2.1%  with a continued sequential improvement in Q2  at -1.9% compared to -2.4% in Q1. Tech Foundations reported a much more contained decrease than in FY21  at -2.6% at constant currency  thanks to renewed focus under the Group‚Äôs new governance. The Evidian perimeter grew +2.0% with robust trends in Digital and Cybersecurity and a temporary low level of HPC sales driven by cyclicality and supply chain challenges. Acquisitions contributed +1.6% to the Group‚Äôs revenue growth. Foreign exchange contributed +3.1%  mainly reflecting the appreciation of the American Dollar and the Pound Sterling against the Euro over the period.Operating margin was ‚Ç¨ 59 million  or 1.1% of revenue. On top of usual seasonality  it was impacted by high inflation (salaries  energy costs) and supply chain tensions  whilst the first benefits of the performance improvement actions launched in H1 are expected to unfold in H2. Operating margin was also hampered by the hiring of more than 16 000 new employees  mainly in Digital and BDS  and predominantly in offshore and nearshore countries  in anticipation of the growth expected in the second half  and in order to ensure the conditions for future success. H1 operating margin was consistent with the back-end loaded delivery embedded in the Group‚Äôs full-year objectives.Free cash flow was ‚Ç¨-555 million in H1 2022  driven by operating margin  working capital seasonality and costs related to restructuring and reorganizations planned at the beginning of the year  which are being executed swiftly.Net debt was ‚Ç¨-1 792 million at the end of June 2022. The Group‚Äôs liquidity remained strong  with ‚Ç¨3.5 billion of gross cash and ‚Ç¨2.3 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility.Financing of Atos‚Äô transformation plan successfully securedAtos announces that it has successfully secured a new debt package  which will provide the Group with the funding it needs during the interim period before a potential split into two listed companies  and significantly reinforces its liquidity.Atos has already received commitment from banks (subject to documentation) for the conversion of ‚Ç¨1.5 billion out of a total of ‚Ç¨2.4 billion of revolving credit facility commitment into an unsecured term loan with a maturity of 18 months with two 6-month extensions at the Group‚Äôs option. A ‚Ç¨900 million revolving credit facility is maintained  maturing in 2025. Atos expects to sign the final documentation in the next few days.As part of this process  the net debt/ OMDA financial covenant is reset at 3.75x and will be tested annually.The success of this financing demonstrates banking partners‚Äô strong support of the Group‚Äôs strategy and marks an important milestone in its envisioned transformation plan.The interim period is fully financed ahead of the envisioned split into two listed entities  and the Group‚Äôs liquidity is significantly strengthened.On July 13  2022  S&P Global lowered Atos‚Äô credit rating to BB. This new rating  which takes into account the envisioned transformation plan presented on June 14  still provides a favorable framework for the setup of an adequate and sustainable capital structure. It also allows Atos to continue to have access to a wide range of debt financing instruments  thus maintaining the flexibility needed to optimize its capital structure.As highlighted by S&P Global‚Äôs statement  Atos‚Äô liquidity is strong and its financial policy is supportive. In particular  S&P Global stated that Atos' planned liquidity should provide the Group with the means to deliver its transformation plan  with its now secured ‚Ç¨1.5 billion term loan and  ‚Ç¨900 million revolving credit facility  reduced commercial paper utilization  and ‚Ç¨700 million in non-core assets disposals.H2 outlookRevenue growth at constant currency is expected to turn positive in H2  underpinned by the renewed commercial momentum observed in Q2  and the Group‚Äôs success in securing the right talents in H1.Operating margin is expected to increase markedly as the benefits of performance improvement actions launched earlier in the year will materialize in H2. Such actions are focused on structure costs (including the unwinding of the Spring organization  a reduction in subcontracting  selective hirings and strengthened cost discipline)  underperforming contracts and pricing. Additionally  Atos expects an uptick in operating margin in its hardware-intensive businesses  primarily HPC  driven by volume recovery and secured components supply.Free cash flow  excluding additional costs of the transformation plan  is expected to improve significantly as a direct consequence of operating margin recovery  supported by positive seasonal working capital effects.2022 objectives confirmed and refinedAtos reiterates that its FY22 performance will be back-end loaded  and refines its full-year objectives.Revenue growth objective is unchanged  at -0.5% to +1.5% at constant currency.Operating margin is expected at the lower end of the 3% to 5% range.Free cash flow is expected at the lower end of the ‚Ç¨-150 million to ‚Ç¨200 million range excluding additional impacts of the envisioned transformation plan. Such additional impacts are estimated around ‚Ç¨-250 million  including the cost of financing  in line with information communicated at Atos Capital Markets Day in June.Progress in Atos‚Äô value-creating separation projectThe in-depth analysis of the separation project announced on June 14  2022  is progressing to plan.The launch of the consultation of the Group‚Äôs employee representative bodies is scheduled for early September  in line with the envisioned timetable.The interim period before the envisioned separation into two listed entities is now fully financed.The Company and its Board of Directors are convinced that this project is the most value-creating for all its stakeholders  considering notably the potential synergies between BDS and Digital  and prospects for improving Tech Foundation's operational performance.As announced on July 13  2022  Atos appointed a new management to ensure a successful execution of the strategic transformation project under consideration. Nourdine Bihmane is co-CEO and in charge of the Tech Foundations business  Philippe Oliva is co-CEO and in charge of the Evidian Perimeter and Diane Galbe is Senior Executive Vice President in charge of strategic projects and support functions.In addition  the Group appointed a consultative ad hoc Committee within the Board of Directors  in charge of overseeing the study and implementation of the strategic project by the management team. This committee is composed of a majority of independent directors and is chaired by Ren√© Proglio.Human resourcesTotal headcount stood at 112 180 at the end of June 2022  up +2.8% compared to 109 135 at the end of December 2021 (+2.1% organically).In H1 2022  Atos hired 16 089 new employees (gross)  of which 7 855 in Q2  mainly in Digital and BDS  and predominantly in offshore and nearshore countries  in order to support the growth expected in the second half of the year and to ensure the conditions for future success. Atos also welcomed Cloudreach‚Äôs 742 employees.Operating Margin to Operating Income(in ‚Ç¨ million) H1 2022 H1 2021 Operating margin 59 302 Staff reorganization -73 -79 Rationalization and associated costs -33 -42 Integration and acquisition costs -18 -22 Amortization of intangible assets (PPA from acquisitions) -67 -79 Equity based compensation -11 -33 Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets -91 Other items -64 -164 Operating income (loss) -298 -118Operating income was a loss of ‚Ç¨-298 million in the first half of 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨-118 million in the first half of 2021.Staff reorganization  rationalization  and integration costs amounted to ‚Ç¨-124 million in the first half of 2022 decreasing compared to ‚Ç¨-143 million in the first half of 2021. In H1 2022  Atos executed swiftly on cost optimization measures and reorganizations planned at the beginning of the year (for a total estimated annual cost of ‚Ç¨-150 million).Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets for ‚Ç¨-91 million in the first half of 2022  related to the impairment of assets associated with disposal groups classified as held for sale.Other items amounted to ‚Ç¨-64 million in the first half of 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨-164 million in the first half of 2021. They included ‚Ç¨-32 million related to the impairment of current assets related to the Russian business classified as held for sale.Operating income to Net income Group shareNet financial expense amounted to ‚Ç¨-129 million in the first half of 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨-3 million in the first half of 2021. They included mainly ‚Ç¨-109 million related to the disposal of Worldline shares in June  for net proceeds of ‚Ç¨219 million  and ‚Ç¨-13 million of net cost of financial debt.The tax charge was ‚Ç¨-77 million in the first half of 2022.As a result of the above  Net income (Group share) was a loss of ‚Ç¨-503 million for the first half of 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨-129 million in the first half of 2021.Basic EPS and diluted EPS amounted to ‚Ç¨-4.55  compared to ‚Ç¨-1.18 in the first half of 2021.The normalized net income (Group share) excluding unusual  abnormal and infrequent items (net of tax) was a loss of ‚Ç¨-119 million  compared to an income of ‚Ç¨162 million in the first half of 2021.Normalized basic EPS and normalized diluted EPS amounted to ‚Ç¨-1.07  compared to ‚Ç¨ 1.48 in the first half of 2021.Free cash flow and net debt(in ‚Ç¨ million) H1 2022 H1 2021 Operating Margin before Depreciation and Amortization (OMDA) 369 633 Capital expenditures -123 -154 Lease payments -207 -183 Change in working capital requirement -383 -394 Cash from operation (CFO) -344 -98 Tax paid -21 -46 Net cost of financial debt paid -13 -13 Reorganization  Rationalization & Integration costs -113 -147 Other changes -64 -66 Free Cash Flow (FCF) -555 -369In the first half of 2022  free cash flow was ‚Ç¨-555 million. On top of usual seasonality  whereby free cash flow is significantly lower in H1 than in H2  H1 2022 free cash flow primarily reflects the low level of OMDA recorded over the period  at ‚Ç¨369 million  compared to ‚Ç¨633 million in H1 2021.The seasonal working capital outflow was ‚Ç¨-383 million  primarily driven by a decrease in customer advanced payments.Reorganization  rationalization and integration costs amounted to ‚Ç¨-113 million and were primarily composed of staff reorganization costs.Other items below free cash flow amounted to ‚Ç¨-11 million and included mainly acquisitions net of the disposal of Worldline shares for ‚Ç¨-92 million and the impact of foreign exchange fluctuation effects for ‚Ç¨+98 million.As a result  the Group‚Äôs net debt position as of the end of June 2022 was ‚Ç¨-1 792 million compared to ‚Ç¨-1 226 million at the end of December 2021.BacklogFull backlog at the end of June 2022  amounted to ‚Ç¨22.6 billion  down ‚Ç¨1.6 billion at constant currency compared to the end of December 2021  including ‚Ç¨0.9 billion of corrections pertaining to prior periods  and representing 2.0 years of revenue. The full qualified pipeline was ‚Ç¨7.1 billion  slightly up compared to the end of December 2021 and representing 7.6 months of revenue.Condensed consolidated financial statementAtos‚Äô Board of Directors in its meeting held on July 26  2022  has reviewed the Group half-year consolidated financial statements closed at June 30  2022.

Small variances may arise once fully integrated into the Group‚Äôs reporting systems.The revenue of the Tech Foundations business  including UCC  decreased by -2.6% in H1 2022 at constant currency (-2.0% excluding UCC). This is a strong sequential improvement compared to 2021  where revenue declined -11.4% over the full year (including UCC)  evidencing the momentum that started to build up quickly within the newly formed Tech Foundations business line. The infrastructure business reported a much more contained revenue decline than last year  reaping the first benefits from renewed focus under the Group‚Äôs new organization. Professional services delivered robust growth  benefitting from high structural demand. Digital workplace services and BPO were stable due to refocusing actions and UCC contracted due to persisting supply chain tensions. The deliberate gradual wind down of the value-added resale business continued into H1 2022. Revenue in top 30 accounts increased by 2 2% reflecting the success of the playbook deployed across these accounts. Operating margin was-1.0%  in line with that of FY21.Earlier in the month  Atos was positioned by Gartner for the second time as a global leader in the 2022 Magic Quadrant for data center outsourcing and hybrid infrastructure managed services  and recognized for its completeness of vision and ability to execute.The Evidian perimeter (Digital and Big Data & Cybersecurity) grew +2.0% in H1 2022 at constant currency. Growth in Digital was driven by the contribution of recent acquisitions that enriched the Group‚Äôs offerings  particularly in multi-cloud services  as well as robust organic trends in the applications and cloud businesses  notably in Americas  although mitigated by volume reductions with a large customer  and a decrease in value-added resale. Cybersecurity continued on its above-market growth trajectory. As anticipated  Advanced Computing contracted due to a reduction in HPC sales  reflecting the deal flow cyclicality in this business  compounded by supply chain tensions.Operating margin was 3.5% in H1 2022  impacted by the shortfall in HPC revenue  as well as an increase in staff cost. FY22 operating margin is expected to be back-end loaded  and will benefit in H2 from the aforementioned performance improvement actions.Order entry in HPC was strong in H1  indicating a recovery as soon as in H2. With the award of the MareNostrum5 supercomputer contract by EuroHPC JU for the Barcelona Supercomputing Center  Atos‚Äô BullSequana X HPC range will be used in six out of the eight EuroHPC supercomputing centers.In July 2022  Atos was positioned as a Visionary in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud IT Transformation Services  2022  Worldwide  based on its completeness of vision and ability to execute.H1 2022 performance by Regional Business UnitRevenue Operating margin Operating margin % In ‚Ç¨ million H1 2022 H1 2021* Evolution at constant currency H1 2022 H1 2021* H1 2022 H1 2021* Americas 1 353 1 348 +0.4% 73 159 5.4% 11.8% Northern Europe & APAC 1 625 1 625 +0.0% 28 113 1.7% 7.0% Central Europe 1 258 1 280 -1.7% -30 24 -2.4% 1.9% Southern Europe 1 198 1 231 -2.7% 40 46 3.4% 3.7% Others & Global structures 129 111 +15.9% -52 -24 NA NA Total 5 563 5 594 -0.6% 59 317 1.1% 5.7% * At constant currencyAmericas revenue was up +0.4% at constant currency  driven by the contribution of recent acquisitions in multi-cloud services and product lifecycle management. Trends were robust in digital  in particular with the ramp up of a new contract with a major hospital chain. This was offset by a revenue decrease in Tech Foundations  driven by infrastructure and UCC services  as well as fluctuations in the advanced computing business. Operating margin was significantly lower than in H1 2021  primarily due to high personal costs inflation and a less favorable contract mix.Northern Europe & APAC‚Äôs revenue was stable at constant currency compared to H1 2021. Revenue growth turned positive in Q2  driven by a good momentum in Digital  particularly with public sector and defense customers  as well as in BDS. Tech Foundations activities were slightly down in H1 but improved sequentially between Q1 and Q2. Robust growth in digital workplace was offset by a decline in the BPO business  following the reassessment of a large contract in the UK in Q4 2021. Operating margin was lower than in H1 2021  impacted by the aforementioned BPO contract reassessment and underperforming contracts in the process of being right-sized.Central Europe‚Äôs revenue decreased by -1.7% at constant currency  impacted by the termination of an underperforming contract with a telecom operator  as part of the Group‚Äôs performance improvement actions  and low activity levels in HPC and UCC. Excluding these items  revenue was stable with a marked improvement between Q1 and Q2  driven by robust growth in Digital. The decline in Tech Foundations‚Äô activities (excluding UCC) was much more contained than last year. Operating margin was negative  as anticipated  due to salary inflation and challenging delivery of some projects.Southern Europe‚Äôs revenue decreased by -2.7% at constant currency  due to fluctuations in the HPC business  and to the continued deliberate wind down of value-added resale. Excluding these two activities  which are minor revenue contributors  the RBU turned in a modest revenue growth in H1. Momentum in Digital was robust. Tech Foundations improved  with a more decline than last year  as contract renewals and new wins provided some resilience. Operating margin remained broadly in line with H1 2021  as operational improvements compensated for the impacts of salary inflation and of two underperforming contracts.Others  which encompass Middle East  Africa  Major Events as well as two cost centers: the Group‚Äôs global delivery centers and global structures. Revenue grew +15.9% at constant currency supported by business related to the Beijing Olympics. Operating margin  structurally negative  decreased year-on-year due to under-absorption of global delivery centers‚Äô fixed costs.Revenue and operating margin at constant scope and exchange rates reconciliationIn ‚Ç¨ million H1 2022 H1 2021 % change Statutory revenue 5 563 5 424 +2.6% Exchange rates effect 170 Revenue at constant exchange rates 5 563 5 594 -0.6% Scope effect 84 Exchange rates effect on acquired/disposed perimeters 5 Revenue at constant scope and exchange rates 5 563 5 683 -2.1% Statutory operating margin 59 302 -80.4% Exchange rates effect 16 Operating margin at constant exchange rates 59 317 -81.3% Scope effect -5 Exchange rates effect on acquired/disposed perimeters 0 Operating margin at constant scope and exchange rates 59 313 -81.1% as % of revenue 1.1% 5.5%Scope effects amounted to ‚Ç¨ 89 million for revenue and ‚Ç¨ -5 million for operating margin.

Our tube business continues to operate in a highly favorable environment  particularly in North America. Our iron ore mine has reopened but is still operating below typical production levels  and this situation is now assumed to continue for the remainder of the year. Nevertheless  at this stage in the year  we are confident in quantifying our EBITDA outlook for FY 2022  with an expected performance between ‚Ç¨650 to ‚Ç¨750 million. Adjusted for the normal operation of the mine  EBITDA would have been approximately ‚Ç¨1.0 billion. Free Cash Flow in the Second Quarter remained in negative territory  reflecting temporary investments in inventories to satisfy strong business demand. It will be positive in the Second Half as working capital stabilizes at current levels.Story continuesWe continue to progress our ‚ÄòNew Vallourec‚Äô transformation plan  with the plant closure process launched in Germany and other European reorganization measures underway. Furthermore  I am delighted to welcome new leaders to the Executive Committee to complete the team which will drive the transformation of Vallourec.‚ÄùKEY DATAFirst-half 2022 First-half 2021 Change In ‚Ç¨ million Q2 2022 Q2 2021 Change 828 739 12.0% Production shipped (k tonnes) 433 381 13.6% 2 060 1 544 33.4% Revenue 1 144 842 35.9% 205 228 ‚Ç¨(23)m EBITDA 160 148 ‚Ç¨12m 10.0% 14.8% (4.8)p.p.

The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  and to a lesser extent in EA-MEA as well as the higher contribution both in Industry in EA-MEA and South America was partially offset by the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the mine operations.Sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A) at ‚Ç¨98 million or 8.6% of revenue versus 9.6% in Q2 2021.Adjusted for the regular operation of the iron ore mine and actual iron ore prices for Q2 2022  the normalized level of EBITDA would have been approximately ‚Ç¨240 million.Operating income was negative at ‚Ç¨(358) million  compared to a positive ‚Ç¨200 million in Q2 2021  resulting mainly from the provisions related to the adaptation measures (European social plans and associated fees) and  to a lesser extent  provisions for non-recurring costs related to the incident at the mine. Moreover  Q2 2021 included a positive one-off ‚Ç¨70m gain related to the Reisholz land and building sale.Financial income was negative at ‚Ç¨(8) million  compared with ‚Ç¨(93) million in Q2 2021; net interest expenses in Q2 2022 at ‚Ç¨(22) million  and reflecting the new balance sheet structure  were partially offset by ‚Äòother financial income‚Äô.Income tax was reduced to ‚Ç¨(48) million compared to ‚Ç¨(60) million in Q2 2021  reflecting lower earnings from the mine and a recovery in activity in North America.This resulted in negative net income  Group share  of ‚Ç¨(415) million  compared to a positive ‚Ç¨51 million in Q2 2021.H1 2022 consolidated results analysisIn H1 2022  EBITDA amounted to ‚Ç¨205 million  a ‚Ç¨23 million decrease year-on-year  to stand at 10.0% of revenue  reflecting:An industrial margin of ‚Ç¨383 million or 18.6% of revenue  down ‚Ç¨28 million compared with H1 2021. The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  and to a lesser extent in EA-MEA as well as the higher contribution both in Industry in EA-MEA and South America was more than offset by the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the mine operations.Sales  general and administrative costs (SG&A) of ‚Ç¨183 million  or 8.9% of revenue  versus ‚Ç¨158 million and 10.2% of revenue in H1 2021.Adjusted for the regular operation of the iron ore mine and actual iron ore prices for H1 2022  the normalized level of EBITDA would have been approximately ‚Ç¨370 million.Operating income was negative at ‚Ç¨(375) million compared with a positive ‚Ç¨227 million in H1 2021  resulting mainly from the provisions related to the adaptation measures (European social plans and associated fees) and  to a lesser extent  provisions for non-recurring costs related to the incident at the mine (H1 2021 was positively impacted by a non-recurring ‚Ç¨70m gain related to the above-mentioned real estate asset disposals).Financial income was negative at ‚Ç¨(21) million  compared with ‚Ç¨(175) million in H1 2021; net interest expenses in H1 2022 at ‚Ç¨(45) million reflecting the new balance sheet structure  were partially offset by other financial income.Income tax amounted to ‚Ç¨(51) million mainly related to Brazil and North America.As a result  net income  Group share  amounted to ‚Ç¨(450) million  compared to ‚Ç¨(42) million in H1 2021.CASH FLOW & FINANCIAL POSITIONCash flow from operating activitiesIn Q2 2022  cash flow from operating activities improved to ‚Ç¨41 million  compared to ‚Ç¨(15) million in Q2 2021; It included cash-out related to the adaptation measures of ‚Ç¨22 million  lower income tax paid  as well as lower financial expenses.H1 cash flow from operating activities was positive at ‚Ç¨61 million compared to ‚Ç¨(2) million in H1 2021. The improvement was related to lower income tax and adaptation measures cash-out  as well as reduced financial expenses.Operating working capital requirementIn Q2 2022  the operating working capital requirement increased by ‚Ç¨(187) million  versus an increase of ‚Ç¨(92) million in Q2 2021  reflecting higher forward volume expectations and raw-material price increases. The net working capital requirement stood at 117 days of sales  compared to 101 days in Q2 2021.For H1 2022  the operating working capital requirement increased by ‚Ç¨(403) million versus an increase of ‚Ç¨(139) million in H1 2021.CapexCapital expenditure was ‚Ç¨(25) million in Q2 2022  compared with ‚Ç¨(28) million in Q2 2021  and ‚Ç¨(59) million in H1 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨(56) million in H1 2021.For the full year it is expected to be slightly above ‚Ç¨200 million.Free cash flowAs a result  in Q2 2022  free cash flow was negative at ‚Ç¨(171) million versus ‚Ç¨(135) million in Q2 2021.Free cash flow for H1 2022 was negative ‚Ç¨(401) million after ‚Ç¨403 million working capital build in H1  compared with ‚Ç¨(197) million in H1 2021.For the Second Half of 2022 free cash flow is expected to be positive.Asset disposals & other itemsIn Q2 2022  asset disposals & other items amounted to ‚Ç¨(5) million compared with ‚Ç¨1 780 million in Q2 2021. This included the recognition of the financial restructuring  the cash-in from the Reisholz building and land disposal for ‚Ç¨71 million and from the Valinox Nucl√©aire SAS disposal for ‚Ç¨12 million.For H1 2022  they amounted to ‚Ç¨(30) million.Net debt and liquidityAs of June 30  2022  net debt stood at ‚Ç¨1 389 million  compared with ‚Ç¨1 213 million at March 31  2022. As of June 30  2022  gross debt amounted to ‚Ç¨1 754 million including ‚Ç¨81 million of fair value adjustment under IFRS 9 (which will be reversed over the life of the debt). Long-term debt amounted to ‚Ç¨1 379 million and short-term debt totaled ‚Ç¨375 million.Net debt at year-end 2022 is projected below the level of end-June thanks to positive free cash flow.As of June 30  2022  lease debt stood at ‚Ç¨61 million following the application of IFRS 5 standards  compared with ‚Ç¨50 million on March 31  2022.The liquidity position was strong at ‚Ç¨752 million  with cash amounting to ‚Ç¨365 million and an undrawn committed Revolving Credit Facility of ‚Ç¨387 million.UPDATE ON PAU BRANCO MINEOn January 8  2022  following exceptionally heavy rainfall in Minas Gerais State (Brazil)  some material from the waste pile associated with the operations of Vallourec‚Äôs Pau Branco mine slid into a rainwater dam (the Lisa Dam) causing it to overflow resulting in the interruption of traffic on a nearby highway. There were no casualties and the structure of the dam was not affected. As a result of this incident  however  the operations of the mine were temporarily suspended.On May 4  2022  Vallourec partially restarted operations  using an alternative waste pile. Under these conditions  volumes extracted in H1 2022 amounted to approximately 1.1 million tonnes.In the Full Year 2022  Vallourec now assumes an annual production of 2.6 million tonnes  which informs its EBITDA outlook.Meanwhile  Vallourec continues discussions with the authorities regarding the use of other alternative waste piles to continue production. The Group is also working as fast as possible on additional safeguarding measures including drainage system reinforcement and the stabilization of the soft soil layers  in order to resume normal operations using the original waste pile  subject to the validation by the state mining and environmental authorities. Those normal operations are expected not before Q2 2023 following the full release of the Cachoeirinha Pile.PROGRESS ON ‚ÄòNEW VALLOUREC‚ÄôFoundations of the New VallourecReshape industrial footprintIn May 2022  Vallourec announced the initiation of the closure process of its German tube plants and the transfer of the German rolling activity for Oil & Gas to Brazil. This process will take place over the next two years and will include the sale of land and buildings. The transfer will require approximately ‚Ç¨120 million of capex in the Brazil operations to support the transition of premium tubular volume from Europe by end 2023.The closure of the German operations implies further rationalization of other European operations involved in the finishing of tubes rolled in Germany. This rationalization will entail the consolidation of all the European threading activities in a single location in Aulnoye  France. The Group has also launched the closure processes of the heat treatment line at Saint-Saulve (France) and the threading line at Bellshill (Scotland). Elsewhere  Vallourec completed the sale of Vallourec Bearing Tubes. The Aulnoye Competence Center will lead the ‚Äòone R&D‚Äô organization.Streamline overheads to lower breakeven and increase efficiencyVallourec will simplify its organization by streamlining its structure in all regions (North America  South America and Eastern Hemisphere) and by further downsizing the headquarter functions  which will be primarily focused on strategy and expertise.The Group will also benefit from higher productivity by implementing automation for all transactional processes and consolidating support functions in larger  Shared Services Centers  to leverage the Company‚Äôs scale.Finally  support functions will be located close to production sites and the Group will focus on value-creating projects.These combined initiatives will lead to ‚Ç¨230 million of recurring EBITDA and ‚Ç¨250 million in ongoing cash up-lift. The execution is expected to be finalized at end of Q1 2024. The associated headcount reduction3 should be approximately 2 950.The implementation of these measures is subject to consultation of the competent employee representative bodies.The indicative profile for the ‚Äòone-off‚Äô cash flows of this project shows that the bulk of the cash outflows (severance and other one-off costs) are concentrated at the beginning of 2024  while the main cash inflows (sale of land  buildings  working capital and other) are expected in the early part 2023. Consequently  the restructuring is not expected to impair liquidity.Further reinforcement of Executive CommitteeFollowing the nomination in May of Ulrika Wising as Senior Vice President Energy Transition  Vallourec has made four further senior appointments to reinforce the Executive Committee tasked with executing the ‚ÄòNew Vallourec‚Äô transformation strategy.Enrico Schiappacasse as Senior Vice President Group Strategy and Development: On June 1  2022  Vallourec announced the appointment of Enrico Schiappacasse as Senior Vice President Group Strategy and Development. He took office on June 1  2022. Enrico was previously Vice President of the Oil and Gas Business Unit at Prysmian Group  world leader in the energy and telecom cable systems industry.Nathalie Joannes as General Counsel: On July 1  2022  Vallourec announced the appointment of Nathalie Joannes as General Counsel for the Group. Prior to joining Vallourec  Nathalie was Executive Vice President Legal and Compliance & General Counsel at LEO Pharma. Nathalie has successfully built international legal  risk management and compliance teams in listed and private companies worldwide. She has been a member of the New York Bar since 1987.Ludovic Oster as Chief Human Resources Officer: On July 1  2022  Vallourec announced the appointment of Ludovic Oster as Chief Human Resources Officer. Since August 2018  he has been Chief Human Resources Officer at Elior Group where he contributed to the implementation of the group's strategy  particularly through the alignment and commitment of teams  the development of human resources and organizational efficiency.Pierre d'Archemont as Senior Vice President South America: On July 8  2022  Vallourec announced the appointment of Pierre d'Archemont as Senior Vice President South America. He took up his position on July 14  2022. He occupied the position of Regional VP Brazil and Argentina in charge of the operational and financial turnaround of Visteon since 2014.New Vallourec industrial footprint in 2024Vallourec‚Äôs new industrial footprint is designed to support its value-over-volume strategy through a reduction of approximately 700 000 tonnes of unprofitable capacity in Europe and a focus on low-cost production regions with a significantly reduced carbon footprint.Following the completion of the reshaping of its industrial footprint  Vallourec industrial footprint will consist of:750 000 tonnes of competitive rolling capacity in North America which will be supported by steel production capacity of 750 000 tonnes.1 100 000 tonnes of low-cost rolling capacity in Brazil  effectively limited by steel production of 950 000 tonnes.Unchanged rolling capacity of 600 000 tonnes in the Eastern Hemisphere (China) operations.2022 OUTLOOKOil & GasIn North America  the highly favorable market conditions should continue into H2 2022  in both price and volume terms. Market very tight in terms of available supply.In EA-MEA  volumes expected to continue to recover modestly in the coming quarters; cost increases will be passed onto customers.In South America  volumes are expected to increase leading to margin improvement throughout the year.Industry & OtherIn Europe  the outlook for volumes is neutral in a softer market; price increases are expected to fully offset cost inflation.In Brazil  the outlook for volumes is neutral relative to currently elevated levels  with price increases fully offsetting cost inflation.Vallourec has partially restarted the mining operations. Assumptions for H2 2022 assume production of approximately 1.5 million tonnes  bringing the total for the year to 2.6 million tonnes. H2 2022 consensus estimates for iron ore average prices stand at approximately US$120 per tonne4.Based on these market trends and assumptions we are quantifying our EBITDA outlook for FY 2022 which is now expected in a range of ‚Ç¨650 to ‚Ç¨750 million. On a normalized basis (for full production at the iron ore mine) EBITDA would have been estimated at approximately ‚Ç¨1 billion5.OtherCapex is expected to be slightly above ‚Ç¨200 million  including approximately ‚Ç¨50 million for the preparation of the transfer of operations from Germany to Brazil.Information and Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release may include forward-looking statements.

They include changes in Group structure  the impairment of goodwill and brands and  where material  of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets  restructuring costs and disputes.‚ÄúRecurring operating income‚Äù is therefore a major indicator for the Group  defined as the difference between operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses. This intermediate line item is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can therefore be used as a way to estimate recurring performance. This indicator is presented in a manner that is consistent and stable over the long term in order to ensure the continuity and relevance of financial information.EBITDAThe Group uses EBITDA to monitor its operating performance. This financial indicator corresponds to recurring operating income plus net charges to depreciation  amortization and provisions on non-current operating assets recognized in recurring operating income.Free cash flow from operations  available cash flow from operations and available cash flowThe Group uses an intermediate line item  ‚ÄúFree cash flow from operations‚Äù  to monitor its financial performance. This financial indicator measures net operating cash flow less net operating investments (defined as acquisitions and disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets).The Group has also defined a new indicator  ‚ÄúAvailable cash flow from operations‚Äù  in order to take into account capitalized fixed lease payments (repayments of principal and interest) pursuant to IFRS 16  and thereby reflect all of its operating cash flows.‚ÄúAvailable cash flow‚Äù therefore corresponds to available cash flow from operations plus interest and dividends received  less interest paid and equivalent (excluding leases).Net debtNet debt is one of the Group‚Äôs main financial indicators  and is defined as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Consequently  the cost of net debt corresponds to all financial income and expenses associated with these items  including the impact of derivative instruments used to hedge the fair value of borrowings. Borrowings include put options granted to minority interests.Effective tax rate on recurring incomeThe effective tax rate on recurring income corresponds to the effective tax rate excluding tax effects relating to other non-recurring operating income and expenses.Attachment,positive,0.9,0.05,0.05,positive,0.67,0.27,0.07,True,English,"['VERY STRONG PERFORMANCES', 'FIRST HALF', 'Kering', 'THE', '2022', 'substantial Free cash flow', 'ongoing brand elevation strategy', 'Fran√ßois-Henri Pinault', 'Yves Saint Laurent', 'Recurring operating income', 'VERY STRONG PERFORMANCES', 'Recurring operating margin', 'first six months', 'exchange rate basis', 'strong double-digit increase', 'Group operating income', 'Operating performance', 'Net income', 'solid performances', 'FIRST HALF', 'comparable basis', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'Covid-related measures', 'second quarter', 'local customers', 'nascent rebound', 'macro uncertainty', 'great shape', 'short-term challenges', 'new opportunities', 'ambitious strategies', 'tremendous prospects', 'currency effects', 'new record', 'Financial indicators', 'Bottega Veneta', 'comparable scope', 'North America', 'Southeast Asia', 'new highs', 'perfect execution', 'high level', 'retail network', 'Western Europe', 'Other Houses', 'The Group', 'last year', 'topline momentum', 'Comparable change', 'Kering Eyewear', '2022 Group revenue', 'higher sales', 'world', 'impact', 'China', 'engagement', 'markets', 'tourism', 'period', 'advantage', 'brands', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'difference', 'commerce', 'success', 'resumption', 'growth', 'operations', 'Story', '‚Ç¨ millions', 'H1', 'Gucci', 'Corporate', 'Eliminations', 'Wholesale', 'Japan', 'lockdowns', 'orders', 'Asia-Pacific', '34']",2022-07-27,2022-07-28,finance.yahoo.com

Constant currency change is calculated by taking current year results and comparing against prior year results restated at current year rates.Q2 2022 ResultsRevenue for the second quarter of 2022 (""Q2 2022"") was ‚Ç¨2 535 million  an increase of 25.4% year-over-year  or 17.3% in constant currency. UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all had strong revenue growth  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter grew 18.7% year-over-year  or 8.8% in constant currency  to ‚Ç¨507 million  driven by revenue growth. EBITDA margin was 20.0%  compared to 21.1% in the second quarter of 2021 (""Q2 2021""). EBITDA and EBITDA margin in Q2 2021 were impacted by a net ‚Ç¨2 million of share-based compensation and expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam. Excluding these expenses  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 18.2% year-over-year  or 8.3% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.0%  compared to 21.2% in the second quarter of 2021.As disclosed in the UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). In prior years  these revenues were recognised when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters  with a benefit of ‚Ç¨98 million in revenue and ‚Ç¨17 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022.In addition  as previously disclosed  Q2 2021 benefited from a catch-up payment from a digital service provider (the ""DSP Catch-Up Payment"")  amounting to ‚Ç¨41 million in revenue and ‚Ç¨26 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Excluding the Change in Society Accounting and DSP Catch-Up Payment  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.1% in Q2 2022  compared to 20.3% in Q2 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.H1 2022 ResultsIn the half year ended June 30  2022 (""H1 2022"")  UMG's revenues of ‚Ç¨4 734 million increased by 23.6%  or 16.9% in constant currency  compared to the half year ended June 30  2021 (""H1 2021""). This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 27.4% to ‚Ç¨2 608 million in H1 2022  reflecting higher revenues and revenue mix. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to 55.1% from 53.4% driven by higher artist costs from a greater proportion of Music Publishing revenues in H1 2022 as well as the impact of the DSP Catch-Up Payment and a previously disclosed exceptional recovery of an advance provision and release of historic royalties (the ""Exceptional Recovery and Release"") in the first quarter of 2021 (with a ‚Ç¨20 million impact) that all benefited artists costs relative to revenues in the prior year period.Operating profit improved 11.8% year-over-year  or 6.7% in constant currency  to ‚Ç¨765 million in H1 2022 driven by the growth in revenues. EBITDA amounted to ‚Ç¨960 million  an increase of 16.8%  or 11.1% in constant currency  compared to H1 2021  also as a result of the growth in revenues.EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨2 million during H1 2022 and by ‚Ç¨3 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during H1 2021. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 was ‚Ç¨962 million  up 16.6% compared to H1 2021  or 11.0% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 1.2pp year-over-year to 20.3%.Revenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 benefited from the Change in Society Accounting discussed above  amounting to ‚Ç¨144 million in revenue and ‚Ç¨34 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Revenue for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment described above  while EBITDA for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment and the Exceptional Recovery and Release described above.Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2% in H1 2022  compared to 20.6% in H1 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for H1 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨241 million compared to ‚Ç¨452 million in H1 2021  resulting in EPS of ‚Ç¨0.13 in H1 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨0.25 in H1 2021. The decline in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was due to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment) and other financial investments that was an expense in H1 2022 of ‚Ç¨567 million compared to a net expense in H1 2021 of ‚Ç¨170 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments amongst other items  amounted to ‚Ç¨763 million in H1 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨578 million in H1 2021  resulting in Adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨0.42 in H1 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨0.32 in H1 2021. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in EBITDA and a decline in interest and income tax expense  both driven by a ‚Ç¨100 million benefit from two tax litigations finalized in H1 2022.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and equivalents  at the end of H1 2022 was ‚Ç¨2 283 million compared to ‚Ç¨2 010 million at December 31  2021.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved to ‚Ç¨605 million in H1 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨470 million in H1 2021  an increase of 28.7%  mainly as a result of the growth in EBITDA and favourable working capital movements. Royalty advance payments  net of recoupments grew to ‚Ç¨223 million in H1 2022 from ‚Ç¨130 million in H1 2021  due to the timing of major artist renewals partly offset by higher recoupment.Free cash flow decreased to ‚Ç¨104 million in H1 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨280 million in H1 2021  mainly as a result of the timing of catalogue acquisitions (-‚Ç¨221 million)  whilst the prior half year benefited from the disposal of Alamo Records (-‚Ç¨102 million). This was partly offset by the improvement in net cash provided by operating activities (+‚Ç¨122 million).UMG's dividend policy is to pay a dividend of 50% of adjusted net profit. UMG's Board of Directors declared an interim dividend for H1 2022 of ‚Ç¨435 million  or ‚Ç¨0.24 per share. The ex-dividend date will be on October 5  2022  the record date will be on October 6  2022 and the payment date will be on October 28  2022.Recorded MusicThree Months EndedJune 30 %%Six Months EndedJune 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.

EBITDA amounted to ‚Ç¨960 million  an increase of 16.8%  or 11.1% in constant currency  compared to H1 2021  also as a result of the growth in revenues.EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨2 million during H1 2022 and by ‚Ç¨3 million of expenses related to UMG‚Äôs listing on Euronext Amsterdam during H1 2021.

Constant currency change is calculated by taking current year results and comparing against prior year results restated at current year rates.Q2 2022 ResultsRevenue for the second quarter of 2022 (""Q2 2022"") was ‚Ç¨2 535 million  an increase of 25.4% year-over-year  or 17.3% in constant currency. UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all had strong revenue growth  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter grew 18.7% year-over-year  or 8.8% in constant currency  to ‚Ç¨507 million  driven by revenue growth. EBITDA margin was 20.0%  compared to 21.1% in the second quarter of 2021 (""Q2 2021""). EBITDA and EBITDA margin in Q2 2021 were impacted by a net ‚Ç¨2 million of share-based compensation and expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam. Excluding these expenses  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 18.2% year-over-year  or 8.3% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.0%  compared to 21.2% in the second quarter of 2021.As disclosed in the UMG Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). In prior years  these revenues were recognised when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters  with a benefit of ‚Ç¨98 million in revenue and ‚Ç¨17 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022.In addition  as previously disclosed  Q2 2021 benefited from a catch-up payment from a digital service provider (the ""DSP Catch-Up Payment"")  amounting to ‚Ç¨41 million in revenue and ‚Ç¨26 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Excluding the Change in Society Accounting and DSP Catch-Up Payment  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.1% in Q2 2022  compared to 20.3% in Q2 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.H1 2022 ResultsIn the half year ended June 30  2022 (""H1 2022"")  UMG's revenues of ‚Ç¨4 734 million increased by 23.6%  or 16.9% in constant currency  compared to the half year ended June 30  2021 (""H1 2021""). This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 27.4% to ‚Ç¨2 608 million in H1 2022  reflecting higher revenues and revenue mix. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to 55.1% from 53.4% driven by higher artist costs from a greater proportion of Music Publishing revenues in H1 2022 as well as the impact of the DSP Catch-Up Payment and a previously disclosed exceptional recovery of an advance provision and release of historic royalties (the ""Exceptional Recovery and Release"") in the first quarter of 2021 (with a ‚Ç¨20 million impact) that all benefited artists costs relative to revenues in the prior year period.Operating profit improved 11.8% year-over-year  or 6.7% in constant currency  to ‚Ç¨765 million in H1 2022 driven by the growth in revenues. EBITDA amounted to ‚Ç¨960 million  an increase of 16.8%  or 11.1% in constant currency  compared to H1 2021  also as a result of the growth in revenues.EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by share-based compensation of ‚Ç¨2 million during H1 2022 and by ‚Ç¨3 million of expenses related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam during H1 2021. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 was ‚Ç¨962 million  up 16.6% compared to H1 2021  or 11.0% in constant currency  driven by revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 1.2pp year-over-year to 20.3%.Revenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for H1 2022 benefited from the Change in Society Accounting discussed above  amounting to ‚Ç¨144 million in revenue and ‚Ç¨34 million in both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.Revenue for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment described above  while EBITDA for H1 2021 benefited from the DSP Catch-Up Payment and the Exceptional Recovery and Release described above.Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2% in H1 2022  compared to 20.6% in H1 2021.The remaining decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by revenue mix  as lower-margin merchandising revenues benefited from a strong rebound in touring  while higher-margin revenue streams continued to exhibit solid growth.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for H1 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨241 million compared to ‚Ç¨452 million in H1 2021  resulting in EPS of ‚Ç¨0.13 in H1 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨0.25 in H1 2021. The decline in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was due to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment) and other financial investments that was an expense in H1 2022 of ‚Ç¨567 million compared to a net expense in H1 2021 of ‚Ç¨170 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments amongst other items  amounted to ‚Ç¨763 million in H1 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨578 million in H1 2021  resulting in Adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨0.42 in H1 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨0.32 in H1 2021. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in EBITDA and a decline in interest and income tax expense  both driven by a ‚Ç¨100 million benefit from two tax litigations finalized in H1 2022.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and equivalents  at the end of H1 2022 was ‚Ç¨2 283 million compared to ‚Ç¨2 010 million at December 31  2021.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved to ‚Ç¨605 million in H1 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨470 million in H1 2021  an increase of 28.7%  mainly as a result of the growth in EBITDA and favourable working capital movements. Royalty advance payments  net of recoupments grew to ‚Ç¨223 million in H1 2022 from ‚Ç¨130 million in H1 2021  due to the timing of major artist renewals partly offset by higher recoupment.Free cash flow decreased to ‚Ç¨104 million in H1 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨280 million in H1 2021  mainly as a result of the timing of catalogue acquisitions (-‚Ç¨221 million)  whilst the prior half year benefited from the disposal of Alamo Records (-‚Ç¨102 million). This was partly offset by the improvement in net cash provided by operating activities (+‚Ç¨122 million).UMG's dividend policy is to pay a dividend of 50% of adjusted net profit. UMG's Board of Directors declared an interim dividend for H1 2022 of ‚Ç¨435 million  or ‚Ç¨0.24 per share. The ex-dividend date will be on October 5  2022  the record date will be on October 6  2022 and the payment date will be on October 28  2022.Recorded MusicThree Months EndedJune 30 %%Six Months EndedJune 30 %%20222021YoYconst.20222021YoYconst.

This may also apply to other shareholders who do not hold their shares either directly on the Register of Members or in the corporate sponsored nominee arrangement. Shareholders can contact their broker  financial intermediary  bank or financial institution for the election deadline that applies.Story continuesTaxation - cash dividendsWith the Company‚Äôs tax residence moved to the UK  dividends paid to shareholders on their ordinary shares will not attract Dutch dividend withholding tax. This means that holders of the former A shares receive their dividends in full as Dutch dividend withholding tax is no longer withheld on these dividends. Holders of the former B shares receive their dividends directly from the Company as these dividends will no longer be paid through the Dividend Access Mechanism.If you are uncertain as to the tax treatment of any dividends you should consult your tax advisor.Dividend Reinvestment Programmes (‚ÄúDRIP‚Äù)The following organisations operate Dividend Reinvestment Plans (‚ÄúDRIPs‚Äù) which enable Shell‚Äôs shareholders to elect to have their dividend payments used to purchase Shell shares:Equiniti Financial Services Limited (‚ÄúEFSL‚Äù)  for those holding shares (a) directly on the register as certificate holder or as CREST Member and (b) via the Shell Corporate Nominee;ABN-AMRO NV (‚ÄúABN‚Äù) for Financial Intermediaries holding shares via Euroclear Nederland;JPMorgan Chase Bank  N.A.

In this announcement ‚ÄúShell‚Äù  ‚ÄúShell Group‚Äù and ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words ‚Äúwe‚Äù  ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúour‚Äù are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‚Äò‚ÄòSubsidiaries‚Äô‚Äô  ‚ÄúShell subsidiaries‚Äù and ‚ÄúShell companies‚Äù as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as ‚Äújoint ventures‚Äù and ‚Äújoint operations‚Äù  respectively. ‚ÄúJoint ventures‚Äù and ‚Äújoint operations‚Äù are collectively referred to as ‚Äújoint arrangements‚Äù. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as ‚Äúassociates‚Äù. The term ‚ÄúShell interest‚Äù is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management‚Äôs current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management‚Äôs expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ‚Äúaim‚Äù  ‚Äúambition‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòanticipate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòbelieve‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòcould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòestimate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòexpect‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äògoals‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòintend‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòmay‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòobjectives‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòoutlook‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòplan‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòprobably‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòproject‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòrisks‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúschedule‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòseek‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòshould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòtarget‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòwill‚Äô‚Äô and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell‚Äôs products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  July 28  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell‚Äôs net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

The CloudMargin user base grew 45% from April 2021 through March 2022 and 25% more by the end of June. The majority of these users have been at large regional banks and buy-side firms.With a backdrop of rising inflation and challenging market conditions  banks are increasingly turning to CloudMargin to drive increased operating efficiency via a single collateral process across all traded products. The platform provides banks with a consolidated view of their obligations  along with an enterprise-wide view of their inventory and associated eligibility to meet collateral obligations  giving them the capability to optimise their collateral allocation and funding across the entirety of the business.CloudMargin CEO Stuart Connolly said: ""In today's volatile markets  banks are looking for centralisation of their collateral pools and a singular approach to optimisation  across asset classes. As we have increased our capabilities for the sell side and regional banks over the past few years ‚Äì in addition to our long-standing service to the buy side ‚Äì we're very pleased to be a go-to resource for banks large and small as they seek to drive financial efficiencies by breaking down the traditional bifurcated approach to collateralisation. Our new fiscal year is off to a very strong start following our best year to date  and we look forward to continuing to grow in all regions as the year progresses.""CloudMargin has also added Michelle Burridge to its sales team in Europe. Burridge  who has extensive experience in securities finance  joined from FIS  where for seven years she served as a Senior Business Analyst for its Apex securities finance arm.David White  CloudMargin Chief Commercial Officer  said: ""Michelle's hire is another key step in our strategy to broaden our expertise alongside the development and build-out of our product.""Continuation of the firm's growth is also expected as a steady stream of firms will breach Initial Margin (IM) exposure thresholds and be required to make operational and technology changes to comply with the Uncleared Margin Rules (UMR) in future years. From a recent poll the firm conducted  52% of the participants stated they were likely to be ""slow to breach"" the IM threshold but likely to do so at some point in the future (i.e.  one to two years). Another 27% indicated they expected to be ""quick to breach"" the threshold (i.e.  under a year).In addition to product enhancements  CloudMargin also recently established a connection with the triparty services from BNP Paribas Securities Services  adding to its list of 60+ custodians and triparty agents that already connect to the platform. Approximately 40% of all CloudMargin clients in scope for UMR are using the firm's triparty and custodian SWIFT services.The CloudMargin platform powers the industry  not only through the firm's direct and growing client base but through strategic partnerships the company has forged with leading industry infrastructure providers  including Acadia  Finastra and IHS Markit (now part of S&P Global).About CloudMarginHeadquartered in London  CloudMargin created the world's first cloud-based collateral management workflow tool  which has earned more than 20 industry awards and honours since 2015 for innovation and best-in-class technology. The firm's Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model helps leading sell-side and buy-side financial institutions globally ‚Äì including banks  brokerage and asset management firms  pension funds and insurance companies meet time-critical regulatory deadlines and reduce dramatically growing costs associated with collateral requirements.

All plants are operational since 2021 and benefit from the Dutch incentive scheme SDE+  which provides for a feed-in tariff for approx. 15 years. The financing of the Willem projects in the total amount of EUR 47.7 million and with a maturity date of June 30  2039  consists of a ‚ÄûFloating Rate Facility‚Äú  with the floating base rate being hedged by an interest rate swap  in the amount of EUR 24.7 million  a ‚ÄûFixed Rate Facility‚Äú in the amount of EUR 18.7 million and a ‚ÄúDebt Service Reserve Facility‚Äù in the amount of EUR 4.0 million  and was provided by Rabobank.Encavis AG will benefit from an inflow of liquid funds of EUR 33 million in total. These proceeds consist of the valuation of the Floating Rate Facility (minus transaction costs) and a distribution of EUR 9.2 million directly from the Willem projects. ‚ÄúWe are glad  that  besides the introduction of a Floating Rate Facility  we could maintain the already existing Fixed Rate Facility within the framework of the refinancing with Rabobank  whose terms and conditions  we wouldn‚Äôt have had any chance to achieve alternatively in the current interest rate environment. A great result that sets free liquidity for further investments ‚Äù Dr Christoph Husmann  CFO of Encavis AG  welcomed the borrower-friendly terms and conditions of this refinancing on holding level. With this transaction  ENCAVIS optimises again the structures and costs of existing project financings and benefits of an enhanced leverage ratio as well as streamlined project structures for the ongoing operational management of the portfolio. All three previous refinancing transactions have been completely structured  arranged and managed by Encavis AG‚Äòs own inhouse Project Finance team  established in 2019. In all transactions the Encavis Group benefitted from the ongoing low-interest environment and has captured the positive developments in the debt market particularly for photovoltaic plants.About ENCAVIS: Encavis AG (Prime Standard; ISIN: DE0006095003 / ticker symbol: ECV) is a producer of electricity from Renewable Energies listed on the MDAX of Deutsche B√∂rse AG.

These targets support Euronext‚Äôs recently announced ""Fit for 1.5¬∞‚Äù commitment to net zero through the ‚ÄúBusiness Ambition for 1.5¬∞‚Äù initiative in partnership with the United Nations Climate Change ‚ÄúRace to Zero‚Äù campaign. Euronext‚Äôs ESG commitment is a key pillar of Euronext‚Äôs ‚ÄúGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äù strategic plan announced in November 2021.Applying the SBTi methodology to Euronext‚Äôs emissions leads to the formulation of the following targets:Operational emissions contraction target By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 70% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019.Supplier engagement target By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 67% of Euronext‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.These are emissions reduction or contraction targets which cannot be achieved through the purchase of offsetting credits.Euronext set out the following measures to achieve its targets:Scope 1 emissions will be reduced through consolidation and energy efficiency upgrades in the building portfolio  energy efficiency investments  decommissioning of gas-fired boilers and decarbonisation of the vehicle fleet;Scope 2 emissions will be reduced by moving office space and data centres to renewable energy  including through the move of Euronext‚Äôs Core Data Centre to the Aruba Data Centre near Bergamo  Italy. The new Core Data Centre is powered 100% by renewable energy sources and self-produces energy through solar panels and its own hydroelectric power stations;Travel emissions will be reduced by implementing a sustainable travel programme;Euronext will engage its key suppliers directly and will deploy a new supplier onboarding platform  which will support the ‚ÄòEuronext Supplier Code of Conduct‚Äô  including provisions regarding environmental protection  human rights  diversity and inclusion;Euronext will engage its staff through Climate Workshops  organised in partnership with Climate Fresk  which aim to develop awareness and ability to act by keeping environmental impacts in mind  at both individual and company level.Acquisition of the technology businesses from Nexi‚Äôs capital markets activitiesOn 14 June 2022  Euronext announced the signing of the sale by Nexi and purchase by Euronext of the technology businesses currently powering MTS  Euronext‚Äôs leading fixed-income trading platform  and Euronext Securities Milan (the Transaction). The purchase price will be paid in cash  and amounts toc. ‚Ç¨57 million (on a debt free  cash free basis)  subject to customary closing adjustments.This Transaction is a new step in Euronext‚Äôs strategy to leverage its integrated value chain as it further enhances Euronext‚Äôs technology competencies and capabilities in trading and post trade.The Transaction will also strengthen the core operations of MTS and Euronext Securities Milan  which joined Euronext in April 2021. With this Transaction  Euronext internalises the core trading platform of MTS and its largest IT contract. It enables Euronext to become more agile and efficient by fully owning the technology powering MTS and Euronext Securities Milan.The Transaction  which will be realised through Euronext‚Äôs subsidiaries MTS and Euronext Securities Milan  is expected to close in the second half of 2022 and is subject to the customary approvals from the competent authorities and completion of the union consultation procedure.Euronext Clearing introduces VaR-based margin methodologyOn 21 June 2022  Euronext announced the introduction of a new VaR-based margin methodology for government bonds traded on the MTS cash and repo platforms and BrokerTec on MOT  EuroTLX and Hi-MTF platforms.The introduction of the new methodology falls under the next-to-come market best practice  applying state-of-the-art risk principles and parameters. It is a first major step toward the European expansion of Euronext Clearing  marking an important milestone of the Euronext ‚ÄúGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äù strategic plan.The VaR-based margin methodology for Italian  Portuguese  Spanish  and Irish government bonds has been live since 20 June 2022  as part of the continuous evolution of Euronext Clearing Risk Management systems  replacing the MVP SPAN-like margin methodology that currently applies to all other bond instruments.Corporate highlights since 30 June 2022Recent developments on Euronext ClearingEuronext Clearing has engaged in an important transformation aimed at preparing to serve all Euronext cash and derivatives markets and further develop the relationship with European and international clients as clearing members.In June 2022  Euronext Clearing introduced a VaR-based margin methodology for fixed-income instruments. Furthermore  Euronext Clearing expects to expand the adoption of VaR-based margin methodology for equity and derivatives instruments in 2023 and 2024  enabling clearing members to better manage their collateral requirements.In addition  in July 2022  Euronext Clearing reduced its investment portfolio with the aim of strengthening and preserving its available regulatory capital and aligning the investment strategy to the current level of market volatility and uncertainty.As a result  Euronext Clearing disposed of its portfolio maturing after 1st May 2023. A post-tax loss of 35 million euros on this transaction will be recorded in Q3 2022. Euronext Clearing decided to retain its short-term investment portfolio maturing through April 2023 and hold these to maturity. At the beginning of Q2 2023  Euronext Clearing will no longer have an outright portfolio.The capital impact reported on the sale of the portfolio will be more than compensated by a reduction of the regulatory capital requirement linked to the security portfolio. Therefore  the available regulatory capital surplus at Euronext Clearing is estimated to increase.As the sale of the portfolio will have no negative impact on the available capital of the Group  Euronext decided that the dividend for the fiscal year 2022 will be adjusted to neutralize any negative impact from this operation.Launch of Tech Leaders indexOn 6 July 2022  Euronext announced that it has launched the Euronext¬Æ Tech Leaders Index  following the kick-off of the Euronext Tech Leaders initiative in June 2022. The index will track the performance of more than 100 Tech companies that are part of the Euronext Tech Leaders Segment listed on one of the seven Euronext marketplaces.AgendaA conference call and a webcast will be held on 29 July 2022  at 09.00am CEST (Paris time) / 08.00am BST (London time):Conference call:To connect to the conference call  please dial:UK Number: +44 33 0551 0200 NO Number: +47 2 156 3318 FR Number: +33 1 70 37 71 66 PT Number: +351 3 0880 2081 NL Number: +31 20 708 5073 IR Number: +353 1 436 0959 US Number: +1 212 999 6659 IT Number: +39 06 8336 0400 BE Number: +32 2 789 8603 DE Number: +49 30 3001 90612Password: EuronextLive webcast:For the live audio webcast go to: Euronext Results webcastThe webcast will be available for replay after the call will be available at the webcast link and on the Euronext Investor Relations webpage.CONTACT ANALYSTS & INVESTORS ‚Äì ir@euronext.com Aur√©lie Cohen +33 1 70 48 24 27 ir@euronext.com Cl√©ment Kubiak +33 1 70 48 26 33 ir@euronext.comCONTACTS MEDIA ‚Äì mediateam@euronext.com Aur√©lie Cohen (Europe) +33 1 70 48 24 45 parispressoffice@euronext.com Marianne Aalders (Amsterdam) +31 20 721 41 33 maalders@euronext.com Pascal Brabant (Brussels) +32 2 620 15 50 pbrabant@euronext.com Sandra Machado (Lisbon) +351 210 600 614 smachado@euronext.com Andrea Monzani (Europe/Milan/Rome) +39 02 72 42 62 13 Italypressoffice@euronext.com Cathrine Lorvik Segerlund (Oslo) +47 41 69 59 10 clsegerlund@euronext.com Sarah Mound (Paris/Dublin) +33 1 70 48 24 45 parispressoffice@euronext.comAbout EuronextEuronext is the leading pan-European market infrastructure  connecting European economies to global capital markets  to accelerate innovation and sustainable growth.

The statutory auditors conducted an interim review of these half-year financial statements.Record H1 results‚Ç¨m - IFRS H1 2021 H1 2022 Change Revenue 50.8 63.3 +25 % Gross margin 27.8 33.5 +21 % % of revenue 54.7 % 52.9 %Operating expenses 25.9 29.3 +13 % EBITDA1 9.4 10.8 +15 % % of revenue 18.4 % 17.0 %Current operating income 1.9 4.1 +117 % Operating income/(loss) 1.8 4.2 +129 % Consolidated net income/(loss) 1.6 5.2 +225 % % of revenue 3.2 % 8.2 %1EBITDA (Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) corresponds to current operating income restated for (i) amortization  depreciation and provisions  and (ii) income and expenses relating to share-based payments.Record half-year revenue with 25% growthAt the end of the first half of 2022  Ekinops' consolidated revenue stood at ‚Ç¨63.3 million versus ‚Ç¨50.8 million in the previous year  representing robust growth of 25%. At constant scope and exchange rates  half-year growth was 20%.This trend is the result of solid momentum in all the Group's activities: +31% for optical transport equipment  +21% for Access solutions and +47% for software and services  which now represent 15% of the group's revenue as a result of the success of SDN (Software Defined Networks) and virtualization solutions.In geographic terms  half-year sales grew significantly by 48% in North America (33% in USD)  reaching 20% of the group's business for the first time. Asia-Pacific continued on the growth trajectory that began in H2 2021 with a very sustained 80% increase in half-year sales. Sales in EMEA  in which 38% of the group's activity is generated  grew 6% compared with the same period in the previous year. After a first quarter in which activity in France remained virtually stable  the group's sales returned to steady growth of 29% in the semester.Story continuesGross margin of 52.9%  within the target range  despite the components crisisAs a result of the very strong sales momentum over the semester and the increase in the share of software and services in the business mix  gross margin for the period was ‚Ç¨33.5 million  up 21% from the same period a year earlier.Gross margin thus represented 52.9% of consolidated revenue in H1 2022. This figure is in line with the group's targets and is within the long-term target range (52%-56%)  despite the components crisis  which is continuing in 2022.EBITDA margin of 17.0% in H1 2022  towards the top of the target rangeAs of June 30  2022  H1 EBITDA was ‚Ç¨10.8 million versus ‚Ç¨9.4 million in H1 2021  with a contained increase in operating expenses (13%). At the same time  the Group made the investments needed to support its growth and development (24 net new hires in the period  and equipment purchases  mainly for R&D purposes).The EBITDA margin stood at 17.0% in H1 2022  at the high end of FY 2022 target range (14%-18%)  versus 16.9% for FY 2021.After net depreciation  amortization and provisions (‚Ç¨5.3 million  of which ‚Ç¨3.0 million in amortization related to technologies and purchase price allocation) and non-cash expenses relating to share-based payments (‚Ç¨0.9 million) and the associated employer contributions (‚Ç¨0.4 million)  current operating income (EBIT) amounted to ‚Ç¨4.1 million in H1 2022  representing significant growth of 117% from the previous year. The current operating margin was 6.5% of revenue  versus 3.7% in H1 2021. Excluding amortization related to the intangible assets identified post purchase price allocation  pro forma EBIT was 11.2%.In the absence of other material operating income and expenses in H1 2022  operating income came to ‚Ç¨4.2 million versus ‚Ç¨1.8 million a year earlier  representing growth of 129%.Record net margin of 8.2% in H1 2022After accounting for ‚Ç¨0.9 million in financial income from foreign exchange gains and the recognition of a positive tax result of ‚Ç¨0.2 million  net income for the period leapt by +225% to ‚Ç¨5.2 million  higher than that achieved in FY 2021 (‚Ç¨4.8 million).The net margin for H1 2022 was 8.2%  a record level  versus 3.2% a year earlier and 4.6% for the whole of the FY 2021.Net cash of ‚Ç¨19.3 million at June 30  2022In H1 2022  Ekinops generated cash flow of ‚Ç¨10.7 million versus ‚Ç¨9.2 million in H1 2021  a 17% increase.With working capital increased by ‚Ç¨8.3 million  versus a change in working capital of ‚Ç¨4.3 million a year earlier  as a result of very buoyant levels of activity  operating cash flow was ‚Ç¨2.2 million versus ‚Ç¨4.6 million in H1 2021.Cash flow from investing activities amounted to a ‚Ç¨2.8 million outflow (versus ‚Ç¨2.1 million a year earlier)  with CAPEX of ‚Ç¨2.7 million  comprising ‚Ç¨1.6 million of capitalized R&D expenditure and ‚Ç¨1.1 million of expenditure on fixed assets.Cash flow from financing activities was -‚Ç¨3.6 million  including -‚Ç¨3.1 of repayments under bank loans. No new loans were taken out during the semester.As of June 30  2022  cash and cash equivalents stood at ‚Ç¨41.4 million  for financial borrowings of ‚Ç¨22.1 million. Ekinops' financial situation was particularly solid at the end of the period  with net cash of ‚Ç¨19.3 million and shareholders' equity of more than ‚Ç¨100 million.ASSETS - ‚Ç¨mIFRS 12/31 2021 6/30 2022EQUITY & LIABILITIES - ‚Ç¨mIFRS 12/31 2021 6/30 2022 Non-current assets 75.3 75.4Shareholders' equity 98.8 105.8 o/w goodwill 29.4 29.6Financial liabilities 23.8 22.1 o/w intangible assets 23.2 21.6o/w bank loans 18.4 16.5 o/w right-of-use assets 4.6 3.9o/w factoring 4.5 5.0 Current assets 49.7 60.0French research tax credit pre-financing 4.8 3.9 o/w inventories 19.0 17.8Trade payables 16.2 18.0 o/w trade receivables 24.2 34.0Lease liabilities 4.7 4.0 Cash & cash equivalents 45.4 41.4Other liabilities 22.0 23.0 TOTAL 170.3 176.8TOTAL 170.3 176.8Annual revenue guidance increased for 20222021 was a very dynamic year for the group and the results in H1 2022 reflect an acceleration in growth and continued high profitability  illustrating Ekinops' outperformance of its markets and its main competitors.Beyond these very good results  which illustrate Ekinops' ability to capture investments from operators  as well as the relevance of its solutions for their needs in a more difficult economic environment  H1 2022 was marked by the strong traction generated by all the group's business lines  achieving very strong shipping and delivery levels despite the components crisis.The Company nevertheless continues to pay close attention to this unprecedented crisis  which is likely to remain a key issue in the coming quarters. It has not  however  had any major impact on the group's activity thanks to its effective management of its supply chain and has demonstrated its agility in sourcing and managing its inventories since the start of the crisis.As of June 30  2022  Ekinops raises its organic growth guidance and reiterates its gross margin and EBITDA targets for 2022 fiscal year:organic growth over +15%   versus more than 12% initially targeted;gross margin of between 52% and 56%  in line with the long-term goal and factoring in the impact of the supply chain crisis on electronic components;EBITDA margin between 14% and 18%  integrating human and technological investments to execute the new growth plan.Given its sound financial position  Ekinops continues to very actively pursue external growth and explore all acquisition opportunities that could create value for the company.EKINOPS ContactsDidier Br√©dyChairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frEkinops Logo (PRNewsfoto/Ekinops)CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ekinops-delivers-ebitda-margin-at-17-0-and-25-revenue-growth-in-h1-2022--301595462.htmlSOURCE Ekinops,neutral,0.04,0.93,0.02,positive,0.56,0.36,0.08,True,English,"['EBITDA margin', '25% revenue growth', 'Ekinops', 'H1', 'capitalized R&D expenditure', 'other material operating income', 'R&D purposes', 'purchase price allocation', 'optical transport equipment', 'foreign exchange gains', 'Current operating income', 'half-year financial statements', 'long-term target range', 'current operating margin', 'Software Defined Networks', 'Consolidated net income', 'positive tax result', 'Record net margin', 'strong sales momentum', 'Record H1 results', 'operating cash flow', 'H1 2022 financial statements', 'Record half-year revenue', 'FY 2022 target range', ""Ekinops' consolidated revenue"", 'financial income', 'H1 2022 Change Revenue', 'record level', 'exchange rates', 'solid momentum', 'equipment purchases', 'Net cash', 'Operating expenses', 'Gross margin', 'EBITDA margin', 'half-year sales', 'half-year growth', 'leading supplier', 'telecommunications solutions', 'telecom operators', 'statutory auditors', 'interim review', 'share-based payments', 'first half', 'previous year', 'constant scope', 'Access solutions', 'virtualization solutions', 'geographic terms', 'North America', 'first time', 'first quarter', 'components crisis', 'same time', 'employer contributions', 'intangible assets', 'working capital', 'buoyant levels', '‚Ç¨2.8 million outflow', 'fixed assets', 'cash expenses', 'net depreciation', 'robust growth', 'growth trajectory', 'steady growth', 'significant growth', 'Euronext Paris', 'business mix', 'high end', 'investing activities', 'H1 EBITDA', 'same period', 'sustained 80% increase', '2022 revenue', '25% growth', '17% increase', 'guidance', 'July', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', 'June', 'Board', 'Directors', 'IFRS', 'EBITDA1', '1EBITDA', 'Earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'amortization', 'provisions', 'trend', 'Group', 'services', 'success', 'SDN', 'USD', 'Asia-Pacific', 'H2', 'EMEA', 'activity', 'France', 'semester', 'Story', 'figure', 'line', 'targets', 'top', 'investments', 'development', 'technologies', 'forma', 'absence', 'recognition', 'CAPEX', 'financin', '16.', '8.']",2022-07-28,2022-07-28,finance.yahoo.com

(NYSE: ""CLB US"" and Euronext Amsterdam: ""CLB NA"") (""Core""  ""Core Lab""  or the ""Company"") reported second quarter 2022 revenue of...","SECOND QUARTER REVENUE OF $120.9 MILLION; UP 5% SEQUENTIALLY; UP 2% YEAR-OVER-YEARSECOND QUARTER SEQUENTIAL INCREMENTAL MARGINS  EX-ITEMS  43%  DRIVEN BY RESERVOIR DESCRIPTIONSECOND QUARTER GAAP EPS OF $0.15; EPS  EX-ITEMS  $0.12RENEWS AND EXTENDS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THROUGH 2026ANNOUNCES Q3 2022 QUARTERLY DIVIDENDAMSTERDAM  July 27  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE: ""CLB US"" and Euronext Amsterdam: ""CLB NA"") (""Core""  ""Core Lab""  or the ""Company"") reported second quarter 2022 revenue of $120 900 000. Sequential revenue growth was adversely impacted by approximately $2 000 000  due to the devaluation of the Euro and British Pound  as well as a decrease in revenue from operations based in Russia. Core's operating income was $11 700 000  with earnings per diluted share (""EPS"") of $0.15  all in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Operating income  ex-items  a non-GAAP financial measure  was $9 600 000  yielding operating margins of 8%  sequential incremental margins of 43%  and EPS  ex-items  of $0.12. An adjustment to reverse previously recognized stock compensation expense was recorded during the second quarter of 2022 for certain performance share awards which are no longer expected to vest. A full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures is included in the attached financial tables.Core's CEO  Larry Bruno stated  ""First  our thoughts remain with our Ukrainian employees and their families during the on-going conflict. Turning to Core's results during the second quarter of 2022  we achieved sequential improvement in revenue  operating income  operating margins and EPS; these financial improvements occurred despite somewhat greater than expected business disruptions associated with the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Aside from the areas affected by this conflict  Core sees improving momentum in both onshore and offshore client activity across our global operations.""Story continuesRussia-Ukraine ConflictThe on-going geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine  along with the associated European and U.S. sanctions  presents some measure of uncertainty for Core's business and financial performance. Over the course of the second quarter of 2022  the military conflict continued and European sanctions against Russian crude oil imports were expanded.As part of Core's Reservoir Description laboratory network  the Company provides analytical services on crude oil  natural gas and derived products  including both reservoir condition analysis and ambient condition assay work. Disruptions in assay work in parts of Europe  Russia and Ukraine have persisted with the continuing conflict  while traditional supply lines of crude oil and derived products are realigning to new logistical patterns. Given that current global demand for these liquid hydrocarbons remain near pre-conflict levels  Core Lab expects supply patterns to continue realigning  and demand for the Company's associated laboratory services to trend back toward pre-conflict levels.Liquidity  Free Cash Flow and DividendOn 9 June 2022  Core Lab announced a $60 000 000 At-The-Market (""ATM"") equity offering program. As of 27 July 2022  the Company had not sold any shares under the ATM program.On 25 July 2022  the Company entered into an agreement to renew and extend its revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility""). The Credit Facility was extended through 25 July 2026 with an aggregate borrowing commitment of $135 000 000  and includes a $50 000 000 accordion option. Additionally  the terms of the Credit Facility provide an increase to the maximum permitted leverage ratio to be equal to (a) 2.75:1.00 through the fiscal quarter ending 30 September 2022; and (b) 2.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending 31 December 2022. For additional information regarding the Credit Facility  see the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company on 26 July 2022.Core Lab initially began to refocus the use of free cash towards reducing long-term debt in the first quarter of 2020. The Company maintains this focused effort and continues to apply free cash primarily towards reducing long-term debt. Long-term debt has been reduced from $295 900 000 as of 31 December 2019 to $171 900 000 as of 30 June 2022  or a cumulative debt reduction of $124 000 000 over the last 30 months. Core will continue applying free cash towards reducing debt until the Company reaches its target leverage ratio (calculated as total net debt divided by trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA) of 1.5 times or lower. The following graph summarizes the progress towards reducing the leverage ratio during 2021 and the impact both the Russia-Ukraine conflict and significantly higher COVID-19 cases have had on the Company's leverage ratio during the first half of 2022.Core continues to focus on maximizing free cash flow (""FCF"")  a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. For the second quarter of 2022  cash from operations was $600 000 and capital expenditures were $3 200 000  yielding FCF of $(2 600 000). Cash from operations declined sequentially in the second quarter of 2022  primarily due to three factors:The Russia-Ukraine conflict negatively impacted the level of sales and revenue as the Company exited the first quarter and began the second quarter of 2022. Consequently  cash collections on accounts receivable were lower during the second quarter of 2022. Additional cash was also used to fund working capital requirements  as product sales continue to increase  supply chains remain challenged  and inflationary factors are resulting in higher levels of inventory. Cost reduction plans and associated severance obligations accrued in the first quarter of 2022 have been partially executed in the second quarter of 2022. Additionally  unfunded liabilities associated with certain employee retirement plans were paid from operating cash flow.Core expects the growth in working capital associated with higher levels of inventory to moderate  cash from operations to strengthen and the Company to generate positive free cash in future quarters. Core's free cash will continue to be returned to its shareholders via the Company's regular quarterly dividend as well as being focused towards reducing long-term debt.On 27 April 2022  Core's Board of Supervisory Directors (""Board"") announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock  which was paid on 31 May 2022 to shareholders of record on 9 May 2022. Dutch withholding tax was deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.On 27 July 2022  the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock payable in the third quarter of 2022. The third quarter dividend will be payable on 29 August 2022  to shareholders of record on 8 August 2022. Dutch withholding tax will be deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.Reservoir DescriptionReservoir Description operations are closely correlated with trends in international and offshore activity levels  with approximately 80% of revenue sourced from outside the United States. Reservoir Description revenue in the second quarter of 2022 was $75 800 000  up 1% sequentially and down 3% year-over-year. While underlying activity has improved in multiple international regions  there are two primary factors impeding the overall revenue growth: 1) the conflict between Russia and Ukraine  and 2) devaluation of the Euro and British Pound. Revenue from operations in Russia in the second quarter of 2022 decreased approximately $800 000 sequentially  and $2 300 000 year-over-year; the revenue decline was $3 200 000 for the first half of 2022 when compared to 2021. Additionally  the sharp devaluation of both the Euro and British Pound during 2022 lowered revenue billed in these currencies when translated into U.S. dollars by $2 900 000 for the second quarter of 2022 and $4 800 000 for the first half of 2022  when compared to 2021. Operating income for the second quarter of 2022 on a GAAP basis was $5 900 000  while operating income  ex-items  was $5 000 000  yielding operating margins of 7% and sequential incremental margins of 102%.Core Lab's eighty-plus years of expertise evaluating both subsurface geology and fluid flow through natural  porous media are providing Reservoir Description with opportunities in emerging energy transition initiatives. In addition to Core's multi-faceted engagement in Carbon Capture and Sequestration (""CCS"") projects  described over the past several quarters  the Company has also been engaged to evaluate subsurface cores tied to lithium extraction opportunities. Lithium is a valuable commodity  essential to the creation of high efficiency batteries. During the second quarter of 2022  Core Lab  under the direction of 3PL Operating Inc.  commenced work on a multi-well core project from Railroad Valley  Nevada. 3PL Operating Inc. has targeted a Pliocene continental evaporite sequence with extensive metalliferous deposits that include: sodium  phosphorous  tungsten  boron  lithium  and other metals  potentially making the Railroad Valley deposit one of the most promising in the world of this type. Multiple cored intervals from the 3PL Operating  Inc. Li 10-28 and Li 11-18 wells were recovered from the subsurface and stabilized at the wellsite with Core Lab's proprietary CoreSta‚Ñ¢ technology. CoreSta‚Ñ¢ is a superior preservation technology specifically invented for friable and unconsolidated formations. Upon arrival at the laboratory  these cores were immediately scanned using Core Lab's proprietary Non-Invasive Testing and Reservoir Optimization (""NITROSM"") technologies. Among these  Dual Energy Computed Tomography (""DECT"") quickly provided experts at 3PL Operating  Inc. with lithologic information and a wide range of geological and petrophysical parameters  as well as high resolution (millimeter-scale) 3D digital images of the recovered cores. The cores are now progressing through the laboratory analytical program. Geological insights and petrophysical parameters obtained from this analytical program will provide a robust dataset of physical measurements that 3PL Operating  Inc. will use for both economic assessment of the strata and to establish optimized development strategies. All of the analytical data for this important project are being hosted in Core Lab's secure RAPID‚Ñ¢ database  which 3PL Operating  Inc. will use as a shared digital workspace.Also in the second quarter of 2022  a client company in Latin America employed Core Lab's proprietary technologies to improve the utility of heavy and extra-heavy crudes from an onshore field by blending them with lighter crude oils. Laboratory fluid testing  including assessment of the potential for the precipitation of organic solids  is required to verify the viability of the resultant blends. Responding to this need  Core Lab developed and executed a testing protocol using its proprietary imaging system for magnified viewing of fluids and fluid interactions at high temperatures and pressures. This technology uses two methods to evaluate and measure asphaltene flocculation: 1) a high-resolution trinocular microscope for pressurized fluid imaging (""PFI"")  and 2) a near infrared (""NIR"") spectrophotometer. Combined  these technologies determine the size and shape of flocculated particles at various temperatures and pressures. Successful development and deployment of these technologies  coupled with the growing market for heavy oil blends  has led to the commissioning of similar studies for additional clients in South America in the second half of 2022.Production EnhancementProduction Enhancement operations  which are focused on complex completions in unconventional  tight-oil reservoirs in the U.S.  as well as conventional offshore projects across the globe  posted second quarter 2022 revenue of $45 100 000  up 11%  both sequentially and year-over-year. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $4 900 000  while operating income  ex-items  was $3 900 000  yielding operating margins of 9% and sequential incremental margins of 18%. In the quarter  Core's proprietary product sales experienced growth and market penetration in both U.S. and international markets.During the second quarter of 2022  working with a client in the North Sea  Core Lab successfully launched its innovative energetic perforating system  Helios‚Ñ¢  aimed at improving the efficiency of plug-and-abandonment (""P&A"") programs. Helios‚Ñ¢ is a technology that creates a high-density perforation matrix  providing improved access to the cement between the outermost casing and the geologic formation. The optimized perforation matrix allows for greater circulation and more efficient removal of debris in the annular space during the perf and wash process. The operator first perforated the casing with the Helios‚Ñ¢ technology  and then  utilizing a specialized jet wash tool  circulated fluid between the perforated casing and the formation to create a clean annulus. Cement plugs were subsequently set to secure the well for abandonment. Core's Helios‚Ñ¢ technology provided the opportunity to significantly reduce P&A expenses by decreasing rig time  saving the operator up to $4 000 000 per abandoned well versus conventional section milling. Helios‚Ñ¢ provides Core's clients with an effective and efficient solution when executing multimillion-dollar P&A programs and demonstrates how Core's Production Enhancement engineers are able to adapt downhole technological advances to evolving industry needs.Also during the second quarter of 2022  Core's SpectraStim‚Ñ¢  SpectraScan‚Ñ¢  and PackScan¬Æ downhole imaging technologies were utilized in a client's deepwater Gulf of Mexico well to assess a frac pack completion. A successful frac pack requires an effective annular pack; this includes uniform proppant placement across the annulus between the casing and the sand control screen  along with ample proppant reserve above the top of the screen  to accommodate in-filling of any initial voids in the pack. When a successful frac pack is placed  the well is protected from the influx of formation fines that can cut the screen  damage surface facilities  and fill the wellbore with produced solids  all of which can restrict production and potentially compromise the completion. Based upon traditional volumetric measurements during the frac pack treatment  the frac pack was initially interpreted to have been successfully placed. However  when Core's Production Enhancement engineers analyzed the diagnostic data from its SpectraScan‚Ñ¢ and PackScan¬Æ logging tools  the results revealed a major void in the annular pack  as well as inadequate proppant reserve to cover the top of the screen and/or fill the annular void. Core's team recommended a top-off proppant pumping procedure to ensure complete screen coverage. A relog using Core's PackScan¬Æ showed the top-off procedure was successfully completed  avoiding a multimillion-dollar remedial completion intervention.Return On Invested CapitalThe Board and the Company's Executive Management continue to focus on strategies that maximize return on invested capital (""ROIC"") and FCF  factors that have high correlation to total shareholder return. Core's commitment to an asset-light business model and disciplined capital stewardship promotes capital efficiency and are designed to produce more predictable and superior long-term ROIC.The Board has established an internal performance metric of demonstrating superior ROIC performance relative to the oilfield service companies listed as Core's Comp Group by Bloomberg  as the Company continues to believe superior ROIC will result in higher total return to shareholders. Bloomberg's calculations using the latest comparable data available indicate Core Lab's ROIC of 3.8%.Industry and Core Lab Outlook and GuidanceAs we look ahead to the second half of 2022 and into 2023  Core anticipates the crude-oil commodity price will remain elevated  but to be moderately volatile as crude-oil supply and demand may be impacted by uncertainties related to slowing global economic growth. Crude oil supply is projected to tighten as production growth faces limitations due to prolonged underinvestment in many regions around the globe. These crude-oil market fundamentals are reflected in the year-over-year increase in international onshore and offshore rig counts  with oilfield drilling programs being executed and capital spending plans expanding for 2022  2023 and beyond. Core sees these as leading indicators of a growing international multi-year cycle.With Core Lab having more than 70% of its revenue exposed to international activity  both business segments remain active on international projects. The Company will have revenue opportunities when wells are completed  stimulated  and once reservoir rock or fluid samples have been collected. Core continues to see modest improvement in client activity across many international regions including the South Atlantic Margin  Latin America  and the Middle East. However  Core Lab's Russia  Ukraine and Western Europe laboratory networks present some uncertainty  as the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict continues and sanctions on Russia have expanded.Core expects Reservoir Description revenue to improve by low-to-mid single digits in the third quarter of 2022. Year-to-date the international rig count has been flat. When the international rig count sustains improvement and Core's clients drill and sample their reservoirs  Core's Reservoir Description segment is expected to outperform the changes in industry activity levels.Core's Production Enhancement segment is more exposed to U.S. onshore activity and typically correlates to well stimulation and completion programs. The third quarter 2022 U.S. rig count is projected to increase sequentially  however  the rate of growth for completions may potentially be limited by the availability of third party frac equipment and crews. Consequently  Core's Production Enhancement segment revenue is projected to increase sequentially by mid-to-high single digits.For the third quarter of 2022  Core projects continued improvement in U.S. activity and moderate improvement in international  offshore and deepwater markets. The realignment of crude-oil supply lines is projected to continue into the third quarter of 2022  having a sequential positive impact on Reservoir Description's assay laboratory testing in the affected regions. Core projects third quarter 2022 revenue to range from $123 000 000 to $129 000 000 and operating income of $10 100 000 to $13 300 000  yielding operating margins of approximately 9%. EPS for the third quarter of 2022 is expected to be $0.13 to $0.18.The Company's third quarter 2022 guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. Third quarter 2022 guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%.Earnings Call ScheduledThe Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss Core's second quarter 2022 earnings announcement.

The Board of Directors of Technicolor S.A.  meeting today  approved the Group's first half 2022 accounts and guidance.G ood set of results with strong performance across all divisions extending the positive momentum from the first quarter   and leading to improved f inancial performance of the Group compared to the first half 2021 : R evenues of ‚Ç¨ 1 601 million  up 18.4% (+8.8% at constant exchange rate); Adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨ 134 million   up ‚Ç¨ 40 million (+‚Ç¨29 million at constant exchange rate)  with margin improving by 139 basis points to 8.4% of revenues; Free Cash Flow before f inancial and t ax es of ‚Ç¨( 35 ) million   up ‚Ç¨ 1 80 million (+‚Ç¨178 million at constant exchange rate) with positive FCF of ‚Ç¨90 million generated over the second quarter of 2022;Technicolor confirms its 2022 guidance 1 ;Completion in May 2022 of the sale of the Trademark Licensing operations for an approximately ‚Ç¨100 million cash consideration;The 65% partial spin-off of Technicolor Creative Studios is on track to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.Richard Moat  Chief Executive Officer of Technicolor  said:‚ÄúTechnicolor‚Äôs divisions continued to perform well despite facing ongoing industry-related headwinds  which reflects the strength and leadership position of our businesses. The Group‚Äôs performance improved significantly in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021  driven by overall strong demand across almost all divisions. In addition  our businesses continue to benefit from an improved cost base and from operational efficiencies  enabling them to navigate ongoing supply chain constraints  as well as restricted advertising spending. With robust demand across most of our businesses  I am pleased to confirm this year‚Äôs guidance.In parallel  we have made significant progress in the partial spin-off of Technicolor Creative Studios along with the full refinancing of our existing debt  thanks to the overwhelming support we have had from all our stakeholders. We are well on track to create two leading independent companies  Technicolor Creative Studios and Vantiva  with solid foundations for long term growth.Story continuesI want to thank our teams for doing an outstanding job in handling our day-to-day operations  and supporting us in leading Technicolor into a new chapter of value creation.‚ÄùI- H1 2022 key highlights and 2022 OutlookFirst Half In ‚Ç¨ million  continuing operations2 2022 2021 Actual Change Change at constant rate Revenues 1 601 1 352 18.4% 8.8% Adjusted EBITDA 134 94 43.1% 30.7% As a % of revenues 8.4% 6.9% 145 bps 139 bps Adjusted EBITA 48 10 na na Free Cash Flow before financial and taxes (35) (215) +83.5% +82.9%The first half of 2022 registered a good set of results driven by strong demand for Technicolor Creative Studios and Connected Home products  despite a trading environment marked by persistent fulfillment difficulties.First half 2022 revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨1 601 million  up 18.4% (up 8.8% at constant exchange rate  up 11.2% at constant exchange rate and perimeter). This good performance was notably driven by a high level of demand for Technicolor Creative Studios and Connected Home products and services  despite continued supply constraints and decelerating advertising spending growth in Q2 2022 compared with a high comparative base in H1 2021.First half 2022 Adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨134 million improved by ‚Ç¨40 million (up ‚Ç¨29 million at constant exchange rate). Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 145 basis points (+139 basis points at constant exchange rate) to 8.4% of revenues  resulting from higher revenues and significant cost savings and operating efficiencies achieved across all divisions. This led to a +‚Ç¨38 million adjusted EBITA improvement compared to the first half 2021  reaching ‚Ç¨48 million.Free Cash Flow from continuing operations before financial and taxes amounted to ‚Ç¨(35) million compared to ‚Ç¨(215) million in the first half of 2021. This ‚Ç¨178 million improvement at constant currency mainly resulted from better operating performance and lower change in working capital requirements at Connected Home  along with lower restructuring expenses  mainly through the second quarter of 2022. In the sole second quarter  Free Cash Flow from continuing operations before financial and taxes improved by ‚Ç¨105 million (‚Ç¨96 million at constant exchange rate) with ‚Ç¨90 million FCF generated over the second quarter of 2022.OutlookThe Group confirms its 2022 guidance along with the outlook for its divisions as published on June 6th  2022:Demand for Technicolor Creative Studios‚Äô highest quality VFX & Animation artistry and cutting-edge technology is expected to continue to grow significantly throughout 2022 and 2023. At MPC and Mikros Animation  the divisions continue to be awarded multiple new projects  resulting in more than 85% of the revenue pipeline for MPC and Mikros Animation being already committed for 2022 as of the end of June 2022. In addition  the number of feature animation projects in production has grown from two in 2019 to six features in 2022; At The Mill  whose activity is closely correlated to advertising spending  activity growth is being restricted by the current global economic environment. As a result  as communicated on June 6 th   2022  The Mill is expecting slower growth than initially anticipated earlier this year  with the main impact in 2022. Actions to mitigate the impact on margin have already been identified and initiated relating to costs and operational efficiencies; At Technicolor Games  demand for games content is expected to continue growing  along with the expansion of the Technicolor Games service offering beyond art services into co-development and quality assurance (‚ÄúQA‚Äù) services;Significant investment in artist recruitment  retention  and training (including TCS Academy programs) continues  as delivering all pipeline projects remains the main challenge for 2022  as a consequence of the shortage of talent in the market.Worldwide demand for Connected Home broadband equipment is expected to remain strong in 2022  as customers seek to improve their connectivity. However  ongoing component shortages and pricing challenges will continue to impact our ability to serve end customer demand for broadband products throughout 2022  although we are starting to see signs of improvements. Furthermore  while we do not have any assets or direct customers or suppliers in Russia and Ukraine  the ongoing conflict has generated additional uncertainty in terms of supply. This has led to an increase in transit times to some European customers  as we transition from rail to sea transportation for products that used to move through Russia. Nonetheless  efficiency measures  gradual improvements in delivery and continuous discussions with both suppliers and customers should continue to help offset these headwinds.For V antiva Supply Chain Services (formerly DVD Services)  solid year-on-year new release volumes are expected as theatrical attendance continues to normalize  but this will be more than offset by lower catalog volumes driven by evolving customer and retailer behavior. Financial performance will be improved through continuing cost efficiencies. As part of the Group‚Äôs plan to accelerate the diversification of the business  the division is continuing to work on significantly expanding non-disc activities.The Group delivered ‚Ç¨171 million of cost savings in 2020  ‚Ç¨116 million in 2021  and ‚Ç¨30 million in the first half 2022. These results  combined with continuous improvements in efficiency  are keeping Technicolor on track to deliver a cumulative ‚Ç¨325 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2022.As a result  the Group Technicolor confirms its 2022 guidance ‚Äúas is‚Äù with:Revenue from continuing operations is expected to grow;Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of ‚Ç¨361 million;Adjusted EBITA from continuing operations of ‚Ç¨161 million;FCF from continuing operations  before financial results and tax  of ‚Ç¨217 million.Technicolor results are sensitive to the valuation of its main currencies - notably the US dollar  the Canadian dollar  and the British pound ‚Äì which have evolved favorably since the beginning of the year. Hedging arrangements are in place to mitigate forex risks. This 2022 guidance for Technicolor group assumes external macroeconomic assumptions  including a EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.15  EUR/CAD of 1.52  and EUR/GBP of 0.89. It also includes management assumptions reflecting the IFRIC interpretation on Saas adjustment  excludes Trademark Licensing operations  and does not include the TCS spin-off.II- Update on Technicolor‚Äôs intention to list 65% of Technicolor Creative Studios and on the early refinancing of Technicolor‚Äôs existing debtThe Group is making good progress on the implementation of the Technicolor Creative Studios spin-off plan and the refinancing of Group debt:On February 24th  2022  the Group published its intention to list and spin-off 65% of Technicolor Creative Studios through a distribution-in-kind to Technicolor shareholders  and to fully refinance the existing debt structure;The Extraordinary General Meeting for the approval of the Mandatory Convertible Notes (MCN) was held on May 6 th   2022. The proposed issuance of Mandatory Convertible Notes (‚ÄúMCN‚Äù) to be subscribed by a group of named beneficiaries for a total nominal amount of ‚Ç¨300 million was approved  and all necessary powers were given to the Board of Directors to implement the issuance;On June 14 th   2022  the Group announced the launch of its new brand: Vantiva. The new brand will be composed of Connected Home and Vantiva Supply Chain Services (formerly named ‚ÄúDVD Services‚Äù).The Group has also appointed the leadership teams for the two new entities: At Vantiva   Richard Moat  current CEO of Technicolor  will be appointed Chairman  Luis Martinez-Amago  current President of Connected Home  will be appointed CEO  and Lars Ihlen  current CFO of Connected Home  will be appointed CFO; At Technicolor Creative Studios (TCS)  Anne Bouverot  current Chairperson of Technicolor  will be appointed Chairperson  Christian Roberton  current President of TCS  CEO  and Laurent Carozzi  current CFO of Technicolor  will be appointed CFO.As part of the refinancing process  Technicolor S.A. has finalized discussions for both Vantiva and TCS: For Vantiva  Barclays Bank and Angelo Gordon have committed to provide a ‚Ç¨375 million debt package to Vantiva. In parallel  advanced discussions are underway with Wells Fargo to extend the Asset-Based Lending (ABL) Facility for 4 years; For TCS  the Group has obtained commitments for a ‚Ç¨623 million floating rate First Lien Term Facility. This facility is composed of two tranches  a ‚Ç¨563 million tranche and a $60 million tranche. Maturity for both tranches will be 4 years. In addition  the Group has obtained commitments for a ‚Ç¨40 million Revolving Credit Facility. The terms of the TCS refinancing as well as the terms of the distribution will be subject to a prospectus to be approved by the AMF.Technicolor will convene a Shareholders Meeting on September 6th  2022  and the notice of this meeting will be published in the BALO (mandatory legal announcement bulletin) on August 1st  2022. It will be proposed that the shareholders vote on the change of the corporate name of Technicolor S.A. to Vantiva S.A.  and on the matters related to the distribution in kind of at least 65% of the capital of Technicolor Creative Studios (""TCS"") to the shareholders of Technicolor S.A.. This will enable the latter to receive TCS shares while remaining shareholders of Technicolor  on the basis of one Technicolor Creative Studios share for one Technicolor share. The Distribution will also result in the admission of the TCS shares to the regulated market of Euronext Paris (‚ÄúEuronext Paris‚Äù).The spin-off is expected to be completed in Q3 2022  subject to (i) the shareholders‚Äô approval of the terms of the spin-off on September 6th  2022  and (ii) customary conditions  consultations and regulatory approvals.III- Segment Review ‚Äì First Half 2022 Results HighlightsTechnicolor Creative StudiosTechnicolor Creative Studios revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨408 million in the first half 2022  up 38.3% (up 29.6% at constant rate) compared to H1 2021. Excluding the Post-Production business divested in April 2021  revenue growth was 53.3% (43.7% at constant exchange rate) compared to H1 2021. This improvement resulted from the significant demand for original content compared to the first half 2021  and was achieved despite the market shortage of talent and decelerating advertising spending growth in Q2 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions.At MPC  revenues more than doubled compared to H1 2021  driven by the continued ramp up in production of major theatrical projects  as well as increasing contributions from all the major streaming platforms. H1 2021 was still suffering from pandemic-related impacts on production;At The Mill  advertising revenues decreased in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021 at constant currency (but were slightly up at current exchange rates)  driven by lower year-on-year revenues in the second quarter  as activity was restricted by decelerating advertising spending growth in Q2 2022 compared with a high comparative base in H1 2021;At Mikros Animation revenues were up mainly as a result of higher volumes in feature animation projects;At Technicolor Games  revenues were higher thanks to greater production capacity.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to ‚Ç¨61 million  up ‚Ç¨16 million compared to H1 2021 at constant rate  and Adjusted EBITA was ‚Ç¨26 million  up ‚Ç¨18 million compared to H1 2021 at constant rate. On top of the increase in revenues  EBITDA margin improvement from 13.7% to 15.0% resulted from the positive impacts of multiple operational transformation programs in conjunction with permanent cost reduction measures. These included mutualization of resources through  for example  the production platform in India  centralized global IT infrastructure  and the consolidation of real estate and other resources in key locations. However  H1 2022 margin was partly reduced by higher costs required to complete major projects  and a shortage of experienced talent is causing delays and additional costs. Lower revenues at The Mill in the second quarter of 2022 also reduced profitability. At The Mill and at MPC  actions to mitigate the impact on margin have already been identified and initiated relating to costs and operational efficiencies. In addition  the Group is actively working on accelerating its recruiting and training plan. Delivering on all projects committed remains the main challenge for 2022.On June 14th  2022 during the capital markets day  Technicolor Creative Studios updated its Key Performance Indicators (‚ÄúKPIs‚Äù)  with the goal of becoming more comparable with its peers and market practice  and to further align them with the way the business is managed. These KPIs include Adjusted EBITDA after lease (new definition)  Adjusted EBITA after lease (new definition)  and Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after lease (new definition). TCS‚Äô first half 2022 combined accounts along with an MD&A commenting on these new KPIs will be available in the days to come as part of the Prospectus to be filed with the Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers.Connected HomeConnected Home revenues totaled ‚Ç¨897 million in the first half 2022  up 16.4% (up 5.8% at constant exchange rates) compared the same period in 2021. Although the worldwide semiconductor shortage and supply chain disruptions limited the division‚Äôs ability to fully satisfy the demand from its broadband customers  second quarter revenues benefited from the first signs of improvement in the allocation of supply and in transit times. This  combined with broadband now representing 77% of total sales (vs. 64% in H1 2021)  with notably a strong rebound in North America in Q2 2022  is driving revenue improvement  despite decreased video products sales.Adjusted EBITDA was ‚Ç¨70 million in the first half 2022 (up 14.4% at constant exchange rate)  or 7.8% of revenue  compared to 7.2% of revenues in the first half 2021. Margin improvement is mainly resulting from operating efficiencies and cost savings  along with sales improvement. H1 2022 Adjusted EBITA was ‚Ç¨37 million  +18.0% compared to the first half 2021 at constant rate and representing 4.2% of revenues in the first half.The division continues its collaboration with clients and suppliers to maximize deliveries  and to mitigate potential profitability and working capital impacts of fulfillment difficulties. A significant portion of cost increases is currently passed through to customers. The division continues to focus on selective investments in key customers  platform-based products and partnerships  and on optimizing fixed costs.Vantiva Supply Chain Services ( former DVD Services division)Vantiva Supply Chain Services revenues totaled ‚Ç¨296 million in the first half 2022  up 4.5% (down 3.2% at constant exchange rate) compared with first half 2021. Lower disc volumes year-on-year3 (-30%) were driven by expected market declines  and were further exacerbated by the inventories built up in 2021 by the major US studios  which reduced new manufacturing demand in H1 2022. The impact of volume reductions was partially offset by disc price increases  and pass through of cost increases  along with the performance of new growth businesses (notably transportation management and vinyl).In the first half 2022  adjusted EBITDA amounted to ‚Ç¨15 million (vs. ‚Ç¨10 million in the first half 2021)  representing 5.2% of H1 2022 revenues  compared to 3.6% in H1 2021. EBITDA margin improvement mainly resulted from significant footprint optimization  headcount reductions and higher activity in non-disc activities  partly offset by the impacts of lower disc volumes and higher labor costs in North America and Mexico. Vantiva Supply Chain Services continued to adapt distribution and manufacturing operations  and related customer contract agreements  in response to continued volume reductions.Corporate & OtherCorporate & Other revenues were nil in the first half of 2022  compared with ‚Ç¨4 million in the first half 2021. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to ‚Ç¨(12) million  and Adjusted EBITA was ‚Ç¨(15) million.IV- Results analysisP&L analysisFirst Half In ‚Ç¨ million 2022 2021 Actual Change Change at constant rate Revenues from continuing operations 1 601 1 352 +18.4% +8.8% Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 134 94 +43.1% +30.7% As a % of revenues 8.4% 6.9% +145 bps +139 bps D&A1 & Reserves2  witho PPA amortization (86) (84) Adjusted EBITA from continuing operations 48 10 As a % of revenues 3.0% 0.7% 228 bps 219 bps PPA amortization (20) (19) Non-recurring items (20) (3) EBIT from continuing operations 8 (11) As a % of revenues 0.5% -0.8% Net financial income (loss) (65) (63) Income tax (19) (10) Profit (loss) from continuing operations (77) (84) +8.9% +10.1% Net gain (loss) from discontinued operations 63 5 Net income (loss) (14) (79) +82.6% +83.8%1 Including IT capacity use for rendering in Technicolor Creative Studios of ‚Ç¨(4)m in H1 2022 and ‚Ç¨0m in H1 20212 Risk  litigation and warranty reservesFirst half 2022 revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨1 601 million and were up 18.4% (up 8.8% at constant exchange rates). Excluding change in perimeter (i.e. excluding Post Production)  first half 2022 revenues would have been up 21.0% (up 11.2% at constant exchange rate and perimeter). This good performance was driven by the high level of demand for Technicolor Creative Studios and Connected Home products and services  despite continued supply constraints and decelerating advertising spending growth in Q2 2022 compared with a high comparative base in H1 2021.First half 2022 Adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨134 million improved by ‚Ç¨40 million (up ‚Ç¨29 million at constant exchange rate). Margin improved by 139 basis points to 8.4% of revenues  mainly thanks to higher revenues and improved performance from all divisions and more particularly from Technicolor Creative Studios  resulting from the significant cost savings and operating efficiencies achieved across all divisions.First half 2022 Adjusted EBITA of ‚Ç¨48 million represented a ‚Ç¨38 million improvement (+‚Ç¨33 million at constant rate) compared to the first half 2021. This resulted mainly from the EBITDA improvement.EBIT from continuing operations was a ‚Ç¨8 million profit compared to a ‚Ç¨(11) million loss in the first half 2021. This resulted from better operational performance  despite higher non-recurring items. Non-recurring items amounted to ‚Ç¨(20) million compared to ‚Ç¨(3) million in H1 2021. This increase mainly resulted from positive non-current items of ‚Ç¨24 million recorded in H1 2021 (mainly capital gains) compared to negative ‚Ç¨(9) million recorded in H1 2022 (mainly related to the ongoing spin off project)  offset by lower restructuring costs of ‚Ç¨(8) million in H1 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨(26) million in H1 2021.The financial loss totaled ‚Ç¨(65) million  compared to ‚Ç¨(63) million in the first half 2021.Income tax was up at ‚Ç¨(19) million  compared to ‚Ç¨(10) million in the first half 2021  mainly due to Technicolor Creative Studios improved performance.Net gain from discontinued operations amounted to ‚Ç¨63 million compared to ‚Ç¨5 million in the first half 2021. On May 31st  2022  the Group completed the sale of its Trademark Licensing operations  and received a cash consideration of approximately ‚Ç¨100 million  subject to customary price adjustments. As a result  the Group has accounted for Trademark Licensing operations as discontinued operations as from January 1  2021.The Group net loss therefore amounted to ‚Ç¨(14) million in H1 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨(79) million in H1 2021.FCF and debt analysisFirst Half In ‚Ç¨ million 2022 2021 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 134 94 Capex (57) (40) Non-recurring items (cash impact) (37) (59) Change in working capital and other assets and liabilities1 (76) (211) Free Cash Flow from continuing operations before Tax & Financial (35) (215) 30/06/2022 31/12/2021 Nominal gross debt (including Lease debt) 1 373 1 306 Cash and cash equivalents (168) (196) Net financial debt at nominal value (non IFRS) 1 205 1 110 IFRS adjustment (64) (71) Net financial debt (IFRS) 1 141 1 0391 Including IT capacity use for rendering in Technicolor Creative Studios of ‚Ç¨(4) million in H1 2022 and nil in H1 2021Free Cash Flow from continuing operations before financial and taxes improved to ‚Ç¨(35) million compared to ‚Ç¨(215) million in the first half 2021. This ‚Ç¨180 million improvement mainly reflects positive impacts from:I mproved operating performance (adjusted EBITDA was up ‚Ç¨40 million);L ower increase of working capital requirements (+‚Ç¨135 million). The change in working capital was ‚Ç¨(76) million compared with ‚Ç¨(211) million in the first half 2021. This improvement came from a positive variation year-on-year at Connected Home as first half 2021 working capital was notably impacted by the negative impact of reductions in supplier payment terms;Lower non-recurring cash outflows (+‚Ç¨22 million)  notably lower cash restructuring (+‚Ç¨33 million)  principally at the Connected Home and Vantiva Supply Chain Services divisions.These positive impacts were partly offset by:Capex increase of ‚Ç¨17 million from ‚Ç¨40 million to ‚Ç¨57 million  mainly at Technicolor Creative Studios  mostly due to higher activity and higher headcount  and to payment phasing.The cash position at the end of June 2022 was ‚Ç¨168 million  compared to ‚Ç¨196 million at the end of December 2021. Change in cash over the period was ‚Ç¨(28) million  mainly explained by negative ‚Ç¨(35) million free cash flow from continuing operations before financial and taxes  and ‚Ç¨(36) million net cash interest paid and ‚Ç¨(18) million net tax paid over the period  partly offset by the proceeds from the sale of the Trademark Licensing operations. Cash out for operating leases amounted to ‚Ç¨21 million  compared to ‚Ç¨28 million in the first half 2021. Total liquidity amounts to ‚Ç¨216 million  with ‚Ç¨48m of the Wells Fargo line available (undrawn at the end of the quarter).As a consequence  net financial debt at nominal value amounted to ‚Ç¨1 205 million at the end of June 2022  compared with ‚Ç¨1 110 million at the end of December 2021. IFRS net debt amounted to ‚Ç¨1 141 million as of June 30  2022  compared with ‚Ç¨1 039 million as of December 31  2021. The Net Debt / EBITDA ratio of 4.01x was below the 4.50x covenant.An analyst audio webcast hosted by Richard Moat  CEO and Laurent Carozzi  CFO will be held today  July 28  2022  at 6:30pm CEST.Indicative TimetableAGM to approve the spin offSpin-off of the TCS sharesTechnicolor SA (Vantiva) Q3 communication September 6  2022Q3  2022End November /Early December 2022###Warning: Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

Although Verimatrix believes its expectations to be based on reasonable assumptions  they do not constitute guarantees of future performance. Accordingly  the Company‚Äôs actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements owing to a number of risks and uncertainties.Appendix 1 - Supplementary non-IFRS financial information - Reconciliation of IFRS results with adjusted resultsThe performance indicators presented in this press release that are not strictly accounting measures are defined below. These indicators are not defined under IFRS  and do not constitute accounting elements used to measure the company‚Äôs financial performance. They should be considered as additional information  which cannot replace any other strictly accounting-based operating or financial performance measure  as presented in the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements and their related notes. The company uses these indicators because it believes they are useful measures of its recurring operating performance and its operating cash flows. Although they are widely used by companies operating in the same industry around the world  these indicators are not necessarily directly comparable to those of other companies  which may have defined or calculated their indicators differently than the company  even though they use similar terms.Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit before (i) the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations  (ii) any potential goodwill impairment  (iii) share-based payment expense and (iv) non-recurring costs associated with restructuring and business combinations and divestiture undertaken by the company.Adjusted operating income/(loss) is defined as operating income/(loss) before (i) the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations  (ii) any potential goodwill impairment  (iii) share-based payment expense and (iv) non-recurring costs associated with restructuring and business combinations and divestiture undertaken by the company.EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating income before depreciation  amortization and impairment expenses not related to business combinations.Annual Recurring Revenue  or ARR  corresponds annualized value of all recurring revenues from current contracts at the time of measurement. ARR includes all contract types that are recurring in nature  such as maintenance & support  SaaS and non-SaaS subscriptions  and for which revenue is currently being recognized. The ARR is a rolling number that accumulates over time whereas the Total Contract Value (or TCV) metric also used by the Company  is typically used to measure (new or incremental) sales bookings within a period.

‚Ç¨471.4m  an increase of ‚Ç¨86.0m (+22.3%)  driven by higher core operating income (an increase of ‚Ç¨101.6m) and better other working-capital requirement change (‚Ç¨51.7m  reflecting the reimbursement in 2022 of tax refunds)  partly offset by higher operating working-capital requirements (‚Ç¨19.5m mainly from higher trade receivables)  higher capital expenditure (‚Ç¨15.7m  including projects to increase efficiency at industrial sites in the U.K.  Ireland and France  as well as IT and digital projects) and lower other non-cash items from unrealized cash-flow hedging.Free cash

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen‚Äôs business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen‚Äôs 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.1 At constant exchange rates (CER)  which exclude any foreign-exchange impact by recalculating the performance for the relevant period by applying the exchange rates used for the prior period.2 Extract of consolidated results.

This equity investment was accompanied by the acquisition of a 51.82%-stake in the capital of the British company CAREMEDS.By developing innovative technology solutions for medication adherence  these companies will make it possible to manage the entire per unit dispensing cycle from the manufacturing phase to delivery to the patient:MULTIMEDS sells a manual dispensing solution with a comprehensive and innovative patent-protected pill dispenser;CAREMEDS develops a secure cloud-based platform for tracking the medication cycle using pill dispensers. Its eMAR system provides pharmacists in dispensing pharmacies as well as nurses and caregivers when dispensing medications in elderly residential care homes (EHPAD) with secure medication management and batch traceability for prescription drugs prepared in pill dispensers. The company has also developed a mobile app for retirement homes (CARE HOME).While these solutions are complementary  they can also be marketed separately according to the needs of healthcare professionals and adapted to the specificities of each country. These offerings are currently distributed in the United Kingdom  France  Spain  Italy  Portugal and Germany.Story continuesIn 2019  through CAREMEDS  Equasens Group strengthened its position in this segment of the medication dispenser market by acquiring a majority 60%-stake in the German company I-MEDS  a wholesaler and distributor of equipment and accessories for supplying drugs to patients and pharmacies. I-MEDS is a key distribution partner for MULTIMEDS manual pillboxes in Germany (20% market share for manual dispensing solutions).In 2022  the Group will maintain its strategy focused on patients and effective medication compliance. These additional investments highlight the Group‚Äôs goal of further developing this activity  accelerating the roll-out of these solutions in Europe and offering the most extensive range of compliance solutions on the market.To optimise this integration  the English activities dedicated to securing the flow of medicines between pharmacies and retirement homes will be part of the AXIGATE LINK Division  while the Pharmacy activities in the other countries will be part of the PHARMAGEST Division. Each of these entities has its own governance. The CAREMEDS and MULTIMEDS offerings will have development potential with the European customer base of these Divisions: 12 000 pharmacies and over 3 000 nursing homes in Europe equipped with the Group's solutions. At the same time  the Divisions will increase their penetration of the European markets supplied by CAREMEDS and MULTIMEDS by leveraging their installed customer base (notably in the United Kingdom  approximately 200 pharmacy distributors and more than 1 000 nursing homes equipped with CAREMEDS software and MULTIMEDS pillboxes  i.e. more than 80 000 patients addressed) as well as their networks of resellers and distributors like I-MEDS.These solutions will benefit from the Group's proactive and innovative approach and resources based on an agile and European organisation  healthcare professionals from multiple sectors  multi-country R&D communities working closely together and new technologies.These different operations will help Equasens Group accelerate its expansion and reinforce its presence in several European countries. In particular:in the United Kingdom  by combining CAREMEDS' eMAR medication traceability solution with MALTA INFORMATIQUE's TITANLINK facility management solution (MALTA intends to replicate its business model  based on the successful example of MALTA BELGIUM in Belgium);in Germany  by enhancing MULTIMEDS‚Äô manual dispensing range with the Group's pharmacy automation solutions  and in particular the addition of AUTOMEDS' semi-automatic dispensing systems  which are perfectly suited to the German market in terms of design and capacity.About Equasens Group:With more than 1 200 employees fulfilling a vital role as ‚ÄúCitizens in the Service of Health and Well-Being‚Äù  Equasens Group is today a key player in the European healthcare sector  providing software solutions to all healthcare professionals (pharmacists  primary care practitioners  hospitals  Hospital-at-Home structures  retirement homes  health centres) in both primary and secondary care sectors.With operations in France  Italy  Belgium  Luxembourg  United Kingdom and Germany  Equasens Group is currently developing the leading healthcare platform and a unique ecosystem in France and Europe benefiting people by making available the very best of technology.Listed on Euronext Paris‚Ñ¢ -

However  unexpected issues sourcing a critical semiconductor chip caused a severe revenue shortfall in our Printhead Solutions segment and erased the gains from the Printing Software and Enterprise Software segments. This resulted in subpar financial results for the first half of 2022  a sharp contrast from the record results this segment delivered in 2021.‚ÄúThe situation has already been rectified by redesigning a key circuit board using a more powerful chip. Thanks to heroic efforts by our employees and valuable input from customers who tested the new design  I‚Äôm pleased to report that we are now shipping the new board in production quantities and did not lose any customers due to the quick redesign of this key component  so we expect significant recovery in the second half of 2022.‚ÄúHybrid Software Group remains committed to innovation and profitable growth and will continue to invest in additional engineering staff for key projects and business segments.‚ÄùFinancial highlights (unaudited)For the six months ended 30 June In thousands of euros 2022 (unaudited) 2021 (unaudited) Revenue 23 435 23 774 Operating profit 248 2 274 Profit before tax 248 1 977 Tax benefit 118 483 Profit for the period attributable to equity holders 366 2 460 EBITDA 4 620 5 812 Adjusted operating profit 1 439 3 827 Adjusted net profit 958 3 518About Hybrid Software GroupThrough its operating subsidiaries  Hybrid Software Group PLC (Euronext: HYSG) is a leading developer of enterprise software for industrial print manufacturing.

On a like-for-like basis  the increase was 16.9%  driven in particular by strong growth in North America. The currency impact over the period was -‚Ç¨8.3m  including -‚Ç¨17.3m on the Turkish lira and +‚Ç¨8.5m on the US dollar.The second-quarter performance resulted in stable reported half-year turnover  up 5% on a like-for-like basis  outperforming the global vehicle production market over the first half of the year (-1.8%1).BREAKDOWN OF TURNOVERThe geographical breakdown of turnover by production zone was as follows during the six-month period:France: ‚Ç¨136.8m (-1.5%)Europe (excluding France) and Africa: ‚Ç¨135.8m (-11.4%)North America: ‚Ç¨144.2m (+18.4%)Asia and the Middle East (including Turkey): ‚Ç¨68.4m (-2.7%)South America: ‚Ç¨2.9m (-10.0%)Products and Functions turnover was up by 1.3% in the first half at ‚Ç¨473.2m. The Cooling (+8.3%) and Air (+2.2%) activities continued to grow  driven by market share gains. The Depollution product line limited its decline to -2.6%  and the Aftermarket activities remained strong on SCR tanks. Tooling turnover was down at ‚Ç¨11.0m after unusual prior financial years.NET CASH POSITION OF ‚Ç¨116mThe Group generated ‚Ç¨7.7m in free cash flow during the first half of 2022  reaching a net cash position as of 30 June  excluding rental obligations  of ‚Ç¨116m after the dividend payout.2022 OUTLOOKIn a global automotive market that continues to be very turbulent  AKWEL confirms its expectation of moderate growth in turnover for the 2022 financial year. However  as mentioned in recent communications  the supply difficulties disrupting the activities of vehicle and equipment manufacturers  particularly at European sites  and the significant inflation observed in the costs of raw materials  components  energy  transport  and labour will have a major impact on the Group‚Äôs operating profitability this year. These various increases cannot be easily passed on to sales prices. In all cases  this requires long negotiation periods. This time lag leads AKWEL to anticipate a significant decrease in its current operating income in both the first half and second half of 2022.Next press release: 2022 half-year results  Thursday 22 September 2022  after the markets close.An independent  family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange  AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management and mechanisms  offering first-rate industrial and technological expertise in applying and processing materials (plastics  rubber  metal) and mechatronic integration.Operating in 20 countries across every continent  AKWEL employs 9 700 people worldwide.Euronext Paris ‚Äì Compartment B ‚Äì ISIN: FR0000053027 ‚Äì Reuters: AKW.PA ‚Äì Bloomberg: AKW:FPContactsAKWELGr√©gory Voisin ‚Äì Financial VP ‚Äì Tel.: +33 4 50 56 99 25EKNO ‚Äì Press RelationsChristine Savoie ‚Äì Jean-Marc Atlan ‚Äì jean-marc.atlan@ekno.fr ‚Äì Tel.: +33 6 70 08 11 09 / +33 6 07 37 20 44CALYPTUS ‚Äì Investor RelationsMathieu Calleux ‚Äì akwel@calyptus.net ‚Äì Tel.: +33 1 53 65 68 681 Source: S&P Global MobilityAttachment,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.14,0.14,0.72,True,English,"['STABLE TURNOVER FIGURES', '1st\xa0HALF', 'AKWEL', 'THE', 'S&P Global Mobility Attachment', 'unusual prior financial years', 'The Depollution product line', 'Euronext Paris Stock Exchange', 'MORE DYNAMIC SECOND QUARTER', 'global vehicle production market', 'international geopolitical tensions', 'market share gains', 'NET CASH POSITION', 'free cash flow', 'long negotiation periods', 'Gr√©gory Voisin', 'current operating income', 'Next press release', 'global automotive market', 'independent, family-owned group', 'STABLE TURNOVER FIGURES', 'global market', 'production zone', 'operating profitability', 'second half', '1st quarter', '2nd quarter', 'Financial VP', 'Press Relations', 'The Cooling', 'The Group', '2022 financial year', '1st HALF', 'HGV equipment', 'systems manufacturer', 'fluid management', 'first half', 'supply problems', 'raw materials', 'higher level', 'strong growth', 'North America', 'currency impact', 'Turkish lira', 'US dollar', 'second-quarter performance', 'Middle East', 'South America', 'SCR tanks', 'rental obligations', 'dividend payout', 'moderate growth', 'recent communications', 'supply difficulties', 'equipment manufacturers', 'European sites', 'significant inflation', 'major impact', 'various increases', 'sales prices', 'time lag', 'significant decrease', '2022 half-year results', 'first-rate industrial', 'technological expertise', 'processing materials', 'mechatronic integration', 'Compartment B', 'Christine Savoie', 'Jean-Marc Atlan', 'Investor Relations', 'Mathieu Calleux', 'half-year turnover', 'Functions turnover', 'Tooling turnover', 'Sharp decline', 'electronic components', 'geographical breakdown', 'six-month period', 'Aftermarket activities', 'AKW.PA', 'Consolidated turnover', 'Akwel', 'Thursday', 'mechanisms', 'January', '30 June', 'millions', 'Variation', 'context', 'activity', 'basis', 'France', 'Africa', 'Asia', 'Turkey', 'Products', 'Air', '2022 OUTLOOK', 'expectation', 'costs', 'energy', 'transport', 'labour', 'cases', 'markets', 'applying', 'plastics', 'rubber', 'metal', '20 countries', 'continent', '9,700 people', 'Reuters', 'Bloomberg', 'Contacts', 'Tel.', 'EKNO', 'marc.', 'CALYPTUS', '1 Source', '‚Ç¨', '33 4 50']",2022-07-28,2022-07-28,finance.yahoo.com

Our pipeline stood at a record level at the end of the second quarter and the value of deals won remains robust. In addition  after several quarters of increasing working capital  we now see this stabilised compared to the previous quarter.As we support our clients to navigate through the current challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  we continue to position the Group for long-term growth. This is achieved by further strengthening our foundations and hence we‚Äôre investing in compliance & remediation and expanding our talented workforce. As employee attrition remained elevated  we have welcomed more than 1 100 new colleagues to our offices across the globe in the first half which  in the current tight labour market  resulted in markedly higher staff expenses. In addition  we are seeking targeted price increases to partially offset the various inflationary pressures which are inevitably impacting our cost base in the short term.Story continuesTaking all this into account  we reiterate our revenue guidance of 3-5% underlying growth for the year and we adjust our EBITA margin guidance to 26-28%. Our medium-term ambitions  which aim for accelerated revenue growth and margin expansion  remain unchanged and reflect our commitment to long-term growth and solid cash generation.We value our shareholders' support in the transaction with CSC as evidenced during the AGM last May.

The Bank of England is set to raise rates next week  perhaps by as much as 50 basis points.‚ÄúClearly ahead of us we have adjustments that are to come to price lasting inflation  increased interest rates  lasting geostrategic moves  and there will be some form of rotation in assets to transform these external shocks into investment decisions ‚Äù Boujnah told Reuters.Euronext  which runs stock exchanges in Paris  Dublin  Amsterdam  Lisbon  Brussels and Oslo  reported second quarter earnings on Thursday  with like-for-like revenue and income up 2.5% on the same quarter last year at 374.7 million euros.The first savings from its takeover of the Milan Exchange Group totalled 24.1 million euros  a quarter of the 100 million euros savings forecast under the exchange‚Äôs current strategic plan which runs to the end of 2024.Shifting servers from Basildon near London to Bergamo in Italy due to Brexit contributed 8.9 million euros to savings.

As a result  overall revenue growth slowed in Q2 (1%) versus Q1 2022.Story continuesThe Group‚Äôs main brands posted a resilient performance in the first half of 2022  particularly Marie Brizard and San Jos√©. Other brands including Sobieski posted growth in the on-trade business  while off-trade sales dipped slightly in the second quarter. Despite a general slowdown in the under-12-year blended whisky market (down 6.7% in the first half)  William Peel recorded a small decline in sales in the first half of 2022 compared to 2021  thanks to a new listing obtained in the second half of 2021 enabling it to gain market share.The first half upswing in France cluster sales was impacted by severe disruption in raw material supply chains since the beginning of March  notably due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and soaring raw material costs  which have particularly affected the glassmaking industry since early April. The Group is dealing with this situation by adopting allocation measures per brand based on available volumes. Furthermore  sales pricing policy adjustments across all distribution channels have been and will continue to be necessary in order to adapt to this new volatile environment.International clusterThe International cluster posted H1 2022 revenues of ‚Ç¨46.3m  up 9.2% from H1 2021 at constant exchange rates.In Western Europe  business in the first six months of 2022 benefited from a strong recovery including a Q2 upturn in UK sales (particularly on-trade versus 2021)  driven by a strong performance by the Marie Brizard brand (in terms of value and percentage of business).Sales in Spain fell 2.9% versus H1 2021  mainly due to a temporary decline in subcontracted operations resulting from difficulties with glass supplies (bottles)  offset by strong growth among strategic brands (particularly Marie Brizard  Sobieski and William Peel).Scandinavia posted a significant increase in H1 revenues  mainly driven by Marie Brizard and Gautier  particularly in the on-trade market in the second quarter.Business continued to thrive in the Middle East driven by the development of the Marie Brizard range of syrups  which recorded significant growth in the first half.In the Baltic States  first half revenues rose 8.8%  reflecting favourable economic conditions on the bulk market and brand growth on the domestic market thanks to a favourable product mix and pricing policy  despite the immediate consequences of the war in Ukraine  which affected exports to Russia and Belarus  albeit with an overall impact that is not deemed material at Group level.Bulgaria also posted strong growth throughout the first half of 2022 (up 18.3%) across its entire brand portfolio (wines and spirits) in both domestic and export markets (Greece  Croatia  Serbia) as well as a sustained level of subcontracting activity for Romania.In Poland  Group brand sales were boosted strongly by growth in Cognac Gautier sales and the launch of Marie Brizard liqueurs.US revenues for the first half of 2022 were down versus 2021 due to the continuing decline in Sobieski sales due to aggressive promotional strategies by competitors in the vodka segment and ongoing pressure on sea transport capacity.Brazil revenues fell sharply in the second quarter of 2022 across the entire brand portfolio except for Marie Brizard and Sobieski  due to the revision in early 2022 of the portfolio pricing policy. The new policy has however helped to limit the reduction in revenues.Asia Pacific maintained revenue growth in the second quarter of 2022  as the decline in sales in the Chinese market was largely offset by strong performances in South Korea  Taiwan  Japan and Australia.OutlookAs mentioned at the 30 June 2022 General Meeting  over the coming months  rising raw material and energy prices and the varying availability of supplier production are factors that must be taken into account in managing our business.These factors could impact the Group‚Äôs ability to supply all of its customers (both in France and abroad) notwithstanding the impact of higher prices on consumer demand. These considerations are all the more pertinent in view of the Group‚Äôs need to adapt pricing policies to the new situation and  as such  the Group will continue to adopt a cautious stance regarding its forecasts over the coming months.Financial calendarH1 2022 results: 28 September 2022 after close of tradingInvestors and Shareholders Relations ContactMBWS GroupEmilie Drexleremilie.drexler@mbws.comPhone: +33 1 43 91 62 40 Press ContactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurence Maurycdoligez@image7.fr ‚Äì lmaury@image7.frPhone: +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a Group of wines and spirits based in Europe and the United States.

The first half of 2021 was stimulated by the lockdowns imposed across Europe. In the first half of 2022  adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events negatively impacted consumer spending and business investment decisions  but did not negatively impact trends in the electronic payments market.The strong momentum in payment volumes seen across all market segments is only partially reflected in revenues. The discontinuation of a number of payment methods in the Belgian market saw the transfer of a proportion of payment volumes to other  less lucrative  methods.Successful business developmentHiPay recorded a high level of sales activity in the first half of the year along with an increase in market share  thus attesting to its ability to perform in a difficult economic environment. The group expanded its business relationships with tier-22 retailers  expanding its reach with new brands by leveraging its omni-channel offering. HiPay also continued its European expansion with its share of payment volumes completed outside of France increasing to 39% over the period  an increase of +1 point compared to H1 2021.HiPay‚Äôs omni-channel positioning attests to its popularity in FranceHiPay‚Äôs business in France is driven by retailer appetite for its unified commerce offering which accounted for almost a third of new initiatives and nearly 15% of contracts signed in the first six months of the year. 38 new clients were signed in numerous vertical channels  thus strengthening HiPay‚Äôs multi-specialist positioning. As such  HiPay added a number of well-known French brands to its portfolio  including Dodo  Jott  EasyParapharmacie  Atmosphera and V33.Story continuesNew retail brands in Portugal and Italy and international growth for iGamingIn Portugal  32 new customers began using the HiPay platform in the first half of the year  including high-profile brands like 360Imprimir  Cant√© and SMEG.In Italy  the luxury group Binda (jewellery and watchmaking) signed on in the first quarter and launched its flagship brand  Breil.

8319,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/vivendi-revenue-rises-on-growth-at-havas-canal-1235186334/,Vivendi Second-Quarter Revenue Report: Canal Plus ‚Äì The Hollywood Reporter,French media and telecommunications conglomerate Vivendi reported higher first-half revenue and earnings on Thursday  driven by gains at advertising giant...,French media and telecommunications conglomerate Vivendi reported higher first-half revenue and earnings on Thursday  driven by gains at advertising giant Havas  but also pay TV unit Canal+ Group.Revenue for the first six months of 2022 reached ‚Ç¨4.87 billion ($4.94 billion)  up 10.9 percent  or 5.4 percent on an organic basis  which focuses on constant currencies and current assets  compared to the year-ago period. Earnings before interest  taxes and amortization (EBITA) jumped 31.5 percent to ‚Ç¨412 million ($418 million)  ‚Äúthanks notably to the contribution of Canal+ Group  the growth of Havas Group and the integration of (French magazine publisher) Prisma Media.‚ÄùVivendi also broke out revenue for the second quarter  which rose 8.6 percent to ‚Ç¨2.50 billion  ‚Äúmainly due to Havas Group‚Äôs very good momentum.‚Äù Focusing on constant currency and assets  quarterly revenue grew by 3.1 percent  led by Havas  while Canal+ recorded a 1.3 decline on that basis.‚ÄúAs reflected in the 31.5 percent increase in EBITA  our businesses continued to show very strong resilience in the first half of the year ‚Äù said Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine. ‚ÄúOur business model and high-profile brands provide solidity and consistency to our revenues and operating performance  as demonstrated by our financial figures‚Äù for the first half of the year.‚ÄúThese figures are a testament to the effectiveness of the strategy implemented by the group ‚Äù said Yannick Bollor√©  chairman of Vivendi‚Äôs supervisory board. ‚ÄúIt is underpinned by the transformation work carried out by each of our businesses to adapt their business models to changes in consumption patterns  the competitive environment  and emerging technologies. We also intend to continue our international development. Havas Group and Canal+ Group already generate 80 percent and 40 percent of their revenues  respectively  outside of France.‚ÄùVivendi said it owned a 57.35 percent economic stake but minority voting stake in French publishing giant Lagard√®re following a public tender offer that ended in June. Vivendi said on Thursday that it would explore divesting its publishing unit Editis  acquired in 2019  ‚Äúto avoid any potential antitrust problems.‚Äù It added: ‚ÄúVivendi contemplates carrying out this transaction primarily by distributing Editis shares to Vivendi‚Äôs shareholders and simultaneously having the shares admitted to trading on the Euronext Paris stock exchange.‚ÄùDuring an analyst call  Vivendi execs talked about Canal+ being among bidders eyeing a potential stake in Lionsgate‚Äôs Starz premium pay TV and streaming platform. CEO de Puyfontaine said the French media giant had successfully taken minority stakes in other global media companies  including holding a 20 percent stake in African pay-TV platform Multichoice.‚ÄúThe approach is very pragmatic. We‚Äôre open to different opportunities.

This performance was underpinned by the ongoing strong growth in Tolling service sales (+18%)  which have higher margins than Package Sales  and highlights the business recovery to higher pre-pandemic levels. The increase in demand in Europe and the sales price increases implemented by the Company to compensate for cost inflation contributed to the increase in turnover over the half-year.Sales evolution by quarter and by activity(‚Ç¨M) 2022 2021 Variation Q1 6.61 5.91 + 12.0 % Q2 7.34 6.54 + 12.2 % Half-year total 13.95 12.45 + 12.1 % Of which Tolling Sales 11.68 9.86 + 18.5 % Package Sales1 2.27 2.59 - 12.5 %Tolling services: sustained double-digit growth in the second quarterHalf-year sales of Tolling services amounted to ‚Ç¨11.7m  up 18.5% compared to the first half of 2021  accounting for 83.8% of total sales  compared with 79.2% the previous year. In the second quarter  sales momentum remained strong (+11.4%) despite a less favourable comparison base than in previous quarters; it should be noted that sales in the second quarter of 2021 were up by +39.6%. Since the beginning of the year  in a context of strong growth in the construction and architectural end markets  demand has been fuelled by restocking by distributors in Europe due to their anticipation of higher aluminium prices.Package Sales: recovery in the second quarter despite an unfavourable international environmentHalf-yearly Package Offer sales  whereby the Company supplies continuously anodised aluminium directly to end customers  amounted to ‚Ç¨2.3m  down -12.5% on the previous year. They accounted for 16.2% of total sales  compared with 20.8% the previous year. In the second quarter  sales increased by 17.6% due to a favourable base effect and were particularly dynamic in Europe in order to compensate for the lack of sales in Russia due to the conflict in Ukraine and in Asia due to the costs and delivery times for pre-anodised aluminium.Story continuesOutlookAs COIL celebrates its 50th anniversary this year  the commercial performance of the first half of 2022  driven by an exceptionally high demand  confirms the high quality of the Company's products  customer confidence  employee mobilisation and the efficiency of its industrial facilities.The impact of the two current major crises - the war in Ukraine and the Covid-19 epidemic - is generating significant short-term uncertainties  particularly with the rise in inflation  existing or potential shortages  and a weakening of the supply chain. In this context  the Company remains cautious and anticipates a slowdown in demand in the second half of the year and a return to a normal level of activity.The Company remains confident in its prospects and has a solid financial position allowing for the increase of its business potential in the long term. With this in mind  the Company is investing in partnerships in environmentally neutral technologies in order to substitute its fossil fuel consumption with new renewable energy sources at attractive costs and with carbon neutrality objectives for the Bernburg industrial site in Germany.Agenda31 October 2022 First half 2022 results and half-year financial report (after close of trading)About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes. It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people.

The indexation effect was slightly positive.These positive effects were offset by the temporary vacancy of the medium-sized unit vacated in January 2022 at Carr√© V√©lizy  which has already been relet under a lease that came into effect on 29 April 2022 (see above).On a reported basis  taking account of the impact of the disposal of two non-strategic assets in October 2021  revenues were down 3.9% relative to the first half of 2021.Half-year rental income‚Ç¨ million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Like-for-like change2 Gross rental income 4.7 4.9 -3.9% -0.7% Recurring non-recovered property expenses (1.2) (1.2) Non-recurring items (0.2) 0.2 Net rental income 3.3 3.9 -16.8%Compared with the first half of 2021  the amount of non-recovered property expenses was stable at ‚Ç¨1.2 million.

This acquisition is subject to a variety of conditions precedent. If it goes ahead  it would increase the value of MRM‚Äôs asset portfolio by more than 50%. The two properties  located in Flins-sur-Seine (Yvelines) and Ollioules (Var)  are both attached to Carrefour hypermarkets and are leading shopping centres within their catchment area. These are successful properties combining yields and potential for value creation.Story continuesFran√ßois de Varenne  Chairman of the Board of Directors of MRM  commented: ‚ÄúWe are delighted to present today a proposed significant acquisition that will have a transformative effect on MRM. The acquisition of these two shopping centres would mark a real change of dimension for MRM  representing an increase of more than 50% in the value of our asset portfolio. Altarea is a key player in the real estate industry. Its entry in the share capital of MRM is a mark of recognition of our know-how and confidence in our ability to create value.‚ÄùFran√ßois Matray  Chief Executive Officer of MRM  added: ‚ÄúHaving gradually refocused our portfolio on retail properties  enhanced the value of our properties by means of an apt investment plan and then over the last two years stepped up our active portfolio management under complex conditions  this acquisition would open up new prospects  allowing us to roll out our proactive management policy on the basis of a larger portfolio. It would enable us to aim for annualised net rents of over ‚Ç¨16 million and make us more profitable thanks to better absorption of fixed costs.‚ÄùSignificant increase in MRM‚Äôs portfolioThis proposed acquisition of the regional shopping centre in Flins-sur-Seine  Yvelines  and the Carrefour Ollioules shopping centre in the Var region for a total of ‚Ç¨90.4 million (including transfer taxes) would enable MRM to change dimension. While also extending its geographical presence in two fast-growing regions  the acquisition would significantly increase the size of its portfolio by 52% from ‚Ç¨163.0 million to ‚Ç¨247.3 million pro forma on the basis of values excluding transfer taxes as at 30 June 2022.This extension of the portfolio would result in a sharp increase in MRM‚Äôs annualised net rents from ‚Ç¨9.5 million to ‚Ç¨15.0 million pro forma as at 30 June 2022  thereby increasing MRM‚Äôs target annualised net rents from ‚Ç¨10 million to ‚Ç¨16 million. The increase in rental income would have a very positive impact on MRM‚Äôs net operating cash flow generation and enable it to improve its profitability thanks to better absorption of fixed costs.Positioned as market leaders within their catchment area and with physical occupancy rates of 97% and 92% respectively as at 30 June 2022  the Flins-sur-Seine and Ollioules shopping centres present net yields slightly higher than the current total yield for MRM‚Äôs portfolio. Furthermore  both present potential for value creation  which would give MRM the possibility of rolling out its asset management expertise (refurbishment  partial redevelopment  proactive rental management  changes in the retailer mix).Flins regional shopping centreClose to Mantes-la-Jolie in the Yvelines region  the Flins regional shopping centre is located in an attractive retail district in the heart of one of France‚Äôs biggest urban communities with a fast-growing population.

URW is well positioned to outperform and gain market share  as retailers accelerate their ‚Äúdrive to store‚Äù strategies. Against this backdrop  asset values have stabilised  and our credit metrics have significantly improved  in particular thanks to the net debt reduction and the increase in EBTIDA.In Europe  we have now achieved 80% of our ‚Ç¨4 billion disposal target. In the US  we continued to streamline our regional asset portfolio with the sale of the Promenade development parcel and are in active discussions on other regional assets. Given the quality and strong performance of our assets  we are confident in our ability to delever the company by executing on the radical reduction of our financial exposure to the US. We have maintained strict capital allocation  while continuing to deliver major development projects  and our hedging protects us against rising interest rates.In the context of our operational recovery in this challenging macro-environment  we are increasing our 2022 AREPS guidance from ‚Ç¨8.20 - ‚Ç¨8.40 to at least ‚Ç¨8.90.‚ÄùH1-2022 H1-2021 Growth Like-for-like growth2 Net Rental Income (in ‚Ç¨ Mn) 1 139 785 +45.0% +43.8%3 Shopping Centres 1 037 753 +37.7% +37.6%4 Offices & Others 34 32 +6.5% +28.0% Convention & Exhibition 68 0 n.m. n.m.

Rebasing both periods for the COVID-19 rent relief  the AREPS would have increased by +‚Ç¨0.80 per share (+18.1%).OPERATING PERFORMANCEShopping CentresLike-for-like shopping centre NRI was up +37.6%5 for the Group  and +49.7% in Continental Europe  +14.7% in the US and +34.8% in the UK. All regions benefitted from higher variable income and lower doubtful debtors as a result of better rent collection  and ongoing collection of 2021 rents. Performance in Continental Europe was also driven by the end of COVID-19 rent relief and indexation. The increase in the UK was driven by the end of COVID-19 rent relief. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 rent relief  the Group‚Äôs shopping centre like-for-like NRI growth would be +12.8%.Tenant sales6 and footfall7 continue to perform well with sales levels for the Group exceeding 2019 levels and continuing to outperform footfall  thanks to higher conversion rates and longer dwell times. Q1-2022 figures remained impacted by the restrictions in Europe  including a lockdown in The Netherlands  and severe restrictions for non-vaccinated persons in Austria and Germany. Q2 saw an improvement with footfall reaching 91% of 2019 levels for the Group  including 90% in Continental Europe  91% in the UK and 92% in the US. In total  in H1-2022  footfall in Europe reached 85% of 2019 levels and 89% in the US.In Q1-2022  the Group‚Äôs European tenant sales reached 89% of 2019 levels. During Q2  tenant sales improved significantly and reached 102%  exceeding 2019 levels earlier than expected  with all European regions except the UK and Austria above 2019 levels. Overall  H1-2022 tenant sales reached 96% of 2019 levels  with Continental Europe and the UK at 97% and 91%  respectively. The performance of the main categories as a percentage of 2019 levels was 107% for Health and Beauty  106% for Sports  96% for F&B  91% for Fashion and 85% for Entertainment.In the US  tenant sales had already reached 2019 levels during the second half of 2021  and continue to consistently outperform pre-COVID levels. H1-2022 sales came to 106% of 2019 levels  driven by the performance of our Flagship8 assets at 114%. The strong recovery in the US continued to be broad-based with almost all categories performing above 2019 levels. Entertainment remains impacted at 77% but showing improvement from 72% in Q1 to 80% in Q2.The performance seen in H1-2022 gives the Group a high degree of confidence that its Flagship destinations  which are located in the most desirable locations  with the best catchment areas and have an affluent customer base  are positioned to outperform and gain market share.Rent collection9 has improved since the full year and reached 96% for H1-2022 (vs. 88% at FY-2021 and 73% in H1-2021). It amounted to 96% in Continental Europe  97% in the UK and 94% in the US. During 2022  the Group also collected ‚Ç¨210.9 Mn10 in rents related to 2021  improving its 2021 collection rate from 88% to 92%  and leading to reversals of provisions in H1-2022 of ‚Ç¨33.4 Mn.URW signed 1 201 leases11 during H1-2022  broadly in line with H1-2021 and H1-2019. The proportion of long-term leases increased from 44% in H1-2021 to 59% in H1-2022 as conditions improved. Overall  the MGR uplift on all deals was +2.7%. For deals above 36 months MGR uplift came to +11.8% for the Group showcasing asset strength  with Continental Europe at +12.1%  the UK at +0.3% and the US at +23.1%.The Group has benefitted from strong tenant sales  as illustrated by the performance in shopping centre SBR12  which increased from ‚Ç¨28.0 Mn in H1-2021 (3.8% of NRI) to ‚Ç¨55.5 Mn in H1-2022 (5.4% of NRI). In the US  the increase in shopping centre SBR was the largest from ‚Ç¨16.0 Mn in H1-2021 (6.7% of NRI) to ‚Ç¨31.3 Mn in H1-2022 (10.7% of NRI).Vacancy for shopping centres at a Group level decreased to 6.9% at H1-2022  down from 8.9% at H1-2021 and 7.0% at FY-2021. In Continental Europe  vacancy was stable at 4.0%  despite the seasonal uptick that had been recorded during Q1. In the UK  vacancy also decreased from 10.6% at FY-2021 to 9.7% at H1-2022. In the US  the vacancy reduced to 10.4% at H1-2022 from 11.0% at FY-2021  while in Flagships13  it decreased from 9.3% to 8.3%.Commercial Partnerships income came to ‚Ç¨50.4 Mn in H1-2022  compared to ‚Ç¨24.3 Mn in H1-2021 and ‚Ç¨50.0 Mn in H1-2019. Europe amounted to ‚Ç¨25.2 Mn (vs. ‚Ç¨13.2 Mn in H1-2021 and ‚Ç¨20.1 Mn in H1-2019) and the US to ‚Ç¨25.3 Mn (vs. ‚Ç¨11.1 Mn in H1-2021 and ‚Ç¨29.9 Mn in H1-2019). The income of new Media  Brand & Data Partnerships division  which is included in the Commercial Partnerships scope and is expected to generate ‚Ç¨75 Mn (at 100%) in annual net revenues by 2024 in Europe  amounted to ‚Ç¨17.0 Mn in H1-2022.Offices & OthersNRI increased by +6.5%  primarily as a result of the delivery of the Trinity office tower and the Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse Hotel and Offices  partly offset by the disposal of Solna Centrum and Les Villages 3  4 and 6. On a like-for-like basis  it was +28.0%  with +55.9% in France thanks to leasing of Trinity  but -30.6% in the US due to the exposure to the San Francisco market where tech companies have been slower in returning to the office.Following 2022 leasing activity  Trinity is currently 74% let. During the first half  the Group also signed a 9-year lease with Arkema for 25 100 sqm in the Lightwell office regeneration project  securing a pre-letting of 80% and 85%14 of the cost of construction. Furthermore  URW signed a lease with Shell on 8 023 sqm  representing 29% of the office buildings in Westfield Hamburg to be delivered in 2024.Convention & ExhibitionRecurring NOI amounted to ‚Ç¨94.5 Mn compared to -‚Ç¨1.5 Mn in H1-2021  and ‚Ç¨80.6 Mn in H1-2018. In H1-2022  this includes a ‚Ç¨25 Mn contribution from the French State  to compensate closure periods in earlier years.In H1-2022  Viparis hosted 272 events (o/w 86 exhibitions  33 congresses and 153 corporate events) vs. 69 events at the same period in 2021. As at June 30  2022  signed and pre-booked events in Viparis venues for 2022 amounted to c. 103% of its expected 2022 rental income  and 89% of 201815 pre-bookings level for the year.DELEVERAGINGIn H1-2022  the Group continues to make deleveraging progress through disposals  control on CAPEX allocation and retaining earnings.In Europe  URW completed in 2022 the disposal of Solna Centrum (Stockholm region)  2 residential buildings at Westfield Hamburg (Hamburg)  a 45% interest in Westfield Carr√© S√©nart (Paris region)  Gera Arcaden (Gera)  Almere Centrum (Amsterdam region) and Carr√© S√©nart Shopping Parc (Paris region).Furthermore  URW‚Äôs partner in Aupark (Bratislava) exercised its call option for the acquisition of an additional 27% stake  which is expected to complete in August 2022. The Group also signed on July 21  2022  an agreement for the sale of Villeneuve 2 (Lille region)  which is expected to close in September 2022.The disposals completed or signed in 2022  amounted to ‚Ç¨1.2 Bn  representing an average NIY of 5.5% and a premium to the last unaffected appraisal of +2.9%.Upon the closing of these transactions  URW will have completed ‚Ç¨3.2 Bn  representing 80% of its ‚Ç¨4.0 Bn European disposal programme  at an average NIY of 4.9% and a premium to the last unaffected appraisal of +5.1%. A number of discussions for disposals are ongoing to secure the remainder of the European disposal programme.URW continued to streamline its US portfolio during 2022  with the sale of the Promenade development parcel in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles for a sale price of $150 Mn (at 100%  URW share 55%)  which reflected a +60% premium to the latest appraisal. The company is in active discussions on other regional assets.Given the quality and strong performance of the Group‚Äôs Flagship assets  we are confident in our ability to delever the company by executing on the radical reduction of our financial exposure to the US.The Total Investment Cost (TIC)16 of URW‚Äôs development pipeline has remained overall stable compared to December 31  2021  at ‚Ç¨3.3 Bn  mainly as a result of H1-2021 successful deliveries  offset by cost increases and the addition of the House of Fraser repurposing project at Westfield London  which will turn the building into a premium coworking space by The Ministry  including a multi-studio fitness offer  a rooftop bar and restaurant.Committed projects amount to ‚Ç¨2.5 Bn  of which ‚Ç¨1.3 Bn has already been invested. The two main projects are mixed used developments in Paris (Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse) and Hamburg (Westfield Hamburg). Following the successful pre-letting of 80% of the Lightwell office regeneration  and 85% of the construction secured  the project has now moved from the controlled to the committed pipeline.DELIVERIESIn H1-2022  the Group delivered the Westfield Topanga extension (Los Angeles region) which will open in phases and the Ga√Æt√© Montparnasse office (Paris)  representing a total of c. 30 000 sqm and a TIC of ‚Ç¨0.2 Bn. The average letting17 of these deliveries stands at 88%.In H2-2022  URW will deliver Les Ateliers Ga√Æt√©  ‚ÄúRue de la Boucle‚Äù project at Westfield Forum des Halles and Porte de Paris at Westfield Les 4 Temps  representing a total of c. 31 000 sqm and TIC of ‚Ç¨0.3 Bn. The average pre-letting18 of these projects stands at 82%.VALUATIONThe proportionate Gross Market Value (GMV) of the Group‚Äôs assets as at June 30  2022  increased by +0.9% to ‚Ç¨55.0 Bn from ‚Ç¨54.5 Bn as at December 31  2021  mainly as a result of positive FX moves (+‚Ç¨0.9 Bn)  CAPEX  acquisitions and transfers (+‚Ç¨0.4 Bn)  partly offset by disposals (-‚Ç¨0.4 Bn) and revaluation of non like-for-like assets & shares (-‚Ç¨0.2 Bn). In H1-2022  the like-for-like shopping centres valuation was slightly up for Continental Europe (+0.8%)  while the UK (-1.4%) and the US (-3.1%) were down  resulting in -0.3% for the Group overall.On the back of the slight increase in valuation  the EPRA Net Reinstatement Value per share came to ‚Ç¨163.40 as at June 30  2022  up +‚Ç¨3.80 (+2.4%) compared to December 31  2021  mainly driven by the retained recurring results and positive FX moves  partly offset by negative revaluations. The EPRA Net Disposal Value increased to ‚Ç¨152.90 on the back of the mark-to-market of the debt and financial instruments resulting from the steep increase in rates and spreads in H1-2022.FINANCINGDriven by the progress on disposals and the retained cash flow  the IFRS net financial debt decreased from ‚Ç¨22.6 Bn to ‚Ç¨22.1 Bn between December 31  2021  and June 30  2022. Pro forma for the disposals of Gera Arcaden  Almere Centrum and Carr√© S√©nart Shopping Parc  which have been cashed-in  and the signed disposals of an additional 27% interest in Aupark and Villeneuve 2  this figure will decline further to ‚Ç¨21.6 Bn. The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio decreased from 43.3% to 42.0% (45.8% including the hybrid)  and 41.5% pro-forma (45.3% including the hybrid) for the disposal already signed but not closed at June 30  2022.The Group‚Äôs average cost of debt remained stable at 2.0%  representing a blended 1.5% for EUR19 debt and 3.8% for USD and GBP debt.The Group‚Äôs average debt maturity remained roughly stable at 8.5 years. Following the operational recovery seen in H1  URW‚Äôs credit metrics have improved. The Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) stood at 4.5x (vs. 2.9x at H1-2021)  while the Funds from Operations to Net Financial Debt (FFO / NFD) ratio came to 7.5% (vs. 4.3% at H1-2021). The Net Debt to EBITDA came down from 16.6x in H1-2021 to 11.0x in H1-2022.With cash and available facilities of ‚Ç¨12.0 Bn  the Group has fully secured its refinancing needs for the 36 months. Taking into account the expected disposal proceeds of URW‚Äôs deleveraging programme  the Group‚Äôs debt is fully hedged for the coming 5 years  positioning URW well in the current rising interest rate environment.2022 GUIDANCEBased on the operational recovery achieved in H1-2022 notwithstanding a challenging macro-economic environment  the one-offs received during the period  and hedging which will limit the increase in URW‚Äôs financial expenses  the Group increases its 2022 AREPS guidance from ‚Ç¨8.20 - ‚Ç¨8.40 to at least ‚Ç¨8.90.Tenant sales exceeding 2019 levels  significant leasing demand for shopping centres and offices  and the recovery of C&E activity  all demonstrate the appeal of the Group‚Äôs assets.Given the current macro-economic environment  this updated guidance does not fully reflect the earlier than expected sales recovery experienced in Q2-2022 for Continental Europe and current level of US sales  or further improvements in rent collection. The Group also assumes no major COVID-19 or energy-related restrictions  nor major disruption to the macro-economic environment.FINANCIAL SCHEDULEThe next financial events on the Group‚Äôs calendar will be:October 26  2022: Q3 trading updateFebruary 9  2023: FY-2022 resultsFor further information  please contact:Investor RelationsMaarten Otte+33 7 63 86 88 78maarten.otte@urw.comMedia RelationsUK/Global:Cornelia Schnepf ‚Äì Finelk+44 7387 108 998Cornelia.Schnepf@finelk.euUnited States:Molly Morse ‚Äì Kekst CNC+ 1 212 521 4826molly.morse@kekstcnc.comFrance:Nathalie Feld ‚Äì Image7+33 6 30 47 18 37nfeld@image7.frAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is a dynamic global developer and operator of Flagship Destinations  with a portfolio valued at ‚Ç¨55.0 Bn as at June 30  2022  of which 87% in retail  6% in offices  5% in convention & exhibition venues and 2% in services.

Several best-selling French authors also have left Hachette.Under the plan  Bollore would sell all the Editis shares he would receive after the transaction  which would consist of a simultaneous distribution of Editis shares to Vivendi shareholders and the listing of Editis on the Euronext Paris stock exchange  it said.Bollore is Vivendi‚Äôs controlling shareholder with a 29% stake. The mass media holding company already owns 57% of Lagardere following a bid for all of the shares of the group  which is also home to flagship newspapers such as JDD and Paris Match. Vivendi has said it is ready to spend as much as 2 billion euros to acquire all of Lagardere‚Äôs shares.But Vivendi‚Äôs voting rights in Lagardere are capped at 23% until a merger approval by competition authorities.Vivendi reported that its revenue in the first half of the year was 4.87 billion euros  up 5.4% on an underlying basis from the same period a year earlier. The growth was driven by international operations at its pay-TV unit Canal Plus.Core operating profits over the period were up by 31.5% from a year earlier to 412 million euros  it said.(This story refiles to fix date of story)(Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain; editing by David Evans and Paul Simao),neutral,0.05,0.84,0.11,negative,0.01,0.05,0.94,True,English,"['French investor', 'Editis sale', 'Lagardere takeover', 'Bollore', 'Several best-selling French authors', 'mass media holding company', 'pay-TV unit Canal Plus', 'two biggest publishing groups', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'new publishing behemoth', 'The Vivendi-Lagardere tie-up', 'Core operating profits', 'Paris Match', 'European Union', 'antitrust authorities', 'independent publishers', 'famous one', 'simultaneous distribution', 'controlling shareholder', 'flagship newspapers', '2 billion euros', 'voting rights', 'merger approval', 'competition authorities', 'first half', '4.87 billion euros', 'underlying basis', 'international operations', '412 million euros', 'Mathieu Rosemain', 'David Evans', 'Paul Simao', 'same period', 'Vivendi shareholders', 'Editis shares', 'combination', 'France', 'Hachette', 'prospect', 'wave', 'criticism', 'Gallimard', 'plan', 'Bollore', 'transaction', 'listing', '29% stake', 'bid', 'JDD', 'revenue', 'year', 'growth', 'story', 'date', 'editing']",2022-07-28,2022-07-28,fxempire.com

Today  Lectra‚Äôs Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2022  which have been subject to a limited review by the Statutory Auditors.To facilitate analysis of the Group‚Äôs results  the financial statements are compared to those published in 2021 and to the 2021 pro forma financial statement (""2021 Pro forma"")  prepared by integrating the three acquisitions made in 2021 ‚Äì Gerber Technology (‚ÄúGerber‚Äù)  Neteven  and Gemini CAD Systems (‚ÄúGemini‚Äù) ‚Äì as if they had been consolidated from January 1  2021  whereas they have been consolidated since June 1  July 28 and September 27  2021 respectively.GREAT RESILIENCY IN A DEGRADED ENVIRONMENTThe first semester was significantly marked by the war in Ukraine and its consequences. As soon as the conflict began  the Company decided to cease its operations in Russia  by suspending the activity of its subsidiary Lectra Russia and stopping all deliveries of products or services. The Group's direct exposure to Ukraine and Russia is low; the contribution of these two countries in 2021 accounted for less than 1 percent of revenues.Story continuesThis war has accelerated price increases  energy shortfalls and shortages in some raw materials. However  their impact on the Group's financial statements was limited due to its low exposure to energy costs and a limited dependency on those raw materials affected the most. The Group also adjusted sale prices to compensate for the increase in its production costs  first in January and then in July.In addition  the lockdown periods had a negative impact on the amount of orders in China. They also caused delays in the delivery of CAD/CAM equipment  including a portion of that equipment manufactured in China  estimated at 2.4 million euros  which had not been recovered at the end of June; the shortfall is expected to be rectified by the end of September. Moreover  persistent problems in maritime shipping have caused shipping delays that adversely affected revenues.Finally  since the beginning of 2022  the dollar has significantly strengthened against the euro. With an average exchange rate of $1.09/‚Ç¨1 in H1  it was up 10% compared to H1 2021. This change and other currency changes mechanically increased revenues by roughly 6%. The difference between the observed exchange rates and the dollar/euro rate used to define the 2022 objectives ($1.13/‚Ç¨1) had only a +2% impact on revenues.In this environment  the Group has once again demonstrated its resiliency  with strong earnings growth.Q2 2022Q2 2022 revenues (128.9 million euros) increased by 61%. EBITDA before non-recurring items (23.7 million euros) doubled compared to Q2 2021 and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 18.4%.Income from operations before non-recurring items (16.2 million euros) was multiplied by 2.1 and net income (10.9 million euros) by 3.7  compared to 2021  which included a non-recurring charge of 3.8 million euros in respect of the acquisition of Gerber.Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 7.7 million euros (4.5 million euros in Q2 2021).Comparison to the 2021 Pro formaIn the climate of uncertainty and slowing economic growth affecting many countries  some of the Group's customers have decided to postpone their investment decisions. Furthermore  the strict lockdown measures implemented by the Chinese government  which became even stricter in late March and were only gradually lifted from the beginning of June  had a very negative impact on orders in China.Despite this context  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (55.3 million euros) increased by 4% compared to Q2 2021. The annual value of new software subscription orders amounted to 1.9 million euros  down 14%.Revenues increased by 12% compared to the 2021 Pro forma.EBITDA before non-recurring items increased by 51% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items by 4.8 percentage points.Partnership between Lectra Turkey and Glengo TeknolojiOn April 25  2021  the Company announced that Lectra Turkey had joined forces with Glengo Teknoloji (see press release issued on that date).FIRST HALF 2022H1 2022 revenues (250.8 million euros) increased by 71%. EBITDA before non-recurring items (45.2 million euros) was up 95% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 18.0%.Consolidated income from operations before non-recurring items amounted to 30.7 million euros (16.2 million euros in H1 2021)  up 90%. This includes a 5.6-million-euro charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of Gerber  Neteven and Gemini  and of the activity of Glengo Teknoloji.Net income (20.2 million euros) was multiplied by 2.3.Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 14.7 million euros (14.3 million euros in H1 2021).Comparison to the 2021 Pro formaH1 orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (107.1 million euros) were up 8% compared to the 2021 Pro forma. The annual value of new software subscription orders (4.2 million euros) increased by 33%.Despite the negative impact of the war in Ukraine and the lockdown measures in China  H1 2022 revenues increased by 11%. Revenues from perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (100.5 million euros) were up 10%  those from recurring contracts (80.2 million euros) by 11% and those from consumables and parts (70.1 million euros) by 12%.EBITDA before non-recurring items increased by 44% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items by 4.1 percentage points.Balance sheet at June 30  2022At June 30  2022  the Group had a particularly robust balance sheet  with a consolidated shareholders‚Äô equity of 437.1 million euros (400.8 million euros at December 31  2021) and a net financial debt of 13.3 million euros  consisting in financial debt of 118.5 million euros and available cash of 105.2 million euros.The working capital requirement at June 30  2022 was a negative 16.5 million euros.BUSINESS TRENDS IN 2022In its 2021 Financial Report  published February 9  2022  the Group indicated that the acquisitions made in 2021  and particularly the acquisition of Gerber  give the Group a new dimension and open new perspectives.It further explained that uncertainties persist regarding the evolution of the pandemic and its impacts on the macroeconomic environment and could continue to weigh on investment decisions by the Group‚Äôs customers. To those uncertainties have been added the consequences of the war in Ukraine and of the strict lockdown measures implemented in China.At the beginning of 2022  the Group set itself objectives of achieving  in the current fiscal year  revenues in the range of 508 to 556 million euros (+31% to +43%) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 92 to 104 million euros (+41% to +60%). These objectives were prepared on the basis of the closing exchange rates on December 31  2021  and particularly $1.13 to the euro.While the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment renders the level of order intake in the second half of the year uncertain  the order backlog at June 30 remains high and provides Lectra with good visibility regarding revenues in the coming months. Furthermore  the Group stands to benefit from the strength of the dollar against the euro  were the dollar to remain strong.In light of the above  the Group now anticipates achieving full-year 2022 revenues in the range of 514 to 534 million euros (+33% to +38%) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 95 to 102 million euros (+46% to +57%). These new scenarios were established on the basis of the actual exchange rates in H1  and the rates on June 30  2022  particularly $1.04/‚Ç¨1  for the second half of 2022.The 2021 Annual Financial Report  as well as the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for H1 2022 are available on lectra.com. Q3 and the first nine months of 2022 earnings will be published on October 25  2022.As a major player in the fashion  automotive and furniture markets  Lectra contributes to the Industry 4.0 revolution with boldness and passion by providing best-in-class technologies.The Group offers industrial intelligence solutions - software  equipment  data and services - that facilitate the digital transformation of the companies it serves.

These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ‚Äúaim‚Äù  ‚Äúambition‚Äù  ‚Äòanticipate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòbelieve‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòcould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòestimate‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòexpect‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äògoals‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòintend‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòmay‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòobjectives‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòoutlook‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòplan‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòprobably‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòproject‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòrisks‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äúschedule‚Äù  ‚Äò‚Äòseek‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòshould‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòtarget‚Äô‚Äô  ‚Äò‚Äòwill‚Äô‚Äô and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell‚Äôs products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc‚Äôs Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov ). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  July 28  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell‚Äôs net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù  which include Shell‚Äôs carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers‚Äô carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers‚Äô carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell‚Äôs ‚ÄúNet Carbon Footprint‚Äù or ‚ÄúNet Carbon Intensity‚Äù are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell‚Äôs net-Zero Emissions TargetShell‚Äôs operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell‚Äôs operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell‚Äôs operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort.

8331,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/geojunxion-nv-ticker-gojxn-formerly-060000333.html,GeoJunxion NV (ticker: GOJXN.AS) Formerly called AND International Publishers NV (AND.AS) - Business update Full Year 2021-2022,Capelle aan den IJssel  The Netherlands  28 July 2022  GeoJunxion generated positive cash flow for full year 2021-22 and delivered on guided revenue growth...,"GeoJunxion N.V.Capelle aan den IJssel  The Netherlands  28 July 2022  GeoJunxion generated positive cash flow for full year 2021-22 and delivered on guided revenue growth of 40% year-over-year  while keeping costs down compared to 2020-2021.The closure of June 2022 also represents the end of the Financial Year 2021/22 (1 July 21 ‚Äì 30 June 22) for GeoJunxion: our Location data and technology business has proven to be solid  despite the external challenging variables like the Covid-19 pandemic persisting  the unexpected extended war in Ukraine  the market volatility  the raising inflation rates and the general concerns about a potential upcoming recession. GeoJunxion performed in line with the guidance  with a revenue growth of 40% YOY.‚ÄúWe are continuously encouraged by the market interest in our new premium location aware products. Eco and Safety Alert Zones  in particular Low Emissions and School Safety geofences play a key role in our portfolio of products and services‚Äù. Most of our revenues continues to come from the Location Intelligence Services  which have attracted the attention of public and private companies in various industry sectors and resulted in an increased strength of our pipeline of opportunities for the new coming financial year 2022/23. Within the Location Intelligence Services  the Outdoor Venue Plan are getting more traction. This materialized in last mile maps for two major events in The Netherlands during Q2 2022.Our continued focus on cost control is paying off: For the full year 2021-22  operating expenses were slightly lower than last year  despite the 40% revenue growth. The increased revenue paired with cost control measures  resulted in a positive EBITDA for the accounting year 2021-22. Assisted by COVID related government measures (delayed payments of salary taxes) we also managed to generate positive cash flow during the past accounting year. This is a major accomplishment  after years of ongoing negative cash flows.Story continuesOPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATEStrategy UpdateGeoJunxion‚Äôs strategy remains solidly focused on creating ‚Äúmap agnostic‚Äù data products. Digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into  or overlaid on any commercial or open-source brand of maps. Data to be utilised in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases and in different industries and market sectors. A key role is played by smart dynamic geofences  like the Eco Alert Zones and the Safety Alert Zones. Our Location Intelligence Services continue to represent the most important source for revenue generation.GeoJunxion‚Äôs efforts are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with our customers  through the creation of recurring business models rather than one-off opportunities. Although the relationship with clients frequently starts with a proof-of-concept or a custom  one-off project  most of the Company‚Äôs development actions go into building value-added  dynamic content  requiring continuous or frequent updates to maintain and increase their value over time. This means that most of our proof-of-concept and one-off projects are a launch-pad for establishing a service or a license contract  converting the initial activities into a recurring  more predictable and sustainable business model.Moreover  when executing projects  GeoJunxion typically retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  which can be subsequently resold to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle.Our mission remains focused on improving road safety and contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions.Central to GeoJunxion‚Äôs strategy are:Cost effective sourcing  production  ingestion and aggregation of geodata.Flexible licensing models at competitive pricing.Direct delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIs.Highly customised solutions and content creation.Market DevelopmentsDespite the general situation improved significantly  COVID 19 still impacted our results. Most of the companies remains cautious in their investments delaying some scheduled activities. While clear signs of improvement were raising in some industry sectors  the conflict in Ukraine has brought other concerns and forced existing and potential customers to pay even more attention in their expenditures  given the general instability and uncertainty.At the time of publishing this report  we had no relevant material business exposure to the recent events in Ukraine. There are no active customers  or deliveries due to be received from Ukraine or Russia. We have no staff located in Ukraine or Russia. GeoJunxion‚Äôs pipeline of opportunities has limited exposure towards both countries. GeoJunxion is however exposed to raising inflation rates  as any other Company  due to increased energy and other raw material prices  which has started impacting the salary & benefit expenses of our teams.GeoJunxion continues to develop opportunities in the Automotive and Autonomous driving sector  in Transport and Logistics  Insurtech and Real Estate markets. This is done through our portfolio of geofences  which is constantly expanding and under frequent maintenance. Significant efforts have been made to expand the existing relationships with big Global Tech Companies and Public Administrations  not only through the delivery of unique data content to be utilized as geofences in a variety of use cases  but also through custom Location Intelligence Services.Within the Location Intelligence Services  GeoJunxion is experienced in building location-aware maps for indoor and outdoor settings. We combine data insights with cartographic technologies to create bespoke mapping solutions that benefit venue employees  visitors and stakeholders. In support of this  we released a dedicated e-book: ""The Potential for Location- Aware Technologies in Tracking Both People and Assets in Indoor and Outdoor Venues"". This completes a series of e-books started in the second half of last year  that touched also the Insurance and Insurtech market (e-book title: ‚ÄúCan Location Aware Content reduce Insurance claims?‚Äù) and Transport and Logistics (e-book title: ‚ÄúSolving Business-Critical Transport & Logistics challenges with Geo-Data"").In order to strengthen GeoJunxion presence in the market  our leadership team attended a few important events during the first half of 2022. We participated in investor events like VFB (Vlaamse Federatie van Beleggers) in Kinepolis  Antwerp in April. We were present in several business and technical events like: Home Delivery World Europe in Amsterdam  Intertraffic Amsterdam 2022  HAN Kennisfestival Intelligente Mobiliteit in Arnhem  NGF Datagedreven Ecosysteem in Utrecht and ASITA Annual Conference in Genoa  Italy.Business DevelopmentIn the quarter from April to June 2022  GeoJunxion continued to develop the High Alert Zones data suite. The focus has been on keeping Eco Alert Zones up to date  for passenger cars  commercial light vehicles and heavy vehicles  and launching the new School Safety Zones  as part of the Safety Alert Zones. Both Eco and Safety Zones are categorized as smart dynamic geofences.A geofence is a virtual boundary  delimiting a real-world geographical location. Such virtual boundaries can be of any size or shape: a straight line between two points  a circle around a specific geo-located center point  or a complex geometry like an intricated polygon delimiting the road-network of a city (like is case in our Eco and Safety Alert Zones).Like a physical fence  a geofence defines a separation between what is inside the virtual boundary and what is outside. A geofence can also be smart: smart geofences may change in shape  size and other characteristics (for instance active or inactive) depending on the attributes assigned to them. Geofences can be visualized on a map  visible to the users  or they can be hidden  readable only by dedicated software  providing geo-targeted push notifications and messages to end users  including security alerts. Its purpose is to allow asset and people tracking or triggering any other action or collect location data. The process of using geofences  is called geofencing  and it‚Äôs a vital part of any navigation systems  routing or route optimization application  fleet management system and more.In April 2022 the School Safety Zones have been officially launched  generating a lot of interest from our clients. School Safety Zones are specialized dynamic smart geofences (complex polygons)  with meta data such as school opening and closing times  around schools and kindergartens. The precise location of the school is the geo-localized starting point. In creating the Safety Zone around it  GeoJunxion takes in consideration the relevant infrastructure  which is used in reaching the destination. Think of bus stops  zebra crossings  walking paths and dangerous intersections  to mention a few of them.In addition to this new dataset  the Location Intelligence Services have played a primary role in the business development of the period. We continued with the diligent execution and completed the successful deliveries for all the three tailor-made Location Intelligence Services  won in Q1/2022. Thereby serving two large global Tech Companies. Two of those contracts were Proofs of Concept  perfectly aligned with GeoJunxion‚Äôs strategic focus on safety on the road and environmental sustainability. The efforts invested in such development may lead to very interesting contracts extensions and additional opportunities in the new coming financial year 2022/23.The most relevant efforts in business development during the first half of 2022 has been on the acquisition of a significant Location Intelligence contract with an important Navigation and Infotainment Systems supplier in the Automotive industry. The contract was signed at the very beginning of Q2/2022. We embraced this opportunity as a long-term partnership with clear common technical and commercial objectives and with the intent to establish a solid and fruitful long-term relationship.Our Outdoor Venue Plan and Location Intelligence Services continue receiving interest from existing and prospect customers. This interest comes from local Municipalities  engaged in their path to the digitalization of their services. Interest came also from private organizations  with the goal to improve their customers‚Äô experience. This led to the acquisition and development of two Outdoor Venue Plans during Q2/2022  for a jumping sports events and a large festival in The Netherlands (CHIO Rotterdam 2022 and Zwarte Cross 2022).During the quarter  GeoJunxion has also invested in strategic cooperations and partnerships with other Companies. The partnership between NextBillion.ai  an industry-leading spatial data and AI platform and GeoJunxion  the leading Low Emission Zones and Restricted Traffic Areas data provider is proof of that. This strategic cooperation will help to improve the effectiveness of the Low Emission Zone (LEZ) ‚Äî an initiative that is designed to protect the environment.Product DevelopmentProduct development during the last quarter of the fiscal year 2021/22 (April-June ‚Äò22) was mainly focused on the diligent execution of the Location Intelligence Services projects won in the first months of 2022. Product Development has been done in geo-location services for heavy vehicles and trucks regulations  but also for ‚Äúleisure‚Äù markets on hiking trails and walking areas.The biggest development efforts went into the Location Intelligence contract with an important Navigation and Infotainment Systems supplier in the Automotive industry. The current challenging market conditions (for the automotive market) and the introduction of new regulations (like ISA) are imposing significant changes in the strategy of most of the suppliers of infotainment systems. GeoJunxion continues to support these and other requirements.The European Commission has taken unprecedented action to help the transport sector and public authorities prepare for the mobility of tomorrow  with introduction of the General Vehicle Safety Regulation (EU) 2019/2144. The objective is to protect European citizens against traffic accidents  poor air quality and climate change. To empower them with new mobility solutions that match their changing needs and defend the competitiveness of European industry. As of 23 June 2022  the delegated act ‚ÄúTechnical requirements and test procedure for approval of intelligent speed assistance (ISA)‚Äù has been adopted. From July 2022  Intelligent speed assistance (ISA) will be mandatory for new models/types of vehicles introduced on the European market. The ISA will become mandatory for all new cars that will be sold from July 2024.Product development was dedicated to keep Eco Alert Zones dataset and related APIs  up to date. To enable an easier and more effective delivery to the clients. This authoritative and dynamic dataset perfectly fits GeoJunxion‚Äôs mission to foster safety and sustainability through location-aware content. It creates added value to B2B clients operating in the Automotive  Transport & Logistics  Real Estate  Utilities & Services markets  as well as public organizations.GeoJunxion‚Äôs Eco Alert Zones database continues to expand: It currently includes over 2.500 areas in 35 Countries. Zones can be divided in three major categories:Low Emission and Congestion Zones for passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles up to 3 5T;Low Emission and Congestion Zones for Heavy Vehicles over 3 5T;Limited Traffic Zones for all types of vehicles.The dataset is monitored daily and updated as soon as any modification in the geometry or attributes is announced by the responsible governmental authority.Regarding the bespoke Outdoor Venue Plans for CHIO Rotterdam 2022 and ZWARTE CROSS 2022:CHIO Rotterdam is the only Dutch equestrian 5 stars outdoor event and belongs to the very best international events in the world. With a 72 years history in top level showjumping and dressage  CHIO Rotterdam is also the eldest international top sports event in Rotterdam. For business  the CHIO is the place to be. Many prominent politicians and top executives visit the event every year. Together with the KLM Open and the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament  the CHIO belongs to the top 3 of hospitality events in the Netherlands (Ref: CHIO Rotterdam website).GeoJunxion is also proud to have supported the Dutch Red Cross for emergency management and response at the Zwarte Cross Festival in Lichtenvoorde (NED). GeoJunxion developed a navigable  digital map of the area with all relevant Points of Interest (POI)  such as entrances  campgrounds  stages  and the Red Cross first aid locations. On top of the Outdoor Venue Plan of the event area  GeoJunxion created a grid to help the Red Cross volunteers to identify the precise locations. In case of an emergency  the volunteers receive the grid location of the emergency  and are guided to this location on their mobile device. This way  they can easily find and navigate to the emergency location and respond quickly. ‚ÄúIn case of an emergency  every second counts! In the past  the Red Cross volunteers used a paper map. They needed to find their location and navigate manually to the place of the emergency. Now they save precious minutes in response time  which can be critical in case of emergency.‚ÄùGeoJunxion continues exploring the combination of geo-localized interactive content and virtual immersive reality to offer a unique and attractive combination of services.ORGANIZATIONGeoJunxion has received Level 2 certification on Social Entrepreneurship: the ‚ÄúPrestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen (PSO)‚Äù. This independent assessment shows that GeoJunxion offers high-quality employment to people who have difficulty accessing the labor market and collaborates with organizations that also do or strive to achieve this. With this certification  GeoJunxion provides an above-average contribution in the field of social entrepreneurship in a sustainable way. GeoJunxion is one of the first publicly listed organizations in The Netherlands with a PSO quality certification. ‚ÄúGeoJunxion has valued diversity  integration and investment in social responsibility for years. We are committed to offering our daily contribution towards a better and more sustainable work environment. Every single action count and we are conscious about that‚Äù.During the Financial Year 2021/22  GeoJunxion went through a partial reorganization. The roles ‚ÄúHead of Marketing‚Äù and ‚ÄúHead of Business Strategy & Enablement‚Äù have been made redundant. At the same time new investments have been made in the R&D and Operations departments. New resources were hired to support the projects in Location Intelligence Services  accelerate innovation in some key areas like API development  deep learning and to strengthen the data sourcing team.FINANCIAL POSITIONGeoJunxion has closed the current accounting year per 30 June 2022 with a cash balance of Euro 953K. This represents a positive cash flow over the past 12 month of Euro 131K. Based on our current outlook  the available cash on hand is estimated to be sufficient to cover our operational requirements for at least the next 12 months.EXTERNAL AUDITOR ‚Äì Status updateGeoJunxion is one of 9 actively trading companies  quoted on Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange  that have been unable to present audited financial statements  because of unavailability of a PIE/OOB licensed auditor. The proposed legislation regarding the future of the Dutch Accountancy Sector (voorstel voor de Wet toekomst accountancysector)  includes a proposed process whereby the NBA (Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants)  at the request of the company  can assign a PIE/OOB licensed auditor and determine a reasonable fee for the auditing activities. The Management Board continues to support this initiative and hopes that this proposal obtains the necessary political support to be converted into legislation in a timely way.In the meantime  we have connected with all 6 Dutch PIE/OOB licensed auditors and requested a quotation to audit our 2021-2022 annual accounts. Four company have declined to quote  one is in process of reviewing our request and one company has not responded to our request (to date).RISK MANAGEMENTRisk management is an integral managerial task. Our risk management and control procedures take into consideration the size of the company and the character of the business to identify the most significant risks which the company is exposed to. The risks identified are discussed on a periodical basis and mitigated or fully resolved  where possible. Such a system cannot provide absolute certainty that objectives will be realized. Neither can it guarantee prevention of potential cases of material mistakes  damage  fraud  or breaches of statutory laws.The 2020-21 annual report  as published in October 2021  describes the principal strategic  operational  and financial risks. The risks and uncertainties described in the annual report are relevant and are deemed incorporated and repeated by reference in this report. There were no cases of material damage  fraud or breaches of law detected since issuing the Annual Accounts.On the Social aspect  we continue to pay particular attention on preventive actions to limit exposure of our people to Covid-19  encouraging and supporting smart working from home  and establishing clear rules for those that need to be physically present in our offices. Our people are our key assets  and we do whatever we can to keep them safe and healthy.GROUP STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATIONDuring the past year the GeoJunxion group structure was significantly simplified: AND Data India Private Ltd was liquidated and the entity was removed from the corporate registry in India. The two Dutch dormant entities AND Publishers B.V. and AND Holding B.V. were liquidated  the registrations at the Chamber of Commerce (KVK) were removed. The final tax declarations were completed and accepted by the Dutch Tax authorities. The group now only contains GeoJunxion N.V. and its 100% operating entity GeoJunxion B.V.:FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS / IMPORTANT NOTICEThis document contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial position and results of GeoJunxion.

Our organic revenue growth outside China reached +43.1% in H1 2022 and +34.7% in Q2 2022. This performance has been driven by the strong growth of digital and the strong recovery of our roadside activities especially Street Furniture which was already back to pre-Covid revenue levels in H1  while Transport remained impacted by mobility restrictions  including major lockdowns in China.Digital Out Of Home (DOOH) grew strongly at +79.6% in H1 2022  +72.0% on an organic basis  to reach 30.0% of Group revenue vs 22.8% in H1 2021. Our programmatic advertising revenue more than doubled vs the same period last year through the VIOOH SSP (Supply Side Platform)  the most connected of the OOH industry  which offers DOOH inventory from JCDecaux for 17 countries now  including Brazil since June  as well as from other OOH media owners. We have concluded in July a strategic alliance including the acquisition of a majority stake  with Displayce  a leading DSP (Demand Side Platform)  that will enable us to offer a full-stack solution  from DSP to SSP  to our clients  while continuing to offer complete and direct access for advertisers and media agencies to all DOOH media by keeping Displayce independent and fully open.Story continuesBy activity  Street Furniture was strong at +37.6% organically in H1 2022 and was back to H1 2019 levels globally and above in Europe (including France and UK) and in North America; Billboard grew significantly as well at +21.9% organically in H1 2022  above 2019 in Asia-Pacific; Transport grew strongly at +27.3% reflecting the strong return of US air travel at 90% of pre-Covid level with US airport adverting revenue also at 90% of pre-Covid level  in the Middle-East with air travel at 75% of pre-covid levels  our airport advertising revenue being above 90% of pre-Covid levels  but Transport remained meaningfully impacted by mobility restrictions in China and by lower commuter traffic in public transport than pre-pandemic.All geographies grew strongly in H1 2022 except Asia-Pacific which was down single digit organically due to its Transport exposure and to local mobility restrictions especially in China in Q2.Our adjusted operating margin has significantly improved by ‚Ç¨152.2m to reach ‚Ç¨183.6 million  a +484.8% increase year-on-year reflecting a strong operating leverage due to a tight control over our cost base growing at a much slower pace than the revenue growth and despite the negative impact from the decrease of revenue in China year-on-year in Q2. Our other financial performance indicators improved accordingly. With a positive funds from operations at ‚Ç¨80.7 million from -‚Ç¨74.4 million in H1 2021 and a tight control over working capital requirements  our Free-Cash Flow improved by ‚Ç¨20.1 million. Our net debt decreased by ‚Ç¨186.4 million compared to the same period last year to ‚Ç¨976.9 million as of June 30th  2022.Recognized as best-in-class by extra-financial rating agencies  we have reaffirmed the excellence of our sustainable practices by unveiling in May our ambitious 2030 ESG Strategy. This aims to support the circular economy  promote outdoor advertising as a catalyst for ecological and social transition and work towards the decarbonisation of the economy and society.As far as Q3 is concerned  organic revenue growth rates continue to be either high single digit or double digit in most countries while in China our advertising revenue remains negatively impacted by mobility restrictions. We now expect an organic revenue growth rate at around +7% with Street Furniture revenue above the same quarter in 2019.As the most digitised global OOH company with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet and the high quality of our teams across the world  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.‚ÄùFollowing the adoptions of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014 and IFRS 16 from January 1st  2019  and in compliance with the AMF‚Äôs instructions  the operating data presented below are adjusted:to include our prorata share in companies under joint control  regarding IFRS 11 to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on our core business lease agreements (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).Please refer to the paragraph ‚ÄúAdjusted data‚Äù on page 5 of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros.

The positive variation is mainly due to the increase of the operating margin as net amortisation and provisions were relatively stable over the period.The impairment on tangible and intangible assets of +‚Ç¨3 million in H1 2022 is related to the mechanical reversal of the provisions for onerous contracts recognised from our historical impairment tests.Adjusted EBIT  after impairment charge  has improved by ‚Ç¨148.5 million from -‚Ç¨163.5 million in H1 2021 to -‚Ç¨14.9 million in H1 2022.NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (LOSS) (3)In the first half of 2022  interest expenses on IFRS 16 leases were quite stable at -‚Ç¨41.8 million compared to -‚Ç¨42.1 million in the first half of 2021  the mechanical reduction of the IFRS 16 lease liability related to the contract life progression being compensated by the additions coming from new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed.In the first half of 2022  excluding IFRS 16  other net financial income / (loss) was -‚Ç¨25.9 million compared to -‚Ç¨21.0 million in the first half of 2021  a variation of -‚Ç¨4.9 million mainly due to the financial interest expenses relating to the ‚Ç¨500 million bond placed in January 2022 and discounting charges on dismantling provision and employee benefits.EQUITY AFFILIATESIn the first half of 2022  the share of net profit from equity affiliates was ‚Ç¨7.1 million  increasing significantly compared to the same period last year (-‚Ç¨6.7 million)  reflecting the improvement in the overall operational performance of our affiliates in line with the recovery of our activitiesNET INCOME GROUP SHAREIn the first half of 2022  net income Group share before impairment charge increased by +‚Ç¨143.3 million to -‚Ç¨13.5 million compared to -‚Ç¨156.9 million in H1 2021.Taking into account the net impact from the impairment charge  net income Group share increased by ‚Ç¨142.6 million to -‚Ç¨11.7 million compared to -‚Ç¨154.4 million in H1 2021.ADJUSTED CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn the first half of 2022  adjusted net capex (acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals of assets) at ‚Ç¨122.4 million remain below H1 2019 capex by 10.4%.

The increase  mainly related to new contracts and renewals and a positive foreign exchange rates impact is partly offset by repayments occurred on the first half of 2022 as well as renegotiations and end of contracts.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.Under IFRS 16  applicable from January 1st  2019  a lease liability for contractual fixed rental payments is recognised on the balance sheet  against a right-of-use asset to be depreciated over the lease term. As regards P&L  the fixed rent expense is replaced by the depreciation of the right-of-use in EBIT  below the operating margin  and a lease interest expense on the lease liability in financial result  below EBIT. IFRS 16 has no impact on cash payments but payment of debt (principal) is booked in funds from financing activities.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group and the readability of our performance  our operating management reports used to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance continue:To integrate on proportional basis operating data of the companies under joint control and;To exclude the IFRS 16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).As regards the P&L  it concerns all aggregates down to the EBIT. As regards the cash flow statement  it concerns all aggregates down to the free cash flow.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group‚Äôs internal information  and the Group‚Äôs external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information.

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its results for the first half of 2022.Commenting on the results  Philippe Berterotti√®re  Chairman and CEO of GTT  said: ‚ÄúWith 88 orders for LNG carriers  our core business sales performance for the first half of 2022 beats our record for the whole of 2021  highlighting particularly strong momentum. Furthermore  the final investment decisions on new liquefaction plants taken in the second quarter  the expected ramp-up of LNG carrier orders from Qatar and increasing demand for LNG in Europe have confirmed the need for infrastructure and LNG carriers in the years to come.The first half is also promising for LNG as fuel  with 38 orders already placed  well above last year‚Äôs level. In addition  the growing number of mid-sized container ships in our order book is evidence of our enlarged market share in this sector.In order to meet the needs of the market  new shipyards have been marketing our technologies since the first half of the year.GTT maintains a tireless focus on R&D to meet its customers‚Äô energy transition needs and the increased requirements they face. During the first half  we obtained a number of approvals from classification bodies to develop new innovative technologies across a wide range of fields  notably for our future NEXT1 containment system and for designing a LH 2 carrier as part of our partnership with Shell.Story continuesFrom a financial perspective  revenues for the first half of 2022 were  as expected  lower than for the first half of 2021. This decline is attributable to a base effect  as the first half of 2021 still benefitted from the excellent momentum experienced in 2020  whereas the first half of 2022 didn‚Äôt get the full impact of the high order intake in 2021 and 2022. It is worth noting that revenues increased by 11.5% between Q1 and Q2 2022. Margin levels achieved in the first half of 2022 are also lower than in H1 2021  due to lower revenues  partly offset by cost reductions.As regards 2022 targets  in the second quarter the Group noted some delays in shipbuilding schedules  resulting in a postponement of revenue recognition. These delays have various reasons: supply difficulties related to sanctions  lockdowns and social movements in Asia. Given these delays  we are confirming our annual targets  but we now expect to be in the lower half of the range announced in February.Furthermore  work on projects in which the Group is involved in Russia is continuing in compliance with the applicable sanction regimes. However  given the increasing impact of international sanctions on LNG liquefaction projects in Russia  the continuation and proper execution of these contracts are exposed to risks of postponement or cancellation.However  the crisis has highlighted the global scale of gas demand  the need for European countries to achieve energy independence in respect of Russia and  more specifically  the strategic importance of maritime transport of LNG  GTT‚Äôs core business.‚ÄùBusiness activity- Record order intake for LNG carriersIn the first half of 2022  GTT booked 88 orders for LNG carriers  continuing the excellent sales momentum achieved in Q1 2022. Delivery is scheduled between Q3 2024 and Q2 2027. It should be noted that orders for projects in Qatar amounted to 24 vessels in the first half of the year.- New record for fitting LNG-powered vesselsFollowing the record number of orders received in 2021 (27 vessels)  GTT received 38 orders for LNG-powered vessels in the first half of 2022  confirming another record year in this segment. These orders were received from various Chinese and Korean shipyards on behalf of several major global ship-owners. Delivery of the vessels is scheduled between Q1 2024 and Q1 2026.- Smart Shipping: flagship contract signedGTT has signed a contract with a major player in the liquefied gas transport industry for GTT Digital to equip 30 vessels with Smart Shipping solutions. The contract includes the installation and activation of sensors  automatic data collection systems and smart software to manage and optimise the vessels‚Äô energy and environmental performance. It also provides for the regular intervention of GTT Digital experts to carry out customised data analysis and produce dedicated operational reporting.- Elogen reaches new key milestones in its developmentThree key partnerships have been signed to facilitate Elogen‚Äôs international development:Exclusive collaborative agreement with HIFraser Group to market and supply electrolysers in Australia and New Zealand for the production of green hydrogen. HIFraser will locally assemble the BOP 2 for Elogen‚Äôs electrolysers and adapt them to Australian standards and local customer requirements.Collaboration agreement between Elogen and Valmax Technology Corporation for the supply of electrolysers in South Korea. Valmax will locally assemble the BOP 2 for Elogen‚Äôs electrolysers and will work with local certification bodies  such as the Korea Gas Safety Corporation  in order to obtain approval and install the electrolysers.Non-binding letter of intent with Charbone Hydrogen Corporation (Charbone) to enter into a long-term framework supply agreement no later than November 30  2022. Under the terms of the agreement  Elogen will supply Charbone with PEM3 electrolysers for a capacity of up to 100 megawatts over a four-year period (2023-2026) for Charbone‚Äôs green hydrogen projects in North America.On July 15  2022  Elogen‚Äôs ‚Äúgigafactory‚Äù and R&D reinforcement project was selected by the European Commission to form part of the Hydrogen IPCEI4. As a reminder  the Elogen ‚Äúgigafactory‚Äù will start production in 2025 with a production capacity of 1 GW.Finally  in July  Elogen was selected by Symbio to supply an electrolyser with an initial capacity of 2.5 MW for Symbio‚Äôs new fuel cell plant. This new contract represents an important milestone for Elogen  as it highlights the company‚Äôs ability to deploy its technologies on multi-megawatt capacities for large industrial projects.Development of new technologies - GTT once again leading the way in number of patents filedIn 2021  for the third year in a row  GTT ranked first in the list of medium-sized companies filing patents published by the INPI. This ranking highlights GTT‚Äôs outstanding innovative momentum.In the first half of 2022  GTT received numerous approvals from classification bodies:In March and April 2022  GTT received several approvals in principle in the field of LNG as fuel  including from Bureau Veritas for a new LNG conversion concept for very large container ships  from ClassNK for a new design of LNG fuel tank with 2 bar gauge pressure applicable to PCTC 5 vessels as well as LNG-powered cruise ships  and lastly from DNV for an innovative design for an LNG-powered PCTC vessel.In the second quarter  GTT received further approvals in principle  including from Lloyd‚Äôs Register for its future NEXT1 containment system and from Bureau Veritas for Shear-Water  a ballast-free vessel concept for LNG bunkering and refuelling vessels.Finally  late July 2022 GTT obtained approvals in principle from DNV for the containment system of the transport of liquid hydrogen  as well as for the concept of a ‚Äúhydrogen carrier‚Äù vessel. These approvals in principle were obtained in the framework of the partnership with Shell announced early 2022 and reflect the progress of this project.Order book at June 30  2022On January 1  2022  GTT‚Äôs order book excluding LNG as fuel comprised 161 units  and subsequently changed as follows:Deliveries completed: 15 LNG carriers  4 ethane carriers  1 FLNGOrders received: 88 LNG carriersAt June 30  2022  the order book excluding LNG as fuel stood at 229 units  breaking down as follows:210 LNG carriers2 ethane carriers2 FSUs3 GBSs12 onshore storage tanksRegarding LNG as fuel  with the deliveries of two ultra-large container ships and orders for 38 container ships  the number of vessels in the order book stood at 68 units at June 30  2022.Change in consolidated revenues for the first half of 2022(in thousands of euros) H1 2021 H1 2022 Change Revenues 165 286 144 223 -12.7% New builds 153 885 130 656 -15.1% LNG carriers/VLEC 132 542 112 704 -15.0% FSUs6 5 851 10 202 +74.4% FSRUs7 6 958 - nm FLNGs8 1 460 1 218 -16.6% Onshore storage tanks 611 3 116 +410.0% GBSs9 1 719 2 292 +33.3% LNG-powered vessels 4 745 1 124 -76.3% Electrolysers 2 466 1 723 -30.1% Services 8 935 11 844 +32.6%Consolidated revenues for H1 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨144.2 million  down 12.7% versus H1 2021.New build revenues totalled ‚Ç¨130.7 million  down 15.1% versus H1 2021  when the cycle was still at its peak.

LNG as fuel royalties (‚Ç¨1.1 million) were not yet impacted by the high order intake in 2021 and 2022.First half revenues from Elogen‚Äôs electrolyser business amounted to ‚Ç¨1.7 million.First half revenues from services rose sharply  up 32.6% to ‚Ç¨11.8 million  driven by growth in digital  maintenance and intervention operations on vessels in operation and new project studies.Analysis of first half 2022 consolidated income statementSummary consolidated income statement(in thousands of euros  except earnings per share) H1 2021 H1 2022 Revenues 165 286 144 223 Operating income before depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets (EBITDA10) 96 478 79 706 EBITDA margin (on revenues  %) 58.4% 55.3% Operating income (EBIT11) 92 851 75 937 EBIT margin (on revenue  %) 56.2% 52.7% Net income 76 564 63 692 Net margin (on revenues  %) 46.3% 44.2% Net earnings per share12 (in euros) 2.07 1.73Operating income before depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets (EBITDA) amounted to ‚Ç¨79.7 million  down 17.4% versus H1 2021. The EBITDA margin on revenue evolved from 58.4% in H1 2021 to 55.3% in H1 2022. External expenses decreased by 5.9% versus H1 2021  mainly due to a 35.5% decrease in testing and research expenses. Personnel expenses rose 3.8%  mainly due to the increase in headcount in the subsidiaries.First half operating income amounted to ‚Ç¨75.9 million  down 18.2% from ‚Ç¨92.9 million in H1 2021.Net income decreased from ‚Ç¨76.6 million in H1 2021 to ‚Ç¨63.7 million in H1 2022  resulting in a reduction in the net margin from 46.3% to 44.2%.Other consolidated financial data(in thousands of euros) H1 2021 H1 2022 Capital expenditure(including acquisitions of non-current assets) (6 115) (8 340) Dividends paid (65 951) (64 553) Cash position 164 209 168 242 Change in cash (vs. 31/12) +22 466 -35 563The - ‚Ç¨35.6 million change in cash at June 30  2022 is mainly due to the temporary increase in trade receivables. At June 30  2022  the Group had a positive net cash position of ‚Ç¨168.2 million.Update on Russian exposureWork on projects in which the Group is involved in Russia is currently continuing in compliance with the applicable sanction regimes.In Russia  the Group is involved in tank design for 15 ice-breaker LNG carriers currently being built at the Zvezda Shipbuilding Complex (Zvezda)  as well as in the design of 3 GBSs currently under construction by Saren B.V.13 At July 1  2022  ‚Ç¨78 million of revenues has yet to be recognised in respect of the ice-breaker LNG carriers by 2025  including ‚Ç¨11 million in 2022  while ‚Ç¨13 million of revenues has yet to be recognised in respect of the GBSs by 2026  including ‚Ç¨3 million in 2022.Given the increasing impact of international sanctions on LNG liquefaction projects in Russia  the continuation and successful execution of these contracts are exposed to risks of postponement or cancellation. In particular  the Group notes that sanctions are affecting Russian imports of certain products and equipment used in current projects  including the Zvezda project. Furthermore  GTT was notified in July by Saren B.V. of its intention to terminate the contract between them. In this context  GTT is investigating solutions to ensure the proper implementation and integrity of its technology  in strict compliance with applicable international sanctions.As a reminder  other orders in progress in Asian shipyards for six ice-breaker LNG carriers and two FSUs14 are specifically intended for Russian Arctic projects. To date  these projects are proceeding according to plan. At July 1  2022  these orders represent for GTT a total of ‚Ç¨38 million revenues to be recognised by 2023  including ‚Ç¨17 million in 2022.Finally  eight conventional LNG carriers ordered by international ship-owners  under construction in Asian shipyards  are intended for the Arctic LNG2 project  but can operate in all types of conditions.Outlook for 2022In its 2021 annual results press release dated February 17  2022  the Group issued the following targets for 2022  assuming no significant order deferrals or cancellations:consolidated revenues between ‚Ç¨290 million and ‚Ç¨320 million consolidated EBITDA between ‚Ç¨140 million and ‚Ç¨170 million a dividend amount for the 2022 financial year at least equivalent to the 2021 dividend.Given the first half delays in some shipbuilding schedules  the Group now expects these figures to reach the lower half of the ranges of revenues and EBITDA announced in February.The crisis has also highlighted the global scale of gas demand  the need for European countries to achieve energy independence in respect of Russia and  more specifically  the strategic importance of maritime transport of LNG  GTT‚Äôs core business.In the longer term  the Group should benefit from the current strong order momentum and expects to achieve significantly higher revenues and earnings from 2023 onwards versus 2022.Interim dividendOn July 28  2022  the Board of Directors decided on the distribution of an interim dividend of ‚Ç¨1.55 per share for the 2022 financial year  to be paid in cash according to the following schedule:December 13  2022: Ex-dividend date;December 15  2022: Payment date.***First half 2022 results presentationPhilippe Berterotti√®re  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  and Virginie Aubagnac  Chief Financial Officer  will comment on GTT‚Äôs first half results and answer questions from the financial community during a webcast held  in English  on Friday  July 29  2022  at 8:30 a.m. (Paris time).This conference will be broadcast live on GTT‚Äôs website (www.gtt.fr/finance).To participate in the conference call  please dial one of the following numbers five to ten minutes before the start of the conference:France: + 33 1 70 91 87 04UK: +44 1 212 818 004USA: +1 718 705 87 96Confirmation code: 555877The presentation document will be available on the website on July 29  2022 from 8:30 a.m.Financial agendaQ3 2022 results: October 27  2022 (after close of trading)Payment of an interim dividend of ‚Ç¨1.55 per share for the 2022 financial year: December 15  2022About GTTGTT is the technological expert in membrane containment systems dedicated to the transport and storage of liquefied gases.

The electrification trends that we have highlighted during our Capital Markets Day are clearly at play and benefiting us. To reinforce Rexel even further in an environment of economic uncertainty  we started actively implementing our Power Up 2025 strategic plan. By continuously increasing digital sales  focusing on electrification trends and ESG  and concentrating our portfolio on our strengths  as we have done with two acquisitions and two divestments  we will continue to enhance our growth profile and further reinforce our resilience and our agility.‚ÄùFINANCIAL REVIEW FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30  2022First-half 2022 financial report was authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on July 27  2022. It has been subjected to a limited review by statutory auditors.The following terms: Reported EBITA  Adjusted EBITA  EBITDA  EBITDAaL  Recurring net income  Free Cash Flow and Net Debt are defined in the Glossary section of this document.Unless otherwise stated  all comments are on a constant and adjusted basis and  for sales  at same number of working days.SALESIn Q2  sales were up +26.3% year-on-year on a reported basis and up +12.0% on a constant and same-day basis.In the second-quarter  Rexel posted sales of ‚Ç¨4 705.4 million  up +26.3% on a reported basis  including:A positive currency effect of ‚Ç¨176.6 million (i.e. +4.7% of Q2 2021 sales)  mainly due to the appreciation of the US and Canadian dollars;A positive net scope effect of ‚Ç¨295.5 million (i.e. +7.9% of Q2 2021 sales)  mainly resulting from the acquisition of Mayer in the US;An almost neutral calendar effect of +0.1%.Key figures (‚Ç¨m) Q2 2022 YoY change H1 2022 YoY change Sales on a reported basis 4 705.4 +26.3% 9 082.8 +28.7% On a constant and actual-day basis +12.1% +15.3% On a constant and same-day basis +12.0% +13.9%Sales were up +12.0% a constant and same-day basis (or +12.1% on a constant and actual-day basis)  notably driven by robust volumes in North America and additional selling price increases on non-cable products in all geographies  offsetting the situation in China and a more difficult volume base effect in Europe.The same-day sales growth of +12.0% in the quarter resulted from an +0.6% rise in volumes  an increase of 9.2% in the selling price of non-cable products and 2.2% on cable products. More specifically  The non-cable contribution of 9.2% was similar to the 9.1% posted in Q1 22  thanks to additional price increases in the quarter that offset the expected lower carryover effect of circa 130bps. While the carryover effect will ease in H2 22 to converge towards zero in Q4 22  we anticipate further selling price increases in H2 22. The cable products pricing contribution stood at 2.2% in Q2 22 compared to 4.1% in Q1 22  as the copper price rose sharply in Q2 21  creating a more difficult comparable base. Based on the current copper price  we anticipate the contribution to be lower and potentially negative in H2 22.While volumes were robust in the quarter in North America  growing by +5.1%  volumes in Asia were down (23.0)% due to the lockdown in China in April/May and Europe faced the most difficult base effect as business recovered sharply post-Covid in Q2 21. Without China  group volumes would have grown by +1.7% in Q2 (vs. +0.6% reported).Our teams again showed agility to ensure business continuity in an environment that remains marked by labor and supply chain tensions (notably on products embedding electronics components)We posted further growth in digitalization in all three geographies  with digital sales now representing 25.0% of sales  up +244bps compared to Q2 2021. Trends were positive in Europe (34.9% of sales  an increase of +109 bps)  Asia-Pacific (up +25bps  now representing 4.8% of sales) and North America (16.7% of sales  an increase of +467 bps) with the strong progression in the US fueled by the transformation journey.In addition  during the quarter  we have also:Accelerated the development of our webshop search engine  customer seamless experience (Rexel Easy program) and email to EDI (Esker project started in 7 countries)Scaled up AI solutions deployment to fuel growth and performance with increased scope of sales alerts  new roll outs of assortment optimization in the US  and AI pricing in SwitzerlandIn H1 2022  Rexel posted sales of ‚Ç¨9 082.8 million  up +28.7% on a reported basis. On a constant and same-day basis  sales were up +13.9%  including a positive impact of +3.1% from the change in copper-based cable prices (vs. a positive impact of +4.6% in H1 2021) and a positive impact from non-cable copper prices of +9.2%.The +28.7% increase in sales on a reported basis included:A positive currency effect of ‚Ç¨280.9 million (i.e. +4.0% of H1 2021 sales)  mainly due to the appreciation of the US and Canadian dollars;A positive net scope effect of ‚Ç¨535.4 million (i.e. +7.6% of H1 2021 sales)  mainly resulting from the acquisition of Mayer in the US;A positive calendar effect of +1.4%.Europe (50% of Group sales): +10.4% in Q2 and +11.9% in H1  on a constant and same-day basisIn the second quarter   sales in Europe increased by +10.5% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +0.3%  or ‚Ç¨7.5 million  mainly due to the appreciation of the Swiss Franc and the British pound against the euro and a limited scope effect of (0.1)%  or ‚Ç¨(3.2) million.

While sales growth is tapering from Q1 22 due to a strong base effect  we recorded further market share gains in the quarter. Q2 22 was supported by strong demand in the industrial segment and  to a lesser extent  in the commercial end-market  offsetting lower growth in the residential market.Sales in Scandinavia (13% of the region‚Äôs sales) were up +9.3%  notably driven by commercial activity and strong demand in photovoltaic products.Benelux (11% of the region‚Äôs sales) was up +16.1%  outperforming the market  with very strong growth in EV and PV. The PV business growth was notably driven by the increase in energy prices.Sales in Germany (10% of the region‚Äôs sales) were up +15.5%  gaining further market share. Demand is accelerating very strongly in photovoltaics (above 200%) as a result of efforts to increase the country's energy independence in the context of the war in Ukraine.In the UK (8% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales were up by +8.7%  lower than in Q1 22 from a more difficult base effect  notably in the commercial business. First-half 2022 benefited until June from a contract with the Department of Education (school air filtration and CO2 equipment) contributing for 200bps in Q2 22.Sales in Switzerland (6% of the region‚Äôs sales) were up +3.6%  lower than Q1 22 on slightly lower building installation and cable business.Sales in Italy (2% of the region's sales) were up +24.4% in Q2 22  accelerating compared to Q1 22 and confirming that the recent strategic decisions are paying off.North America (42% of Group sales): +17.2% in Q2 and +19.2% in H1 on a constant and same-day basisIn the second quarter   sales in North America were up +59.8% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +11.7%  or ‚Ç¨144.8 million  due to the appreciation of the US and Canadian dollars against the euro and a positive scope effect of ‚Ç¨301.5 million  or +24.3%  from the acquisition of Mayer in the US.

The three end-markets grew at a similar pace compared to Q2 21. When compared to their pre-crisis level and looking at the different markets  growth potential is higher in the industrial market and  to a lesser extent  commercial We benefited from strong overall momentum in the Mountain Plains and Gulf Central regions  notably driven by Oil & Gas  as well as robust growth in commercial The Mayer integration is going well and performance is progressing above expectations  up +8.3%  on a more difficult base effect as Mayer recovered earlier from Covid in 2021. We are on track to achieve our upgraded synergy ambitions The backlog remains very important  up +81% year-on-year at end June yoy  representing c. 3 months of salesIn Canada (19% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales grew by +14.0% on a same-day basis  notably thanks to robust performance driven by industrial end-markets (O&G and mining specifically)  offsetting stable demand in residential. Backlog is also very strong  representing circa 4 months of sales.Asia-Pacific (8% of Group sales): (2.6)% in Q2 and +1.2% in H1 on a constant and same-day basisIn the second-quarter   sales in Asia-Pacific were up +3.3% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +7.2%  or ‚Ç¨24.3 million  due to the appreciation of all currencies against the euro and more specifically the Australian dollar and the Chinese renminbi.

Adjusted EBITA margin was up +297 bps at 8.5% of sales  benefiting from Mayer synergies (contributing for c. 65bps)  the strong momentum in sales growth and a favorable calendar effect in H1 22 (19 bps)  which will be reversed in H2 22.

Strengthening our platform is a key priority  especially important in the current environment. The five topics of this pillar are: talent culture  supplier relationships  supply chain & footprint  digital and productivity. Applied to the current environment  we are specifically focusing on resilience plans  with all countries putting increased emphasis since Q1 on headcount control  inventory quality control  credit control or mix optimizationWith the second pillar of the strategy (""Strive to be a differentiated leader"")  we will focus on five areas where we believe Rexel can have a strong competitive advantage in the short- and medium-term: data & AI  advanced services  Energy solutions transition  ESG and M&A. By doing so we will position ourselves to benefit from accelerating and more resilient macro electrification trends.ACTIVE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENTRexel announced 4 transactions to reinforce its portfolio and its local footprint in key regions. They include :Two acquisitions of quality businesses in Belgium and US  highly complementary with our existing footprint  as illustrated by the high level of expected synergiesThe disposal of Rexel's activities in two non-core countries  Spain and Portugal.The combined operations will contribute positively to our sales  earnings and Return On Capital Employed in year 1. More specifically  they will add c. ‚Ç¨75m in sales (FY 2021) on a net basis and be accretive in adjusted Ebita margin.Acquisition of Trilec in BelgiumOn July 4th  Rexel Belgium closed the acquisition of Trilec  a Belgian family-owned electrical distributor operating mostly in Flanders  with 15 branches  172 employees and a semi-automated distribution center.Trilec is a high-quality asset with a number 3 position in Belgium  and ‚Ç¨80m of sales generated in 2021. Its commercial footprint and supply chain organization are very complementary to our existing base  as reflected by the high level of targeted synergies.Acquisition of Horizon Solutions in the USOn July 7th  Rexel USA signed a definitive agreement to acquire Horizon Solutions headquartered in Rochester  New York with 10 branches and 219 employees. The Industrial automation business specialist generated sales of USD 170m in 2021.With the acquisition  Rexel USA will benefit from a strong management team with deep industry expertise and a sound culture and strengthen its presence as an Industrial automation distributor in the Northeast Region.The transaction is projected to be accretive to Rexel‚Äôs Earnings Per Share in year 1 and value-creating in year 2  fully in line with the Group‚Äôs commitment  notably thanks to targeted synergies.The transaction is expected to close in Q3 22.Disposal of Rexel in Spain & PortugalRexel has entered into a binding agreement with Sonepar for the sale of Rexel Spain and Rexel Portugal.

Cables accounted for approximately 17% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group‚Äôs sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group‚Äôs total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

The review process started in the fourth quarter of 2021 in light of the Put Option‚Äôs expiry date on 31 July 2022.Considering the independent expert report prepared by Moore Corporate Finance  which values the 2% shareholding in NN2 in a range of EUR 0 million to EUR 3.4 million  the opinion of the independent directors of the Company  questions and comments raised by certain minority shareholders and other information made available to it  the Company believes it is in its corporate benefit to exercise the Put Option. Further  the exercise of the Put Option limits the Company‚Äôs liquidity risks for the foreseeable future and avoids insolvency that would  on the basis of current projections  have arisen in the second quarter of 2023. A full summary of the background  the process followed and the summary of the analysis is made below. The Company informs that it will exercise the Put Option before the expiry on 31 July 2022.BackgroundIn October 2018  the former Nyrstar group initiated a review of its capital structure (the ""Capital Structure Review"") in response to the challenging financial and operating conditions being faced by the Nyrstar group. The Capital Structure Review identified a very substantial additional funding requirement that the Nyrstar group was unable to meet without a material reduction of the Nyrstar group's indebtedness. Consequently  the Capital Structure Review necessitated negotiations between the Nyrstar group's financial creditors that ultimately resulted in the restructuring of the Nyrstar group  which became effective on 31 July 2019 (the ‚ÄúRestructuring‚Äù). As a result of the Restructuring  Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd.  via its indirect 98% ownership of the new holding company NN2  became the ultimate parent company of the former (direct and indirect) subsidiaries of the Company (the ""Operating Group‚Äù)  with the remaining 2% stake in NN2 (and thereby the Operating Group) being owned by the Company.Story continuesThe lock-up agreement (‚ÄúLock-Up Agreement‚Äù) entered into on 14 April 2019 between  among others  the Company and representatives of its key financial creditor groups  envisaged that the Company  Trafigura Pte Ltd (‚ÄúTrafigura‚Äù) and Nyrstar Holdings Limited (""Nyrstar Holdings""  a Trafigura special-purpose vehicle incorporated  amongst other things  for the purpose of implementing the Restructuring  now known as Nyrstar Holdings Plc) would enter into a deed confirming their agreement in respect of (i) certain steps necessary for the implementation of the restructuring as envisaged in the Lock-Up Agreement and (ii) the terms of the ongoing relationship between the Company and the Trafigura group (the ""NNV-Trafigura Deed""). The NNV-Trafigura Deed was duly executed on 19 June 2019.Pursuant to the NNV-Trafigura Deed  the Company and Trafigura also agreed that Trafigura granted an option to the Company to require Nyrstar Holdings(or another Trafigura entity) to purchase the Company's entire interest in NN2. The terms of this option are set out in a separate deed  dated 25 June 2019  between the Company  Trafigura and Nyrstar Holdings (the ""Put Option Deed""). Under the terms of the Put Option Deed  the Company can put all (but not only a part) of its 2% holding in NN2 to Trafigura at a price equal to EUR 20 million (subject to any applicable mandatory regulatory conditions to the sale being satisfied). The Put Option served to give liquidity to the Company for  and enhance and crystallise the value of  an otherwise illiquid 2% minority holding in NN2  a non-listed company  in the corporate benefit of the Company. The Put Option can be exercised by the Company until 31 July 2022.Report by Independent DirectorsAs a result of Urion Holdings (Malta) Ltd  a subsidiary of Trafigura B.V.  holding 24 42% in the Company and also indirectly controlling Nyrstar Holdings  Nyrstar Holdings constitutes a related party of the Company in the meaning of IAS 24 such that article 7:97 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations (the ‚ÄúBCCA‚Äù) applies to the decision whether or not to exercise the Put Option.On 18 November 2021  the Company announced that it had appointed Moore Corporate Finance  to prepare an independent expert‚Äôs opinion (the ‚ÄúExpert Report‚Äù) for the independent directors of the Company (‚ÄúCommittee of Independent Directors‚Äù)  in the framework of article 7:97 BCCA. The independent expert‚Äôs opinion was to advise the Committee of Independent Directors in examining the benefit to the Company  taking all relevant circumstances into account  of the exercise or non-exercise of the Put Option that the Company has in relation to its (entire) 2% investment in NN2. In making its decision on whether or not to exercise the Put Option  the Committee of Independent Directors was to also duly consider any substantiated third-party bids  including of the Company‚Äôs shareholders other than Trafigura and/or of other stakeholders and third parties  that it may receive in respect of the 2% shareholding in NN2. Any such bids for the 2% shareholding in NN2 were requested to be addressed to the Company prior to 15 February 2022. As advised by the Company in the annual report and financial statements issued on 13 April 2022  via a press release on 27 May 2022 and at the annual general shareholders meeting on 28 June 2022  the Company has not received any bids.Moore Corporate Finance was asked to advise on the following:The current valuation of the Operating Group and the equity value to be assessed for the Company‚Äôs 2% equity interest in NN2. The financial consequences of (not) exercising the Put Option for the Company and possible other consequences related to such decision. Benefits and disadvantages for the Company if the Board resolves to exercise the Put Option  including considering the alternative investments that the Board could consider pursuing with the proceeds of the Put Option. In doing so  the expert was instructed to consider the financial viability of the Company over at least the next 24 months  after date of issuance of the Expert Report if it decides to not exercise the Put Option. The potential outcomes under the alternative options to the exercise of the Put Option  including the ability of the Company to sell the 2% stake in NN2 to a third party and the likely sales proceeds that the Company may be able to generate from such a sale.In preparing the Expert Report  Moore Corporate Finance has reviewed the information made available by Nyrstar and by the Operating Group to conduct the valuation of the Operating Group and was given the opportunity to request additional information and engage in a question-and-answer process with both Nyrstar and the Operating Group. In addition  Moore Corporate Finance has  among other things  reviewed certain publicly available business and historic financial information relating to the Company and the Operating Group as well as other market data to test the robustness and reasonableness of the information and projections provided by the Company and the Operating Group management. Moore Corporate Finance has confirmed that it found no indication to doubt the reliability of the information provided. The information was requested pursuant to the information rights granted to the Company by Trafigura in the framework of the Restructuring and stored in an electronic data room. The Committee of Independent Directors requested the Company‚Äôs management to facilitate this process and monitored that BDO  the Company‚Äôs statutory auditor  was duly informed early in the process and was given the opportunity to raise questions  including with Moore Corporate Finance.As part of the review process  the Company‚Äôs management assessed the amounts that would be repayable under the Company‚Äôs EUR 13.5 million Limited Recourse Loan Facility (‚ÄúLRLF‚Äù) with NN2 if the decision of the Board were to exercise the Put Option. This assessment of the repayment obligations of the LRLF was shared with Moore Corporate Finance. It is noted that there are limited recourse provisions in the LRLF which limit the Company‚Äôs obligations to make any repayments under the LRLF and NN2‚Äôs recourse to the Company  to the extent of the Company ‚Äôs net assets (as defined in the LRLF). . It has been concluded by the Company‚Äôs analysis of the LRLF that there will be no immediate repayment obligation of the EUR 9.8 million that is currently outstanding under the LRLF  nor for the foreseeable future given the current and forecast value of the Company‚Äôs net assets (as defined in the LRLF). The Company will continue to monitor the development of its net asset position to consider whether any repayment of the LRLF would be needed.Certain minority shareholders have raised questions and comments in the framework of the Put Option for Moore Corporate Finance at the occasion of the Company‚Äôs annual shareholders meeting on 28 June 2022 (see minutes on the Company‚Äôs website). The Committee of Independent Directors has considered these questions and also ensured that these questions and comments were passed to Moore Corporate Finance and/or considered by the Company‚Äôs management in the memoranda prepared by management for the Committee of Independent Directors.The Expert Report concluded that the benefits for the Company of exercising the Put Option is a degree of financial security considering that its valuation shows that the strike price of the Put Option (EUR 20 million) by far exceeds its valuation of the 2% holding in NN2 (which lies in a range of EUR 0 million to EUR 3.4 million as at 31 May 2022). This in turn limits the Company‚Äôs liquidity risks for the foreseeable future and avoids insolvency that would risk  on the basis of current projections  to arise in the second quarter of 2023. Further  based on the valuation  the exercise of the Put Option for EUR 20 million is significantly higher than the amount a third party would be likely willing to pay. The disadvantages are that the Company‚Äôs major asset will be realised and thus its activity will now consist in managing the proceeds of the Put Option and the management of the ongoing legal and other regulatory proceedings. The Expert Report lists a number of investments for the Company that are suited in such circumstances  which the Board of Directors is considering.Decision to exercise the Put OptionThe Committee of Independent Directors has considered the Expert Report  as well as the information provided by the Company‚Äôs management when evaluating the decision whether or not to exercise the Put Option as well as the comments raised by certain minority shareholders at the occasion of the latest annual shareholders meeting. On this basis  the Committee of Independent Directors has advised the Company‚Äôs board of directors on the exercise or non-exercise of the Put Option in accordance with article 7:97 of the BCCA.The key conclusions from the detailed review conducted by the Committee of Independent Directors in accordance with article 7:97 of the BCCA which were material for the decision by the Company to exercise the Put Option are summarised as follows:The valuation performed by Moore Corporate Finance shows that the fair market valuation of the Company‚Äôs 2% equity interest is in the range of EUR 0 million to EUR 3.4 million as at 31 May 2022. This valuation is substantially below the EUR 20 million exercise price of the Put Option. The amount of EUR 20 million that the Company would receive upon exercising the Put Option would thus result in a clear financial advantage to the Company compared to not exercising it. The Put Option expires on 31 July 2022. The exercise of the Put Option would result in the cancellation of NN2‚Äôs commitments under the LRLF and the requirement for repayment of certain amounts outstanding thereunder (subject to the limited recourse provisions). The net effect of any obligation to repay amounts under the LRLF would be to reduce the portion of the EUR 20 million proceeds received from the exercise of the Put Option available for use by the Company. However  the limited recourse provisions of the LRLF result in the Company not being required to pay amounts under the LRLF to the extent it would not have sufficient Company net assets (as defined in the LRLF). This allows deduction of the Company‚Äôs non-LRLF liabilities (including its contingent liabilities)  which are broadly defined. (The Company net assets are defined in the LRLF and such definition is unrelated to IFRS or Belgian GAAP rules and reporting).As long as the Company net asset position  calculated on the basis of the provisions of the LRLF  remains negative  the EUR 20 million that the Company will receive upon exercising the Put Option (and the sale completing subject to any applicable mandatory regulatory conditions being satisfied) will therefore not be required to be used towards repayment of the LRLF. However  exercising the Put Option would terminate the provision of certain ongoing operational and administrative services under the LRLF (the ‚ÄúOngoing Services‚Äù). The effect of the latter would be minimal as the Ongoing Services period also automatically expires on 31 July 2022.As a result of the limited recourse provisions in the LRLF  the exercise of the Put Option provides the Company with sufficient headroom to cover its expected near-term costs and consider appropriate use for the net proceeds In this context  however  and as noted above  the Company will continue to monitor the development of its Company Net Asset position to consider whether any repayment of the LRLF needs to be made in accordance with its terms. The consequence of exercising the Put Option (and the sale completing subject to any applicable mandatory regulatory conditions being satisfied) will result in the Company forfeiting the opportunity to receive future dividends from NN2  if any  and will result in the Company no longer having the option to dispose of the Company‚Äôs 2% equity interest in NN2 to a third party or Trafigura at a potentially higher price than the Put Option exercise price of EUR 20 million. The Company has assessed the probability of not exercising the Put Option and instead waiting until a future moment in time when the value of the Company‚Äôs 2% equity interest would exceed EUR 20 million or a third party or Trafigura would offer more. The Company considers  based on the Expert Report and lack of interest shown  including by sector players  that this seems a very unlikely hypothesis as the Company has already approached the market to learn whether there would be a possibility of any substantiated third-party bids and did not receive any bids since the announcement in its press release on 18 November 2021. Importantly  the proposition not to exercise the Put Option before it is set to expire on 31 July 2022 would likely place the Company in insolvency during H1 2023 as the Company‚Äôs liquidity forecasts  in the absence of the EUR 20 million of Put Option proceeds  show the Company becoming illiquid in Q2 2023.The opinion of the Committee of Independent Directors is therefore as follows:On the basis of the considerations set out above  including the Expert Report  the information provided [by management] in Annex 2 as well as the comments made by minority shareholders  the Committee is of the opinion that the decision to exercise the Put Option is not such as to imply a disadvantage to the Company that  in light of its current policies  would be manifestly illegitimate.Furthermore  the Committee is of the opinion that it is unlikely that the decision to exercise the Put Option would lead to disadvantages for the Company which will not be outweighed by the benefits for the Company of such decision.The Company‚Äôs statutory auditor  BDO  has reviewed the Expert Report  the report by the Committee and the minutes of the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with article 7:97 BCCA and its assessment is as follows.Based on our review  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial and accounting data reported in the advice of the committee of independent directors dated 27 July 2022 and in the minutes of the administrative body dated 27 July 2022  which justify the proposed transaction  are not consistent  in all material respects  compared to the information we have in the context of our assignment as statutory auditor of Nyrstar NV.Our assignment is solely executed for the purposes described in article 7:97 of the Code of Companies and Associations and therefore our report is not to be used for any other purpose.The Expert Report  the report by the Committee and BDO‚Äôs report are all available on the Company‚Äôs website: https://www.nyrstar.be/en/investors/results-reports-and-presentations/2022About Nyrstar NVThe Company is incorporated in Belgium and  following completion of the recapitalisation/restructuring has a 2% shareholding in the Nyrstar group.

The review process started in the fourth quarter of 2021 in light of the Put Option‚Äôs expiry date on 31 July 2022.Considering the independent expert report prepared by Moore Corporate Finance  which values the 2% shareholding in NN2 in a range of EUR 0 million to EUR 3.4 million  the opinion of the independent directors of the Company  questions and comments raised by certain minority shareholders and other information made available to it  the Company believes it is in its corporate benefit to exercise the Put Option. Further  the exercise of the Put Option limits the Company‚Äôs liquidity risks for the foreseeable future and avoids insolvency that would  on the basis of current projections  have arisen in the second quarter of 2023. A full summary of the background  the process followed and the summary of the analysis is made below. The Company informs that it will exercise the Put Option before the expiry on 31 July 2022.BackgroundIn October 2018  the former Nyrstar group initiated a review of its capital structure (the ""Capital Structure Review"") in response to the challenging financial and operating conditions being faced by the Nyrstar group. The Capital Structure Review identified a very substantial additional funding requirement that the Nyrstar group was unable to meet without a material reduction of the Nyrstar group's indebtedness. Consequently  the Capital Structure Review necessitated negotiations between the Nyrstar group's financial creditors that ultimately resulted in the restructuring of the Nyrstar group  which became effective on 31 July 2019 (the ‚ÄúRestructuring‚Äù). As a result of the Restructuring  Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd.  via its indirect 98% ownership of the new holding company NN2  became the ultimate parent company of the former (direct and indirect) subsidiaries of the Company (the ""Operating Group‚Äù)  with the remaining 2% stake in NN2 (and thereby the Operating Group) being owned by the Company.The lock-up agreement (‚ÄúLock-Up Agreement‚Äù) entered into on 14 April 2019 between  among others  the Company and representatives of its key financial creditor groups  envisaged that the Company  Trafigura Pte Ltd (‚ÄúTrafigura‚Äù) and Nyrstar Holdings Limited (""Nyrstar Holdings""  a Trafigura special-purpose vehicle incorporated  amongst other things  for the purpose of implementing the Restructuring  now known as Nyrstar Holdings Plc) would enter into a deed confirming their agreement in respect of (i) certain steps necessary for the implementation of the restructuring as envisaged in the Lock-Up Agreement and (ii) the terms of the ongoing relationship between the Company and the Trafigura group (the ""NNV-Trafigura Deed""). The NNV-Trafigura Deed was duly executed on 19 June 2019.Pursuant to the NNV-Trafigura Deed  the Company and Trafigura also agreed that Trafigura granted an option to the Company to require Nyrstar Holdings(or another Trafigura entity) to purchase the Company's entire interest in NN2. The terms of this option are set out in a separate deed  dated 25 June 2019  between the Company  Trafigura and Nyrstar Holdings (the ""Put Option Deed""). Under theterms of the Put Option Deed  the Company can put all (but not only a part) of its 2% holding in NN2 to Trafigura at a price equal to EUR 20 million (subject to any applicable mandatory regulatory conditions to the sale being satisfied). The Put Option served to give liquidity to the Company for  and enhance and crystallise the value of  an otherwise illiquid 2% minority holding in NN2  a non-listed company  in the corporate benefit of the Company. The Put Option can be exercised by the Company until 31 July 2022.Report by Independent DirectorsAs a result of Urion Holdings (Malta) Ltd  a subsidiary of Trafigura B.V.  holding 24 42% in the Company and also indirectly controlling Nyrstar Holdings  Nyrstar Holdings constitutes a related party of the Company in the meaning of IAS 24 such that article 7:97 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations (the ‚ÄúBCCA‚Äù) applies to the decision whether or not to exercise the Put Option.On 18 November 2021  the Company announced that it had appointed Moore Corporate Finance  to prepare an independent expert‚Äôs opinion (the ‚ÄúExpert Report‚Äù) for the independent directors of the Company (‚ÄúCommittee of Independent Directors‚Äù)  in the framework of article 7:97 BCCA. The independent expert‚Äôs opinion was to advise the Committee of Independent Directors in examining the benefit to the Company  taking all relevant circumstances into account  of the exercise or non-exercise of the Put Option that the Company has in relation to its (entire) 2% investment in NN2. In making its decision on whether or not to exercise the Put Option  the Committee of Independent Directors was to also duly consider any substantiated third-party bids  including of the Company‚Äôs shareholders other than Trafigura and/or of other stakeholders and third parties  that it may receive in respect of the 2% shareholding in NN2. Any such bids for the 2% shareholding in NN2 were requested to be addressed to the Company prior to 15 February 2022. As advised by the Company in the annual report and financial statements issued on 13 April 2022  via a press release on 27 May 2022 and at the annual general shareholders meeting on 28 June 2022  the Company has not received any bids.Moore Corporate Finance was asked to advise on the following:i. The current valuation of the Operating Group and the equity value to be assessed for the Company‚Äôs 2% equity interest in NN2.ii. The financial consequences of (not) exercising the Put Option for the Company and possible other consequences related to such decision.iii. Benefits and disadvantages for the Company if the Board resolves to exercise the Put Option  including considering the alternative investments that the Board could consider pursuing with the proceeds of the Put Option. In doing so  the expert was instructed to consider the financial viability of the Company over at least the next 24 months  after date of issuance of the Expert Report if it decides to not exercise the Put Option.iv. The potential outcomes under the alternative options to the exercise of the Put Option  including the ability of the Company to sell the 2% stake in NN2 to a third party and the likely sales proceeds that the Company may be able to generate from such a sale.In preparing the Expert Report  Moore Corporate Finance has reviewed the information made available by Nyrstar and by the Operating Group to conduct the valuation of the Operating Group and was given the opportunity to request additional information and engage in a question-and-answer process with both Nyrstar and the Operating Group. In addition  Moore Corporate Finance has  among other things  reviewed certain publicly available business and historic financial information relating to the Company and the Operating Group as well as other market data to test the robustness and reasonableness of the information and projections provided by the Company and the Operating Group management. Moore Corporate Finance has confirmed that it found no indication to doubt the reliability of the information provided. The information was requested pursuant to the information rights granted tothe Company by Trafigura in the framework of the Restructuring and stored in an electronic data room. The Committee of Independent Directors requested the Company‚Äôs management to facilitate this process and monitored that BDO  the Company‚Äôs statutory auditor  was duly informed early in the process and was given the opportunity to raise questions  including with Moore Corporate Finance.As part of the review process  the Company‚Äôs management assessed the amounts that would be repayable under the Company‚Äôs EUR 13.5 million Limited Recourse Loan Facility (‚ÄúLRLF‚Äù) with NN2 if the decision of the Board were to exercise the Put Option. This assessment of the repayment obligations of the LRLF was shared with Moore Corporate Finance. It is noted that there are limited recourse provisions in the LRLF which limit the Company‚Äôs obligations to make any repayments under the LRLF and NN2‚Äôs recourse to the Company  to the extent of the Company ‚Äôs net assets (as defined in the LRLF). . It has been concluded by the Company‚Äôs analysis of the LRLF that there will be no immediate repayment obligation of the EUR 9.8 million that is currently outstanding under the LRLF  nor for the foreseeable future given the current and forecast value of the Company‚Äôs net assets (as defined in the LRLF). The Company will continue to monitor the development of its net asset position to consider whether any repayment of the LRLF would be needed.Certain minority shareholders have raised questions and comments in the framework of the Put Option for Moore Corporate Finance at the occasion of the Company‚Äôs annual shareholders meeting on 28 June 2022 (see minutes on the Company‚Äôs website). The Committee of Independent Directors has considered these questions and also ensured that these questions and comments were passed to Moore Corporate Finance and/or considered by the Company‚Äôs management in the memoranda prepared by management for the Committee of Independent Directors.The Expert Report concluded that the benefits for the Company of exercising the Put Option is a degree of financial security considering that its valuation shows that the strike price of the Put Option (EUR 20 million) by far exceeds its valuation of the 2% holding in NN2 (which lies in a range of EUR 0 million to EUR 3.4 million as at 31 May 2022). This in turn limits the Company‚Äôs liquidity risks for the foreseeable future and avoids insolvency that would risk  on the basis of current projections  to arise in the second quarter of 2023. Further  based on the valuation  the exercise of the Put Option for EUR 20 million is significantly higher than the amount a third party would be likely willing to pay. The disadvantages are that the Company‚Äôs major asset will be realised and thus its activity will now consist in managing the proceeds of the Put Option and the management of the ongoing legal and other regulatory proceedings. The Expert Report lists a number of investments for the Company that are suited in such circumstances  which the Board of Directors is considering.Decision to exercise the Put OptionThe Committee of Independent Directors has considered the Expert Report  as well as the information provided by the Company‚Äôs management when evaluating the decision whether or not to exercise the Put Option as well as the comments raised by certain minority shareholders at the occasion of the latest annual shareholders meeting. On this basis  the Committee of Independent Directors has advised the Company‚Äôs board of directors on the exercise or non-exercise of the Put Option in accordance with article 7:97 of the BCCA.The key conclusions from the detailed review conducted by the Committee of Independent Directors in accordance with article 7:97 of the BCCA which were material for the decision by the Company to exercise the Put Option are summarised as follows:I.

At the same time  McPhy is pursuing its strategy to develop its pressurized alkaline electrolysis technology with an investment in capacity at its San Miniato plant  complemented by the recruitment of engineering and R&D teams in Wildau. These investments mark the Group's change of scale and increase its production capacity to meet the demand of the European market. Finally  also in the electrolyzers area  the validation of the Gigafactory project by the European Commission within the framework of the PIIEC scheme confirms the potential of low-carbon hydrogen  and is a key step in the Group's decision-making process.Story continuesOn the operational side  McPhy has started to benefit this semester from the implementation of the large-scale hydrogen projects in which it is engaged. Intrinsic performance was affected by the take back of two stations already ordered due to non-standard technical and commercial requirements for both the two customers concerned and for McPhy.This adjustment neutralizes the dynamism observed in the good progress of the last few months in the first half of the year.‚ÄùDynamic commercial activity with increased order intake2022 First-Half Revenue is stable compared to 2021 at ‚Ç¨5.2 million . This is mainly due to the repurchase of two old generation stations sold in previous years to German customers  whose related amount has been subtracted from 2022 First-Half Revenue. The buyback of this equipment was deducted from 2022 First-Half Revenue. Adjusted for this effect  revenue would be ‚Ç¨7.4 million compared with ‚Ç¨5.2 million in the first half of 2021  representing growth of 42%. This solid performance is the result of the completion of the first orders on the major projects in which McPhy is involved  while the market continues to show a wait-and-see attitude regarding the release of public funding.The supply of electrolyzers  either large capacity (McLyzer) or from the Piel range  and McFilling hydrogen stations contribute to this half-year performance and demonstrate their perfect complementarity in generating growth.The Group‚Äôs recently won tenders on large-scale projects are beginning to generate substantial revenues  which are expected to increase significantly with new orders received under the framework of these projects: R-Hynoca 2   regarding the implementation of the first hydrogen station in Strasbourg; CEOG 3   regarding the construction of the West Guyana Power Plant. It will combine photovoltaic energy and massive electricity storage  mainly in the form of hydrogen;McPhy also signed a contract at the beginning of the year with a subsidiary of Eiffage to equip a site in Belfort 4 with a 1 MW electrolyzer and a refueling station able to distribute up to 800 kg per day in order to fuel a fleet of hydrogen buses.Finally  McPhy received two first orders under the framework of its strategic partnership with Hype5  consisting in supplying: (i) two 2 MW alkaline electrolyzers whose capacity can be increased to 4MW  and (ii) two Dual Pressure stations with a capacity of 800 kg per day respectively  to be installed in the Paris region.The commercial dynamism during the first half of the year is reflected in firm orders totaling ‚Ç¨16.1 million  bringing the backlog to ‚Ç¨29.1 million at 30 June 2022  an increase of 44% compared to 31 December 2021.Recurring operating result reflecting growth investments and prudent project managementDuring the first half of the year  in order to support the expected growth of its business  the Group continued its development strategy. This resulted in an increase in current expenses due to: the development of its industrial capacities with the opening of the new station production site in Grenoble; innovation and R&D expenses in relation to the future introduction of its new range of electrolyzers and stations; the structuring of the teams and the active recruitment policy.In this environment  personnel costs increased by ‚Ç¨2.2 million year-on-year to ‚Ç¨7.9 million in the first half of 2022  reflecting the net recruitment of 32 new employees during the period. Other expenses amounted to ‚Ç¨4.4 million in the first half of 2021 and ‚Ç¨9.6 million in the first half of 2022  of which ‚Ç¨6 million were incurred to strengthen the Group's industrial and R&D teams (industrial subcontracting  recruitment costs and technical expertise).To cover a possible additional cost related to the technical warranty of its installed base of new generation electrolyzers  the Group has also made a provision of around ‚Ç¨3 million in non-recurring expenses.The recurring operating loss thus reached - ‚Ç¨19.4 million in the first half of 2022  compared with - ‚Ç¨8.3 million in the first half of 2021.Net loss for the first half of 2022 was ‚Ç¨19.7 million  compared with ‚Ç¨8.6 million for the same period in 2021.Strong cash position thanks to controlled cash consumptionAs of 30 June 2022  McPhy had a cash position of ‚Ç¨141.8 million compared to ‚Ç¨177.2 million at 31 December 2021. Cash consumption amounted to slightly more than ‚Ç¨35 million during the first half of the year  including ‚Ç¨12 million for the financial investment in the Hype Convertible Bonds subscribed under the framework of the strategic partnership with this company6. The balance of ‚Ç¨23 million is the result of the cash consumption required by the Group to finance its industrial and R&D investment policy.2022 First-Half highlights: accelerating industrial scale-up and strengthening partnershipsMcPhy finalized the consolidation of all the activities dedicated to refueling stations on its new site in the heart of Grenoble on an existing industrial building of more than 4 000 m 2 . The new site will have a production capacity seven times higher than today‚Äôs  increasing from 20 to 150 units per year  and will lead to the creation of around one hundred direct jobs at full load. This new facility completes the Group‚Äôs network of stations and strengthens its presence in Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes   one of the most dynamic regions in Europe for the development of green hydrogen solutions. It perfectly illustrates McPhy‚Äôs ambition to become a major player in the hydrogen mobility segment.At the same time  McPhy maintained its efforts to scale up the electrolyzer part of its business with a major investment bringing the production capacity to 300 MW on the San Miniato site   in order to meet the market traction while waiting for the potential commissioning of the Gigafactory. To begin with  its facilities will be based on the Wildau site for the design and engineering of very high capacity electrolysis systems (multi-MW / GW)  and on the San Miniato site for the design  production and assembly of stacks . The construction of the Gigafactory   with the addition of 1 GW  would bring the production capacity to 1.3 GW and McPhy would thus have a pan-European industrial facility unmatched by any other electrolyzer manufacturer.McPhy pursued the strengthening of its partnership ecosystem with key players such as Chart Industries  Technip Energies and TSG  which complement and confirm the quality of McPhy‚Äôs offer while providing important commercial leverage. McPhy thus participated in various tenders through joint bids  notably with Technip Energies.Continued active recruitment policy and implementation of a structured ISR policyThe Group strengthened its governance with the appointments of La√´titia Peyrat as General Counsel and Secretary to the Board  and Beno√Æt Barri√®re as Chief Technology Officer 7 .McPhy hired 32 net new employees in the first half of 2022 in a context of intensified talent hunting. At the same time  the Group developed internal mobility in order to retain its managers  while pursuing an active policy to attract young graduates to the hydrogen sector through the promotion of internships which  in most cases  lead to hiring.In terms of ISR  the Group is pursuing the implementation of a structured policy to get closer to the best standards with the aim of achieving a demanding certification by 2025.Post-closing event: validation by the European Commission of the McPhy Gigafactory project under the Hydrogen IPCEI program8The European Commission validated the electrolyzer Gigafactory project among the projects submitted by France under the framework of the Hydrogen IPCEI . This decision demonstrates the interest of the project for the hydrogen sector in France and in Europe.The final investment decision will be taken by McPhy soon  after final confirmation by the French authorities of the amount of public aid and the contractualization of the terms of the provision of this aid with Bpifrance.OutlookBased on 2022 First-Half Results  McPhy observes that the low-carbon hydrogen market is still gradually gaining momentum and anticipates a more moderate growth of its revenue for the year 2022 than initially anticipated.During the second half of the year  the Group will continue its industrial investments  notably by communicating its final decision on the construction of a Gigafactory. It also intends to maintain its active human resources policy  with a target of more than 60 net recruitments in 2022.As the market in which McPhy operates remains strong  the Group will also continue to accelerate its growth investments  in particular in R&D  which will consequently impact its profitability.AgendaAvailability of the half-yearly financial report: September 15  2022   after market closePublication of Full-Year Revenue: January 24  2023  after market closeAbout McPhy EnergySpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

No product net sales were recognized during the same period in 2021.Collaboration revenue for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $0.4 million and $2.6 million  respectively  compared to $312.2 million and $470.4 million for the same periods in 2021. The collaboration revenue for the three and six months ended June 30  2021 was primarily attributable to the recognition of the transaction price as a consequence of the termination of the collaboration agreement with Janssen  resulting in the recognition of $311 million in collaboration revenue.Other operating income for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $10.0 million  and $18.1 million  respectively  compared to $7.8 million and $28.2 million for the same periods in 2021. During the three months ended June 30  2022  the fair value of the argenx profit share in AgomAb Therapeutics NV increased by $4.3 million. The increase is a result of the extension of a Series B financing round by AgomAb for which the Company maintains a profit share in exchange for granting the license for the use of HGF-mimetic antibodies from the SIMPLE Antibody‚Ñ¢ platform.Total operating expenses for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $259.7 million and $513.9 million  respectively  compared to $224.9 million and $403.5 million for the same periods in 2021  and consists of:Cost of sales for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $5.0 million and $6.4 million  respectively. The cost of sales were recognized with respect to the sale of VYVGART during the first half of 2022. There were no cost of sales recognized in the comparable prior year periods.Research and development expenses for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $126.9 million and $278.9 million  respectively  compared to $151.6 million and $273.9 million for the same periods in 2021. The research and development expenses mainly relate to external research and development expenses and personnel expenses incurred in the clinical development of efgartigimod in various indications and the expansion of our other clinical and preclinical pipeline candidates.Selling  general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $127.8 million and $228.7 million  respectively  compared to $73.3 million and $129.6 million for the same periods in 2021. The selling  general and administrative expenses mainly relate to professional and marketing fees linked to the commercialization of VYVGART in the U.S. and Japan and personnel expenses.Exchange losses for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $46.2 million and $53.4 million  respectively  compared to exchange gains of $10.4 million and exchange loss of $18.4 million for the same periods in 2021. Exchange losses are mainly attributable to unrealized exchange rate losses on our cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets position in Euro.Income tax for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $8.2 million and $11.1 of tax income  respectively  compared to $1.7 million and $12.8 million of tax expense for the same periods in 2021. Tax income for the three months ended June 30  2022 consists of $2.7 million of income tax expense and $10.9 million of deferred tax income  compared to $3.2 million of income tax expense and $1.5 million of deferred tax income for the same period in 2021.Net loss for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $208.7 million and $435.9 million  respectively  compared to net profit of $103.6 million and $63.2 million for the same periods in 2021.Cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets totaled $2 597.4 million as of June 30  2022  compared to $2 336.7 million as of December 31  2021. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets resulted primarily from the closing of a global offering of shares  including a U.S. offering and a European private placement  which resulted in the receipt of $761.0 million in net proceeds in March 2022  partially offset by net cash flows used in operating activities.FINANCIAL GUIDANCEBased on current plans to fund anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures  argenx continues to expect its 2022 cash burn to be up to $1 billion. This will support the global VYVGART launches  clinical development of efgartigimod in 10 indications and ARGX-117 in two indications  investment in the global supply chain  and continued focus on pipeline expansion through the Immunology Innovation Program.EXPECTED 2022 FINANCIAL CALENDAROctober 27  2022: Q3 2022 financial results and business updateCONFERENCE CALL DETAILSThe half-year financial results and second quarter 2022 business update will be discussed during a conference call and webcast presentation today at 2:30 pm CEST/8:30 am ET.

This demand led to an organic net revenue growth of 8.1% in the quarter  continued strong order intake  resulting in an organic backlog growth of 5.9%  and a healthy pipeline of opportunities.Our new operating model  launched in January 2022 and focused on the Global Business Areas (GBAs): Resilience  Places and Mobility  is yielding the expected results. We are seeing increased global collaboration  and scaling and cross selling of services across the business areas  which is helping to serve our clients more efficiently and effectively. We delivered continued strong performance particularly with clients in transportation  energy & resources  and industrial manufacturing  driving margin improvement to 9.3% for the quarter  while making further investments in Digital solutions for clients  and in the attraction  retention and development of key industry talent.As we look to the remainder of the year  we are encouraged by increasing order intake from clients to support their Net Zero ambitions  the increased focus on global electric vehicle roll-out and the need for sustainable industrial manufacturing solutions  particularly in North America. In the current geopolitical reality  both public and private clients are looking to reduce their energy dependencies  leading to a growing appetite for energy transition solutions and sustainability advisory. The recently announced intended acquisition of the Canadian IBI Group will bring increased presence in the highly attractive North American market  enhances our Digital capabilities and positions us well for further acceleration of our profitable growth  all fully supporting our strategic agenda.Story continuesWe will continue to closely watch the geo-political situation as well as the economic developments and outlook. I am confident that with the accelerated demand we are experiencing combined with the pipeline of private and public sector opportunities and our financial discipline  we are on track to deliver on our strategic targets.‚ÄùKEY FIGURESin ‚Ç¨ millions Half year Second quarter Period ended 30 June 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Gross revenues 1 847 1 660 11% 968 848 14% Net revenues 1 418 1 276 11% 729 644 13% Organic growth (%)1) 6.9% 8.1% EBITDA 178 167 7% 91 83 10% EBITDA margin (%) 12.6% 13.1% 12.5% 12.9% EBITA 130 113 15% 65 57 13% EBITA margin (%) 9.2% 8.9% 8.9% 8.9% Operating EBITA2) 133 116 14% 68 58 16% Operating EBITA margin (%) 9.3% 9.1% 9.3% 9.1% Net Income 86 77 12% 44 31 40% Net Income from Ops.

Growth was very strong in the UK  North America  and Australia  with Continental Europe and Brazil contributing as well. Organic growth was slightly offset by a decline in Greater China  as a result of ongoing lockdowns. The currency impact was 7.0%  mainly driven by a strong US Dollar. The operating EBITA improved to 9.3% (Q2 2021: 9.1%)  driven by a better year-on-year performance from Places. Globally  the margin improved while we increased our investments in both Digital Solutions and People.REVIEW OF THE HALF YEAR 2022Net revenues totaled ‚Ç¨1 418 million and increased organically by 6.9%  driven by all GBAs. The currency impact was 5.9% driven by a strong US Dollar. Non-operating costs were in line with last year and driven by restructuring costs for the wind-down of our business in the Middle East. The income tax rate was 28% (Q2 2021: 21%) and was impacted by  amongst others  non-deductible expenses and non-taxable income from divestitures. Net finance expenses decreased to ‚Ç¨5.6 million (HY 2021: ‚Ç¨12.5 million)  driven by a lower net debt position. Net income from operations increased by 16% to ‚Ç¨93 million (HY 2021: ‚Ç¨80 million)  or ‚Ç¨1.04 per share (HY 2021: ‚Ç¨0.89)  driven by higher revenues  and lower interest expenses.1) Underlying growth excluding the impact of currency movements  acquisitions or footprint reductions  such as the Middle East  winddowns or divestments2) Excluding restructuring  acquisition & divestment costs3) Net income before non-recurring items (e.g. valuation changes of acquisition-related provisions  acquisition & divestment costs  expected credit loss on shareholder loans and corporate guarantees and one-off pension costs)OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTSRESILIENCE42% of net revenuesin ‚Ç¨ millions Half year Second quarter Period ended 30 June 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 589 513 14.9% 308 261 17.8% Organic growth (%)1) 7.7% 8.5% Operating EBITA 60 55 7.8% Operating EBITA margin (%) 10.1% 10.8% Backlog net revenues (millions) 842 746 Backlog organic growth (yoy)1) 5.5%Resilience showed continued solid revenue and backlog growth for the second quarter  driven by both public and private clients in North America  UK  Australia and Brazil. Client demand and performance continues to be strong in environmental restoration  e.g. caused by clients adhering to their environmental obligations and tightening regulation around PFAS. The current economic and geopolitical unrest has further driven public as well as private investments in climate adaptation  energy transition and water optimization  which was reflected in solid organic backlog growth. The margin for the half year was in line with our strategic margin target set for 2023  and driven by good performance from North America and Europe. The margin decrease versus last year was to a large extent driven by increased investments in Digital Solutions and People  as we continue to invest in attracting and retaining key industry talent to execute our growing backlog.PLACES33% of net revenuesin ‚Ç¨ millions Half year Second quarter Period ended 30 June 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 463 447 3.7% 235 228 3.1% Organic growth (%)1) 3.1% 5.1% Operating EBITA 41 30 36.0% Operating EBITA margin (%) 8.9% 6.8% Backlog net revenues (millions) 968 961 Backlog organic growth (yoy)1) 3.1%Places demonstrated good revenue growth in the second quarter in particular driven by UK  North America and Australia  further supported by good growth in Continental Europe and partially offset by COVID-19 lockdowns in China and CallisonRTKL. Key clients in Industrial Manufacturing (e.g. Life Sciences  Automotive and Technology)  Government and Energy & Resources  were main contributors to the revenue and backlog growth  as they made investments in creating sustainable manufacturing facilities  EV giga factories  energy efficient data centres or resilient public transport places. The margin improved year-on-year and was driven by strong performance  and a higher contribution from UK and North America  last year‚Äôs margin was impacted by losses on projects in Asia. We see a healthy pipeline of opportunities across a resilient client and solutions portfolio  with very strong demand and investments in EV giga factory space for support in permitting  D&E and program management  but also increasing capex investments in industrial manufacturing driving resource efficiency and productivity.MOBILITY25% of net revenuesPeriod ended 30 June 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 366 317 15.4% 187 155 20.2% Organic growth (%)1) 10.2% 11.1% Operating EBITA 35 33 6.6% Operating EBITA margin (%) 9.5% 10.3% Backlog net revenues (millions) 521 418 Backlog organic growth (yoy)1) 11.9%Revenue and backlog growth was very strong in Mobility for the first half year  particularly for public and private clients in the UK and Australia  with additional contribution from North America and Continental Europe. Highways and Rail clients increasingly looked to improve efficiency and reliability of travel with the use of digital tools to reduce disruption and congestion  ultimately lowering cost and improving quality of life. The client demand for New Mobility was also strong  with increased investments in additional capacity for EV charging infrastructure  amongst others. We experienced increased GBA cross selling as Mobility clients look for Resilience solutions  driving transport decarbonization for highways  ports  airports  and rail. The margin was very strong in UK and Australia  and slightly offset by performance in Greater China  again caused by ongoing lockdowns. The margin decrease versus last year was driven by increased investments in Digital Solutions and People  as well as the ramp up of large projects.BALANCE SHEET & CASH FLOWNet working capital as a percentage of annualized gross revenues improved to 13.3% (Q2 2021: 14.3%) and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) improved to 69 days (Q2 2021: 74 days)  resulting from disciplined working capital management. Both well within the strategic targets set for 2023. The balance sheet strengthened year-on-year  resulting in a significantly lower net debt of ‚Ç¨283 million (Q2 2021: ‚Ç¨368 million).Free cash flow was ‚Ç¨41 million during the second quarter (Q2 2021: ‚Ç¨68 million)  improved EBITDA performance versus last year was offset by cash outflow from high unbilled receivables  a result of a sharp increase in gross revenues for June 2022.STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTSOn July 18  2022  Arcadis announced the acquisition of IBI Group: a forward thinking  technology-driven design firm  which will:Accelerate Arcadis‚Äô Digital Leadership strategy with technology driven industry talent from IBI Group  and enable Arcadis to combine all of its digitally enabled client solutions and software products in a new fourth Global Business Area ‚ÄúIntelligence‚ÄùComplement and strengthen our position in North America  leveraging on the Global Key Client program and use of GECs. Our Places clients in Industrial Manufacturing  Government and Energy & Resources are key drivers of revenue and backlog growth  which will be a strong match with IBI Buildings‚Äô expertise in master planning  smart city design and structural & electrical engineering (e.g. in Automotive and Aerospace) In our Mobility GBA we see very strong demand across our client base with  for example  a critical ask for more efficient and reliable Highways and Rail solutions and public transport places. IBI Group‚Äôs solutions such as Transport Planning and -Engineering and -Management with a strong digitally-enabled solutions and state of the art Transport Information Systems are expected to improve our client proposition Our Resilience GBA will benefit from increasing further scale through IBI Group‚Äôs water and wastewater as well as its environmental services activitiesProvide a strong position in the highly attractive Canadian marketDuring the first half 2022 and as part as its ‚ÄòFocus and Scale‚Äô strategic axis  Arcadis divested its activities in Czech Republic  Slovakia  and Thailand.

First-half revenues climbed to ‚Ç¨30.5m  up 72% for the new scope(1) and 26% for the consolidated Group. Driven by technological and regulatory advances  and thanks to the visibility provided by the current geopolitical context  demand for high-performance and secure drone equipment and solutions is accelerating.During the first half of 2022  the Group generated:87% growth in revenues for microdrones (+81% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨15.4m  reflecting the deliveries of ANAFI USA microdrones to agencies & defense forces  as well as the start of ANAFI Ai sales to professionals. In a specific geopolitical context  the alignment between supply and demand for microdrones is facilitating the growing integration of its technologies on the core target markets (inspection  surveillance  mapping).29% growth in revenues from data analysis software (+21% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨15.1m  reflecting the success of Pix4D‚Äôs international deployment in a market that is expanding. The robust commercial development is continuing to be supported by Pix4Dmapper  the most widely-used drone-based photogrammetry solution  combined with the gradual ramping up of the new business solutions launched since 2020.Revenues (‚Ç¨m) H1 2022 H1 2021 Change FY 2021 A Parrot Drones 15.4 50% 8.2 34% +87% 20.9 38% B Of which  consumer products(2) 0.4 1% 2.1 9% - 6.2 11% C Pix4D 15.1 50% 11.7 48% +29% 26.2 48% D Parrot SA 0.3 1% 0.1 0% - 0.3 1% E Intragroup eliminations -0.3 -1% -0.5 -2% - -0.8 -2% F SenseFly (activity divested in October 2021) - - 4.7 19% - 7.7 14% G MicaSense (activity divested in January 2021) - - - 9% - 0.0 0% CONSOLIDATED PARROT GROUP TOTAL 30.5 100% 24.3 100% +26% 54.3 100% NEW SCOPE TOTAL (1) (=A-B+C+D+E) 30.1 99% 17.5 72% +72% 40.4 74%(1) ‚ÄúNew scope total‚Äù is a performance indicator reflecting the impact of the strategy rolled out since end-2018.

Professional drones and solutions generated 99% of these revenues  which no longer include sales for the business units (MicaSense Inc  Sensefly SA  Sensefly Inc) that were divested in 2021 and contributed ‚Ç¨4.7m in the first half of 2021. Excluding revenues from the business units divested and from consumer products  like-for-like revenues represent ‚Ç¨30.1m  compared with ‚Ç¨17.5m for the first half of 2021  up 72%. The Group estimates that around 9% of its microdrone sales are directly related to the conflict in Ukraine.The gross margin rate came to 80% for the period  compared with 73% for the first half of 2021. This increase primarily reflects a favorable mix effect for professional drone equipment and the reversal of provisions  with some linked to the clearance of old product ranges which have now been fully written down  while others were no longer applicable.For the first half of 2022  the Parrot Group‚Äôs consolidated operating expenditure totaled ‚Ç¨36.4m  compared with ‚Ç¨37.0m for the same period in 2021. ‚Ç¨0.4m was recorded in 2021 for economic support measures during the health crisis  but this was not recorded in 2022. The disposals are reflected in a ‚Ç¨5.4m reduction in operating expenditure  with the majority reallocated to the Group‚Äôs R&D  notably following on from the CHF 10m capital increase carried out in February 2022 to support Pix4D. As a result  R&D spending is stable at ‚Ç¨20.8m for the first half of this year compared with the same period in 2021. For its next innovation phase  the Group is harnessing artificial intelligence and extended connectivity to automate missions and processes for all types of sites or infrastructures.The reduction (-27%) in sales and marketing spending  which came to ‚Ç¨5.6m  compared with ‚Ç¨7.7m for the first half of 2021  mainly reflects the impact of the disposals combined with the effective management of BtoB marketing budgets.Production and quality spending is virtually stable (-3%)  highlighting the good management of procurement and supplies. Against the backdrop of significant health constraints in China and disruption affecting the components market  Parrot is maintaining its agile approach and increasing the resources allocated to production management.The increase in administrative costs and overheads (+26%) for the first half of 2022 primarily reflects non-recurring impacts that reduced the figure for 2021 (reversal of provisions for disputes) and led to an increase in 2022 (recruitments  employee-related provisions recorded).At end-June 2022  income from ordinary operations shows an improvement of ‚Ç¨7.0m  with a first-half current operating loss of -‚Ç¨12.1m  versus -‚Ç¨19.2m at end-June 2021. The Group‚Äôs workforce (permanent and fixed-term contracts) represented 514 people (448 at December 31  2021 and 547 at June 30  2021)  in addition to 63 external contractors (49 at December 31  2021 and 50 at June 30  2021). 56 people joined the Group during the first half of 2022  with 34 focused on R&D.The non-recurring operating expenses of -‚Ç¨4.2m concern the impacts of the divestments. On the one hand  a capital loss on the sale of the AgEagle Systems Inc shares received as payment for the equivalent of $3m corresponding to part of Sensefly‚Äôs sale. These shares were sold in March for a total of ‚Ç¨1.8m on the NYSE American market  generating a capital loss of ‚Ç¨1.2 m. On the other hand  negotiations launched with the buyer in June were completed on July 22 and recognized in the accounts at June 30. They concern the early payment and the securing of the remaining sums payable in 2022 and 2023  representing approximately $7.5m. A payment of $3.7 million is now expected in the next few days  the difference of $3.7 million provisioned at June 30  2022. As a reminder  in June 2021  ‚Ç¨16.2m of non-recurring operating income linked to the sale of Micasense at the start of 2021 was recorded in the accounts. End of June 2022 EBIT therefore came to -‚Ç¨16.3m.After ‚Ç¨3.1m of financial income and expenses and a -‚Ç¨0.9m share of income from associates  consolidated net income (Group share) came to -‚Ç¨14.1m for the first half of 2022.Changes in the cash position and balance sheet at June 30  2022The Group had ‚Ç¨70.0m of net cash at June 30  2022  compared with ‚Ç¨82.0m at end-December 2021  excluding the impact of IFRS 16. Cash and cash equivalents totaled ‚Ç¨70.0m  with ‚Ç¨12.8m consumption during the first six months of 2022.Cash flow from operations came to -‚Ç¨9.3m (versus -‚Ç¨18.4m at end-June 2021). The loss for the period includes the reversal of provisions  the capital loss on the sale of the AgEagle Aerial Systems shares  and the IFRS 2 costs for the Group‚Äôs various stock option and bonus share plans. Factoring in the -‚Ç¨4.8m change in working capital requirements  cash from operating activities totaled -‚Ç¨14.1m  compared with -‚Ç¨22.9m at end-June 2021.The change in working capital requirements reflects the following developments: (i) a +‚Ç¨1.9m impact linked to a reclassification of ‚Ç¨3.2m of tax receivables allocated against various liabilities for a similar amount (VAT) and offsetting an increase in trade receivables for ‚Ç¨1.7m  (ii) a -‚Ç¨3.9m change in trade and other payables  resulting from the decrease in advances and deposits received on orders  tax and employee-related liabilities  and prepaid income  and (iii) a -‚Ç¨2.7m change in inventories  linked to the ramping up of professional microdrone sales (finished products and components). With net inventories raised to ‚Ç¨8.1m at June 30  2022  versus ‚Ç¨4.9m at December 31  2021  Parrot is ramping up the production of its microdrones with its subcontractors in the United States and Asia.Cash flow from investment activities came to ‚Ç¨3.5m  linked primarily to the payment instalments received on the sales of SenseFly and Micasense during the first half of 2022. These amounts  which totaled ‚Ç¨4.8m  offset the operating investments for -‚Ç¨1.2m.Cash flow from financing activities came to -‚Ç¨3.5m  with -‚Ç¨1.5m of IFRS 16 costs  as well as -‚Ç¨1.6m of costs linked to the unwinding of a stock option plan concerning Pix4D.In terms of the balance sheet  the application of IFRS 5 (Assets Held for Sale for ‚Ç¨1.8m) concerns a proposed operation to sell the interest in Planck Aerosystems Inc  which is consolidated on an equity basis and was 47.2% owned by Parrot at end-June 2022. The valuation of this interest has led to a -‚Ç¨1.0m impairment in goodwill  recognized in ‚ÄúShare of profit of companies accounted for by the equity method‚Äù on the income statement. This item has no cash impact.Outlook for 2022Realigned  streamlined and driven by professional solutions at the forefront of innovation  Parrot is looking ahead to 2022 with confidence in its strategy and vigilance concerning the changes in the international environment. During the second half of this year  the deliveries for orders received from NATO countries defense forces will generate a further acceleration in growth.The Group is continuing to allocate its resources to an ambitious R&D roadmap. Supported by its advances in the field of artificial intelligence and the growing integration between hardware and software  Parrot aims to continue facilitating the adoption of drone technologies and offer new use cases that are aligned with the needs of professionals  businesses and institutions  focused on (i) 3D Mapping  Geomatics and Inspection  (ii) Defense and Security  and (iii) Precision Farming.To secure its production capacity over the medium and long term  and respond to the growing interest in its microdrones at the start of this year  Parrot is further strengthening its synergies between R&D  procurement and production tracking. The increase in the resources allocated to these operations will be combined with an agile sourcing management approach. These transformational initiatives are limiting the reduction of costs in 2022  and their efficiency and effectiveness are still strongly correlated with changes in the health context in China  where the situation has deteriorated at the start of this year.Looking beyond the disruption linked to the economic and geopolitical environment  which is difficult to predict  the Group plans to move forward with its roadmap for revenue growth on its ‚Äúnew scope‚Äù and capitalize on the opportunities opened up by the growing adoption of drone technologies in businesses and the public sector. The Group will continue to closely monitor the allocation of its cash  and will be ready to respond and adapt to potential changes in the conditions.Next financial dates2022 third-quarter business: Thursday November 17  2022ABOUT PARROTFounded in 1994 by Henri Seydoux  Parrot is today the leading European drone manufacturer in this rapidly expanding market.Visionary  at the forefront of innovation Parrot has a complementary range of equipment and software adapted to the needs of companies  large groups and government organizations.

Khurshid will become the chairman of the company‚Äôs board  and current chair Roy McGregor remains as a director at the firm.Bednall served as a managing director at BlackRock from 2000 to 2013  according to his LinkedIn profile. There  he was co-head of the iShares product team responsible for new exchange-traded product (ETP) development and management in Europe  the Middle East and Africa.More recently  Bednall led FinEx Capital Management‚Äôs ETF business  including portfolio management  capital markets  operations and product development.The Jacobi Bitcoin ETF  the first such product in Europe  is set to launch on Euronext Amsterdam next month with a 1.5% annual management fee  and Bednall will help the firm expand its crypto fund slate.Bednall called ETFs the ‚Äúgo-to structure‚Äù for investors  arguing that they are superior to the exchange-traded notes (ETNs) currently on the European market.While ETNs are debt instruments that are typically collateralized by the underlying exposure  such as bitcoin  he told Blockworks  Jacobi‚Äôs ETF was approved by a regulator and holds bitcoin directly.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bringing the digital exposures but doing it in a way that investors are very comfortable with ‚Äù Bednall said. ‚ÄúIf you put the time and the effort in  you get a better product  and that‚Äôs what Jacobi has.‚ÄùRegulatory process and future productsJacobi‚Äôs upcoming bitcoin ETF product had received regulatory approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission last October  but it took months for the firm to find a place to list it.Christopher Jehan  head of fund architecture and former chair of the Guernsey Investment & Funds Association  helped the bitcoin ETF meet regulatory standards. Several exchanges in the region ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have the appetite‚Äù for the ETF  he told Blockworks.‚ÄúBeing the first thing of a kind  it is satisfying but it is always significantly more work and a lot more handholding than taking the well-traveled path ‚Äù Jehan added.Jehan said he expects launching more crypto products will be a more ‚Äústreamlined‚Äù process going forward. Executives noted that the company could seek to launch additional single-asset crypto funds  such as one that owns ether  as well as crypto basket products and funds that holds crypto alongside non-crypto assets  such as traditional commodities.‚ÄúAlready there has been discussion going on about potential funds two  three  four and five ‚Äù Jehan said. ‚ÄúHave we got an absolute sense of direction yet? No.‚ÄùBednall added that investors are expressing interest in yield products.‚ÄúWe have to be very wary of that  as we know there have been issues in the market around stablecoins ‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúSo when we look at that  we‚Äôll need to design it so there‚Äôs a lot of investor protection.‚ÄùWho will emerge as competitors?Bednall called this a pivotal time for digital assets  noting that many interested institutional investors have been on the sidelines seeking the best way into the space.‚Äú[This] is going to be the product that many of the institutional investors have been waiting for ‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt then gives them that first taste  that first access and then builds their comfort around investing in digital assets.‚ÄùWhile Bednall expects smaller  nimble companies to launch similar crypto ETFs  he said BlackRock  for example  ‚Äî the world‚Äôs largest asset manager ‚Äî is likely ‚Äúmany years away‚Äù from doing so.BlackRock added the iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF (IBLC) to its megatrends product suite  but has declined to comment on whether it would seek to launch products that hold cryptoassets directly.‚ÄúThere are a lot of competing voices within those institutions where many will be wary  some people will be totally against it and then you‚Äôll have people that want to do it ‚Äù Bednall said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre slow-moving organizations and the bureaucracy doesn‚Äôt allow them to come into something like this at this stage.‚ÄùAttend DAS  the industry‚Äôs favorite institutional crypto conference.

The statutory auditors conducted an interim review of these half-year financial statements.Record H1 results‚Ç¨m - IFRS H1 2021 H1 2022 Change Revenue 50.8 63.3 +25 % Gross margin 27.8 33.5 +21 % % of revenue 54.7 % 52.9 %Operating expenses 25.9 29.3 +13 % EBITDA1 9.4 10.8 +15 % % of revenue 18.4 % 17.0 %Current operating income 1.9 4.1 +117 % Operating income/(loss) 1.8 4.2 +129 % Consolidated net income/(loss) 1.6 5.2 +225 % % of revenue 3.2 % 8.2 %1EBITDA (Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) corresponds to current operating income restated for (i) amortization  depreciation and provisions  and (ii) income and expenses relating to share-based payments.Record half-year revenue with 25% growthAt the end of the first half of 2022  Ekinops' consolidated revenue stood at ‚Ç¨63.3 million versus ‚Ç¨50.8 million in the previous year  representing robust growth of 25%. At constant scope and exchange rates  half-year growth was 20%.This trend is the result of solid momentum in all the Group's activities: +31% for optical transport equipment  +21% for Access solutions and +47% for software and services  which now represent 15% of the group's revenue as a result of the success of SDN (Software Defined Networks) and virtualization solutions.In geographic terms  half-year sales grew significantly by 48% in North America (33% in USD)  reaching 20% of the group's business for the first time. Asia-Pacific continued on the growth trajectory that began in H2 2021 with a very sustained 80% increase in half-year sales. Sales in EMEA  in which 38% of the group's activity is generated  grew 6% compared with the same period in the previous year. After a first quarter in which activity in France remained virtually stable  the group's sales returned to steady growth of 29% in the semester.Gross margin of 52.9%  within the target range  despite the components crisisAs a result of the very strong sales momentum over the semester and the increase in the share of software and services in the business mix  gross margin for the period was ‚Ç¨33.5 million  up 21% from the same period a year earlier.Gross margin thus represented 52.9% of consolidated revenue in H1 2022. This figure is in line with the group's targets and is within the long-term target range (52%-56%)  despite the components crisis  which is continuing in 2022.EBITDA margin of 17.0% in H1 2022  towards the top of the target rangeAs of June 30  2022  H1 EBITDA was ‚Ç¨10.8 million versus ‚Ç¨9.4 million in H1 2021  with a contained increase in operating expenses (13%).

The current operating margin was 6.5% of revenue  versus 3.7% in H1 2021.

Net sales recorded the acceleration of the profitable shift of product sales towards marketplace sales  which are only recognized for the amount of the associated commissions.Gross margin was ‚Ç¨201.0m in the 1st half 2022  representing 22.8% of net sales  a slight decrease of -0.4 point compared to 2021 but a significant increase of +5.3 pts compared to pre-pandemic level (1st half of 2019). This gross margin increase over the past three years demonstrates the success of the implementation of the strategic plan  with a marketplace growing +19% compared to the 1st half of 2019 and advertising services nearly doubling in revenues vs. the same pre-pandemic level. Compared to 2021  Cnova accelerated its shift towards the marketplace with direct sales margin negatively impacted by increase in transportation costs and destocking initiatives in a context of Efficiency Plan to optimize working capital needs and inventory levels to current level of activity. Despite those underlying drivers  dynamic advertising services helped maintaining a relatively flat gross margin compared to 2021.SG&A costs amounted to ‚Ç¨(184.4)m in the 1st half 2022  representing 20.9% of net sales  a -2.5 points decrease y-o-y. During the 2nd quarter  an efficiency plan to recalibrate cost structure to current level of activity was launched with first significant positive impact expected in the 2nd half and full run-rate impact in 2023. Fulfillment costs  at 7.1% of net sales (+0.2 point)  decreasing by ‚Ç¨7m compared to the same period of last year as this cost line was favorably impacted by lower volume in H1 for its variable part (logistics  after sales and payment processing) and first benefits from the Efficiency Plan for its fixed part. Marketing costs represented 5.9% of net sales (+0.8 point)  stable in value with lower volume driving down marketing variable costs offset by a media campaign over the months of May and June. Technology & Content costs increased at 5.1% of net sales (+1.1 point) mainly impacted by the acceleration of the product & commercial development of Octopia‚Äôs solutions. General & Administrative expenses decreased in value as head office costs increase to support the acceleration of the new B2B activities was compensated by first quick wins from the Efficiency Plan. SG&A savings from the Efficiency Plan are not material yet but will generate  together with CAPEX savings  significant cost reductions of more than ‚Ç¨30m in the 2nd half of 2022 and ‚Ç¨75m in 2023 on a full-year basis.As a result  1st half EBITDA decreased to +‚Ç¨17m compared to last year  representing 1.9% of net sales (-2.9 point vs. 2020). In a context of significant market headwinds  EBITDA benefited from a resilient marketplace performance and increased revenues from advertising services while destocking initiatives negatively impacted Direct Sales gross margin.Operating EBIT decreased to -‚Ç¨32m  with depreciation and amortization increasing by ‚Ç¨6m y-o-y (5.5% of net sales  +1.3 pt vs. 1H21) mainly due to accelerated investments in relation to Octopia over the past 12 months.Net financial expenses ‚Äì mainly related to 4-installment payment solutions offered to customers ‚Äì amounted to ‚Ç¨42m  a significant increase compared to last year as a result of an increase in 4x payment take rate in GMV since the 2nd half of 2021 and higher refinancing interest rates.As part of the Efficiency Plan  4-installment payment share of GMV and its associated cost of risk are being optimized with positive results expected in the coming months with the full-year impact expected in 2023.Net loss amounted to ‚Ç¨(70)m  an important decrease compared to last year level. 1H21 result was favorably impacted by exceptional circumstances in a pandemic context while 1H22 was heavily impacted by low demand and high inflation headwinds at EBITDA level and cost of risks increase at financial results level.Free cash flow figures(‚Ç¨ millions)Half-yearJune 2022Half-yearJune 2021Changevs. 2021EBITDA 16.8 48.9 -65.6% (-) non-recurring items -6.3 -2.9 x2.2 (-) rents -17.7 -16.5 +7.3% Cash from continuing operations  incl. rents -7.2 29.5 -36.7 Net CAPEX (incl.

In Q2 2022  activity recovered to levels close to  if not above  the 2019 levels in almost all of our geogra‚Ä¶,"Q2 REVPAR ABOVE 2019 LEVEL SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOW GENERATIONREVENUE UP 109% TO ‚Ç¨1 725 MILLION (+97% LFL) EBITDA POSITIVE AT ‚Ç¨205 MILLION NET PROFIT GROUP SHARE POSITIVE AT ‚Ç¨32 MILLIONS√©bastien Bazin  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Accor  said: ‚ÄúOnce again this quarter  Accor reported a very strong growth in business  exceeding pre-crisis levels for the first time. This marked rebound in all regions and for all of our brands. The summer will confirm these trends and the fall promises to be strong with the recovery of major seminars and conventions. Nevertheless  the Group remains attentive to the evolution of the geopolitical and economic environment. At this stage  the Group should report a strong growth in EBITDA  with a target of more than ‚Ç¨550 million for the full-year 2022‚Äù.The Group‚Äôs business rebounded significantly in H1 2022 after two years of major pandemic-related disruptions in the tourism and hospitality industry. In Q2 2022  activity recovered to levels close to  if not above  the 2019 levels in almost all of our geographies. The only laggards were China  which is impacted by travel restrictions as part of its strict enforcement of a ‚Äúzero-Covid‚Äù policy  and South East Asia  which is highly dependent on Chinese visitors.This rebound reflects both the recovery of the number of business and leisure domestic guests  and border reopenings which accelerated the return of international travelers. It was accompanied by a sharp increase in prices  driven by demand and emphasized by inflation.During first-half 2022  Accor opened 85 hotels  representing 11 700 rooms  i.e.  net system growth of 1.8% in the last 12 months. At end-June 2022  the Group had a hotel portfolio of 777 945 rooms (5 300 hotels) and a pipeline of 212 000 rooms (1 215 hotels).For 2022  the Group is confirming its forecast of net unit growth in the network of around 3.5%.Consolidated revenueThe Group reported H1 2022 revenue of ‚Ç¨1 725 million  up 97% like-for-like compared with H1 2021. By activity  this growth breaks down into a 119% increase for HotelServices and 57% for Hotel Assets & Other. To provide a comparison with RevPAR (change presented versus 2019 throughout this release)  the like-for-like decline in revenue versus H1 2019 is 10%.Changes in the consolidation scope  mainly due to the consolidation of Ennismore  and the reopening of Pullman Montparnasse contributed positively by ‚Ç¨31 million.Currency effects had a positive impact of ‚Ç¨69 million  mainly due to the US dollar ((9)%).Source: AccorHotelServices revenueHotelServices  which includes fees from Management & Franchise (M&F) and Services to Owners  reported ‚Ç¨1 276 million in revenue  up 119% like-for-like versus H1 2021 (down 12% like-for-like versus H1 2019). This increase reflects the significant recovery seen in the first half of the year.Revenue in Management & Franchise (M&F) stood at ‚Ç¨434 million  up 153% like-for-like versus H1 2021 (down 15% like-for-like versus H1 2019)  with regional performances correlated to the business recovery in the considered countries. In general  the slightly sharper decline in M&F revenue compared with RevPAR (down 11% in H1 2022 versus H1 2019) can be attributed to the decrease in incentive fees based on the hotel operating margin generated from management contracts.Source: AccorConsolidated RevPAR was down 11% overall in H1 2022 versus H1 2019 and up 1% in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2019. These figures reflect a month-after-month sequential improvement in business with a sharp increase in prices  driven by demand and emphasized by inflation. Therefore  activity reached levels close to  or even higher than 2019 levels in almost all of our regions in the second quarter.In Q2 2022  RevPAR in South Europe was 2% above the Q2 2019 level.In France   Q2 2022 RevPAR was 3% above the Q2 2019 level. The recovery of international travelers helped Paris to close the gap with province  both now above 2019 level in Q2. Prices were higher than those of the same period in 2019  with a favorable combination of public events in May (UEFA Champions League Final  Roland-Garros Tournament ‚Ä¶).

In Spain  RevPAR was up 2% in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2019.In Q2 2022  RevPAR in North Europe was down 7% versus Q2 2019  but business improved sequentially month after month.In the United Kingdom   the strength of the recovery was comparable to that seen in France. Both London and the province recovered to RevPAR levels above those of Q2 2019.  the strength of the recovery was comparable to that seen in France. Both London and the province recovered to RevPAR levels above those of Q2 2019. In Germany  which took longer to lift its health restrictions related to the Covid crisis  business recovered at a slower pace. Nevertheless  in June  the country‚Äôs RevPAR performance came close to the levels recorded in neighboring countries.RevPAR continued to improve sequentially in Asia-Pacific (+25 percentage points between Q1 2022 and Q2 2022). It was down 18% in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2019.Pacific confirmed the recovery already seen in Q1 2022 and ended the second quarter up 9% versus Q2 2019.

However  the restrictions implemented as part of the strict enforcement of its ‚Äúzero-Covid‚Äù policy adversely affected its performance and resulted in a 38% decline in RevPAR versus Q2 2019. In South East Asia  RevPAR was down 31% in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2019. Although the main travel restrictions have been lifted  the region‚Äôs dependence on Chinese visitors had an adverse impact on the recovery speed.In the India  Middle East  Africa & Turkey region  the rebound in RevPAR  which exceeded 2019 level (+32% in Q2 2022)  was confirmed for a third consecutive quarter.The United Arab Emirates continued to outperform after a strong Q1 boosted by the world Expo 2020.continued to outperform after a strong Q1 boosted by the world Expo 2020. In Saudi Arabia  the broader reopening of the holy cities for pilgrimages has led to a sharp rebound in activity  particularly during April Ramadan period. This recovery is also expected to continue with the Hajj in July.In the Americas  Q2 2022 RevPAR was 5% higher than in Q2 2019.In North/Central America and the Caribbean   RevPAR was in line with 2019 levels in Q2 2022  driven by a sharp increase in prices.and the   RevPAR was in line with 2019 levels in Q2 2022  driven by a sharp increase in prices. In South America  and particularly Brazil  the pick-up in business volumes was notably impressive  with occupancy rates above the 2019 level throughout Q2 2022.Services to Owners revenue  which includes the Sales  Marketing  Distribution and Loyalty division  as well as shared services and the reimbursement of hotel staff costs  came to ‚Ç¨842 million in H1 2022  down 10% compared with 2019  in line with consolidated RevPAR for the period.Hotel Assets & Other revenueAt end-June 2022  this segment  which includes owned and leased hotels  represented 114 hotels and 22 417 rooms.Revenue in the ‚ÄúHotel Assets & Other‚Äù segment was up 57% like-for-like in H1 2022 versus H1 2021 and down 8% like-for-like versus H1 2019. This segment  which is closely tied to activity in Australia  benefited in particular from renewed leisure and business tourism demand.Since early 2021  this segment has included concierge services  luxury home rentals  private sales of hotel stays and digital services for hotel owners. All these activities benefited from the uptrend in tourism.Positive EBITDAConsolidated EBITDA was ‚Ç¨205 million in H1 2022  versus ‚Ç¨(120) million in H1 2021. This performance was linked to the activity recovery. In the first half  immediate marketing actions were activated to capture and convert this rebound. On top  we are faced with an unexpected cost inflation  which structurally affects our cost base. The RESET cost saving plan  that is being delivered per plan  is helping to offset all the above.Source: AccorSource: AccorHotelServices EBITDA by businessHotelServices EBITDA was positive at ‚Ç¨208 million in H1 2022. This performance breaks down as positive EBITDA for Management & Franchise (M&F) and a negative contribution from Services to Owners. This negative contribution reflects both marketing expenses incurred to capture the pick-up in business and general cost inflation. Rebilling of hotel costs (with revenue at ‚Ç¨497 million)  included in Services to Owners  structurally remains at breakeven at the EBITDA level.Management & Franchise EBITDA by regionSource: AccorThe Management & Franchise division of HotelServices reported an EBITDA of ‚Ç¨297 million in H1 2022  significantly higher than in H1 2021 (at ‚Ç¨55 million) but still below H1 2019 ((19)% like-for-like). All regions are now generating positive EBITDA.Hotel Assets & Other EBITDAHotel Assets & Other EBITDA came to ‚Ç¨58 million in H1 2022 versus ‚Ç¨25 million in H1 2021. This segment is mainly driven by Australia  where the activity has recovered.

Non-recurring items in H1 2021 mainly included a ‚Ç¨649 million positive impact recognized following the partial sale of a 1.5% stake owned in Huazhu in February 2021.Cash flow generationSource: AccorDuring H1 2022  the Group‚Äôs recurring free cash flow improved significantly  from ‚Ç¨(260) million in H1 2021 to ‚Ç¨41 million in H1 2022.Cost of net debt was stable between H1 2021 and H1 2022  demonstrating the quality of our financing policy.The Group‚Äôs recurring expenditure  which includes ‚Äúkey money‚Äù paid by HotelServices for its development  digital and IT investments  remained under control to end the period at ‚Ç¨55 million.Change in working capital is seasonal in nature and reflects the activity recovery reported in H1 2022.The Group‚Äôs net financial debt as of end-June 2022 reached ‚Ç¨2 025 million  versus ‚Ç¨1 844 million as of December 31  2021.

Taking a longer view however  the performance is resilient  with Group GMV 18% above H1 2019  and online GMV up 61% over 3 years  notably thanks to the continued success of our marketplace.To navigate through the exceptionally challenging market conditions  we deployed a comprehensive action plan to support sales  contain costs and optimize cash. Given our sourcing lead time  our collectioning  procurement and inventory shipment optimization plan will mainly materialize in 2023  enabling the Group to start restoring its gross margin. SG&A action plans will come into effect in 2022  and our EUR 20 million cost containment measures are well underway  enabling us to confirm our updated full-year guidance.Story continuesOur teams are fully mobilized to protect our short-term profitability while continuing to deliver our strategic agenda  as illustrated by the opening of our new distribution center in early July  on schedule and in line with planned costs.We are fully confident in the fundamental strength of Maisons du Monde  its differentiated business model and the strategic choices we‚Äôve made over the last few years. As the current share price does not reflect Maisons du Monde‚Äôs intrinsic value  and utilizing our strong balance sheet  the best use of our cash in the current context is to launch a new share buyback plan for up to 10% of our share capital.‚ÄùFirst Half Key Figures H1 2022H1 2021%Change(in ‚Ç¨ million) GMV 643.4 658.6 -2.3% Marketplace 48.7 30.5 +59.7% Sales 603.9 634.4 -4.8% Like-for-like1 575.8 619.9 -7.1% EBIT 28.4 47.9 -40.7% As a % of Sales 4.7% 7.6% Net Income 8.4 20.5 -59.0% Basic EPS (in ‚Ç¨) 0.19 0.43 -55.2% Free Cash Flow (6.6) 51.2 n.a Net debt 91.8 37.7 Leverage 0.64x 0.22xH1 22 key c ommercial d evelopmentsBrand and customersMaisons du Monde continued to develop its brand and customer dynamics over the half.

Total active customers reached 3.9 million at 30 June 2022  in line with H1 2021 and up 15% vs H1 2019.CSR commitmentMaisons du Monde‚Äôs CSR objectives are central to the company‚Äôs project. Despite the current business context  our teams remain committed to executing a broader agenda. Major achievements in H1 2022 included:Deployment of the Good is Beautiful brand movement  including donations to NGOs to help equip 12 Good is Beautiful living spaces for those in need and the launch of the Good for Women initiative to promote gender equality throughout the GroupAwarded Top 5 global Love Brand by Talkwalker & Hootsuite across all product categories  in recognition of our commitment to sustainability.CollectionsFulfilling its mission to be the most desirable and durable home & living brand in Europe. Maisons du Monde co-created with influencer Lisa Gachet a limited-edition collection of 30 creative and sustainable decoration products. Furthermore  Maisons du Monde keeps developing its sustainable offer: our Kids collection is now 50% ‚ÄúGood is Beautiful‚Äù certified. In parallel  the Group chose to digitize its inspiring product catalog for the second half of the year.In terms of product families  sales of outdoor furniture and tableware were particularly successful (up respectively 9% and 8% yoy). Sales of garden and nature decoration items rose 28% yoy  illustrating the strength of our collections and unique capacity to permanently innovate on new trends.ToplineFirst-half activity: EUR 643 million in GMV; EUR 604 million in salesMaisons du Monde‚Äôs first-half 2022 GMV of EUR 643 million was down 2.3% yoy while sales of EUR 604 million were down 4.8% yoy (LFL -7.1%)  in line with the updated guidance communicated on 26 May. This evolution reflects the very high comparable base (H1 2021 yoy growth: +35%) and the much more challenging macroeconomic environment. After a first drop in traffic observed in March following the start of the war in Ukraine  traffic further deteriorated in May in an unexpectedly strong and sudden fashion  as prospects of a long-lasting conflict and strong and durable inflation started to spread across Europe. June showed no improvement compared to May  and the mixed results of the traditional summer sale season confirmed the clear Europe-wide slowdown  particularly in the home and living category  which benefitted from strong consumer spending during the pandemic.Taking a longer view  Maisons du Monde showed resilience as H1 2022 sales were up 11% compared to H1 2019.Summary of ActivityQ2 22Q2 21%ChangeH1 22H1 21%Change(in EUR million) GMV 314.5 330.0 -4.7% 643.4 658.6 -2.3% Marketplace 29.0 16.6 +74.7% 48.7 30.5 +59.7% Sales 290.9 317.2 -8.3% 603.9 634.4 -4.8% % like-for-like change -10.3% +32.3% -7.1% +34.3% Maisons du Monde 289.8 315.9 -8.3% 601.6 632.0 -4.8% % like-for-like change -10.2% +32.2% -7.1% +34.2% Sales by distribution channel Stores 198.2 176.3 +12.5% 407.1 373.5 +9.0% % of sales 68.1% 55.6% 67.4% 58.9% Online 92.7 140.9 -34.2% 196.8 260.8 -24.5% % of sales 31.9% 44.4% 32.6% 41.1% Sales by geography France 151.0 150.7 +0.2% 312.6 332.1 -5.9% % of sales 51.9% 47.5% 51.8% 52.4% International 139.9 166.5 -15.9% 291.3 302.2 -3.6% % of sales 48.1% 52.5% 48.2% 47.6% Sales by category Decoration 152.9 156.5 -2.3% 327.4 331.9 -1.3% % of sales 52.6% 49.3% 54.2% 52.3% Furniture 138.0 160.7 -14.1% 276.5 302.5 -8.6% % of sales 47.4% 50.7% 45.8% 47.7%Sales by channelDuring the first half  store and online sales recalibrated in an environment which  unlike last year  was unaffected by Covid  but was impacted this year by the inflationary context and the decline in consumer confidence across Europe.Online GMV was EUR 237 million (-16.9%)  while online sales decreased by -24.5% vs. H1 21  reflecting a challenging comparable base: online net sales reached all-time-highs in Q1 and Q2 21 on the back of strong demand for the category and a highly dynamic channel  with stores closed on average 30% of the time in H1 21. Online activity  mainly driven by furniture sales  was still impacted in Q2 22 by continued sub-optimal (but rising) inventory levels  which in turn hit the conversion rate. Consequently  both online traffic and the conversion rate were below their H1 21 levels (-13% and -16%  respectively).The marketplace maintained its strong dynamic as GMV reached ‚Ç¨49 million in H1 22 (+60% yoy)  fueled by a solid performance in France (+44% yoy  marketplace GMV representing 35% of French online GMV)  and the successful launch of our second marketplace in Spain  which already accounts for 31% of Spanish online GMV after only three months.The continued success of the Maisons du Monde marketplace demonstrates the relevance of our online strategy and our ability to maintain our competitive edge. In the face of supply chain challenges impacting online more than stores  online represented 37% of Group GMV in H1 and 33% of sales. Compared to H1 19  online GMV and online net sales were up +61% and +34%  respectively.Store sales grew by (+9.0% vs. H1 21)  benefitting from a favorable base effect as stores were partially closed during this period in 2021. In Q2  like-for-like store traffic decreased by 17% on average vs 2019 to the end of April before significantly eroding in May  worsening to about -30%  and even -40% at certain times. The trend was still strongly negative in early June (-25%)  until the seasonal sales season. Decoration sales evolution was above traffic  with an uplift both on conversion rate and average order size  and a limited price effect. Furniture sales  on the other hand  declined more than traffic  reflecting the impact of low product availability.At 30 June 2022  Maisons du Monde had 350 stores  compared to 357 at 31 December 2021  with an average retail trading space per store of 1 226 m2. The first six months of 2022 saw the opening of two new stores  one in France and one in Spain. During the same period  the Group closed six stores in France  two in Belgium and one in Italy. Total store network commercial area at 30 June 2022 of 429 000 m2 decreased 4 000 m2 compared to 31 December 2021.Sales by categoryDecoration sales remained broadly stable (-1.3%) versus H1 21 at EUR 327 million despite the very high comparable base (H1 21 grew by +40% yoy) and the May-June 10% yoy store traffic decline. This resilience reflects the quality of our collections  which  according to consumers as well as to press and influencers  are increasingly desirable and sustainable.Furniture sales decreased to EUR 276 million (-8.6% yoy)  impacted by supply chain disruptions that led to limited availability in certain product families  including best-seller products. China‚Äôs Covid-related measures in Q2 and ongoing freight disruptions added to the supply chain challenge. Amid a slowdown in commercial activity  however  our teams‚Äô efforts to rebuild inventories  led to an improving level of furniture availability. At the end of June  immediate availability reached 59%  a level not reached since June 2020  and this should support sales dynamics over H2.Sales by geographySales in France reached EUR 313 million (52% of total sales)  down 6% vs H1 21  and up 2% vs H1 19. Store sales in France  representing 55% of total store sales  were EUR 222 million  up 8% yoy. Store sales performance was supported by a favorable base effect as French stores were closed on average 33% of the time in H1 last year. Online GMV in France was down 16% yoy and up 78% vs H1 2019. It accounted for 36% of France‚Äôs total GMV  compared to 42% in H1 21 and 23% in H1 19.International sales totaled EUR 291 million  down 3.6% vs H1 21  and up a solid +24% vs H1 2019. Sales vs 2021 in the two largest countries  Italy and Spain  were up 10% and 1%  respectively. International Online GMV was down 18% yoy and up 46% vs. 2019 and represented 38% of total international GMV in H1 22  compared to 45% in H1 21 and 32% in H1 19.Financial p erformanceThe first-half 2022 financial performance was marked by the lower sales yoy. Furthermore  2021 was a non-normative year as it was still impacted by the pandemic which led to its gross margin being exceptionally high given the low level of promotions (low product availability  stores closed 30% of the time  high customer demand). Also the Group benefitted in 2021 from one-off COVID-related measures that temporarily lowered its cost base.First-half 2022 gross margin came in at 64.0%  down 145 pts yoy  but stable vs 2019 (excluding Modani). Compared to 2019  gross margin this year benefited from a favorable product mix (46% of sales in furniture vs. 48% in 2019). However it started to be impacted by the adverse market conditions (further freight price increases  raw material and energy cost inflation as well as EUR/USD currency rate deterioration). These headwinds had not yet fully materialized over the first half. H2 sales  on the other hand  will reflect the combined effect of higher freight and purchasing costs  while our hedging policy protects us for most of the year against the weakened euro.EBIT of EUR 28 million with margin of 4.7%Gross margin  EBITDA  EBIT(in EUR million) H1 2022 H1 2021 %change Sales 603.9 634.4 -4.8% Cost of goods sold (217.2) (219.0) -0.8% Gross margin 386.7 415.4 -6.9% As a % of Sales 64.0% 65.5% -145 bps Store operating and central costs (170.7) (164.3) +3.9% Advertising costs (32.1) (33.6) -4.4% Logistics costs (84.5) (92.4) -8.6% Operating Costs (287.3) (290.2) -1.0% EBITDA 99.4 125.2 -20.6% As a % of Sales 16.5% 19.7% -328 bps Depreciation  amortization and allowance for provisions (70.9) (77.3) -8.2% EBIT 28.4 47.9 -40.6% As a % of Sales 4.7% 7.6% -284 bpsTo mitigate the effect of these external factors at gross and net margin levels  the Group has launched an action plan that aims to drive additional operational optimization programs in sourcing  logistics and transportation (see H2 2022 action plan below for full details). In addition  after a first series of price increases over the course of Q1 in line with its collectioning calendar  a second wave of price increases will go into effect by the end of the summer  as H2 collections are introduced. In a context of constrained purchasing power  low consumer confidence and high risk of arbitrage in our category  the Group has chosen to implement pricing gradually and selectively  in order to preserve customer loyalty and longer-term growth. This sequential approach allows us to base our price uplifts on sales elasticity  safeguarding our market competitiveness.Logistics costs in the first half decreased by 8.6% to EUR 84.5 million on the basis of lower volumes. From a ratio perspective  logistics costs decreased by 57 bps as a percentage of net sales due to enhanced efficiencies in warehouse operations and transportation  as well as favorable product and channel mix.Store operating and central costs increased by EUR 6 million (+3.9% yoy)  mainly reflecting EUR 11 million of the one-off unemployment subsidies and lease payment reductions accounted for in H1 21  and increases in direct costs in 2022 in relation to the inflationary context  which were partially offset by other cost adjustments.The action plan mentioned above also includes cost containment and savings totaling EUR 20 million (full details below). Only a marginal amount was achieved by the end of June  while the bulk is expected to be realized in H2 22.EBITDA was down 20.6% to EUR 99.4 million (EBITDA margin: 16.5%  -328 bps vs H1 21 and -121 bps vs H1 2019).After taking into consideration lower D&A expense thanks to some risk and litigation accrual releases  H1 2022 EBIT reached EUR 28.4 million with an associated margin of 4.7% (-284 bps yoy and -106 bps over H1 2019).Other net operating expenses were mainly related to store closure costs.Net financial expense declined to EUR 9 million due to lower long-term debt and revolving credit facility interest expense compared to H1 21 as well as gains on currency transactions.Income tax declined to EUR 4 million on lower sales volume. The effective tax rate was 26%.Net income from continuing operations amounted to EUR 8 million  down 51% yoy. EPS was EUR 0.19  compared to EUR 0.43 in H1 21.Free cash flow: EUR (7) millionFree cash flow came in at EUR (7) million compared to EUR 51 million in H1 2021. This decrease mainly reflects i) the EBITDA decrease (EUR 26 million)  ii) an increase in the change of working capital requirement related to inventory rebuild (EUR 37 million)  and iii) an increase in capex (EUR 8 million) mainly related to the opening of the new distribution center in northern France  which started operations in July.(in EUR million) 30 June 2022 30 June 2021 EBITDA 99.4 125.2 Change in working capital (12.3) 25.1 Change in other operating items (4.2) (19.6) Net cash generated by/ (used in) operating activities 82.8 130.7 Capital expenditures (Capex) (31.8) (23.8) Change in debt on fixed assets (0.2) (0.6) Proceeds from sale of non-current assets 0.2 0.8 Decrease in lease debt (52.0) (50.4) Decrease in lease debt/Lease interest paid (5.6) (5.6) Free cash flow (6.6) 51.2Net financial debtThe Group‚Äôs gross debt position at 30 June 2022 was EUR 194 million  virtually unchanged vs EUR 191 million at the end of June 2021. Taking into account its cash and cash equivalents position of EUR 102 million  Maisons du Monde‚Äôs net debt position at 30 June 2022 was EUR 92 million (leverage of 0.64x  compared to 0.22x at 30 June 2021).Net debt & leverage(in EUR million)Net debt calculation 30 June 2022 30 June 2021 Convertible bonds (‚ÄúOCEANE‚Äù) 193.4 188.8 Term loan (0.5) 0.0 Revolving Credit Facilities (RCFs) (0.8) (0.1) Other debt2 2.1 2.0 Cash & cash equivalents (102.4) (153.0) Net debt 91.8 37.7 LTM EBITDA (ex IFRS 16) 143.2 191.8 Leverage3 0.64x 0.22xBanking Credit Facility RenewalThe Group renewed its banking credit facility in April 2022. This new EUR 250 million credit agreement (RCF for EUR 150 million and Term Loan for EUR 100 million)  contracted with the Group's main banking partners  secures the Group‚Äôs liquidity and will enable the reimbursement of the convertible program by the end of 2023. It was also an opportunity to confirm Maisons du Monde‚Äôs ESG commitment by inaugurating its first sustainability-linked loans.H2 2022 action planFor the remainder of 2022  the Group aims to best balance the equation between profit and cash protection and fueling sustainable growth.Short-term profitability optimization is driven by:sales boost and the limitation of gross margin erosion in a highly inflationary contextfurther productivity gains in logistics and transportation to offset the operational deleveraging effect of lower sales volumes and the higher fuel pricessolid action plan minimizing all discretionary spending to offset some fixed cost increases (wages  energy)capex rationalization given the low visibility on market conditionsworking capital requirement optimization in a context of inventory rebuild.Sales support & net margin optimizationIn a context of soft demand and a highly promotional competitive environment  the Group will allocate a higher than usual  yet reasonable  markdown budget to H2 (by c.2-3 pp of sales vs LY) to support sales. Gross margin will also be impacted by higher COGS. Price increases will partly offset the impact on margins. In this context  the Group has implemented the following measures to bring EUR 5 million extra savings this year and secure our gross margin around 63%:Additional rounds of negotiations with major suppliers  applicable as of 2022  andOperational efficiency plans in the collectioning and sourcing process as well as extra optimization initiatives in logistics.We are also optimizing our upcoming collections to best balance our customer value proposition and profit protection. The impact of this detailed approach will be mainly visible in 2023 as per our collectioning calendar.Fixed cost containmentRising inflation  a higher store cost base driven by the 2021 store openings as well as the rebasing effect of 2021 Covid-related measures should add additional costs of around EUR 25-30 million over the year. To compensate for these factors  an operating cost containment program of EUR 20 million has been launched and includes:Hiring freeze and restrictive replacement policyTravel limitation and fee reduction programs throughout the companyMarketing spend reduction based on a stricter ROI approach.Capex and WCR optimizationGiven the highly volatile environment  our selective approach to capex has been further reinforced. The Group will adjust all capex spending except for the launch of its second warehouse  a key pillar to deliver its longer-term agenda. Excluding this project  capex would be back to a level comparable to that of 2019.Regarding working capital requirement  the Group plans to keep rebuilding inventories to support 2023 sales. Given the context  however  it has materially reduced its shipping plans for the second half and started discussions with suppliers to reorganize manufacturing and purchasing planning and optimize payment terms.2022 guidanceIn a high-inflation environment marked by rising raw material prices as well as persistent supply chain bottlenecks  the Group revised its guidance on May 26. Today  despite the ongoing challenging environment and thanks in part to our H2 2022 action plan  we confirm our updated full-year 2022 objectives:Top line decrease in the mid-single digit rangeAn EBIT margin of 5% or aboveFCF of EUR 10 million to 30 millionReduction of the Group‚Äôs carbon intensity: CO2 neutrality for scopes 1 and 2Dividend payout ratio of 30% to 40%.New share buyback program and share cancellationDespite the current environment  the Group remains fully confident in the fundamental strength of its business model and the relevance of its strategic choices. The Board of directors and the management team believe the Group‚Äôs current market value is not an accurate reflection of the business‚Äôs value creation and cash generation potential. As a result  utilizing the Group‚Äôs solid balance sheet  Maisons du Monde is today opportunistically launching a new share buyback program. The Group believes this buyback is an attractive investment opportunity for the benefit of its long-term shareholders.Under this new plan  the Group intends to repurchase up to 10% of its outstanding shares at market price over a period of several months beginning 29 July 2022. This program will be carried out within the limits of the authorization granted to purchase shares  as per the 18th resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 31 May 2022. A description of this share buyback program is available on the Group's website: www.corporate.maisonsdumonde.com.The shares acquired under this new buyback program are intended to be cancelled to reduce the share capital of Maisons du Monde as soon as the program is completed.Furthermore  the Board of Directors yesterday decided to cancel 1 953 797 of the treasury shares (or 4.3% of total shares) it acquired under the previous share buyback program launched in November 2021 and fully completed in March 2022. The cancellation will be effective 29 July 2022. As a result  the Group‚Äôs share capital will amount to EUR 140.3 million  comprised of 43 288 097 shares.***Conference call for investors and analystsDate: 28 July 2022 at 09.00 CESTSpeakers: Julie Walbaum.

The growth was led by continued buoyant market conditions in Metals & Minerals (up 15.2% organically) as well as improving trends in the Oil & Petrochemicals segment.more than half of the portfolio (Marine & Offshore  Buildings & Infrastructure  Certification and Consumer Products Services) grew at 4.3% organically on average. Marine & Offshore (up 6.0%) was fueled by solid activity levels in both in-service activity and the new-build activity which continued to benefit from decarbonization trends. Buildings & Infrastructure recorded an increase of 3.8% in the first half of the year as it benefited notably from strong momentum across its Americas platform while the second quarter was impacted by the lockdown measures implemented across many cities in China. Certification grew 4.1% fueled by the rising demand for Sustainability and ESG-driven services. Lastly  Consumer Products Services delivered very healthy revenue growth (up 4.3% organically in H1  with a 4.0% increase maintained in Q2) driven by its South East and Southern Asian operations which offset the disruption caused by the lockdown in China in the second quarter of the year.Disciplined and selective bolt-on M&A in the first half of 2022During the first half of 2022  Bureau Veritas continued to pursue its bolt-on M&A  completing two transactions in strategic areas  representing circa EUR 34 million in annualized revenue (or 0.7% of 2021 Group revenue). This complements the acquisition of PreScience completed on December 29  2021.Consumer Products ServicesAdvanced Testing Laboratory (ATL)Headquartered in Cincinnati  Ohio  Advanced Testing Laboratory (ATL) is a leader in scientific sourcing services for the North American Consumer Healthcare Products  Cosmetics & Personal Care and Medical Device markets. Its services span the entire product life cycle  from research and development to substance and product qualification to manufacturing.

PreScience has been consolidated in Bureau Veritas books since January 1  2022.The pipeline of opportunities is healthy  and the Group will continue to deploy a very selective bolt-on acquisitions strategy  in targeted areas (notably Buildings & Infrastructure  Consumer Products Services  Sustainability Assurance  renewable energy and cybersecurity) and geographies (North America notably).IMPACT OF THE CHINESE LOCKDOWNS IN THE SECOND QUARTERFollowing the Chinese government‚Äôs ‚Äúzero covid policy‚Äù  the Group has been facing selective lockdowns in several cities across the country since the end of March 2022.Given its strong exposure to China (c.15% of total revenue in H1 2022)  the lockdown measures had a material impact on performance in the second quarter of 2022. The impact varied however by business:in Consumer Products Services  which makes up half of the Group‚Äôs Chinese revenues  Bureau Veritas was proactive and adapted to the constraints. The impact in Q2 was thereby contained as the teams were able to divert samples from one location to another across the country or outside of China to the Group‚Äôs South Asia testing capabilities (Vietnam  Bangladesh  India and Sri Lanka). All the Group‚Äôs labs reopened and were fully back to normal by the end of June 2022.in Buildings & Infrastructure (representing roughly 30% of China‚Äôs revenue  solely focused on infrastructure assets in the transportation field and energy)  construction sites were shut down for a few weeks (up to eight weeks) in areas where mobility restrictions were imposed (Shanghai and Shenzhen notably). Once the mobility restrictions had been removed  the Group operated in a stop & go situation with sites required to shut down as soon as the slightest suspicion of Covid arose. Since mid-June  the construction sites have gradually restarted  and the Group expects to recover from Q3 2022 onwards.LIMITED EXPOSURE TO THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE ARThe Group generated c.1% of its Group consolidated revenue in 2021 with Russia and Ukraine together  mainly related to commodities markets.In Ukraine (0.3% of Group revenue)  the Group has put its people‚Äôs safety at the heart of crisis management. Since the start of the war  Bureau Veritas has stopped operating while ensuring the payment of its employees‚Äô salaries.In Russia (0.8% of Group revenue)  the Group has reduced its activities to essential services in quality  health & safety  environmental protection and social responsibility to domestic and international companies. Since the beginning of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine  Bureau Veritas has regularly assessed and monitored its position in Russia. As of this date  the Group has downsized its business in this country in the sectors where the company was previously operating i.e.  Marine  Aeronautics and Commodities. The Group will continue to downsize its operations and presence as the situation evolves.Overall  the Group considers that most of its activities are not materially impacted by the current war in Ukraine.A SOLID PRICE DISCIPLINEIn the current inflationary environment  as a service company  Bureau Veritas is mainly impacted by wage inflation. The Group has overall good traction on pricing with variations across sectors and geographies: price realization is more favorable in the mass market and in highly regulated activities but more complex with a delayed impact for multi-year and large contracts.SOLID FINANCIAL POSITIONAt the end of June 2022  the Group's adjusted net financial debt increased compared with the level at December 31  2021. The Group has a solid financial structure with the bulk of its maturities beyond 2024.At the end of the first half of 2022  Bureau Veritas had EUR 1.4 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and EUR 600 million in undrawn committed credit lines.At June 30  2022  the adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio was further reduced to 1.10x (from 1.30x last year) and the EBITDA/consolidated net financial expense ratio was 16.67x.The average maturity of the Group‚Äôs financial debt was 3.8 years with a blended average cost of funds over the half year of 2.5% excluding IFRS 16 impact (compared with 2.4% in the first half of 2021 excluding the impact of IFRS 16).In July 2022  Bureau Veritas decided to cancel 1 915 000 shares (0.4% of the capital) which had been bought back between April and June 2022 under the share buyback program authorized by the AGM of June 25  2021.Bureau Veritas shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend for the 2021 financial yearAt the Bureau Veritas Ordinary Shareholders‚Äô Meeting  shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of EUR0.53 per share for the 2021 financial year (3rd resolution  approved at 99.98%)  paid in cash on July 7  2022BUREAU VERITAS IS COMMITTED TO ITS EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCECorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) key indicatorsUNITED NATIONS‚ÄôSDGS H1 2022 FY 2021 2025 target SOCIAL & HUMAN CAPITAL Total Accident Rate (TAR) 2 #3 0.24 0.27 0.26 Proportion of women in leadership positions3 #5 29.2% 26.5% 35.0% Number of learning hours per employee (per year) 4 #8 14.2 29.9 35.0 ENVIRONMENT CO 2 emissions per employee (tons per year) 5 #13 2.38 2.49 2.00 GOVERNANCE Proportion of employees trained to the Code of Ethics #16 95.9% 95.8% 99.0%CSR key initiatives and awards in first half 2022Over the first half 2022  several CSR-related actions and initiatives were implemented:Environ m ent : Eco-efficiency assessments have been conducted in some of Bureau Veritas‚Äô buildings and offices in Africa and solar panels were installed on the roofs of several laboratories (Nigeria  South Africa  Ivory Coast) within the framework of direct Power Purchase Agreement‚Äôs (PPA); Initiatives have been implemented to reduce and offset CO 2 emissions as part of the deployment of Earth Day (compensation programs through afforestation and reforestation); Some contracts were renegotiated to enable access to renewable energy for some of Bureau Veritas‚Äô large labs across the World;Safety : Dedicated campaigns and training sessions were rolled out (e.g. ‚Äú2 minutes for my Safety‚Äù training) as part of the World Day for Safety & Health at Work celebrations; Bureau Veritas provided support to its employees and their family members in Ukraine through the supply of transport  accommodation  and access to essential goods and services  as well as through donations given by the Group and by its employees; Support was also provided to the employees and families facing Covid-19 lockdown measures in China and Hong Kong in Q2 2022 (access to goods  assistance programs);Social : Improvements and implementation of leadership development programs dedicated to high potential women across all Operating Groups; Development and implementation of an employee on-boarding and off-boarding survey as part of the Group's overall employee engagement assessment; Bureau Veritas became a signatory of the United Nations Women‚Äôs Empowerment Principles;Awards:Bureau Veritas received several CSR-related awards in the first-half of 2022:The Economic Times has recognized Bureau Veritas as one of the best Organizations for Women for 2022.

The rest of the portfolio grew steadily  with Marine & Offshore  Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) Certification and Consumer Products Services  up from 3.8% to 6.0% organically.By geography  Americas was the best performing region (27% of revenue; up 16.4% organically)  led by a 9.8% increase in North America (driven by Buildings & Infrastructure) and by a 28.4% increase in Latin America (led by Brazil notably). Europe (34% of revenue; up 2.9% organically) was primarily led by strong growth in Italy and the Netherlands. Business in Asia Pacific (30% of revenue; up 1.9% organically) was impacted by the lockdown measures in China (concentrated in Q2) while double digit growth was delivered in Southern Asia (led by India) and high single digit growth in Australia. Finally  Africa and the Middle East (9% of revenue)  strongly outperformed the rest of the Group with organic revenue growth of 12.3%  essentially driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 0.4%  reflecting bolt-on acquisitions realized in the past few quarters.Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of 4.5% (of which 5.6% in Q2)  mainly due to the appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries‚Äô currencies.Adjusted operating profit up 8.7% to EUR 410.9 millionAdjusted operating profit increased by 8.7% to EUR 410.9 million; the half-year 2022 adjusted operating margin decreased by 38 basis points to 15.3%  including a 4-basis-point positive impact from foreign exchange and a 2-basis-point positive impact from scope. It was mainly attributed to the impact from the lockdowns occurred in China in the second quarter.CHANGE IN ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN IN PERCENTAGE AND BASIS POINTS H1 2021 adjusted operating margin 15.6% Organic change (44)bps Organic adjusted operating margin 15.2% Scope +2bps Constant currency adjusted operating margin 15.2% Currency +4bps H1 2022 adjusted operating margin 15.3%The revenue improvement and operating leverage drove organic margins higher in Marine & Offshore and in Agri Food & Commodities.The businesses that saw the biggest margin decline came from Buildings & Infrastructure and to some extent Consumer Products services  having suffered the most from the lockdowns in China in Q2. Together  they represented the bulk of the organic decrease in the Group‚Äôs margin in the first half of 2022.Other operating expenses slightly increased to EUR 35.7 million versus EUR 32.1 million in the first half of 2021. These include:EUR 22.0 million in amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (down from EUR 28.9 million in H1 2021);EUR 3.7 million in write-offs of non-current assets related to the Agri Food & Commodities and Industry businesses;EUR 8.9 million in restructuring costs  relating chiefly to Industry andcommodities-related activities (EUR 4.4 million in H1 2021);EUR 1.1 million in net losses on disposals and acquisitions (net gain of EUR 4.1 million in H1 2021).Operating profit totaled EUR 375.2 million  up 8.4% from EUR 346.1 million in the first half of 2021.Adjusted EPS of EUR 0.55  up 15.2% year on yearNet financial expense amounted to EUR 29.5 million in the first half of 2022  compared with EUR 36.9 million in the same period one year earlier.The slight increase in net finance costs to EUR 38.9 million in H1 2022 (compared with EUR 37.6 million in H1 2021) is mainly attributable to the impact of the appreciation of the US dollar on the interest on the US Private Placements denominated in US dollars.The Group posted foreign exchange gains of EUR 14.2 million in H1 2022 owing to the appreciation of the US dollar and the euro against most emerging market currencies (foreign exchange gains of EUR 2.4 million in H1 2021). The interest cost on pension plans remained nearly stable at EUR 0.8 million in H1 2022 compared with EUR 0.7 million in H1 2021.Income tax expense totaled EUR 111.1 million in H1 2022  compared with EUR 97.1 million in H1 2021.This represents an effective tax rate (ETR) of 32.1% for the period  compared with a 31.4% in H1 2021.The adjusted effective tax rate was 31.3%  down 0.9 percentage points compared to the first half of 2021. It corresponds to the effective tax rate adjusted for the tax effect of adjustment items. The decline is mainly due to the lower tax rate in France and the increase in pre-tax income compared with taxes not calculated on taxable income  notably withholding taxes and value-added taxes in France and Italy.Attributable net profit for the period was EUR 225.2 million  versus a EUR 196.9 million in H1 2021.Earnings per share (EPS) stood at EUR 0.50 versus EUR 0.44 in H1 2021.Adjusted attributable net profit totaled EUR 248.6 million  up 15.8% versus EUR 214.7 million in H1 2021.Adjusted EPS stood at EUR 0.55  a 15.2% increase versus H1 2021 (EUR 0.48 per share).Solid Free cash flow at EUR 129.9 million despite the Chinese situationHalf-year 2022 operating cash flow decreased by 35.2% to EUR 213.0 million versus EUR 328.9 million in H1 2021. The increase in profit before tax was largely offset by a strong working capital requirement outflow of EUR 176.7 million  compared to a EUR 68.5 million outflow the previous year. The change is due to the strong growth delivered in the second quarter (+11.0% overall) and the temporary impact of the invoice settlement delays triggered by the Chinese lockdowns.Working capital requirement (WCR) stood at EUR 517.2 million at June 30  2022  compared withEUR 367.2 million at June 30  2021. As a percentage of revenue  WCR increased by 220 basis points to 9.8%  compared to 7.6% in H1 2021.Purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals (Net Capex)  amounted to EUR 52.0 million in the first half of 2022  on a par with the H1 2021 figure of EUR 52.6 million. This showed disciplined control over the Group‚Äôs net capex-to-revenue ratio at 1.9% (focusing on maintenance essentially)  down slightly on H1 2021 (2.2%).Free cash flow (operating cash flow after tax  interest expenses and capex) wasEUR 129.9 million  compared to EUR 228.9 million in H1 2021  down 43.2% year on year. On an organic basis  free cash flow reached EUR 124.7 million.CHANGE IN FREE CASH FLOW IN EUR MILLIONS Free cash flow at June 30  2021 228.9 Organic change (104.2) Organic free cash flow 124.7 Scope 2.0 Free cash flow at constant currency 126.7 Currency 3.2 Free cash flow at June 30  2022 129.9At June 30  2022  adjusted net financial debt was EUR 1 088.8 million  i.e. 1.10 trailingtwelve-month EBITDA as defined in the calculation of the bank covenant  compared with 1.30x at December 31  2021. The increase in adjusted net financial debt of EUR 37.4 million versusDecember 31  2021 (EUR 1 051.4 million) reflects:Free cash flow of EUR 129.9 million;Dividend payments totaling EUR 9.8 million corresponding mainly to dividends paid tonon-controlling interests and withholding taxes on intra-group dividends;Acquisitions (net) and repayment of amounts owed to shareholders  accounting for EUR 45.7 million;Lease payments (related to the application of IFRS 16)  accounting for EUR 61.1 million;Share buyback  accounting for EUR50.8 million;Other items that decreased the Group's debt by EUR 1.3 million.2022 OUTLOOK CONFIRMEDBased on a solid sales pipeline around the Group‚Äôs diversified portfolio and the significant growth opportunities related to its sustainability range of services and solutions  and assuming there are no new Covid-19 lockdowns in its main countries of operation  Bureau Veritas still expects for the full year 2022 to:Achieve mid-single-digit organic revenue growth;Improve the adjusted operating margin;Generate sustained strong cash flow  with a cash conversion above 90%.H1 2022 BUSINESS REVIEWMARINE & OFFSHOREIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 204.5 189.2 +8.1% +6.0% - +2.1% Adjusted Operating Profit 50.1 44.4 +12.9% Adjusted Operating Margin 24.5% 23.5% +106 +83 - +23The Marine & Offshore business recorded solid 6.0% organic revenue growth in the first half of 2022.In the second quarter  organic revenue was up 5.6%.The half-year organic performance results mainly from:Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in New Construction (40% of divisional revenue)  primarily fueled by North Asia  Europe (primarily Greece) and Africa. This was cushioned by the lockdowns in China during the second quarter.Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in the Core In-service activity (45% of divisional revenue)  which benefited from the favorable timing of inspections by ship owners  an increased level of occasional surveys  combined with some price increases. At end-June  the fleet classified by Bureau Veritas comprised 11 533 ships  representing 140.1 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT)  stable year on year (based on the number of ships).High single-digit organic revenue growth for Services (15% of divisional revenue  including Offshore)  was driven by a combination of strong commercial development for non-classification services (including consulting services related to energy efficiency stimulated by a context of high oil prices) and increased demand for risk assessment services in the Offshore Oil & Gas market. [The first half of 2022 was marked by an increase in projects in the wind energy sector  both for onshore and offshore wind turbines].The new build market remained well oriented in the first half of the year. Bureau Veritas new orders reached 4.8 million gross tons in June 2022  a stable level compared to the prior-year period. As a result  the order book stood at 18 million gross tons at the end of the quarter  up 17.9% year on year compared to 16.3 million gross tons in December 2021. It is composed of LNG fueled ships  container ships and specialized vessels.Marine & Offshore continued to focus on efficiency levers through digitalization and high added-value services (including digital twin  mobility surveyor at yard  machinery maintenance portal). In Q2  the Group introduced the use of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model for corrosion detection  which will be deployed for augmented surveys in the second half of the year.Adjusted operating margin for the half year improved by 106 basis points to 24.5% on a reported basis compared to H1 2021  positively impacted by foreign exchange effects (23 basis points). Organically  it rose by 83 basis points  benefiting from operating leverage  a positive mix and operational excellence.Sustainability achievementsThe Group continued to address the challenges of sustainability and the energy transition by providing rules and guidelines on the safety  risk and performance requirements for innovation in future fuels and propulsion systems. The Group supported its customers in complying with environmental regulations  implementing sustainable solutions on board  and measuring progress in decarbonization.In the second quarter of 2022  the Group carried out a study aiming at de-risking the use of ammonia as a marine fuel  with a specific focus on leak mitigation and treatment  in collaboration with TotalEnergies. Ammonia is one of the main zero-carbon fuel options currently envisioned by shipping as the industry seeks to decarbonise.AGRI-FOOD & COMMODITIESIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 588.0 517.6 +13.6% +8.6% (0.3)% +5.3% Adjusted Operating Profit 76.2 66.1 +15.3% Adjusted Operating Margin 13.0% 12.8% +20 +20 +2 (2)The Agri-Food & Commodities business recorded 8.6% organic revenue growth in the first half of 2022  led by strong markets for Metal & Minerals and Government services  alongside an improvement in the Oil & Petrochemicals segment. In Q2  Group organic revenue increased by 7.9%.The Oil & Petrochemicals segment (O&P  30% of divisional revenue) delivered mid-single-digit organic growth overall. The O&P Trade market benefited from increased activity in a context of higher fuel consumption  notably for aviation fuel/gasoline. All regions grew apart from Europe  which remained penalized by weak market conditions and the impact of the Russia/Ukraine war  which triggered changes in the routes for trade. Strong growth was achieved in the Middle East and Africa alongside robust growth in both the Americas and Asia. Throughout the first half  Bureau Veritas continued to further reposition its portfolio towards new services (such as laboratory outsourcing) and value-added segments across many geographies. These include sustainability-driven solutions such as Oil Condition Monitoring (OCM)  Carbon 14 traceability for Biofuels  Sustainable Aviation Fuel or a fuel marking program.The Metals & Minerals segment (M&M  33% of divisional revenue) achieved double-digit organic growth overall  across the entire value chain. Upstream (two-thirds of M&M) continued to record strong growth (up 16.7% organically)  across most geographies  led by the Group‚Äôs key hubs (Australia  Canada and Latin America). It benefited from a sustained high level of exploration drilling activity across all the major commodities (with gold  copper  coal and iron ore leading the way)  a growing backlog of samples and the continuing success of the Group‚Äôs on-site laboratories strategy with several important wins in the period (including copper mines in Chile and Peru  an iron ore mine in Chile and a gold mine in Australia). Trade activities recorded double digit organic revenue growth. It was fueled by the main metals  with strong trade volumes for copper  iron ore and coal across all geographies. Copper demand remained strong  notably driven by electrification trends in several economies  while coal was in high demand as an energy source.Agri-Food (22% of divisional revenue) reported positive organic revenue growth in the first half  led by Agricultural products. The agricultural inspection activities grew strongly  led by Latin America and Brazil notably  which benefited from a very early harvest campaign for soybeans and corn as well as an extension of services (transgenic testing). In Europe  business was impacted by the Russia/Ukraine war on Black Sea exports. The Food business saw better resilience of testing activities versus inspection; it reflected a contrasted situation by geography: strong growth in the Middle East and Africa alongside the US (driven by new greenfield labs opening)  but weak growth in Canada (slow restart following the cyber-attack in Q4 2021) and in Asia Pacific (mobility restriction measures). In Australia  which mainly relies on dairy products  business was hampered by reduced Chinese demand for infant milk formula as well as the closure of Food producers‚Äô plants in Victoria during the summer break.Government services (15% of divisional revenue) achieved double-digit organic growth in the first half (of which an 11% increase in the second quarter). Strong growth was delivered in Africa led by the strong development of VOC (Verification of Conformity) in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)  Nigeria  Zimbabwe  Tanzania  Ghana  and Single Window (DRC) contracts. This segment also benefited from the increased value of inspected goods on existing contracts  supported by high commodities prices.The adjusted operating margin for the Agri-Food & Commodities business increased to 13.0%  up 20 basis points compared to last year. This was led by a topline recovery and a positive business mix.Sustainability achievementsCompanies and organizations are stepping up their efforts to meet ambitious decarbonization targets set by the Paris Agreements. In Q2  Bureau Veritas and Climate Neutral Commodity (CNC) joined forces to support their clients as they took action to accelerate the energy and ecological transitions. To do this  CNC defined the first ever certification standard for carbon-neutral transactions and services in the raw materials industry and BV will be the preferred verification body to validate these commodities.INDUSTRYIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 564.3 487.2 +15.8% +10.8% (0.5)% +5.5% Adjusted Operating Profit 62.2 53.7 +15.8% Adjusted Operating Margin 11.0% 11.0% (1) (22) +13 +8Industry was the best performing business within the Group‚Äôs portfolio in the first half of 2022 with organic growth of 10.8%  including 9.8% growth in the second quarter.By geography  most regions delivered strong growth in H1 with Latin America and the Middle East leading the way alongside Asia Pacific. Growth was more moderate in both the US and in Europe.By market  Power & Utilities (14% of divisional revenue) continued to be a key driver of growth for the portfolio with a double-digit organic performance during the half year (including Q2). Growth was driven mainly by Latin America (Chile and Colombia) thanks to the ramp-up of large contract wins with various Power Distribution clients  volume increases on existing contracts and price renegotiation. Europe also contributed to the growth led by France  the UK and Spain (power generation). Similarly  France and the UK benefited from high activity levels in nuclear power plants (the EPR project at Flamanville 3 for France).In renewable power generation (solar  wind  hydrogen)  the opportunities remained significant  backed by a strong sales pipeline. Several contracts were awarded during the first half  including Broad Reach Power which owns a 21-gigawatt portfolio of utility scale solar  wind and energy storage projects in the Western part of the United States. Bureau Veritas will provide Project Management services during the design and construction phases of six Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Projects in Texas. Since the beginning of the year  the Group‚Äôs renewable energy services now exceed Oil & Gas capex projects in terms of revenues.The Oil & Gas segment (33% of divisional revenue) experienced double-digit organic revenue growth benefiting from the combination of strong sales development  the restart of many projects triggered by rising oil prices and favorable comparables. Opex-related activities (representing two-thirds of the Oil & Gas business) maintained a double-digit pace and were essentially driven by Latin America (with Brazil and Argentina leading the way for both onshore and offshore services)  and the Middle East and Europe (led by Spain). Capex-related activities  including Procurement Services  grew mid-single digit organically  essentially attributable to the US (with drilling activity in full speed)  Asia and the Middle East (with projects resuming in the UEA). As of today  the share of Oil & Gas Capex in Group revenue totaled 2%.Elsewhere  the aerospace business in relation to Russia was stopped and thus impacted the revenue stream while the Automotive business (5% of divisional revenue) delivered a stable performance still impacted by supply chain disruption.Adjusted operating margin for the half year was 11.0%  broadly stable year on year (with the slight margin decline offset by a positive scope effect). It is attributable to mobilization costs on large Opex contracts.Sustainability achievementsThrough the BV Green Line of services and solutions dedicated to Sustainability  the Group is supporting its clients notably in the transition towards a better use of natural resources  the reduction of their carbon footprint  and the promotion of more sustainable practices. In the second quarter of 2022  Bureau Veritas developed a voluntary certification framework for assessing the carbon footprint of Hydrogen production facilities. In the absence of internationally recognized statutory certification schemes  this scheme applies as an independent framework to assist stakeholders in the Hydrogen value chain to assess the environmental impact of different Hydrogen production pathways.Bureau Veritas also assisted ORLEN Group  the largest oil & gas company in Central Europe  to calculate its carbon footprint in accordance with the latest recommendations and internationally recognized standards. Carbon footprint inventory will make it possible to quantify key sources of GHG emissions of the company and its entire value chain. It will support the development of effective decarbonization strategies.BUILDINGS & INFRASTRUCTUREIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 775.9 709.2 +9.4% +3.8% +1.6% +4.0% Adjusted Operating Profit 103.9 104.1 (0.2)% Adjusted Operating Margin 13.4% 14.7% (130) (135) (2) +7The Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) business achieved solid organic growth of 3.8% in the first half of 2022  primarily fueled by the Americas and by the Middle East. In Q2  revenue grew 0.7% on an organic basis as it reflects the impact from the Covid-19 related shutdowns across several cities in China.By service  Construction-related activities (54% of divisional revenue) grew faster than Buildings In-service activities benefiting from strong dynamics for new projects in the Americas and the Middle East.The Americas (26% of divisional revenue) was the best performing region  led by a 15.2% increase in the United States and by a stellar performance in Latin America (led by Brazil notably). In the US  where the Group has built its platform over the past few years  the growth drivers are numerous and include i) large project management assistance and transactional activity for Opex-related services across most sectors (Retail essentially); ii) sustained strong dynamics for data center commissioning services to support the increase in remote workforces; iii) increasing revenue for the business related to Electrical Vehicle Charging stations (EVCS). Through the acquisition of PreScience  the Group has positioned itself on the very attractive transportation infrastructure market. In Latin America  business benefited from the very strong recovery of Brazil (fueled by commercial development for both Opex and Capex services) alongside strong trends in both Argentina and Colombia.In Europe (52% of divisional revenue)  growth was moderate overall. A strong performance was delivered in both Italy (ramp-up of large contract wins on the motorway network) and the Netherlands (Opex led) alongside good growth in Spain. France  the region‚Äôs largest contributor (41% of divisional revenue) delivered organic revenue growth. This was driven by the In-service activity (around three quarters of the French business) with the delivery of a solid backlog as well as by the continuing strong performance of Bureau Veritas Solutions (technical assistance; consulting services) led by the increase in headcount. The growth of capex-related works remained muted in a declining new build market. The pipeline of sales related to the EU Green Deal (including the one in France and the upcoming 2024 Olympic Games in France) continued to grow with opportunities mainly focused on energy efficiency programs.The Asia Pacific region (19% of divisional revenue) recorded a high-single digit organic revenue decrease (including a double digit decrease in Q2) with a contrasted situation by country. In China  business was severely impacted by the Covid-19 situation (down c. 30% organically in Q2)  with construction sites fully stopped for up to eight weeks  in areas where lockdowns had been imposed (Shanghai  Shenzhen notably). Once the mobility restrictions had been lifted  the Group operated in a stop & go situation with sites required to shut down as soon as the slightest suspicion of Covid arose. This created inefficiencies  which materially impacted operations. Since mid-June  the construction sites have gradually restarted  and a recovery is expected from Q3 2022 onwards. Elsewhere  business recovered strongly in India as lockdown measures were lifted  while Japan improved  led by code compliance services.Lastly  in the Middle East & Africa region (3% of divisional revenue)  the Group experienced very strong growth primarily led by Saudi Arabia  and by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) which continued to benefit from the development of numerous projects supported by the rebound in oil prices. In Saudi Arabia  for instance  the Group is involved in the NEOM project  a smart city that will be powered by renewable energy.Adjusted operating margin for the half year declined by 135 basis points to 13.4% from 14.7% in the prior year. This was primarily attributed to the impact of the lockdowns in China and a mix effect.Sustainability achievementsIn the second quarter of 2022  the Group continued to accompany owners/concessionaires of buildings and infrastructure with services for energy efficiency and carbon footprint monitoring. it supports notably asset managers towards the achievements of their Net Zero commitments.CERTIFICATIONIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 209.2 196.9 +6.2% +4.1% +0.2% +1.9% Adjusted Operating Profit 40.0 38.1 +4.9% Adjusted Operating Margin 19.1% 19.3% (26) (27) (6) +7The Certification business delivered solid organic growth of 4.1% in the first half of 2022 (including 4.0% in the second quarter)  against challenging comparables (year of recertification for several schemes related to QHSE and Transportation). This was supported by strong sales development  notably as regards Sustainability and robust price increases.Most geographies experienced solid organic growth. The Americas  Africa and the Middle East performed above the divisional average  fueled notably by stellar growth in Latin America (and Brazil in particular)  Asia was at a par (led by South & Southern Asian countries) while Europe grew below the average (primarily led by the UK and Italy). The countries that grew the most are those where the mix has been diversified in recent years (shift from traditional schemes towards new services)  as illustrated by Brazil  Australia  Thailand and some Eastern countries  which all saw high double-digit organic growth in the period.Within the Group‚Äôs portfolio  strong growth was achieved in Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability  Enterprise Risks (led by Cybersecurity and IT management systems solutions)  Food certification (fueled by food product certification  food safety and food sustainability) as well as in Training & Personnel services; conversely  business declined for QHSE and Transportation (reflecting fewer man days) due to tough comparables against the prior year linked to the year of recertification.During H1  Bureau Veritas Sustainability services grew by more than 16%  driven notably by buoyant demand for Greenhouse gas emission verification services related to Carbon footprint assessments  Offsetting & removals projects and Neutrality or net zero goals.Business continued to benefit from the overall rising client demand for more brand protection  traceability  and social responsibility commitments all along the supply chain. While a major part of the demand for ESG is on a voluntary basis  the regulatory framework is expected to be a growth driver in the medium-term. The EU corporate sustainability reporting directive (CSRD) currently sets the rules for European non-financial data reporting in a more standardized way and opens the sustainability assurance market to independent assurance service providers (IASP)  including TIC players. This will support growth from 2025 onwards.In the first half  the Group accelerated the commercial deployment of its new offering Clarity  from both a geographic and a business point of view. Clarity was launched in December 2021  and supports companies in managing their ESG strategy  measuring their performance and tracking their implementation. The commercial pipeline is well oriented and contract wins are now capturing a large range of sectors  including Food & Beverage  industry  Retail and Hospitality.The adjusted operating margin for the half year was a very healthy 19.1%  compared to 19.4% in the prior year. This reflects a 26-basis-point decrease against the record level  driven by strong operational leverage  price increases and tight cost management.Sustainability achievementsDuring the first half of 2022  Bureau Veritas was awarded numerous contracts in the Sustainability field. This ranged from a carbon footprint assessment for a Chinese ecommerce platform to a Clarity program with PepsiCo to review CSR metrics for a number of their internal sites. The Group also signed a long-term contract with a battery producer for electric vehicles to perform the Sustainability assessment of its supply chain and ensure full traceability along the value chain. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Bureau Veritas‚Äô partner  Optel  to track and trace products along the entire chain through the use of digital tools.CONSUMER PRODUCTS SERVICESIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 351.5 318.3 +10.4% +4.3% +0.3% +5.8% Adjusted Operating Profit 78.5 71.8 +9.4% Adjusted Operating Margin 22.3% 22.6% (21) (19) (3) +1The Consumer Products Services business achieved organic revenue growth of 4.3% in the first half of 2022 including a Q2 organic growth of 4.0%  despite the various lockdowns implemented in China. This demonstrated the Group‚Äôs strong resilience and agility to operate in a complicated environment.By geography  all regions apart from China grew with a particularly strong organic revenue performance in the countries and regions where the Group has focused on diversification  namely in the Middle East & Africa (led by Turkey) alongside South Asia which delivered double digit growth (including India and Bangladesh) as well as South America. Europe grew above the divisional average  mainly fueled by Italy. Conversely business levels were impacted by lockdown measures in China and by capacity and logistics issues in Vietnam.Softlines (36% of divisional revenue) performed better than the divisional average  with similar growth in both quarters  and contrasted performances by country. In its largest Chinese operations  the Group has shown strong proactivity in adapting to the lockdowns. By leveraging its unique platform composed of a network of integrated laboratories across the country  the Group‚Äôs teams have been able to divert samples from locations under lockdown to others across the country or outside of China to the Group‚Äôs South Asia testing capabilities. All the laboratories in China reopened and were fully back to normal by end of June. In South Asia (India  Bangladesh and Sri Lanka essentially)  the Group delivered double digit growth. These countries benefited from both the short-term transfer of activity outside of China due to the regional Covid-19 shutdowns and from the continuing structural sourcing shift outside of China. Similarly  Turkey strongly benefited from nearshoring patterns from European retailers and saw a sharp increase in testing volumes. This underlines the importance of the Group‚Äôs geographic diversification strategy towards new production countries that are closer to the countries of consumption. The acquisition of AMSfashion reinforces the Group‚Äôs exposure in Iberia and strengthens its offering in Sustainability.Hardlines/Toys/Health & Beauty (31% of divisional revenue) performed below the divisional average. Small appliances and do-it-yourself products were impacted by the China lockdowns in the second quarter. South Korea benefited from its ongoing diversification into Cosmetics  Health & Beauty while Italy remained fueled by luxury products. Inspection and Audit services reported high single digit organic growth  as they continued to benefit from strong demand for Social & CSR audits across all geographies (including China where the audits were performed remotely). In Q2  the acquisition of US company ATL focusing on scientific sourcing services for the Consumer Healthcare Products  Cosmetics & Personal Care and Medical Device markets will enable the Group to accelerate its geographic diversification and move towards new services.Lastly  Technology6 (33% of divisional revenue) performed below the divisional average  with a double-digit organic performance in both electrical and electronics products and in Automotive (reliability testing and homologation services). The growth in Wireless Testing was impacted by the China‚Äôs Covid-19 shutdowns and by project delays in Korea. In Asia  5G-related products/infrastructure continued to show good momentum with the Group‚Äôs test platforms (Taiwan  South Korea) running at full capacity.Adjusted operating margin for the half year reached a very healthy 22.3% level (down 21 basis points  year-on-year)  as the negative impact from the lockdowns in China was mostly offset by the benefit of several cost actions  government subsidies and overall strong agility.Sustainability achievementsIn the first half of 2022  the Group was awarded a contract with a large European sportswear company to perform energy audits of its suppliers across many geographies; through these services  Bureau Veritas supports its clients in managing their ESG strategy and providing the proof of their commitments.PRESENTATION H1 2022 results will be presented on Thursday  July 28  2022  at 3:00 p.m. (Paris time) A video conference will be webcast live.

These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group‚Äôs budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group‚Äôs performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (‚ÄúTIC‚Äù) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes ‚Äúorganic‚Äù revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group‚Äôs operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  or organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas‚Äô control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group‚Äôs performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations ‚Äì in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGINAdjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the performance of the business  excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the Group‚Äôs underlying intrinsic performance owing to their nature. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators  presented at Group level and for each business  are more representative of the operating performance in its industry.Adjusted operating profitAdjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following:amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions;impairment of goodwill;impairment and retirement of non-current assets;gains and losses on disposals of businesses and other income and expenses relating to acquisitions (fees and costs on acquisitions of businesses  contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses);restructuring costs.When an acquisition is carried out during the financial year  the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis.Since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may  in some cases  be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period  once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known.Organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit.Adjusted operating marginAdjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates  thereby  in the latter case  providing a view of the Group‚Äôs performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas‚Äô control.ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe effective tax rate (ETR) represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre-tax profit.The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre-tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition).ADJUSTED NET PROFITAdjusted attributable net profitAdjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition) and for the tax effect on adjustment items. Adjusted attributable net profit excludes non-controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations.Adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates  thereby providing a view of the Group‚Äôs performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas‚Äô control. The currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.Adjusted attributable net profit per shareAdjusted attributable net profit per share (adjusted EPS or earnings per share) is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares in the period.FREE CASH FLOWFree cash flow represents net cash generated from operating activities (operating cash flow)  adjusted for the following items:purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;interest paid.Net cash generated from operating activities is shown after income tax paid.Organic free cash flow represents free cash flow at constant scope and exchange rates over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of net cash generated from operating activities and free cash flow.FINANCIAL DEBTGross debtGross debt (or gross finance costs/financial debt) represents bank loans and borrowings plus bank overdrafts.Net debtNet debt (or net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise marketable securities and similar receivables as well as cash at bank and on hand.Adjusted net debtAdjusted net debt (or adjusted net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents net debt taking into account currency and interest rate hedging instruments.CONSOLIDATED EBITDAConsolidated EBITDA represents net profit before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months. Consolidated EBITDA is used by the Group to track its bank covenants.1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendices 6 and 8 of this press release.2 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked).3 Proportion of women on the Executive Committee in Band II (internal grade corresponding to an executive management position) in the Group (number of women on a full-time equivalent basis in a leadership position/total number of full-time equivalents in leadership positions).4 Indicator calculated over a 6-month period compared to a 12-month period for FY 2021 and 2025 target values.5 Greenhouse gas emissions from offices and laboratories  tons of CO 2 equivalent per employee and per year for Scopes 1  2 and 3 (emissions related to business travel).6 The Technology segment comprises Electrical & Electronics  Wireless testing activities and Automotive connectivity testing activities.7 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked).8 Proportion of women on the Executive Committee in Band II (internal grade corresponding to an executive management position) in the Group (number of women on a full-time equivalent basis in a leadership position/total number of full-time equivalents in leadership positions).9 Indicator calculated over a 6-month period compared to a 12-month period for FY 2021 and 2025 target values.10 Greenhouse gas emissions from offices and laboratories  tons of CO equivalent net emissions per employee and per year corresponding to Scopes 1  2 and 3 (emissions related to business travel).Attachment,neutral,0.18,0.77,0.05,mixed,0.29,0.26,0.45,True,English,"['Solid H1 2022 operating', '2022 Full Year outlook', 'BUREAU VERITAS', 'financial performance', 'double digit organic revenue growth', 'high single-digit organic revenue growth', 'working capital requirement increase', 'continued buoyant market conditions', 'mid-single-digit organic revenue growth', 'sound 6.5% organic revenue growth', 'Steady organic revenue growth', 'main consolidated financial items', 'sustained strong cash flow', 'Adjusted net financial debt', 'press release H1 2022 HIGHLIGHTS', '5.2% organic revenue growth', 'Free cash flow', 'total annualized revenue', 'CONSTANT CURRENCY Revenue', 'significant growth opportunities', 'numerous growth opportunities', 'disciplined capex policy', 'BV Green Line', 'two new bolt', 'Advanced Testing Laboratory', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'net debt/EBITDA ratio', 'Alternative performance indicators', 'solid underlying trends', 'Attributable net profit', 'sustainable business models', 'half year results', 'new Covid-19 lockdowns', 'solid sales pipeline', 'strong business activity', 'H1 2022 Key figures1', 'ESG related solutions', '2022 Full Year outlook', 'Solid H1 2022 operating', 'Sustainability related solutions', 'diversified business portfolio', 'financial performance', 'Group revenue', 'main countries', 'cash conversion', 'financial statements', 'solid level', 'Underlying momentum', 'operating profit', 'first half', 'Group sales', 'operating margin', 'Operating cash-flow', 'BUREAU VERITAS', 'second quarter', 'invoice settlement', 'most geographies', 'Diversified portfolio', 'lockdown measures', 'Limited impact', 'Russia/Ukraine war', 'strategic areas', 'Didier Michaud-Daniel', 'geographical footprint', 'many cities', 'Society company', 'uncertain environment', 'most businesses', 'volatile environment', 'Utilities segment', 'Gas markets', 'The Group', 'Chinese lockdowns', 'Sustainability assurance', 'sustainability range', 'first semester', 'oil prices', '9.8% growth', '2022 Outlook', 'France', 'July', 'basis', 'EUR', 'China', 'share', 'delays', 'June', 'services', 'delivery', 'Acquisitions', 'companies', 'Consumer', 'PreScience', 'January', 'AMSfashion', 'Spain', 'operation', 'Story', 'strength', 'consequences', 'Q2.', 'clients', 'commitment', 'resilient', 'relevance', 'ambition', 'industry', 'terms', 'Board', 'Directors', 'MILLIONS', 'CHANGE', 'loss', 'EPS', 'IFRS', 'appendices', 'fifth', 'Power', 'renewables', 'rise', 'Agri-Food', 'Commodities', '15.', '2021']",2022-07-28,2022-07-28,finance.yahoo.com

Our best-in-class portfolio of brands  accelerated digital transformation and global ecosystem provide a unique platform that positions us well to lead and grow the beer category and drive superior long-term value creation.2022 OutlookOverall Performance: We expect our EBITDA to grow in-line with our medium-term outlook of between 4-8% and our revenue to grow ahead of EBITDA from a healthy combination of volume and price. The outlook for FY22 reflects our current assessment of the scale and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic  which is subject to change as we continue to monitor ongoing developments. Net Finance Costs: Net pension interest expenses and accretion expenses are expected to be in the range of 170 to 200 million USD per quarter  depending on currency and interest rate fluctuations. We expect the average gross debt coupon in FY22 to be approximately 4.0%. Net finance costs will continue to be impacted by any gains and losses related to the hedging of our share-based payment programs. Effective Tax Rates (ETR): We expect the normalized ETR in FY22 to be in the range of 28% to 30%  excluding any gains and losses relating to the hedging of our share-based payment programs. The ETR outlook does not consider the impact of potential future changes in legislation.

References to the High End Company refer to a business unit made up of a portfolio of global  specialty and craft brands across more than 30 countries. Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. They are presented separately because they are important for the understanding of the underlying sustainable performance of the Company due to their size or nature. Normalized measures are additional measures used by management and should not replace the measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company‚Äôs performance. We are reporting the results from Argentina applying hyperinflation accounting  starting from the 3Q18 results release in which we accounted for the hyperinflation impact for the first nine months of 2018. The IFRS rules (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period. These impacts are excluded from organic calculations and are identified separately in the annexes within the column labeled ‚ÄúHyperinflation restatement‚Äù. In HY22  we reported a negative impact on the profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev of 26 million USD. The impact in HY22 normalized EPS was -0.01 USD. Values in the figures and annexes may not add up  due to rounding. 2Q22 and HY22 EPS is based upon a weighted average of 2 012 million shares compared to a weighted average of 2 004 million shares for 2Q21 and HY21.Legal disclaimerThis release contains ‚Äúforward-looking statements‚Äù.

The statutory auditors conducted an interim review of these half-year financial statements.Record H1 results (PRNewswire)‚Ç¨m - IFRS H1 2021 H1 2022 Change Revenue 50.8 63.3 +25 % Gross margin 27.8 33.5 +21 % % of revenue 54.7 % 52.9 %Operating expenses 25.9 29.3 +13 % EBITDA1 9.4 10.8 +15 % % of revenue 18.4 % 17.0 %Current operating income 1.9 4.1 +117 % Operating income/(loss) 1.8 4.2 +129 % Consolidated net income/(loss) 1.6 5.2 +225 % % of revenue 3.2 % 8.2 %1EBITDA (Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) corresponds to current operating income restated for (i) amortization  depreciation and provisions  and (ii) income and expenses relating to share-based payments.Record half-year revenue with 25% growthAt the end of the first half of 2022  Ekinops' consolidated revenue stood at ‚Ç¨63.3 million versus ‚Ç¨50.8 million in the previous year  representing robust growth of 25%. At constant scope and exchange rates  half-year growth was 20%.This trend is the result of solid momentum in all the Group's activities: +31% for optical transport equipment  +21% for Access solutions and +47% for software and services  which now represent 15% of the group's revenue as a result of the success of SDN (Software Defined Networks) and virtualization solutions.In geographic terms  half-year sales grew significantly by 48% in North America (33% in USD)  reaching 20% of the group's business for the first time. Asia-Pacific continued on the growth trajectory that began in H2 2021 with a very sustained 80% increase in half-year sales. Sales in EMEA  in which 38% of the group's activity is generated  grew 6% compared with the same period in the previous year. After a first quarter in which activity in France remained virtually stable  the group's sales returned to steady growth of 29% in the semester.Gross margin of 52.9%  within the target range  despite the components crisisAs a result of the very strong sales momentum over the semester and the increase in the share of software and services in the business mix  gross margin for the period was ‚Ç¨33.5 million  up 21% from the same period a year earlier.Gross margin thus represented 52.9% of consolidated revenue in H1 2022. This figure is in line with the group's targets and is within the long-term target range (52%-56%)  despite the components crisis  which is continuing in 2022.EBITDA margin of 17.0% in H1 2022  towards the top of the target rangeAs of June 30  2022  H1 EBITDA was ‚Ç¨10.8 million versus ‚Ç¨9.4 million in H1 2021  with a contained increase in operating expenses (13%). At the same time  the Group made the investments needed to support its growth and development (24 net new hires in the period  and equipment purchases  mainly for R&D purposes).The EBITDA margin stood at 17.0% in H1 2022  at the high end of FY 2022 target range (14%-18%)  versus 16.9% for FY 2021.After net depreciation  amortization and provisions (‚Ç¨5.3 million  of which ‚Ç¨3.0 million in amortization related to technologies and purchase price allocation) and non-cash expenses relating to share-based payments (‚Ç¨0.9 million) and the associated employer contributions (‚Ç¨0.4 million)  current operating income (EBIT) amounted to ‚Ç¨4.1 million in H1 2022  representing significant growth of 117% from the previous year. The current operating margin was 6.5% of revenue  versus 3.7% in H1 2021. Excluding amortization related to the intangible assets identified post purchase price allocation  pro forma EBIT was 11.2%.In the absence of other material operating income and expenses in H1 2022  operating income came to ‚Ç¨4.2 million versus ‚Ç¨1.8 million a year earlier  representing growth of 129%.Record net margin of 8.2% in H1 2022After accounting for ‚Ç¨0.9 million in financial income from foreign exchange gains and the recognition of a positive tax result of ‚Ç¨0.2 million  net income for the period leapt by +225% to ‚Ç¨5.2 million  higher than that achieved in FY 2021 (‚Ç¨4.8 million).The net margin for H1 2022 was 8.2%  a record level  versus 3.2% a year earlier and 4.6% for the whole of the FY 2021.Net cash of ‚Ç¨19.3 million at June 30  2022In H1 2022  Ekinops generated cash flow of ‚Ç¨10.7 million versus ‚Ç¨9.2 million in H1 2021  a 17% increase.With working capital increased by ‚Ç¨8.3 million  versus a change in working capital of ‚Ç¨4.3 million a year earlier  as a result of very buoyant levels of activity  operating cash flow was ‚Ç¨2.2 million versus ‚Ç¨4.6 million in H1 2021.Cash flow from investing activities amounted to a ‚Ç¨2.8 million outflow (versus ‚Ç¨2.1 million a year earlier)  with CAPEX of ‚Ç¨2.7 million  comprising ‚Ç¨1.6 million of capitalized R&D expenditure and ‚Ç¨1.1 million of expenditure on fixed assets.Cash flow from financing activities was -‚Ç¨3.6 million  including -‚Ç¨3.1 of repayments under bank loans.

Visit www.verimatrix.com .Supplementary non-IFRS financial informationVerimatrix uses performance indicators that are not strictly accounting measures in accordance with IFRS. They are defined in Appendix 1 of this press release. They should be considered as additional information  which cannot replace any other strictly accounting-based operating or financial performance measure  as presented in the consolidated financial statements  including the income statement set out in Appendix 1 hereof.Forward-looking statementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements concerning Verimatrix. Although Verimatrix believes its expectations to be based on reasonable assumptions  they do not constitute guarantees of future performance. Accordingly  the Company‚Äôs actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements owing to a number of risks and uncertainties.Appendix 1 - Supplementary non-IFRS financial information - Reconciliation of IFRS results with adjusted resultsADVERTISEMENTThe performance indicators presented in this press release that are not strictly accounting measures are defined below. These indicators are not defined under IFRS  and do not constitute accounting elements used to measure the company‚Äôs financial performance. They should be considered as additional information  which cannot replace any other strictly accounting-based operating or financial performance measure  as presented in the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements and their related notes. The company uses these indicators because it believes they are useful measures of its recurring operating performance and its operating cash flows. Although they are widely used by companies operating in the same industry around the world  these indicators are not necessarily directly comparable to those of other companies  which may have defined or calculated their indicators differently than the company  even though they use similar terms.Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit before (i) the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations  (ii) any potential goodwill impairment  (iii) share-based payment expense and (iv) non-recurring costs associated with restructuring and business combinations and divestiture undertaken by the company.ADVERTISEMENTAdjusted operating income/(loss) is defined as operating income/(loss) before (i) the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations  (ii) any potential goodwill impairment  (iii) share-based payment expense and (iv) non-recurring costs associated with restructuring and business combinations and divestiture undertaken by the company.EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating income before depreciation  amortization and impairment expenses not related to business combinations.Annual Recurring Revenue   or ARR   corresponds annualized value of all recurring revenues from current contracts at the time of measurement. ARR includes all contract types that are recurring in nature  such as maintenance & support  SaaS and non-SaaS subscriptions  and for which revenue is currently being recognized. The ARR is a rolling number that accumulates over time whereas the Total Contract Value (or TCV) metric also used by the Company  is typically used to measure (new or incremental) sales bookings within a period. The Company computes an ARR for SaaS and non-SaaS subscriptions and another combining subscriptions and maintenance.View source version on businesswire.com:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220728005744/en/ADVERTISEMENTCONTACT: Investor and media contactsInvestor RelationsJean-Fran√ßois LabadieChief Financial Officer+33 (0)4 42 905 905finance@verimatrix.comFinancial PressMathias Jordan+33 (0)1 56 88 11 26mjordan@actifin.frVerimatrix Media Contact:Matthew Zintel+1 281 444 1590matthew.zintel@zintelpr.comKEYWORD: EUROPE UNITED STATES NORTH AMERICA FRANCEINDUSTRY KEYWORD: TECHNOLOGY MOBILE/WIRELESS ONLINE PRIVACY AUDIO/VIDEO APPS/APPLICATIONS OTHER TECHNOLOGY IOT (INTERNET OF THINGS) SOFTWARE NETWORKS INTERNET HARDWARE DATA MANAGEMENT SECURITY CONSUMER ELECTRONICSSOURCE: VerimatrixCopyright Business Wire 2022.PUB: 07/28/2022 12:00 PM/DISC: 07/28/2022 12:02 PMhttp://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220728005744/en,neutral,0.03,0.93,0.03,mixed,0.29,0.34,0.37,True,English,"['Asaf Ashkenazi', 'CEO', 'Verimatrix', 'other strictly accounting-based operating', 'recurring subscription-based revenue sources', 'Supplementary non-IFRS financial information', 'ongoing business model transformation', 'ADVERTISEMENT Adjusted operating income', 'Chief Operating Officer', 'operating cash flows', 'Amedeo D‚ÄôAngelo', 'live streaming sports', 'valuable revenue streams', 'share-based payment expense', 'Annual Recurring Revenue', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'potential goodwill impairment', 'recurring operating performance', 'financial performance measure', 'consolidated financial statements', 'critical mobile applications', 'Adjusted gross profit', 'Verimatrix governance structure', 'Third-quarter revenue', 'additional information', 'adjusted results', 'recurring revenues', 'Financial calendar', 'sensitive financial', 'other companies', 'impairment expenses', 'income statement', 'future performance', 'Forward-looking statements', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'new business', 'business combinations', 'Executive Chairman', 'SAN DIEGO', 'Regulatory News', 'new products', 'strategic development', 'marketing operations', 'distinct mix', 'cybersecurity expertise', 'management successes', 'previous positions', 'key roles', 'digital content', 'intuitive, people-centered', 'Leading brands', 'premium movies', 'healthcare data', 'trusted connections', 'compelling content', 'press release', 'reasonable assumptions', 'actual results', 'accounting elements', 'related notes', 'same industry', 'similar terms', 'intangible assets', 'non-recurring costs', 'annualized value', 'current contracts', 'contract types', 'performance indicators', 'Asaf Ashkenazi', 'Euronext Paris', 'accounting measures', 'useful measures', 'frictionless security', 'IFRS results', 'AIX-EN-PROVENCE', 'France', 'Jul', 'VMX', 'appointment', 'company', 'evolution', 'reinforcement', 'needs', 'progression', 'CEO', 'sales', 'Qualcomm', 'Motorola', 'October', 'modern', 'world', 'devices', 'everything', 'mission', 'customers', 'experiences', 'millions', 'consumers', 'partners', 'accordance', 'Appendix', 'expectations', 'guarantees', 'number', 'risks', 'uncertainties', 'Reconciliation', 'amortization', 'restructuring', 'divestiture', 'loss', 'EBITDA', 'depreciation', 'ARR', 'time', 'measurement', 'nature', 'maintenance', 'support', 'SaaS']",2022-07-28,2022-07-28,apnews.com
