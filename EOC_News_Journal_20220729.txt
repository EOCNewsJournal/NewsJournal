In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  July 28  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity”  which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

The mass media holding company already owns 57% of Lagardere following a bid for all of the shares of the group  which is also home to flagship news publications such as JDD and Paris Match.Vivendi has said it is ready to spend as much as 2 billion euros to acquire all of Lagardere's shares.But Vivendi's voting rights in Lagardere are capped at 23% until a merger approval by competition authorities.Vivendi reported that its revenue in the first half of the year was 4.87 billion euros  up 5.4% on an underlying basis from the same period a year earlier. The growth was driven by international operations at its pay-TV unit Canal Plus.Core operating profits over the period were up by 28% on an underlying basis from a year earlier to 412 million euros  it said  thanks to its advertising unit Havas and Canal Plus.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterReporting by Mathieu Rosemain; editing by David Evans and Paul SimaoOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",neutral,0.03,0.86,0.11,mixed,0.31,0.18,0.52,True,English,"['publishing division', 'Vivendi', 'spin-off', 'Editis', 'Reuters', 'The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles', 'Several best-selling French authors', 'mass media holding company', 'two biggest publishing groups', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'French media giant Vivendi', 'pay-TV unit Canal Plus', 'The Vivendi-Lagardere tie-up', 'telecoms conglomerate headquarters', 'French media group', 'new publishing behemoth', 'FREE unlimited access', 'Arnaud de Puyfontaine', 'flagship news publications', 'Core operating profits', 'Reuters.com Register', 'billionaire Vincent Bollore', 'publishing unit', 'advertising unit', 'Charles Platiau', 'top investor', 'antitrust hurdles', 'European Union', 'antitrust authorities', 'independent publishers', 'famous one', 'competition) hurdles', 'best one', 'simultaneous distribution', 'controlling shareholder', 'Paris Match', '2 billion euros', 'voting rights', 'merger approval', 'competition authorities', 'first half', '4.87 billion euros', 'underlying basis', 'international operations', '412 million euros', 'Mathieu Rosemain', 'David Evans', 'Paul Simao', 'potential sale', 'same period', 'Vivendi shareholders', 'Editis shares', 'woman', 'signage', 'entertainment', 'France', 'LAGA.', 'combination', 'Hachette', 'prospect', 'wave', 'criticism', 'Gallimard', 'CEO', 'call', 'investors', 'remedy', 'stakeholders', 'details', 'valuation', 'timeline', 'disposal', 'plan', 'transaction', 'listing', '29% stake', 'bid', 'JDD', 'revenue', 'year', 'growth', 'Havas', 'Reporting', 'editing', 'Standards']",2022-07-28,2022-07-29,reuters.com

This key milestone in the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group was completed on schedule in just 14 months  following the announcement of this strategic decision in April 2021.This move allows Euronext to fully control and directly manage its core IT infrastructure  as well as a key service to clients  colocation  which was previously outsourced. It also allows the generation of colocation revenues  embedded in the upgraded synergies.The Core Data Centre migration has been timed in order to pave the way for the migration of the Borsa Italiana equity and derivatives markets onto the Euronext Optiq® trading platform as soon as 2023.The migration to the new green Core Data Centre represents a key milestone in Euronext’s “Fit for 1.5°” commitment  part of its ESG strategy. Located in the Aruba Global Cloud Data Centre IT3’s certified and energy-efficient buildings  the new Core Data Centre is entirely powered by renewable energy  much of it self-produced through a large photovoltaic system and a hydroelectric unit.Announcement of Euronext’s climate targets in line with the science-based targets initiativeOn 21 June 2022  Euronext announced its science-based climate targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with the Paris Agreement  based on the framework provided by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)17. These targets support Euronext’s recently announced ""Fit for 1.5°” commitment to net zero through the “Business Ambition for 1.5°” initiative in partnership with the United Nations Climate Change “Race to Zero” campaign. Euronext’s ESG commitment is a key pillar of Euronext’s “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan announced in November 2021.Applying the SBTi methodology to Euronext’s emissions leads to the formulation of the following targets:Operational emissions contraction target By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 70% compared to 2020; By 2030  Euronext will reduce its Scope 3 travel emissions by at least 46.2% compared to 2019.Supplier engagement target By 2027  Euronext suppliers  representing 67% of Euronext’s greenhouse gas emissions derived from purchased goods and services  must set targets on their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.These are emissions reduction or contraction targets which cannot be achieved through the purchase of offsetting credits.Euronext set out the following measures to achieve its targets:Scope 1 emissions will be reduced through consolidation and energy efficiency upgrades in the building portfolio  energy efficiency investments  decommissioning of gas-fired boilers and decarbonisation of the vehicle fleet;Scope 2 emissions will be reduced by moving office space and data centres to renewable energy  including through the move of Euronext’s Core Data Centre to the Aruba Data Centre near Bergamo  Italy. The new Core Data Centre is powered 100% by renewable energy sources and self-produces energy through solar panels and its own hydroelectric power stations;Travel emissions will be reduced by implementing a sustainable travel programme;Euronext will engage its key suppliers directly and will deploy a new supplier onboarding platform  which will support the ‘Euronext Supplier Code of Conduct’  including provisions regarding environmental protection  human rights  diversity and inclusion;Euronext will engage its staff through Climate Workshops  organised in partnership with Climate Fresk  which aim to develop awareness and ability to act by keeping environmental impacts in mind  at both individual and company level.Acquisition of the technology businesses from Nexi’s capital markets activitiesOn 14 June 2022  Euronext announced the signing of the sale by Nexi and purchase by Euronext of the technology businesses currently powering MTS  Euronext’s leading fixed-income trading platform  and Euronext Securities Milan (the Transaction). The purchase price will be paid in cash  and amounts toc. €57 million (on a debt free  cash free basis)  subject to customary closing adjustments.This Transaction is a new step in Euronext’s strategy to leverage its integrated value chain as it further enhances Euronext’s technology competencies and capabilities in trading and post trade.The Transaction will also strengthen the core operations of MTS and Euronext Securities Milan  which joined Euronext in April 2021. With this Transaction  Euronext internalises the core trading platform of MTS and its largest IT contract. It enables Euronext to become more agile and efficient by fully owning the technology powering MTS and Euronext Securities Milan.The Transaction  which will be realised through Euronext’s subsidiaries MTS and Euronext Securities Milan  is expected to close in the second half of 2022 and is subject to the customary approvals from the competent authorities and completion of the union consultation procedure.Euronext Clearing introduces VaR-based margin methodologyOn 21 June 2022  Euronext announced the introduction of a new VaR-based margin methodology for government bonds traded on the MTS cash and repo platforms and BrokerTec on MOT  EuroTLX and Hi-MTF platforms.The introduction of the new methodology falls under the next-to-come market best practice  applying state-of-the-art risk principles and parameters. It is a first major step toward the European expansion of Euronext Clearing  marking an important milestone of the Euronext “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan.The VaR-based margin methodology for Italian  Portuguese  Spanish  and Irish government bonds has been live since 20 June 2022  as part of the continuous evolution of Euronext Clearing Risk Management systems  replacing the MVP SPAN-like margin methodology that currently applies to all other bond instruments.Corporate highlights since 30 June 2022Recent developments on Euronext ClearingEuronext Clearing has engaged in an important transformation aimed at preparing to serve all Euronext cash and derivatives markets and further develop the relationship with European and international clients as clearing members.In June 2022  Euronext Clearing introduced a VaR-based margin methodology for fixed-income instruments. Furthermore  Euronext Clearing expects to expand the adoption of VaR-based margin methodology for equity and derivatives instruments in 2023 and 2024  enabling clearing members to better manage their collateral requirements.In addition  in July 2022  Euronext Clearing reduced its investment portfolio with the aim of strengthening and preserving its available regulatory capital and aligning the investment strategy to the current level of market volatility and uncertainty.As a result  Euronext Clearing disposed of its portfolio maturing after 1st May 2023. A post-tax loss of 35 million euros on this transaction will be recorded in Q3 2022. Euronext Clearing decided to retain its short-term investment portfolio maturing through April 2023 and hold these to maturity. At the beginning of Q2 2023  Euronext Clearing will no longer have an outright portfolio.The capital impact reported on the sale of the portfolio will be more than compensated by a reduction of the regulatory capital requirement linked to the security portfolio. Therefore  the available regulatory capital surplus at Euronext Clearing is estimated to increase.As the sale of the portfolio will have no negative impact on the available capital of the Group  Euronext decided that the dividend for the fiscal year 2022 will be adjusted to neutralize any negative impact from this operation.Launch of Tech Leaders indexOn 6 July 2022  Euronext announced that it has launched the Euronext® Tech Leaders Index  following the kick-off of the Euronext Tech Leaders initiative in June 2022.

The statutory auditors conducted an interim review of these half-year financial statements.Record H1 results€m - IFRS H1 2021 H1 2022 Change Revenue 50.8 63.3 +25 % Gross margin 27.8 33.5 +21 % % of revenue 54.7 % 52.9 %Operating expenses 25.9 29.3 +13 % EBITDA1 9.4 10.8 +15 % % of revenue 18.4 % 17.0 %Current operating income 1.9 4.1 +117 % Operating income/(loss) 1.8 4.2 +129 % Consolidated net income/(loss) 1.6 5.2 +225 % % of revenue 3.2 % 8.2 %1EBITDA (Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) corresponds to current operating income restated for (i) amortization  depreciation and provisions  and (ii) income and expenses relating to share-based payments.Record half-year revenue with 25% growthAt the end of the first half of 2022  Ekinops' consolidated revenue stood at €63.3 million versus €50.8 million in the previous year  representing robust growth of 25%. At constant scope and exchange rates  half-year growth was 20%.This trend is the result of solid momentum in all the Group's activities: +31% for optical transport equipment  +21% for Access solutions and +47% for software and services  which now represent 15% of the group's revenue as a result of the success of SDN (Software Defined Networks) and virtualization solutions.In geographic terms  half-year sales grew significantly by 48% in North America (33% in USD)  reaching 20% of the group's business for the first time. Asia-Pacific continued on the growth trajectory that began in H2 2021 with a very sustained 80% increase in half-year sales. Sales in EMEA  in which 38% of the group's activity is generated  grew 6% compared with the same period in the previous year. After a first quarter in which activity in France remained virtually stable  the group's sales returned to steady growth of 29% in the semester.Story continuesGross margin of 52.9%  within the target range  despite the components crisisAs a result of the very strong sales momentum over the semester and the increase in the share of software and services in the business mix  gross margin for the period was €33.5 million  up 21% from the same period a year earlier.Gross margin thus represented 52.9% of consolidated revenue in H1 2022. This figure is in line with the group's targets and is within the long-term target range (52%-56%)  despite the components crisis  which is continuing in 2022.EBITDA margin of 17.0% in H1 2022  towards the top of the target rangeAs of June 30  2022  H1 EBITDA was €10.8 million versus €9.4 million in H1 2021  with a contained increase in operating expenses (13%). At the same time  the Group made the investments needed to support its growth and development (24 net new hires in the period  and equipment purchases  mainly for R&D purposes).The EBITDA margin stood at 17.0% in H1 2022  at the high end of FY 2022 target range (14%-18%)  versus 16.9% for FY 2021.After net depreciation  amortization and provisions (€5.3 million  of which €3.0 million in amortization related to technologies and purchase price allocation) and non-cash expenses relating to share-based payments (€0.9 million) and the associated employer contributions (€0.4 million)  current operating income (EBIT) amounted to €4.1 million in H1 2022  representing significant growth of 117% from the previous year. The current operating margin was 6.5% of revenue  versus 3.7% in H1 2021. Excluding amortization related to the intangible assets identified post purchase price allocation  pro forma EBIT was 11.2%.In the absence of other material operating income and expenses in H1 2022  operating income came to €4.2 million versus €1.8 million a year earlier  representing growth of 129%.Record net margin of 8.2% in H1 2022After accounting for €0.9 million in financial income from foreign exchange gains and the recognition of a positive tax result of €0.2 million  net income for the period leapt by +225% to €5.2 million  higher than that achieved in FY 2021 (€4.8 million).The net margin for H1 2022 was 8.2%  a record level  versus 3.2% a year earlier and 4.6% for the whole of the FY 2021.Net cash of €19.3 million at June 30  2022In H1 2022  Ekinops generated cash flow of €10.7 million versus €9.2 million in H1 2021  a 17% increase.With working capital increased by €8.3 million  versus a change in working capital of €4.3 million a year earlier  as a result of very buoyant levels of activity  operating cash flow was €2.2 million versus €4.6 million in H1 2021.Cash flow from investing activities amounted to a €2.8 million outflow (versus €2.1 million a year earlier)  with CAPEX of €2.7 million  comprising €1.6 million of capitalized R&D expenditure and €1.1 million of expenditure on fixed assets.Cash flow from financing activities was -€3.6 million  including -€3.1 of repayments under bank loans. No new loans were taken out during the semester.As of June 30  2022  cash and cash equivalents stood at €41.4 million  for financial borrowings of €22.1 million.

It has not  however  had any major impact on the group's activity thanks to its effective management of its supply chain and has demonstrated its agility in sourcing and managing its inventories since the start of the crisis.As of June 30  2022  Ekinops raises its organic growth guidance and reiterates its gross margin and EBITDA targets for 2022 fiscal year:organic growth over +15%   versus more than 12% initially targeted;gross margin of between 52% and 56%  in line with the long-term goal and factoring in the impact of the supply chain crisis on electronic components;EBITDA margin between 14% and 18%  integrating human and technological investments to execute the new growth plan.Given its sound financial position  Ekinops continues to very actively pursue external growth and explore all acquisition opportunities that could create value for the company.EKINOPS ContactsDidier BrédyChairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frEkinops Logo (PRNewsfoto/Ekinops)CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ekinops-delivers-ebitda-margin-at-17-0-and-25-revenue-growth-in-h1-2022--301595462.htmlSOURCE Ekinops,neutral,0.04,0.93,0.02,positive,0.56,0.36,0.08,True,English,"['EBITDA margin', '25% revenue growth', 'Ekinops', 'H1', 'capitalized R&D expenditure', 'other material operating income', 'R&D purposes', 'purchase price allocation', 'optical transport equipment', 'foreign exchange gains', 'Current operating income', 'half-year financial statements', 'long-term target range', 'current operating margin', 'Software Defined Networks', 'Consolidated net income', 'positive tax result', 'Record net margin', 'strong sales momentum', 'Record H1 results', 'operating cash flow', 'H1 2022 financial statements', 'Record half-year revenue', 'FY 2022 target range', ""Ekinops' consolidated revenue"", 'financial income', 'H1 2022 Change Revenue', 'record level', 'exchange rates', 'solid momentum', 'equipment purchases', 'Net cash', 'Operating expenses', 'Gross margin', 'EBITDA margin', 'half-year sales', 'half-year growth', 'leading supplier', 'telecommunications solutions', 'telecom operators', 'statutory auditors', 'interim review', 'share-based payments', 'first half', 'previous year', 'constant scope', 'Access solutions', 'virtualization solutions', 'geographic terms', 'North America', 'first time', 'first quarter', 'components crisis', 'same time', 'employer contributions', 'intangible assets', 'working capital', 'buoyant levels', '€2.8 million outflow', 'fixed assets', 'cash expenses', 'net depreciation', 'robust growth', 'growth trajectory', 'steady growth', 'significant growth', 'Euronext Paris', 'business mix', 'high end', 'investing activities', 'H1 EBITDA', 'same period', 'sustained 80% increase', '2022 revenue', '25% growth', '17% increase', 'guidance', 'July', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', 'June', 'Board', 'Directors', 'IFRS', 'EBITDA1', '1EBITDA', 'Earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'amortization', 'provisions', 'trend', 'Group', 'services', 'success', 'SDN', 'USD', 'Asia-Pacific', 'H2', 'EMEA', 'activity', 'France', 'semester', 'Story', 'figure', 'line', 'targets', 'top', 'investments', 'development', 'technologies', 'forma', 'absence', 'recognition', 'CAPEX', 'financin', '16.', '8.']",2022-07-28,2022-07-29,finance.yahoo.com

8297,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/technicolor-first-half-2022-results-154700806.html,Technicolor: First Half 2022 Results,PRESS RELEASE Technicolor: First Half 2022 Results Paris (France)  July 28th  2022 – Technicolor (Euronext Paris: TCH; OTCQX: TCLRY) is today announcing its ...,"TECHNICOLORPRESS RELEASETechnicolor: First Half 2022 ResultsParis (France)  July 28th  2022 – Technicolor (Euronext Paris: TCH; OTCQX: TCLRY) is today announcing its results for the first half 2022. The Board of Directors of Technicolor S.A.  meeting today  approved the Group's first half 2022 accounts and guidance.G ood set of results with strong performance across all divisions extending the positive momentum from the first quarter   and leading to improved f inancial performance of the Group compared to the first half 2021 : R evenues of € 1 601 million  up 18.4% (+8.8% at constant exchange rate); Adjusted EBITDA of € 134 million   up € 40 million (+€29 million at constant exchange rate)  with margin improving by 139 basis points to 8.4% of revenues; Free Cash Flow before f inancial and t ax es of €( 35 ) million   up € 1 80 million (+€178 million at constant exchange rate) with positive FCF of €90 million generated over the second quarter of 2022;Technicolor confirms its 2022 guidance 1 ;Completion in May 2022 of the sale of the Trademark Licensing operations for an approximately €100 million cash consideration;The 65% partial spin-off of Technicolor Creative Studios is on track to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.Richard Moat  Chief Executive Officer of Technicolor  said:“Technicolor’s divisions continued to perform well despite facing ongoing industry-related headwinds  which reflects the strength and leadership position of our businesses. The Group’s performance improved significantly in the first half of 2022 compared to the first half of 2021  driven by overall strong demand across almost all divisions. In addition  our businesses continue to benefit from an improved cost base and from operational efficiencies  enabling them to navigate ongoing supply chain constraints  as well as restricted advertising spending. With robust demand across most of our businesses  I am pleased to confirm this year’s guidance.In parallel  we have made significant progress in the partial spin-off of Technicolor Creative Studios along with the full refinancing of our existing debt  thanks to the overwhelming support we have had from all our stakeholders. We are well on track to create two leading independent companies  Technicolor Creative Studios and Vantiva  with solid foundations for long term growth.Story continuesI want to thank our teams for doing an outstanding job in handling our day-to-day operations  and supporting us in leading Technicolor into a new chapter of value creation.”I- H1 2022 key highlights and 2022 OutlookFirst Half In € million  continuing operations2 2022 2021 Actual Change Change at constant rate Revenues 1 601 1 352 18.4% 8.8% Adjusted EBITDA 134 94 43.1% 30.7% As a % of revenues 8.4% 6.9% 145 bps 139 bps Adjusted EBITA 48 10 na na Free Cash Flow before financial and taxes (35) (215) +83.5% +82.9%The first half of 2022 registered a good set of results driven by strong demand for Technicolor Creative Studios and Connected Home products  despite a trading environment marked by persistent fulfillment difficulties.First half 2022 revenues amounted to €1 601 million  up 18.4% (up 8.8% at constant exchange rate  up 11.2% at constant exchange rate and perimeter). This good performance was notably driven by a high level of demand for Technicolor Creative Studios and Connected Home products and services  despite continued supply constraints and decelerating advertising spending growth in Q2 2022 compared with a high comparative base in H1 2021.First half 2022 Adjusted EBITDA of €134 million improved by €40 million (up €29 million at constant exchange rate). Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 145 basis points (+139 basis points at constant exchange rate) to 8.4% of revenues  resulting from higher revenues and significant cost savings and operating efficiencies achieved across all divisions. This led to a +€38 million adjusted EBITA improvement compared to the first half 2021  reaching €48 million.Free Cash Flow from continuing operations before financial and taxes amounted to €(35) million compared to €(215) million in the first half of 2021. This €178 million improvement at constant currency mainly resulted from better operating performance and lower change in working capital requirements at Connected Home  along with lower restructuring expenses  mainly through the second quarter of 2022. In the sole second quarter  Free Cash Flow from continuing operations before financial and taxes improved by €105 million (€96 million at constant exchange rate) with €90 million FCF generated over the second quarter of 2022.OutlookThe Group confirms its 2022 guidance along with the outlook for its divisions as published on June 6th  2022:Demand for Technicolor Creative Studios’ highest quality VFX & Animation artistry and cutting-edge technology is expected to continue to grow significantly throughout 2022 and 2023. At MPC and Mikros Animation  the divisions continue to be awarded multiple new projects  resulting in more than 85% of the revenue pipeline for MPC and Mikros Animation being already committed for 2022 as of the end of June 2022. In addition  the number of feature animation projects in production has grown from two in 2019 to six features in 2022; At The Mill  whose activity is closely correlated to advertising spending  activity growth is being restricted by the current global economic environment. As a result  as communicated on June 6 th   2022  The Mill is expecting slower growth than initially anticipated earlier this year  with the main impact in 2022. Actions to mitigate the impact on margin have already been identified and initiated relating to costs and operational efficiencies; At Technicolor Games  demand for games content is expected to continue growing  along with the expansion of the Technicolor Games service offering beyond art services into co-development and quality assurance (“QA”) services;Significant investment in artist recruitment  retention  and training (including TCS Academy programs) continues  as delivering all pipeline projects remains the main challenge for 2022  as a consequence of the shortage of talent in the market.Worldwide demand for Connected Home broadband equipment is expected to remain strong in 2022  as customers seek to improve their connectivity. However  ongoing component shortages and pricing challenges will continue to impact our ability to serve end customer demand for broadband products throughout 2022  although we are starting to see signs of improvements. Furthermore  while we do not have any assets or direct customers or suppliers in Russia and Ukraine  the ongoing conflict has generated additional uncertainty in terms of supply. This has led to an increase in transit times to some European customers  as we transition from rail to sea transportation for products that used to move through Russia. Nonetheless  efficiency measures  gradual improvements in delivery and continuous discussions with both suppliers and customers should continue to help offset these headwinds.For V antiva Supply Chain Services (formerly DVD Services)  solid year-on-year new release volumes are expected as theatrical attendance continues to normalize  but this will be more than offset by lower catalog volumes driven by evolving customer and retailer behavior. Financial performance will be improved through continuing cost efficiencies. As part of the Group’s plan to accelerate the diversification of the business  the division is continuing to work on significantly expanding non-disc activities.The Group delivered €171 million of cost savings in 2020  €116 million in 2021  and €30 million in the first half 2022. These results  combined with continuous improvements in efficiency  are keeping Technicolor on track to deliver a cumulative €325 million in run rate cost savings by the end of 2022.As a result  the Group Technicolor confirms its 2022 guidance “as is” with:Revenue from continuing operations is expected to grow;Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of €361 million;Adjusted EBITA from continuing operations of €161 million;FCF from continuing operations  before financial results and tax  of €217 million.Technicolor results are sensitive to the valuation of its main currencies - notably the US dollar  the Canadian dollar  and the British pound – which have evolved favorably since the beginning of the year. Hedging arrangements are in place to mitigate forex risks. This 2022 guidance for Technicolor group assumes external macroeconomic assumptions  including a EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.15  EUR/CAD of 1.52  and EUR/GBP of 0.89. It also includes management assumptions reflecting the IFRIC interpretation on Saas adjustment  excludes Trademark Licensing operations  and does not include the TCS spin-off.II- Update on Technicolor’s intention to list 65% of Technicolor Creative Studios and on the early refinancing of Technicolor’s existing debtThe Group is making good progress on the implementation of the Technicolor Creative Studios spin-off plan and the refinancing of Group debt:On February 24th  2022  the Group published its intention to list and spin-off 65% of Technicolor Creative Studios through a distribution-in-kind to Technicolor shareholders  and to fully refinance the existing debt structure;The Extraordinary General Meeting for the approval of the Mandatory Convertible Notes (MCN) was held on May 6 th   2022. The proposed issuance of Mandatory Convertible Notes (“MCN”) to be subscribed by a group of named beneficiaries for a total nominal amount of €300 million was approved  and all necessary powers were given to the Board of Directors to implement the issuance;On June 14 th   2022  the Group announced the launch of its new brand: Vantiva. The new brand will be composed of Connected Home and Vantiva Supply Chain Services (formerly named “DVD Services”).The Group has also appointed the leadership teams for the two new entities: At Vantiva   Richard Moat  current CEO of Technicolor  will be appointed Chairman  Luis Martinez-Amago  current President of Connected Home  will be appointed CEO  and Lars Ihlen  current CFO of Connected Home  will be appointed CFO; At Technicolor Creative Studios (TCS)  Anne Bouverot  current Chairperson of Technicolor  will be appointed Chairperson  Christian Roberton  current President of TCS  CEO  and Laurent Carozzi  current CFO of Technicolor  will be appointed CFO.As part of the refinancing process  Technicolor S.A. has finalized discussions for both Vantiva and TCS: For Vantiva  Barclays Bank and Angelo Gordon have committed to provide a €375 million debt package to Vantiva. In parallel  advanced discussions are underway with Wells Fargo to extend the Asset-Based Lending (ABL) Facility for 4 years; For TCS  the Group has obtained commitments for a €623 million floating rate First Lien Term Facility. This facility is composed of two tranches  a €563 million tranche and a $60 million tranche. Maturity for both tranches will be 4 years. In addition  the Group has obtained commitments for a €40 million Revolving Credit Facility. The terms of the TCS refinancing as well as the terms of the distribution will be subject to a prospectus to be approved by the AMF.Technicolor will convene a Shareholders Meeting on September 6th  2022  and the notice of this meeting will be published in the BALO (mandatory legal announcement bulletin) on August 1st  2022. It will be proposed that the shareholders vote on the change of the corporate name of Technicolor S.A. to Vantiva S.A.  and on the matters related to the distribution in kind of at least 65% of the capital of Technicolor Creative Studios (""TCS"") to the shareholders of Technicolor S.A.. This will enable the latter to receive TCS shares while remaining shareholders of Technicolor  on the basis of one Technicolor Creative Studios share for one Technicolor share. The Distribution will also result in the admission of the TCS shares to the regulated market of Euronext Paris (“Euronext Paris”).The spin-off is expected to be completed in Q3 2022  subject to (i) the shareholders’ approval of the terms of the spin-off on September 6th  2022  and (ii) customary conditions  consultations and regulatory approvals.III- Segment Review – First Half 2022 Results HighlightsTechnicolor Creative StudiosTechnicolor Creative Studios revenues amounted to €408 million in the first half 2022  up 38.3% (up 29.6% at constant rate) compared to H1 2021. Excluding the Post-Production business divested in April 2021  revenue growth was 53.3% (43.7% at constant exchange rate) compared to H1 2021. This improvement resulted from the significant demand for original content compared to the first half 2021  and was achieved despite the market shortage of talent and decelerating advertising spending growth in Q2 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions.At MPC  revenues more than doubled compared to H1 2021  driven by the continued ramp up in production of major theatrical projects  as well as increasing contributions from all the major streaming platforms. H1 2021 was still suffering from pandemic-related impacts on production;At The Mill  advertising revenues decreased in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021 at constant currency (but were slightly up at current exchange rates)  driven by lower year-on-year revenues in the second quarter  as activity was restricted by decelerating advertising spending growth in Q2 2022 compared with a high comparative base in H1 2021;At Mikros Animation revenues were up mainly as a result of higher volumes in feature animation projects;At Technicolor Games  revenues were higher thanks to greater production capacity.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €61 million  up €16 million compared to H1 2021 at constant rate  and Adjusted EBITA was €26 million  up €18 million compared to H1 2021 at constant rate. On top of the increase in revenues  EBITDA margin improvement from 13.7% to 15.0% resulted from the positive impacts of multiple operational transformation programs in conjunction with permanent cost reduction measures. These included mutualization of resources through  for example  the production platform in India  centralized global IT infrastructure  and the consolidation of real estate and other resources in key locations. However  H1 2022 margin was partly reduced by higher costs required to complete major projects  and a shortage of experienced talent is causing delays and additional costs. Lower revenues at The Mill in the second quarter of 2022 also reduced profitability. At The Mill and at MPC  actions to mitigate the impact on margin have already been identified and initiated relating to costs and operational efficiencies. In addition  the Group is actively working on accelerating its recruiting and training plan. Delivering on all projects committed remains the main challenge for 2022.On June 14th  2022 during the capital markets day  Technicolor Creative Studios updated its Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”)  with the goal of becoming more comparable with its peers and market practice  and to further align them with the way the business is managed. These KPIs include Adjusted EBITDA after lease (new definition)  Adjusted EBITA after lease (new definition)  and Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after lease (new definition). TCS’ first half 2022 combined accounts along with an MD&A commenting on these new KPIs will be available in the days to come as part of the Prospectus to be filed with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers.Connected HomeConnected Home revenues totaled €897 million in the first half 2022  up 16.4% (up 5.8% at constant exchange rates) compared the same period in 2021. Although the worldwide semiconductor shortage and supply chain disruptions limited the division’s ability to fully satisfy the demand from its broadband customers  second quarter revenues benefited from the first signs of improvement in the allocation of supply and in transit times. This  combined with broadband now representing 77% of total sales (vs. 64% in H1 2021)  with notably a strong rebound in North America in Q2 2022  is driving revenue improvement  despite decreased video products sales.Adjusted EBITDA was €70 million in the first half 2022 (up 14.4% at constant exchange rate)  or 7.8% of revenue  compared to 7.2% of revenues in the first half 2021. Margin improvement is mainly resulting from operating efficiencies and cost savings  along with sales improvement. H1 2022 Adjusted EBITA was €37 million  +18.0% compared to the first half 2021 at constant rate and representing 4.2% of revenues in the first half.The division continues its collaboration with clients and suppliers to maximize deliveries  and to mitigate potential profitability and working capital impacts of fulfillment difficulties. A significant portion of cost increases is currently passed through to customers. The division continues to focus on selective investments in key customers  platform-based products and partnerships  and on optimizing fixed costs.Vantiva Supply Chain Services ( former DVD Services division)Vantiva Supply Chain Services revenues totaled €296 million in the first half 2022  up 4.5% (down 3.2% at constant exchange rate) compared with first half 2021. Lower disc volumes year-on-year3 (-30%) were driven by expected market declines  and were further exacerbated by the inventories built up in 2021 by the major US studios  which reduced new manufacturing demand in H1 2022. The impact of volume reductions was partially offset by disc price increases  and pass through of cost increases  along with the performance of new growth businesses (notably transportation management and vinyl).In the first half 2022  adjusted EBITDA amounted to €15 million (vs. €10 million in the first half 2021)  representing 5.2% of H1 2022 revenues  compared to 3.6% in H1 2021. EBITDA margin improvement mainly resulted from significant footprint optimization  headcount reductions and higher activity in non-disc activities  partly offset by the impacts of lower disc volumes and higher labor costs in North America and Mexico. Vantiva Supply Chain Services continued to adapt distribution and manufacturing operations  and related customer contract agreements  in response to continued volume reductions.Corporate & OtherCorporate & Other revenues were nil in the first half of 2022  compared with €4 million in the first half 2021. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €(12) million  and Adjusted EBITA was €(15) million.IV- Results analysisP&L analysisFirst Half In € million 2022 2021 Actual Change Change at constant rate Revenues from continuing operations 1 601 1 352 +18.4% +8.8% Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 134 94 +43.1% +30.7% As a % of revenues 8.4% 6.9% +145 bps +139 bps D&A1 & Reserves2  witho PPA amortization (86) (84) Adjusted EBITA from continuing operations 48 10 As a % of revenues 3.0% 0.7% 228 bps 219 bps PPA amortization (20) (19) Non-recurring items (20) (3) EBIT from continuing operations 8 (11) As a % of revenues 0.5% -0.8% Net financial income (loss) (65) (63) Income tax (19) (10) Profit (loss) from continuing operations (77) (84) +8.9% +10.1% Net gain (loss) from discontinued operations 63 5 Net income (loss) (14) (79) +82.6% +83.8%1 Including IT capacity use for rendering in Technicolor Creative Studios of €(4)m in H1 2022 and €0m in H1 20212 Risk  litigation and warranty reservesFirst half 2022 revenues amounted to €1 601 million and were up 18.4% (up 8.8% at constant exchange rates). Excluding change in perimeter (i.e. excluding Post Production)  first half 2022 revenues would have been up 21.0% (up 11.2% at constant exchange rate and perimeter). This good performance was driven by the high level of demand for Technicolor Creative Studios and Connected Home products and services  despite continued supply constraints and decelerating advertising spending growth in Q2 2022 compared with a high comparative base in H1 2021.First half 2022 Adjusted EBITDA of €134 million improved by €40 million (up €29 million at constant exchange rate). Margin improved by 139 basis points to 8.4% of revenues  mainly thanks to higher revenues and improved performance from all divisions and more particularly from Technicolor Creative Studios  resulting from the significant cost savings and operating efficiencies achieved across all divisions.First half 2022 Adjusted EBITA of €48 million represented a €38 million improvement (+€33 million at constant rate) compared to the first half 2021. This resulted mainly from the EBITDA improvement.EBIT from continuing operations was a €8 million profit compared to a €(11) million loss in the first half 2021. This resulted from better operational performance  despite higher non-recurring items. Non-recurring items amounted to €(20) million compared to €(3) million in H1 2021. This increase mainly resulted from positive non-current items of €24 million recorded in H1 2021 (mainly capital gains) compared to negative €(9) million recorded in H1 2022 (mainly related to the ongoing spin off project)  offset by lower restructuring costs of €(8) million in H1 2022 compared to €(26) million in H1 2021.The financial loss totaled €(65) million  compared to €(63) million in the first half 2021.Income tax was up at €(19) million  compared to €(10) million in the first half 2021  mainly due to Technicolor Creative Studios improved performance.Net gain from discontinued operations amounted to €63 million compared to €5 million in the first half 2021. On May 31st  2022  the Group completed the sale of its Trademark Licensing operations  and received a cash consideration of approximately €100 million  subject to customary price adjustments. As a result  the Group has accounted for Trademark Licensing operations as discontinued operations as from January 1  2021.The Group net loss therefore amounted to €(14) million in H1 2022  compared to €(79) million in H1 2021.FCF and debt analysisFirst Half In € million 2022 2021 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 134 94 Capex (57) (40) Non-recurring items (cash impact) (37) (59) Change in working capital and other assets and liabilities1 (76) (211) Free Cash Flow from continuing operations before Tax & Financial (35) (215) 30/06/2022 31/12/2021 Nominal gross debt (including Lease debt) 1 373 1 306 Cash and cash equivalents (168) (196) Net financial debt at nominal value (non IFRS) 1 205 1 110 IFRS adjustment (64) (71) Net financial debt (IFRS) 1 141 1 0391 Including IT capacity use for rendering in Technicolor Creative Studios of €(4) million in H1 2022 and nil in H1 2021Free Cash Flow from continuing operations before financial and taxes improved to €(35) million compared to €(215) million in the first half 2021. This €180 million improvement mainly reflects positive impacts from:I mproved operating performance (adjusted EBITDA was up €40 million);L ower increase of working capital requirements (+€135 million). The change in working capital was €(76) million compared with €(211) million in the first half 2021. This improvement came from a positive variation year-on-year at Connected Home as first half 2021 working capital was notably impacted by the negative impact of reductions in supplier payment terms;Lower non-recurring cash outflows (+€22 million)  notably lower cash restructuring (+€33 million)  principally at the Connected Home and Vantiva Supply Chain Services divisions.These positive impacts were partly offset by:Capex increase of €17 million from €40 million to €57 million  mainly at Technicolor Creative Studios  mostly due to higher activity and higher headcount  and to payment phasing.The cash position at the end of June 2022 was €168 million  compared to €196 million at the end of December 2021. Change in cash over the period was €(28) million  mainly explained by negative €(35) million free cash flow from continuing operations before financial and taxes  and €(36) million net cash interest paid and €(18) million net tax paid over the period  partly offset by the proceeds from the sale of the Trademark Licensing operations. Cash out for operating leases amounted to €21 million  compared to €28 million in the first half 2021. Total liquidity amounts to €216 million  with €48m of the Wells Fargo line available (undrawn at the end of the quarter).As a consequence  net financial debt at nominal value amounted to €1 205 million at the end of June 2022  compared with €1 110 million at the end of December 2021. IFRS net debt amounted to €1 141 million as of June 30  2022  compared with €1 039 million as of December 31  2021. The Net Debt / EBITDA ratio of 4.01x was below the 4.50x covenant.An analyst audio webcast hosted by Richard Moat  CEO and Laurent Carozzi  CFO will be held today  July 28  2022  at 6:30pm CEST.Indicative TimetableAGM to approve the spin offSpin-off of the TCS sharesTechnicolor SA (Vantiva) Q3 communication September 6  2022Q3  2022End November /Early December 2022###Warning: Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

They should be considered as additional information  which cannot replace any other strictly accounting-based operating or financial performance measure  as presented in the consolidated financial statements  including the income statement set out in Appendix 1 hereof.Forward-looking statementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements concerning Verimatrix. Although Verimatrix believes its expectations to be based on reasonable assumptions  they do not constitute guarantees of future performance. Accordingly  the Company’s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements owing to a number of risks and uncertainties.Appendix 1 - Supplementary non-IFRS financial information - Reconciliation of IFRS results with adjusted resultsThe performance indicators presented in this press release that are not strictly accounting measures are defined below. These indicators are not defined under IFRS  and do not constitute accounting elements used to measure the company’s financial performance. They should be considered as additional information  which cannot replace any other strictly accounting-based operating or financial performance measure  as presented in the company’s consolidated financial statements and their related notes. The company uses these indicators because it believes they are useful measures of its recurring operating performance and its operating cash flows. Although they are widely used by companies operating in the same industry around the world  these indicators are not necessarily directly comparable to those of other companies  which may have defined or calculated their indicators differently than the company  even though they use similar terms.Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit before (i) the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations  (ii) any potential goodwill impairment  (iii) share-based payment expense and (iv) non-recurring costs associated with restructuring and business combinations and divestiture undertaken by the company.Adjusted operating income/(loss) is defined as operating income/(loss) before (i) the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations  (ii) any potential goodwill impairment  (iii) share-based payment expense and (iv) non-recurring costs associated with restructuring and business combinations and divestiture undertaken by the company.EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating income before depreciation  amortization and impairment expenses not related to business combinations.Annual Recurring Revenue  or ARR  corresponds annualized value of all recurring revenues from current contracts at the time of measurement. ARR includes all contract types that are recurring in nature  such as maintenance & support  SaaS and non-SaaS subscriptions  and for which revenue is currently being recognized. The ARR is a rolling number that accumulates over time whereas the Total Contract Value (or TCV) metric also used by the Company  is typically used to measure (new or incremental) sales bookings within a period.

With patients at the core of our purpose  we are well on track to execute on our four-pillar strategy  including the maximization of our brands and the replenishment of our pipeline.”Consumer HealthCare: completion of divestmentIpsen today announces the closing of its agreement to divest its CHC business to Mayoly Spindler  with which it had entered into exclusive negotiations in February 2022. The consideration represents an enterprise value of €350m  including an earnout contingent payment of €50m.The combination of Ipsen’s and Mayoly Spindler’s respective CHC businesses will create a global consumer-healthcare platform with a critical size and the capacity to support its growth. This was a major step forward in the Company’s execution of its strategic roadmap  presented in December 2020  towards building a more-focused Ipsen  centring on Specialty Care.Review of resultsIn accordance with IFRS 5  the H1 2022 consolidated net profit and free cash flow resulting from the CHC business have been reclassified in separate line items: ‘Net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations’ in the profit and loss account and ‘Change in net cash/(debt) from discontinued operations’ in the cash-flow statement.

In North America  sales were stable  with volume growth supported by continued market-share gains  despite the entry of lanreotide competition. This was offset by adverse pricing driven by an increased level of commercial rebates and unfavorable movements in channel mix  as well as lower wholesaler inventories. In Europe6  sales declined by 4.0%5  reflecting effects from the launch of generic lanreotide in some markets including Germany  the Nordics and Spain  while sales in the Rest of the World grew by 33.7%5. Decapeptyl sales of €264.6m represented growth of 15.9%5  mainly driven by continued market-share gains in Europe  primarily in France and Italy  along with higher volumes in Russia and Korea. In China  sales continued to grow but were impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19  as well as adverse pricing. Cabometyx sales reached €212.2m  up by 25.4%5  reflecting strong volume uptakes across most geographies  mainly in the second-line renal cell carcinoma indication  and by the launch of the first-line combination with nivolumab. Onivyde sales of €83.2m  growing by 30.4%5  were driven by market-share gains and favorable pricing in the U.S.  as well as increased sales to Ipsen’s ex-U.S. partner.NeuroscienceNeuroscience sales increased by 16.0%7 in H1 2022 to €246.9m and comprised 17.2% of total sales (H1 2021: 16.5%).DysportSales reached €242.3m  up by 15.5%7  driven by good volume uptakes in most therapeutics markets  and strong performances in the aesthetics market  including increased sales to Ipsen’s partner  Galderma  especially in North America.Rare DiseaseRare Disease sales declined by 13.9%7 in H1 2022 to €22.6m and comprised 1.6% of total sales (H1 2021: 2.1%).NutropinAq (somatropin) sales of €14.5m  a decline of 15.1%7  reflected competitive pressures in Europe.

North America sales comprised 33.4% of total sales (H1 2021: 32.4%).EuropeSales in H1 2022 reached €623.6m  an increase of 5.1%7  mainly reflecting strong Cabometyx performances in France  Spain and Germany  and by Decapeptyl’s continued market-share uptakes. Following the launch of generic lanreotide in some European markets  Somatuline sales declined by 4.0%7  while Dysport sales in the aesthetics market were impacted by unfavorable supply phasing. Sales in Europe comprised 43.5% of total sales (H1 2021: 47.4%).Rest of the WorldSales in H1 2022 reached €330.7m  an increase of 27.1%7  driven by solid volume growth in both Oncology and Neuroscience. The increase in Decapeptyl sales reflected market-share gains in Korea and Russia  and favorable shipment phasing in Algeria. The strong growth of Cabometyx was a result of market-share gains across a number of geographies. The performance also reflected good Somatuline sales in Japan and Russia. Rest of the World sales comprised 23.1% of total sales (H1 2021: 20.2%).Comparison of core consolidated income statementCore financial measures are performance indicators.

corresponding to a dividend per share of €1.20 (H1 2021: €82.9m  for a dividend of €1.00 per share).Net investments of €101.9m mainly related to a Cabometyx commercial milestone for €88.2m paid to Exelixis  and an IPN60130 development milestone for €27.4m paid to Blueprint Medicines (H1 2021: positive impact for €8.8m mainly related to Onivyde’s commercial milestones received and to the proceeds from the divestment in equity-accounted companies  partly offset by additional milestone payments to Exelixis).Foreign exchange on net indebtedness and change in earn-out adversely impacted net debt mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange on Onivyde’s earnout (H1 2021: a higher U.S. dollar versus Euro rate adversely impacted indebtedness).Reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.1 At constant exchange rates (CER)  which exclude any foreign-exchange impact by recalculating the performance for the relevant period by applying the exchange rates used for the prior period.2 Extract of consolidated results.

This equity investment was accompanied by the acquisition of a 51.82%-stake in the capital of the British company CAREMEDS.By developing innovative technology solutions for medication adherence  these companies will make it possible to manage the entire per unit dispensing cycle from the manufacturing phase to delivery to the patient:MULTIMEDS sells a manual dispensing solution with a comprehensive and innovative patent-protected pill dispenser;CAREMEDS develops a secure cloud-based platform for tracking the medication cycle using pill dispensers. Its eMAR system provides pharmacists in dispensing pharmacies as well as nurses and caregivers when dispensing medications in elderly residential care homes (EHPAD) with secure medication management and batch traceability for prescription drugs prepared in pill dispensers. The company has also developed a mobile app for retirement homes (CARE HOME).While these solutions are complementary  they can also be marketed separately according to the needs of healthcare professionals and adapted to the specificities of each country. These offerings are currently distributed in the United Kingdom  France  Spain  Italy  Portugal and Germany.Story continuesIn 2019  through CAREMEDS  Equasens Group strengthened its position in this segment of the medication dispenser market by acquiring a majority 60%-stake in the German company I-MEDS  a wholesaler and distributor of equipment and accessories for supplying drugs to patients and pharmacies. I-MEDS is a key distribution partner for MULTIMEDS manual pillboxes in Germany (20% market share for manual dispensing solutions).In 2022  the Group will maintain its strategy focused on patients and effective medication compliance. These additional investments highlight the Group’s goal of further developing this activity  accelerating the roll-out of these solutions in Europe and offering the most extensive range of compliance solutions on the market.To optimise this integration  the English activities dedicated to securing the flow of medicines between pharmacies and retirement homes will be part of the AXIGATE LINK Division  while the Pharmacy activities in the other countries will be part of the PHARMAGEST Division. Each of these entities has its own governance. The CAREMEDS and MULTIMEDS offerings will have development potential with the European customer base of these Divisions: 12 000 pharmacies and over 3 000 nursing homes in Europe equipped with the Group's solutions. At the same time  the Divisions will increase their penetration of the European markets supplied by CAREMEDS and MULTIMEDS by leveraging their installed customer base (notably in the United Kingdom  approximately 200 pharmacy distributors and more than 1 000 nursing homes equipped with CAREMEDS software and MULTIMEDS pillboxes  i.e. more than 80 000 patients addressed) as well as their networks of resellers and distributors like I-MEDS.These solutions will benefit from the Group's proactive and innovative approach and resources based on an agile and European organisation  healthcare professionals from multiple sectors  multi-country R&D communities working closely together and new technologies.These different operations will help Equasens Group accelerate its expansion and reinforce its presence in several European countries. In particular:in the United Kingdom  by combining CAREMEDS' eMAR medication traceability solution with MALTA INFORMATIQUE's TITANLINK facility management solution (MALTA intends to replicate its business model  based on the successful example of MALTA BELGIUM in Belgium);in Germany  by enhancing MULTIMEDS’ manual dispensing range with the Group's pharmacy automation solutions  and in particular the addition of AUTOMEDS' semi-automatic dispensing systems  which are perfectly suited to the German market in terms of design and capacity.About Equasens Group:With more than 1 200 employees fulfilling a vital role as “Citizens in the Service of Health and Well-Being”  Equasens Group is today a key player in the European healthcare sector  providing software solutions to all healthcare professionals (pharmacists  primary care practitioners  hospitals  Hospital-at-Home structures  retirement homes  health centres) in both primary and secondary care sectors.With operations in France  Italy  Belgium  Luxembourg  United Kingdom and Germany  Equasens Group is currently developing the leading healthcare platform and a unique ecosystem in France and Europe benefiting people by making available the very best of technology.Listed on Euronext Paris™ - Compartment AIncluded in the Euronext Tech Leaders segment and the European Rising Tech labelIndexes: MSCI GLOBAL SMALL CAP - GAÏA Index 2020 - CAC® SMALL and CAC® All-TradableEligible for the Deferred Settlement Service (“Service à Réglement Différé” - SRD) and equity savings accounts invested in small and mid caps (PEA-PME).ISIN: FR0012882389 - Ticker Code: EQSFor all the latest news on Equasens Group go to www.equasens.comCONTACTSAnalyst and Investor Relations:Chief Administrative and Financial Officer: Jean-Yves SAMSONTel. +33 (0) 83 15 90 67 - jean-yves.samson@equasens.comMedia Relations:FIN’EXTENSO - Isabelle APRILETel. +33 (0)1 39 97 61 22 - i.aprile@finextenso.frAttachment,negative,0.03,0.45,0.52,positive,0.56,0.36,0.08,True,English,"['ex Pharmagest Interactive', 'three majority acquisitions', 'Equasens Group', 'Complition', 'multi-country R&D communities', ""CAREMEDS' eMAR medication traceability solution"", ""AUTOMEDS' semi-automatic dispensing systems"", 'TITANLINK facility management solution', 'innovative patent-protected pill dispenser', 'COMPLETES THREE MAJORITY ACQUISITIONS', 'elderly residential care homes', 'MULTIMEDS’ manual dispensing range', 'medication dispensing solutions market', 'manual dispensing solution', 'medication dispenser market', 'unit dispensing cycle', 'secure cloud-based platform', 'secure medication management', 'key European-wide issue', 'key distribution partner', 'AXIGATE LINK Division', 'secondary care sectors', 'effective medication compliance', 'innovative technology solutions', 'several European countries', 'primary care practitioners', 'European healthcare sector', 'MULTIMEDS manual pillboxes', 'European customer base', 'chronically ill patients', 'pharmacy automation solutions', 'medication cycle', 'eMAR system', 'batch traceability', 'medication adherence', 'three subsidiaries', 'extensive range', 'innovative approach', 'pill dispensers', 'key player', 'European markets', 'European organisation', 'other countries', 'PHARMAGEST Division', 'multiple sectors', 'German market', 'compliance solutions', 'MULTIMEDS pillboxes', 'Therapeutic compliance', 'retirement homes', 'Pharmacy activities', '3,000 nursing homes', '1,000 nursing homes', 'healthcare professionals', 'majority 60%-stake', 'software solutions', 'Villers-lès-Nancy', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'PHARMAGEST INTERACTIVE', 'Euronext Paris™', 'Compartment A', 'equity investment', 'manufacturing phase', 'mobile app', 'United Kingdom', 'additional investments', 'English activities', 'development potential', 'same time', 'new technologies', 'different operations', 'business model', 'successful example', 'vital role', 'Home structures', '200 pharmacy distributors', 'Irish company', 'British company', 'German company', 'The CAREMEDS', 'CAREMEDS software', 'MALTA INFORMATIQUE', 'prescription drugs', 'health centres', 'MULTIMEDS offerings', 'EQUASENS GROUP', 'MALTA BELGIUM', '51.82%-stake', '80,000 patients', '28 July', 'CET', '23.89% balance', 'Q4 2022', 'conditions', 'I-MEDS', 'ISIN', 'completion', 'reason', 'position', '51% stake', 'capital', 'companies', 'entire', 'delivery', 'comprehensive', 'pharmacists', 'pharmacies', 'nurses', 'caregivers', 'medications', 'EHPAD', 'needs', 'specificities', 'France', 'Spain', 'Italy', 'Portugal', 'Germany', 'Story', 'segment', 'wholesaler', 'equipment', 'accessories', 'strategy', 'goal', 'activity', 'roll-out', 'integration', 'flow', 'medicines', 'entities', 'governance', 'Divisions', 'penetration', 'networks', 'resellers', 'proactive', 'resources', 'agile', 'expansion', 'presence', 'terms', 'design', 'capacity', '1,200 employees', 'Citizens', 'Service', 'Well-Being', 'hospitals', '6:00', '76']",2022-07-28,2022-07-29,finance.yahoo.com

However  unexpected issues sourcing a critical semiconductor chip caused a severe revenue shortfall in our Printhead Solutions segment and erased the gains from the Printing Software and Enterprise Software segments. This resulted in subpar financial results for the first half of 2022  a sharp contrast from the record results this segment delivered in 2021.“The situation has already been rectified by redesigning a key circuit board using a more powerful chip.

On a like-for-like basis  the increase was 16.9%  driven in particular by strong growth in North America. The currency impact over the period was -€8.3m  including -€17.3m on the Turkish lira and +€8.5m on the US dollar.The second-quarter performance resulted in stable reported half-year turnover  up 5% on a like-for-like basis  outperforming the global vehicle production market over the first half of the year (-1.8%1).BREAKDOWN OF TURNOVERThe geographical breakdown of turnover by production zone was as follows during the six-month period:France: €136.8m (-1.5%)Europe (excluding France) and Africa: €135.8m (-11.4%)North America: €144.2m (+18.4%)Asia and the Middle East (including Turkey): €68.4m (-2.7%)South America: €2.9m (-10.0%)Products and Functions turnover was up by 1.3% in the first half at €473.2m. The Cooling (+8.3%) and Air (+2.2%) activities continued to grow  driven by market share gains. The Depollution product line limited its decline to -2.6%  and the Aftermarket activities remained strong on SCR tanks. Tooling turnover was down at €11.0m after unusual prior financial years.NET CASH POSITION OF €116mThe Group generated €7.7m in free cash flow during the first half of 2022  reaching a net cash position as of 30 June  excluding rental obligations  of €116m after the dividend payout.2022 OUTLOOKIn a global automotive market that continues to be very turbulent  AKWEL confirms its expectation of moderate growth in turnover for the 2022 financial year. However  as mentioned in recent communications  the supply difficulties disrupting the activities of vehicle and equipment manufacturers  particularly at European sites  and the significant inflation observed in the costs of raw materials  components  energy  transport  and labour will have a major impact on the Group’s operating profitability this year. These various increases cannot be easily passed on to sales prices. In all cases  this requires long negotiation periods. This time lag leads AKWEL to anticipate a significant decrease in its current operating income in both the first half and second half of 2022.Next press release: 2022 half-year results  Thursday 22 September 2022  after the markets close.An independent  family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange  AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management and mechanisms  offering first-rate industrial and technological expertise in applying and processing materials (plastics  rubber  metal) and mechatronic integration.Operating in 20 countries across every continent  AKWEL employs 9 700 people worldwide.Euronext Paris – Compartment B – ISIN: FR0000053027 – Reuters: AKW.PA – Bloomberg: AKW:FPContactsAKWELGrégory Voisin – Financial VP – Tel.: +33 4 50 56 99 25EKNO – Press RelationsChristine Savoie – Jean-Marc Atlan – jean-marc.atlan@ekno.fr – Tel.: +33 6 70 08 11 09 / +33 6 07 37 20 44CALYPTUS – Investor RelationsMathieu Calleux – akwel@calyptus.net – Tel.: +33 1 53 65 68 681 Source: S&P Global MobilityAttachment,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.14,0.14,0.72,True,English,"['STABLE TURNOVER FIGURES', '1st\xa0HALF', 'AKWEL', 'THE', 'S&P Global Mobility Attachment', 'unusual prior financial years', 'The Depollution product line', 'Euronext Paris Stock Exchange', 'MORE DYNAMIC SECOND QUARTER', 'global vehicle production market', 'international geopolitical tensions', 'market share gains', 'NET CASH POSITION', 'free cash flow', 'long negotiation periods', 'Grégory Voisin', 'current operating income', 'Next press release', 'global automotive market', 'independent, family-owned group', 'STABLE TURNOVER FIGURES', 'global market', 'production zone', 'operating profitability', 'second half', '1st quarter', '2nd quarter', 'Financial VP', 'Press Relations', 'The Cooling', 'The Group', '2022 financial year', '1st HALF', 'HGV equipment', 'systems manufacturer', 'fluid management', 'first half', 'supply problems', 'raw materials', 'higher level', 'strong growth', 'North America', 'currency impact', 'Turkish lira', 'US dollar', 'second-quarter performance', 'Middle East', 'South America', 'SCR tanks', 'rental obligations', 'dividend payout', 'moderate growth', 'recent communications', 'supply difficulties', 'equipment manufacturers', 'European sites', 'significant inflation', 'major impact', 'various increases', 'sales prices', 'time lag', 'significant decrease', '2022 half-year results', 'first-rate industrial', 'technological expertise', 'processing materials', 'mechatronic integration', 'Compartment B', 'Christine Savoie', 'Jean-Marc Atlan', 'Investor Relations', 'Mathieu Calleux', 'half-year turnover', 'Functions turnover', 'Tooling turnover', 'Sharp decline', 'electronic components', 'geographical breakdown', 'six-month period', 'Aftermarket activities', 'AKW.PA', 'Consolidated turnover', 'Akwel', 'Thursday', 'mechanisms', 'January', '30 June', 'millions', 'Variation', 'context', 'activity', 'basis', 'France', 'Africa', 'Asia', 'Turkey', 'Products', 'Air', '2022 OUTLOOK', 'expectation', 'costs', 'energy', 'transport', 'labour', 'cases', 'markets', 'applying', 'plastics', 'rubber', 'metal', '20 countries', 'continent', '9,700 people', 'Reuters', 'Bloomberg', 'Contacts', 'Tel.', 'EKNO', 'marc.', 'CALYPTUS', '1 Source', '€', '33 4 50']",2022-07-28,2022-07-29,finance.yahoo.com

Our pipeline stood at a record level at the end of the second quarter and the value of deals won remains robust. In addition  after several quarters of increasing working capital  we now see this stabilised compared to the previous quarter.As we support our clients to navigate through the current challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  we continue to position the Group for long-term growth. This is achieved by further strengthening our foundations and hence we’re investing in compliance & remediation and expanding our talented workforce. As employee attrition remained elevated  we have welcomed more than 1 100 new colleagues to our offices across the globe in the first half which  in the current tight labour market  resulted in markedly higher staff expenses. In addition  we are seeking targeted price increases to partially offset the various inflationary pressures which are inevitably impacting our cost base in the short term.Story continuesTaking all this into account  we reiterate our revenue guidance of 3-5% underlying growth for the year and we adjust our EBITA margin guidance to 26-28%. Our medium-term ambitions  which aim for accelerated revenue growth and margin expansion  remain unchanged and reflect our commitment to long-term growth and solid cash generation.We value our shareholders' support in the transaction with CSC as evidenced during the AGM last May.

The Bank of England is set to raise rates next week  perhaps by as much as 50 basis points.“Clearly ahead of us we have adjustments that are to come to price lasting inflation  increased interest rates  lasting geostrategic moves  and there will be some form of rotation in assets to transform these external shocks into investment decisions ” Boujnah told Reuters.Euronext  which runs stock exchanges in Paris  Dublin  Amsterdam  Lisbon  Brussels and Oslo  reported second quarter earnings on Thursday  with like-for-like revenue and income up 2.5% on the same quarter last year at 374.7 million euros.The first savings from its takeover of the Milan Exchange Group totalled 24.1 million euros  a quarter of the 100 million euros savings forecast under the exchange’s current strategic plan which runs to the end of 2024.Shifting servers from Basildon near London to Bergamo in Italy due to Brexit contributed 8.9 million euros to savings. There are no changes to guidance on savings or costs  Boujnah said.New listings on Euronext markets totalled 41 in January to June  down from 104 in the first half of 2021 due to market uncertainty  but still ahead of London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse  Boujnah said.“There are many companies that need liquidity and need to raise their own funds  but the question is the appetite of investors for equity risk at a time of strong volatility.”(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Kirsten Donovan),negative,0.01,0.09,0.9,negative,0.02,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['bumpy ride', 'Euronext CEO', 'seatbelts', 'U.S. Federal Reserve', 'The European Central Bank', 'supply chain pressures', 'current strategic plan', 'lasting geostrategic moves', 'Milan Exchange Group', 'second quarter earnings', 'London Stock Exchange', '100 million euros savings', 'The Bank', 'lasting inflation', '374.7 million euros', '24.1 million euros', '8.9 million euros', 'Unavoidable volatility', 'share prices', '50 basis points', '75 basis points', 'external shocks', 'investment decisions', 'stock exchanges', 'same quarter', 'New listings', 'first half', 'market uncertainty', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'many companies', 'equity risk', 'strong volatility', 'Huw Jones', 'Kirsten Donovan', 'first savings', 'Euronext markets', 'interest rates', 'months', 'customers', 'fallout', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Boujnah', 'Wednesday', 'England', 'adjustments', 'form', 'rotation', 'assets', 'Reuters', 'Paris', 'Dublin', 'Amsterdam', 'Lisbon', 'Brussels', 'Oslo', 'Thursday', 'revenue', 'income', 'takeover', 'end', 'servers', 'Basildon', 'Bergamo', 'Italy', 'Brexit', 'guidance', 'costs', 'January', 'June', 'liquidity', 'funds', 'question', 'appetite', 'investors', 'time', 'Editing']",2022-07-28,2022-07-29,fxempire.com

Solid first half 2022 performance in...,Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsCharenton-le-Pont  28 July 2022H1 2022 revenuesMBWS posts first half revenues of €86.4m  up 5.9% versus H1 2021.Solid first half 2022 performance in France despite an overall slowdown in the spirits market (sales up 2.5% versus H1 2021  up 1% in the second quarter)  mainly driven by: a sharp improvement in on-trade business compared to first half 2021  when bars and restaurants were forced to close due to COVID regulations; a relative market share gain for William Peel amid a decline in the under-12-year blended whisky market; significant growth among other portfolio brands  particularly Marie Brizard  in both on-trade and off-trade markets.Continued growth in international sales (up 9.2% versus H1 2021)  reflecting contrasting trends across regions: continued recovery in Europe  particularly in the UK  after the health restrictions of 2021 and despite the Russia-Ukraine conflict  which led to a limited decline in nearby export markets; strong performances across all of the Group’s strategic brands  particularly Marie Brizard and Gautier  in Canada  South Korea  Australia and Poland; decline in US sales of Sobieski vodka in a highly competitive market segment.NB: All revenue growth figures reported herein are at constant exchange rates and consolidation scope  unless otherwise stated.Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits (Euronext: MBWS) today announces its unaudited revenues for the second quarter of 2022  covering the period from 1 April to 30 June 2022  and the first half of 2022.H1 2022 revenues€m H1 2021 LFLchange Currency impact H1 2022 LFL change(excl. currency impact) Reported growth (incl. currency impact) France 39.1 +1.0 - 40.1 +2.5% +2.5% International 41.9 +3.8 +0.6 46.3 +9.2% +10.6% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 81.0 +4.8 +0.6 86.4 +5.9% +6.7%Q2 2022 revenues€m Q2 2021 LFLchange Currency impact Q2 2022 LFL change(exc. currency impact) Reported growth (incl. currency impact) France 19.9 +0.2 - 20.1 +1.0% +1.0% International 22.7 +2.6 +0.4 25.7 +11.6% +13.2% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 42.6 +2.8 +0.4 45.8 +6.6% +7.5%Breakdown by clusterFrance clusterThe France cluster posted first half 2022 revenues of €40.1m  up 2.5% versus H1 2021  mainly due to a significant recovery in the on-trade business  albeit less pronounced in the second quarter  and flat sales in the off-trade market. As a result  overall revenue growth slowed in Q2 (1%) versus Q1 2022.Story continuesThe Group’s main brands posted a resilient performance in the first half of 2022  particularly Marie Brizard and San José. Other brands including Sobieski posted growth in the on-trade business  while off-trade sales dipped slightly in the second quarter. Despite a general slowdown in the under-12-year blended whisky market (down 6.7% in the first half)  William Peel recorded a small decline in sales in the first half of 2022 compared to 2021  thanks to a new listing obtained in the second half of 2021 enabling it to gain market share.The first half upswing in France cluster sales was impacted by severe disruption in raw material supply chains since the beginning of March  notably due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and soaring raw material costs  which have particularly affected the glassmaking industry since early April. The Group is dealing with this situation by adopting allocation measures per brand based on available volumes. Furthermore  sales pricing policy adjustments across all distribution channels have been and will continue to be necessary in order to adapt to this new volatile environment.International clusterThe International cluster posted H1 2022 revenues of €46.3m  up 9.2% from H1 2021 at constant exchange rates.In Western Europe  business in the first six months of 2022 benefited from a strong recovery including a Q2 upturn in UK sales (particularly on-trade versus 2021)  driven by a strong performance by the Marie Brizard brand (in terms of value and percentage of business).Sales in Spain fell 2.9% versus H1 2021  mainly due to a temporary decline in subcontracted operations resulting from difficulties with glass supplies (bottles)  offset by strong growth among strategic brands (particularly Marie Brizard  Sobieski and William Peel).Scandinavia posted a significant increase in H1 revenues  mainly driven by Marie Brizard and Gautier  particularly in the on-trade market in the second quarter.Business continued to thrive in the Middle East driven by the development of the Marie Brizard range of syrups  which recorded significant growth in the first half.In the Baltic States  first half revenues rose 8.8%  reflecting favourable economic conditions on the bulk market and brand growth on the domestic market thanks to a favourable product mix and pricing policy  despite the immediate consequences of the war in Ukraine  which affected exports to Russia and Belarus  albeit with an overall impact that is not deemed material at Group level.Bulgaria also posted strong growth throughout the first half of 2022 (up 18.3%) across its entire brand portfolio (wines and spirits) in both domestic and export markets (Greece  Croatia  Serbia) as well as a sustained level of subcontracting activity for Romania.In Poland  Group brand sales were boosted strongly by growth in Cognac Gautier sales and the launch of Marie Brizard liqueurs.US revenues for the first half of 2022 were down versus 2021 due to the continuing decline in Sobieski sales due to aggressive promotional strategies by competitors in the vodka segment and ongoing pressure on sea transport capacity.Brazil revenues fell sharply in the second quarter of 2022 across the entire brand portfolio except for Marie Brizard and Sobieski  due to the revision in early 2022 of the portfolio pricing policy. The new policy has however helped to limit the reduction in revenues.Asia Pacific maintained revenue growth in the second quarter of 2022  as the decline in sales in the Chinese market was largely offset by strong performances in South Korea  Taiwan  Japan and Australia.OutlookAs mentioned at the 30 June 2022 General Meeting  over the coming months  rising raw material and energy prices and the varying availability of supplier production are factors that must be taken into account in managing our business.These factors could impact the Group’s ability to supply all of its customers (both in France and abroad) notwithstanding the impact of higher prices on consumer demand. These considerations are all the more pertinent in view of the Group’s need to adapt pricing policies to the new situation and  as such  the Group will continue to adopt a cautious stance regarding its forecasts over the coming months.Financial calendarH1 2022 results: 28 September 2022 after close of tradingInvestors and Shareholders Relations ContactMBWS GroupEmilie Drexleremilie.drexler@mbws.comPhone: +33 1 43 91 62 40 Press ContactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurence Maurycdoligez@image7.fr – lmaury@image7.frPhone: +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a Group of wines and spirits based in Europe and the United States.

The first half of 2021 was stimulated by the lockdowns imposed across Europe. In the first half of 2022  adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic events negatively impacted consumer spending and business investment decisions  but did not negatively impact trends in the electronic payments market.The strong momentum in payment volumes seen across all market segments is only partially reflected in revenues. The discontinuation of a number of payment methods in the Belgian market saw the transfer of a proportion of payment volumes to other  less lucrative  methods.Successful business developmentHiPay recorded a high level of sales activity in the first half of the year along with an increase in market share  thus attesting to its ability to perform in a difficult economic environment. The group expanded its business relationships with tier-22 retailers  expanding its reach with new brands by leveraging its omni-channel offering. HiPay also continued its European expansion with its share of payment volumes completed outside of France increasing to 39% over the period  an increase of +1 point compared to H1 2021.HiPay’s omni-channel positioning attests to its popularity in FranceHiPay’s business in France is driven by retailer appetite for its unified commerce offering which accounted for almost a third of new initiatives and nearly 15% of contracts signed in the first six months of the year. 38 new clients were signed in numerous vertical channels  thus strengthening HiPay’s multi-specialist positioning. As such  HiPay added a number of well-known French brands to its portfolio  including Dodo  Jott  EasyParapharmacie  Atmosphera and V33.Story continuesNew retail brands in Portugal and Italy and international growth for iGamingIn Portugal  32 new customers began using the HiPay platform in the first half of the year  including high-profile brands like 360Imprimir  Canté and SMEG.In Italy  the luxury group Binda (jewellery and watchmaking) signed on in the first quarter and launched its flagship brand  Breil.

Earnings before interest  taxes and amortization (EBITA) jumped 31.5 percent to €412 million ($418 million)  “thanks notably to the contribution of Canal+ Group  the growth of Havas Group and the integration of (French magazine publisher) Prisma Media.”Vivendi also broke out revenue for the second quarter  which rose 8.6 percent to €2.50 billion  “mainly due to Havas Group’s very good momentum.” Focusing on constant currency and assets  quarterly revenue grew by 3.1 percent  led by Havas  while Canal+ recorded a 1.3 decline on that basis.“As reflected in the 31.5 percent increase in EBITA  our businesses continued to show very strong resilience in the first half of the year ” said Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine. “Our business model and high-profile brands provide solidity and consistency to our revenues and operating performance  as demonstrated by our financial figures” for the first half of the year.“These figures are a testament to the effectiveness of the strategy implemented by the group ” said Yannick Bolloré  chairman of Vivendi’s supervisory board. “It is underpinned by the transformation work carried out by each of our businesses to adapt their business models to changes in consumption patterns  the competitive environment  and emerging technologies. We also intend to continue our international development. Havas Group and Canal+ Group already generate 80 percent and 40 percent of their revenues  respectively  outside of France.”Vivendi said it owned a 57.35 percent economic stake but minority voting stake in French publishing giant Lagardère following a public tender offer that ended in June. Vivendi said on Thursday that it would explore divesting its publishing unit Editis  acquired in 2019  “to avoid any potential antitrust problems.” It added: “Vivendi contemplates carrying out this transaction primarily by distributing Editis shares to Vivendi’s shareholders and simultaneously having the shares admitted to trading on the Euronext Paris stock exchange.”During an analyst call  Vivendi execs talked about Canal+ being among bidders eyeing a potential stake in Lionsgate’s Starz premium pay TV and streaming platform. CEO de Puyfontaine said the French media giant had successfully taken minority stakes in other global media companies  including holding a 20 percent stake in African pay-TV platform Multichoice.“The approach is very pragmatic. We’re open to different opportunities. A minority [stake] is not something we wouldn’t contemplate if we are given the rationale and all the elements to believe that it’s a wise investment in the context of our strategy plans ” de Puyfontaine told analysts during an evening call.First-half revenue at pay TV unit Canal+ rose 2.2 percent when focusing on constant currencies and current assets  or 3.3 percent otherwise  to €2.87 billion ($2.91 billion). International revenue was a key growth driver “thanks to another significant increase in the number of subscribers ” the firm said. StudioCanal’s revenue fell though by 23.5 percent on an organic basis “despite very good performances from its catalogue and cinema film releases ” with the decrease “coming from its TV series after an exceptional first half of 2021 (War of the Worlds  Un Asunto Privado  Dos Vidas).”Canal+ EBITA of €337 million ($342 million) for the six-month period was up 0.4 percent when looking at constant currency and current assets  or 2.1 percent otherwise.Meanwhile  ad powerhouse Havas boosted its first-half revenue by 19.9 percent to €1.56 billion ($1.58 billion)  while EBITA rose 27.8 percent to €112 million ($114 million) thanks to “the ongoing benefits of the cost adjustment plan  despite a significant increase in personnel costs in the first half of the year ” the firm said.Vivendi also reported flat second-quarter revenue for game-maker Gameloft to €120 million ($122 million) despite “a mobile video game market that declined by 7 percent in the first half.” It noted “the success of Apple Arcade games and the solid performances of Gameloft for brands (advertising platforms) and Gameloft Business Solutions (telecom operators and handset manufacturers platforms) whose revenues increased by 27.8 percent and 7.5 percent  respectively.”,neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,mixed,0.23,0.2,0.58,True,English,"['Vivendi Second-Quarter Revenue Report', 'The Hollywood Reporter', 'Canal Plus', 'French publishing giant Lagardère', 'Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'mobile video game market', 'African pay-TV platform Multichoice', 'other global media companies', 'Starz premium pay TV', 'CEO de Puyfontaine', 'French media giant', 'French magazine publisher', 'public tender offer', 'cinema film releases', 'Un Asunto Privado', 'cost adjustment plan', 'Apple Arcade games', 'pay TV unit', 'potential antitrust problems', 'handset manufacturers platforms', 'first six months', 'key growth driver', 'advertising giant Havas', 'flat second-quarter revenue', 'minority voting stake', 'exceptional first half', 'higher first-half revenue', 'Gameloft Business Solutions', '57.35 percent economic stake', 'publishing unit', 'streaming platform', 'advertising platforms', 'potential stake', 'Prisma Media', 'TV series', 'minority [stake', 'business model', 'minority stakes', 'telecommunications conglomerate', 'constant currencies', 'year-ago period', 'second quarter', 'good momentum', 'constant currency', 'strong resilience', 'operating performance', 'Yannick Bolloré', 'supervisory board', 'transformation work', 'consumption patterns', 'competitive environment', 'emerging technologies', 'international development', 'analyst call', 'different opportunities', 'wise investment', 'evening call', 'significant increase', 'good performances', 'Dos Vidas', 'six-month period', 'ad powerhouse', 'ongoing benefits', 'personnel costs', 'solid performances', 'telecom operators', 'quarterly revenue', 'International revenue', 'current assets', '20 percent stake', 'Havas Group', 'organic basis', 'high-profile brands', 'financial figures', 'Vivendi execs', 'strategy plans', 'Canal+ Group', '31.5 percent increase', 'Editis shares', 'Canal+ EBITA', '5.4 percent', '3.1 percent', '80 percent', '40 percent', '23.5 percent', '19.9 percent', '7 percent', '27.8 percent', '7.5 percent', 'earnings', 'Thursday', 'gains', 'interest', 'taxes', 'amortization', 'contribution', 'integration', '1.3 decline', 'businesses', 'solidity', 'consistency', 'revenues', 'testament', 'effectiveness', 'chairman', 'changes', 'France', 'June', 'transaction', 'shareholders', 'bidders', 'Lionsgate', 'approach', 'something', 'rationale', 'elements', 'context', 'analysts', 'number', 'subscribers', 'firm', 'StudioCanal', 'catalogue', 'decrease', 'War', 'Worlds', 'game-maker', 'success', '10.9']",2022-07-28,2022-07-29,hollywoodreporter.com

This performance was underpinned by the ongoing strong growth in Tolling service sales (+18%)  which have higher margins than Package Sales  and highlights the business recovery to higher pre-pandemic levels. The increase in demand in Europe and the sales price increases implemented by the Company to compensate for cost inflation contributed to the increase in turnover over the half-year.Sales evolution by quarter and by activity(€M) 2022 2021 Variation Q1 6.61 5.91 + 12.0 % Q2 7.34 6.54 + 12.2 % Half-year total 13.95 12.45 + 12.1 % Of which Tolling Sales 11.68 9.86 + 18.5 % Package Sales1 2.27 2.59 - 12.5 %Tolling services: sustained double-digit growth in the second quarterHalf-year sales of Tolling services amounted to €11.7m  up 18.5% compared to the first half of 2021  accounting for 83.8% of total sales  compared with 79.2% the previous year. In the second quarter  sales momentum remained strong (+11.4%) despite a less favourable comparison base than in previous quarters; it should be noted that sales in the second quarter of 2021 were up by +39.6%. Since the beginning of the year  in a context of strong growth in the construction and architectural end markets  demand has been fuelled by restocking by distributors in Europe due to their anticipation of higher aluminium prices.Package Sales: recovery in the second quarter despite an unfavourable international environmentHalf-yearly Package Offer sales  whereby the Company supplies continuously anodised aluminium directly to end customers  amounted to €2.3m  down -12.5% on the previous year. They accounted for 16.2% of total sales  compared with 20.8% the previous year. In the second quarter  sales increased by 17.6% due to a favourable base effect and were particularly dynamic in Europe in order to compensate for the lack of sales in Russia due to the conflict in Ukraine and in Asia due to the costs and delivery times for pre-anodised aluminium.Story continuesOutlookAs COIL celebrates its 50th anniversary this year  the commercial performance of the first half of 2022  driven by an exceptionally high demand  confirms the high quality of the Company's products  customer confidence  employee mobilisation and the efficiency of its industrial facilities.The impact of the two current major crises - the war in Ukraine and the Covid-19 epidemic - is generating significant short-term uncertainties  particularly with the rise in inflation  existing or potential shortages  and a weakening of the supply chain. In this context  the Company remains cautious and anticipates a slowdown in demand in the second half of the year and a return to a normal level of activity.The Company remains confident in its prospects and has a solid financial position allowing for the increase of its business potential in the long term. With this in mind  the Company is investing in partnerships in environmentally neutral technologies in order to substitute its fossil fuel consumption with new renewable energy sources at attractive costs and with carbon neutrality objectives for the Bernburg industrial site in Germany.Agenda31 October 2022 First half 2022 results and half-year financial report (after close of trading)About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes. It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion.

As well as focusing on managing our portfolio in a proactive manner  we have worked on acquisition opportunities and are pleased to announce today the agreement signed with Altarea with a view to acquiring two shopping centres for €90 million. This transformative move would result in a significant change of dimension for MRM  opening up new prospects for development.” (see the dedicated press release published simultaneously).Story continuesContinued brisk letting activityLetting activity remained robust in the first half of 2022. The eight leases1 signed during the period represent total rents of €0.7 million and a total floor area of 2 800 sqm. Taking account of the handful of contracts renegotiated under specific terms relating to the health crisis  the average reversion rate was -4%.New leases signed concern in particular:The ongoing letting of the Valentin shopping centre (near Besançon) with the signing of three leases representing a total floor area of 160 sqm. These agreements have enhanced MRM’s offering in the areas of Beauty and Services.The reletting of the 2 000 sqm medium-sized unit within the Carré Vélizy mixed-used development (Vélizy-Villacoublay) vacated by Office Depot in January 2022: the lease signed with fitness chain On Air came into effect on 29 April 2022. This fits in fully with the Household equipment and Foodservice outlets already present at the site.Letting activity was reflected by a further increase in the financial occupancy rate to 89% at end-June 2022  from 88% at end-December 2021. The physical occupancy rate remained stable at 90%. Annualised net rents totalled €9.5 million as at 1 July 2022  an increase of 2.0% relative to 1 January 2022.MRM collected 92% of rents and charges in the first half of 2022.Slight increase in portfolio valueThe value of MRM’s portfolio was €163.0 million as at 30 June 2022. This increase of 0.6% reflects the improvement in its rental situation.€ million 30.06.2022 31.12.2021 Change Portfolio valueexcl. transfer taxes 163.0 162.0 +0.6%Financial resultsRental incomeGross rental income for the first half of 2022  corresponding to rents billed  amounted to €4.7 million  down 0.7% on a like-for-like basis2.Thanks to its lettings successes  MRM benefited from the full effect of leases signed in 2021 for the Valentin shopping centre  Aria Parc (Allonnes) and Sud Canal (Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines)  as well as new leases coming into effect over the period. The indexation effect was slightly positive.These positive effects were offset by the temporary vacancy of the medium-sized unit vacated in January 2022 at Carré Vélizy  which has already been relet under a lease that came into effect on 29 April 2022 (see above).On a reported basis  taking account of the impact of the disposal of two non-strategic assets in October 2021  revenues were down 3.9% relative to the first half of 2021.Half-year rental income€ million H1 2022 H1 2021 Change Like-for-like change2 Gross rental income 4.7 4.9 -3.9% -0.7% Recurring non-recovered property expenses (1.2) (1.2) Non-recurring items (0.2) 0.2 Net rental income 3.3 3.9 -16.8%Compared with the first half of 2021  the amount of non-recovered property expenses was stable at €1.2 million.

It is still subject to a variety of conditions precedent  including being approved by MRM’s shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting to be held in the fourth quarter of 2022.At the same time  MRM has published its consolidated results for the first half of 2022. These are the object of a separate press release. An information meeting to present the first half results and provide details of the proposed acquisition will be held at 10:00 a.m. on 29 July 2022 at the Company’s head office. To attend  please contact the Company by email at: severine.tanis@oprgfinancial.frParis  28 July 2022: MRM (Euronext code ISIN FR00140085W6)  a real estate investment company specialising in retail property  today announced the signing of an agreement with Altarea and SCOR S.E. concerning the acquisition from Altarea of two shopping centres for a total €90.4 million (including transfer taxes). This acquisition is subject to a variety of conditions precedent. If it goes ahead  it would increase the value of MRM’s asset portfolio by more than 50%. The two properties  located in Flins-sur-Seine (Yvelines) and Ollioules (Var)  are both attached to Carrefour hypermarkets and are leading shopping centres within their catchment area. These are successful properties combining yields and potential for value creation.Story continuesFrançois de Varenne  Chairman of the Board of Directors of MRM  commented: “We are delighted to present today a proposed significant acquisition that will have a transformative effect on MRM. The acquisition of these two shopping centres would mark a real change of dimension for MRM  representing an increase of more than 50% in the value of our asset portfolio. Altarea is a key player in the real estate industry. Its entry in the share capital of MRM is a mark of recognition of our know-how and confidence in our ability to create value.”François Matray  Chief Executive Officer of MRM  added: “Having gradually refocused our portfolio on retail properties  enhanced the value of our properties by means of an apt investment plan and then over the last two years stepped up our active portfolio management under complex conditions  this acquisition would open up new prospects  allowing us to roll out our proactive management policy on the basis of a larger portfolio. It would enable us to aim for annualised net rents of over €16 million and make us more profitable thanks to better absorption of fixed costs.”Significant increase in MRM’s portfolioThis proposed acquisition of the regional shopping centre in Flins-sur-Seine  Yvelines  and the Carrefour Ollioules shopping centre in the Var region for a total of €90.4 million (including transfer taxes) would enable MRM to change dimension. While also extending its geographical presence in two fast-growing regions  the acquisition would significantly increase the size of its portfolio by 52% from €163.0 million to €247.3 million pro forma on the basis of values excluding transfer taxes as at 30 June 2022.This extension of the portfolio would result in a sharp increase in MRM’s annualised net rents from €9.5 million to €15.0 million pro forma as at 30 June 2022  thereby increasing MRM’s target annualised net rents from €10 million to €16 million. The increase in rental income would have a very positive impact on MRM’s net operating cash flow generation and enable it to improve its profitability thanks to better absorption of fixed costs.Positioned as market leaders within their catchment area and with physical occupancy rates of 97% and 92% respectively as at 30 June 2022  the Flins-sur-Seine and Ollioules shopping centres present net yields slightly higher than the current total yield for MRM’s portfolio. Furthermore  both present potential for value creation  which would give MRM the possibility of rolling out its asset management expertise (refurbishment  partial redevelopment  proactive rental management  changes in the retailer mix).Flins regional shopping centreClose to Mantes-la-Jolie in the Yvelines region  the Flins regional shopping centre is located in an attractive retail district in the heart of one of France’s biggest urban communities with a fast-growing population. The property complex  jointly owned with Carrefour  is a powerful shopping centre that constitutes a market leader in its catchment area  within which the Carrefour hypermarket enjoys a leading position. It benefits from extremely easy access via the A13 highway.The agreement concerns the acquisition by MRM of 56 stores covering a floor area of 9 972 sqm  which was 97% occupied as at 30 June 2022.

Market leader in its catchment area  the shopping centre—which is jointly owned with Carrefour and other co-owners—benefits from its immediate proximity to the A50 highway  to the west of Toulon.The agreement concerns the acquisition by MRM of 44 stores covering a floor area of 3 124 sqm  which was 92% occupied as at 30 June 2022. The site attracted 2.8 million visitors in 2021.Financing structure keeping MRM’s net debt at a controlled levelThe acquisition would take place by means of contributions in kind and transfers by Altarea to two MRM subsidiaries. It would be paid for partly in cash totalling €68.9 million and partly by means of the issuing of new MRM shares worth a total of €21 million  in the form of a capital increase by MRM at an issue price corresponding to its replacement NAV as at 30 June 2022  i.e.  €48.92 per share.The cash payment of €68.9 million would come from:A new €42 million bank loan  currently being negotiated by MRM;A current account advance from SCOR S.E. of €25 million;MRM’s available cash.Secondly  MRM would carry out a capital increase in cash with preferential subscription rights of a maximum of €29 million at a unit subscription price equal to MRM’s replacement NAV as at 30 June 2022  or €48 92 per share.

We are seeing strong leasing demand  with retailers expanding with us  thanks to the quality of our assets  which are located in the best catchment areas  and have an affluent customer base. URW is well positioned to outperform and gain market share  as retailers accelerate their “drive to store” strategies. Against this backdrop  asset values have stabilised  and our credit metrics have significantly improved  in particular thanks to the net debt reduction and the increase in EBTIDA.In Europe  we have now achieved 80% of our €4 billion disposal target. In the US  we continued to streamline our regional asset portfolio with the sale of the Promenade development parcel and are in active discussions on other regional assets. Given the quality and strong performance of our assets  we are confident in our ability to delever the company by executing on the radical reduction of our financial exposure to the US. We have maintained strict capital allocation  while continuing to deliver major development projects  and our hedging protects us against rising interest rates.In the context of our operational recovery in this challenging macro-environment  we are increasing our 2022 AREPS guidance from €8.20 - €8.40 to at least €8.90.”H1-2022 H1-2021 Growth Like-for-like growth2 Net Rental Income (in € Mn) 1 139 785 +45.0% +43.8%3 Shopping Centres 1 037 753 +37.7% +37.6%4 Offices & Others 34 32 +6.5% +28.0% Convention & Exhibition 68 0 n.m. n.m.

Rebasing both periods for the COVID-19 rent relief  the AREPS would have increased by +€0.80 per share (+18.1%).OPERATING PERFORMANCEShopping CentresLike-for-like shopping centre NRI was up +37.6%5 for the Group  and +49.7% in Continental Europe  +14.7% in the US and +34.8% in the UK. All regions benefitted from higher variable income and lower doubtful debtors as a result of better rent collection  and ongoing collection of 2021 rents. Performance in Continental Europe was also driven by the end of COVID-19 rent relief and indexation. The increase in the UK was driven by the end of COVID-19 rent relief. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 rent relief  the Group’s shopping centre like-for-like NRI growth would be +12.8%.Tenant sales6 and footfall7 continue to perform well with sales levels for the Group exceeding 2019 levels and continuing to outperform footfall  thanks to higher conversion rates and longer dwell times. Q1-2022 figures remained impacted by the restrictions in Europe  including a lockdown in The Netherlands  and severe restrictions for non-vaccinated persons in Austria and Germany. Q2 saw an improvement with footfall reaching 91% of 2019 levels for the Group  including 90% in Continental Europe  91% in the UK and 92% in the US. In total  in H1-2022  footfall in Europe reached 85% of 2019 levels and 89% in the US.In Q1-2022  the Group’s European tenant sales reached 89% of 2019 levels. During Q2  tenant sales improved significantly and reached 102%  exceeding 2019 levels earlier than expected  with all European regions except the UK and Austria above 2019 levels. Overall  H1-2022 tenant sales reached 96% of 2019 levels  with Continental Europe and the UK at 97% and 91%  respectively. The performance of the main categories as a percentage of 2019 levels was 107% for Health and Beauty  106% for Sports  96% for F&B  91% for Fashion and 85% for Entertainment.In the US  tenant sales had already reached 2019 levels during the second half of 2021  and continue to consistently outperform pre-COVID levels. H1-2022 sales came to 106% of 2019 levels  driven by the performance of our Flagship8 assets at 114%. The strong recovery in the US continued to be broad-based with almost all categories performing above 2019 levels. Entertainment remains impacted at 77% but showing improvement from 72% in Q1 to 80% in Q2.The performance seen in H1-2022 gives the Group a high degree of confidence that its Flagship destinations  which are located in the most desirable locations  with the best catchment areas and have an affluent customer base  are positioned to outperform and gain market share.Rent collection9 has improved since the full year and reached 96% for H1-2022 (vs. 88% at FY-2021 and 73% in H1-2021). It amounted to 96% in Continental Europe  97% in the UK and 94% in the US. During 2022  the Group also collected €210.9 Mn10 in rents related to 2021  improving its 2021 collection rate from 88% to 92%  and leading to reversals of provisions in H1-2022 of €33.4 Mn.URW signed 1 201 leases11 during H1-2022  broadly in line with H1-2021 and H1-2019. The proportion of long-term leases increased from 44% in H1-2021 to 59% in H1-2022 as conditions improved. Overall  the MGR uplift on all deals was +2.7%. For deals above 36 months MGR uplift came to +11.8% for the Group showcasing asset strength  with Continental Europe at +12.1%  the UK at +0.3% and the US at +23.1%.The Group has benefitted from strong tenant sales  as illustrated by the performance in shopping centre SBR12  which increased from €28.0 Mn in H1-2021 (3.8% of NRI) to €55.5 Mn in H1-2022 (5.4% of NRI). In the US  the increase in shopping centre SBR was the largest from €16.0 Mn in H1-2021 (6.7% of NRI) to €31.3 Mn in H1-2022 (10.7% of NRI).Vacancy for shopping centres at a Group level decreased to 6.9% at H1-2022  down from 8.9% at H1-2021 and 7.0% at FY-2021. In Continental Europe  vacancy was stable at 4.0%  despite the seasonal uptick that had been recorded during Q1. In the UK  vacancy also decreased from 10.6% at FY-2021 to 9.7% at H1-2022. In the US  the vacancy reduced to 10.4% at H1-2022 from 11.0% at FY-2021  while in Flagships13  it decreased from 9.3% to 8.3%.Commercial Partnerships income came to €50.4 Mn in H1-2022  compared to €24.3 Mn in H1-2021 and €50.0 Mn in H1-2019. Europe amounted to €25.2 Mn (vs. €13.2 Mn in H1-2021 and €20.1 Mn in H1-2019) and the US to €25.3 Mn (vs. €11.1 Mn in H1-2021 and €29.9 Mn in H1-2019). The income of new Media  Brand & Data Partnerships division  which is included in the Commercial Partnerships scope and is expected to generate €75 Mn (at 100%) in annual net revenues by 2024 in Europe  amounted to €17.0 Mn in H1-2022.Offices & OthersNRI increased by +6.5%  primarily as a result of the delivery of the Trinity office tower and the Gaîté Montparnasse Hotel and Offices  partly offset by the disposal of Solna Centrum and Les Villages 3  4 and 6. On a like-for-like basis  it was +28.0%  with +55.9% in France thanks to leasing of Trinity  but -30.6% in the US due to the exposure to the San Francisco market where tech companies have been slower in returning to the office.Following 2022 leasing activity  Trinity is currently 74% let. During the first half  the Group also signed a 9-year lease with Arkema for 25 100 sqm in the Lightwell office regeneration project  securing a pre-letting of 80% and 85%14 of the cost of construction. Furthermore  URW signed a lease with Shell on 8 023 sqm  representing 29% of the office buildings in Westfield Hamburg to be delivered in 2024.Convention & ExhibitionRecurring NOI amounted to €94.5 Mn compared to -€1.5 Mn in H1-2021  and €80.6 Mn in H1-2018. In H1-2022  this includes a €25 Mn contribution from the French State  to compensate closure periods in earlier years.In H1-2022  Viparis hosted 272 events (o/w 86 exhibitions  33 congresses and 153 corporate events) vs. 69 events at the same period in 2021. As at June 30  2022  signed and pre-booked events in Viparis venues for 2022 amounted to c. 103% of its expected 2022 rental income  and 89% of 201815 pre-bookings level for the year.DELEVERAGINGIn H1-2022  the Group continues to make deleveraging progress through disposals  control on CAPEX allocation and retaining earnings.In Europe  URW completed in 2022 the disposal of Solna Centrum (Stockholm region)  2 residential buildings at Westfield Hamburg (Hamburg)  a 45% interest in Westfield Carré Sénart (Paris region)  Gera Arcaden (Gera)  Almere Centrum (Amsterdam region) and Carré Sénart Shopping Parc (Paris region).Furthermore  URW’s partner in Aupark (Bratislava) exercised its call option for the acquisition of an additional 27% stake  which is expected to complete in August 2022. The Group also signed on July 21  2022  an agreement for the sale of Villeneuve 2 (Lille region)  which is expected to close in September 2022.The disposals completed or signed in 2022  amounted to €1.2 Bn  representing an average NIY of 5.5% and a premium to the last unaffected appraisal of +2.9%.Upon the closing of these transactions  URW will have completed €3.2 Bn  representing 80% of its €4.0 Bn European disposal programme  at an average NIY of 4.9% and a premium to the last unaffected appraisal of +5.1%. A number of discussions for disposals are ongoing to secure the remainder of the European disposal programme.URW continued to streamline its US portfolio during 2022  with the sale of the Promenade development parcel in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles for a sale price of $150 Mn (at 100%  URW share 55%)  which reflected a +60% premium to the latest appraisal. The company is in active discussions on other regional assets.Given the quality and strong performance of the Group’s Flagship assets  we are confident in our ability to delever the company by executing on the radical reduction of our financial exposure to the US.The Total Investment Cost (TIC)16 of URW’s development pipeline has remained overall stable compared to December 31  2021  at €3.3 Bn  mainly as a result of H1-2021 successful deliveries  offset by cost increases and the addition of the House of Fraser repurposing project at Westfield London  which will turn the building into a premium coworking space by The Ministry  including a multi-studio fitness offer  a rooftop bar and restaurant.Committed projects amount to €2.5 Bn  of which €1.3 Bn has already been invested. The two main projects are mixed used developments in Paris (Gaîté Montparnasse) and Hamburg (Westfield Hamburg). Following the successful pre-letting of 80% of the Lightwell office regeneration  and 85% of the construction secured  the project has now moved from the controlled to the committed pipeline.DELIVERIESIn H1-2022  the Group delivered the Westfield Topanga extension (Los Angeles region) which will open in phases and the Gaîté Montparnasse office (Paris)  representing a total of c. 30 000 sqm and a TIC of €0.2 Bn. The average letting17 of these deliveries stands at 88%.In H2-2022  URW will deliver Les Ateliers Gaîté  “Rue de la Boucle” project at Westfield Forum des Halles and Porte de Paris at Westfield Les 4 Temps  representing a total of c. 31 000 sqm and TIC of €0.3 Bn. The average pre-letting18 of these projects stands at 82%.VALUATIONThe proportionate Gross Market Value (GMV) of the Group’s assets as at June 30  2022  increased by +0.9% to €55.0 Bn from €54.5 Bn as at December 31  2021  mainly as a result of positive FX moves (+€0.9 Bn)  CAPEX  acquisitions and transfers (+€0.4 Bn)  partly offset by disposals (-€0.4 Bn) and revaluation of non like-for-like assets & shares (-€0.2 Bn). In H1-2022  the like-for-like shopping centres valuation was slightly up for Continental Europe (+0.8%)  while the UK (-1.4%) and the US (-3.1%) were down  resulting in -0.3% for the Group overall.On the back of the slight increase in valuation  the EPRA Net Reinstatement Value per share came to €163.40 as at June 30  2022  up +€3.80 (+2.4%) compared to December 31  2021  mainly driven by the retained recurring results and positive FX moves  partly offset by negative revaluations. The EPRA Net Disposal Value increased to €152.90 on the back of the mark-to-market of the debt and financial instruments resulting from the steep increase in rates and spreads in H1-2022.FINANCINGDriven by the progress on disposals and the retained cash flow  the IFRS net financial debt decreased from €22.6 Bn to €22.1 Bn between December 31  2021  and June 30  2022. Pro forma for the disposals of Gera Arcaden  Almere Centrum and Carré Sénart Shopping Parc  which have been cashed-in  and the signed disposals of an additional 27% interest in Aupark and Villeneuve 2  this figure will decline further to €21.6 Bn. The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio decreased from 43.3% to 42.0% (45.8% including the hybrid)  and 41.5% pro-forma (45.3% including the hybrid) for the disposal already signed but not closed at June 30  2022.The Group’s average cost of debt remained stable at 2.0%  representing a blended 1.5% for EUR19 debt and 3.8% for USD and GBP debt.The Group’s average debt maturity remained roughly stable at 8.5 years. Following the operational recovery seen in H1  URW’s credit metrics have improved. The Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) stood at 4.5x (vs. 2.9x at H1-2021)  while the Funds from Operations to Net Financial Debt (FFO / NFD) ratio came to 7.5% (vs. 4.3% at H1-2021). The Net Debt to EBITDA came down from 16.6x in H1-2021 to 11.0x in H1-2022.With cash and available facilities of €12.0 Bn  the Group has fully secured its refinancing needs for the 36 months. Taking into account the expected disposal proceeds of URW’s deleveraging programme  the Group’s debt is fully hedged for the coming 5 years  positioning URW well in the current rising interest rate environment.2022 GUIDANCEBased on the operational recovery achieved in H1-2022 notwithstanding a challenging macro-economic environment  the one-offs received during the period  and hedging which will limit the increase in URW’s financial expenses  the Group increases its 2022 AREPS guidance from €8.20 - €8.40 to at least €8.90.Tenant sales exceeding 2019 levels  significant leasing demand for shopping centres and offices  and the recovery of C&E activity  all demonstrate the appeal of the Group’s assets.Given the current macro-economic environment  this updated guidance does not fully reflect the earlier than expected sales recovery experienced in Q2-2022 for Continental Europe and current level of US sales  or further improvements in rent collection. The Group also assumes no major COVID-19 or energy-related restrictions  nor major disruption to the macro-economic environment.FINANCIAL SCHEDULEThe next financial events on the Group’s calendar will be:October 26  2022: Q3 trading updateFebruary 9  2023: FY-2022 resultsFor further information  please contact:Investor RelationsMaarten Otte+33 7 63 86 88 78maarten.otte@urw.comMedia RelationsUK/Global:Cornelia Schnepf – Finelk+44 7387 108 998Cornelia.Schnepf@finelk.euUnited States:Molly Morse – Kekst CNC+ 1 212 521 4826molly.morse@kekstcnc.comFrance:Nathalie Feld – Image7+33 6 30 47 18 37nfeld@image7.frAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is a dynamic global developer and operator of Flagship Destinations  with a portfolio valued at €55.0 Bn as at June 30  2022  of which 87% in retail  6% in offices  5% in convention & exhibition venues and 2% in services.

Several best-selling French authors also have left Hachette.Under the plan  Bollore would sell all the Editis shares he would receive after the transaction  which would consist of a simultaneous distribution of Editis shares to Vivendi shareholders and the listing of Editis on the Euronext Paris stock exchange  it said.Bollore is Vivendi’s controlling shareholder with a 29% stake. The mass media holding company already owns 57% of Lagardere following a bid for all of the shares of the group  which is also home to flagship newspapers such as JDD and Paris Match. Vivendi has said it is ready to spend as much as 2 billion euros to acquire all of Lagardere’s shares.But Vivendi’s voting rights in Lagardere are capped at 23% until a merger approval by competition authorities.Vivendi reported that its revenue in the first half of the year was 4.87 billion euros  up 5.4% on an underlying basis from the same period a year earlier. The growth was driven by international operations at its pay-TV unit Canal Plus.Core operating profits over the period were up by 31.5% from a year earlier to 412 million euros  it said.(This story refiles to fix date of story)(Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain; editing by David Evans and Paul Simao),neutral,0.05,0.84,0.11,negative,0.01,0.05,0.94,True,English,"['French investor', 'Editis sale', 'Lagardere takeover', 'Bollore', 'Several best-selling French authors', 'mass media holding company', 'pay-TV unit Canal Plus', 'two biggest publishing groups', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'new publishing behemoth', 'The Vivendi-Lagardere tie-up', 'Core operating profits', 'Paris Match', 'European Union', 'antitrust authorities', 'independent publishers', 'famous one', 'simultaneous distribution', 'controlling shareholder', 'flagship newspapers', '2 billion euros', 'voting rights', 'merger approval', 'competition authorities', 'first half', '4.87 billion euros', 'underlying basis', 'international operations', '412 million euros', 'Mathieu Rosemain', 'David Evans', 'Paul Simao', 'same period', 'Vivendi shareholders', 'Editis shares', 'combination', 'France', 'Hachette', 'prospect', 'wave', 'criticism', 'Gallimard', 'plan', 'Bollore', 'transaction', 'listing', '29% stake', 'bid', 'JDD', 'revenue', 'year', 'growth', 'story', 'date', 'editing']",2022-07-28,2022-07-29,fxempire.com

Today  Lectra’s Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2022  which have been subject to a limited review by the Statutory Auditors.To facilitate analysis of the Group’s results  the financial statements are compared to those published in 2021 and to the 2021 pro forma financial statement (""2021 Pro forma"")  prepared by integrating the three acquisitions made in 2021 – Gerber Technology (“Gerber”)  Neteven  and Gemini CAD Systems (“Gemini”) – as if they had been consolidated from January 1  2021  whereas they have been consolidated since June 1  July 28 and September 27  2021 respectively.GREAT RESILIENCY IN A DEGRADED ENVIRONMENTThe first semester was significantly marked by the war in Ukraine and its consequences. As soon as the conflict began  the Company decided to cease its operations in Russia  by suspending the activity of its subsidiary Lectra Russia and stopping all deliveries of products or services. The Group's direct exposure to Ukraine and Russia is low; the contribution of these two countries in 2021 accounted for less than 1 percent of revenues.Story continuesThis war has accelerated price increases  energy shortfalls and shortages in some raw materials. However  their impact on the Group's financial statements was limited due to its low exposure to energy costs and a limited dependency on those raw materials affected the most. The Group also adjusted sale prices to compensate for the increase in its production costs  first in January and then in July.In addition  the lockdown periods had a negative impact on the amount of orders in China. They also caused delays in the delivery of CAD/CAM equipment  including a portion of that equipment manufactured in China  estimated at 2.4 million euros  which had not been recovered at the end of June; the shortfall is expected to be rectified by the end of September. Moreover  persistent problems in maritime shipping have caused shipping delays that adversely affected revenues.Finally  since the beginning of 2022  the dollar has significantly strengthened against the euro. With an average exchange rate of $1.09/€1 in H1  it was up 10% compared to H1 2021. This change and other currency changes mechanically increased revenues by roughly 6%. The difference between the observed exchange rates and the dollar/euro rate used to define the 2022 objectives ($1.13/€1) had only a +2% impact on revenues.In this environment  the Group has once again demonstrated its resiliency  with strong earnings growth.Q2 2022Q2 2022 revenues (128.9 million euros) increased by 61%. EBITDA before non-recurring items (23.7 million euros) doubled compared to Q2 2021 and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 18.4%.Income from operations before non-recurring items (16.2 million euros) was multiplied by 2.1 and net income (10.9 million euros) by 3.7  compared to 2021  which included a non-recurring charge of 3.8 million euros in respect of the acquisition of Gerber.Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 7.7 million euros (4.5 million euros in Q2 2021).Comparison to the 2021 Pro formaIn the climate of uncertainty and slowing economic growth affecting many countries  some of the Group's customers have decided to postpone their investment decisions. Furthermore  the strict lockdown measures implemented by the Chinese government  which became even stricter in late March and were only gradually lifted from the beginning of June  had a very negative impact on orders in China.Despite this context  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (55.3 million euros) increased by 4% compared to Q2 2021. The annual value of new software subscription orders amounted to 1.9 million euros  down 14%.Revenues increased by 12% compared to the 2021 Pro forma.EBITDA before non-recurring items increased by 51% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items by 4.8 percentage points.Partnership between Lectra Turkey and Glengo TeknolojiOn April 25  2021  the Company announced that Lectra Turkey had joined forces with Glengo Teknoloji (see press release issued on that date).FIRST HALF 2022H1 2022 revenues (250.8 million euros) increased by 71%. EBITDA before non-recurring items (45.2 million euros) was up 95% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 18.0%.Consolidated income from operations before non-recurring items amounted to 30.7 million euros (16.2 million euros in H1 2021)  up 90%. This includes a 5.6-million-euro charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of Gerber  Neteven and Gemini  and of the activity of Glengo Teknoloji.Net income (20.2 million euros) was multiplied by 2.3.Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 14.7 million euros (14.3 million euros in H1 2021).Comparison to the 2021 Pro formaH1 orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (107.1 million euros) were up 8% compared to the 2021 Pro forma. The annual value of new software subscription orders (4.2 million euros) increased by 33%.Despite the negative impact of the war in Ukraine and the lockdown measures in China  H1 2022 revenues increased by 11%. Revenues from perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (100.5 million euros) were up 10%  those from recurring contracts (80.2 million euros) by 11% and those from consumables and parts (70.1 million euros) by 12%.EBITDA before non-recurring items increased by 44% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items by 4.1 percentage points.Balance sheet at June 30  2022At June 30  2022  the Group had a particularly robust balance sheet  with a consolidated shareholders’ equity of 437.1 million euros (400.8 million euros at December 31  2021) and a net financial debt of 13.3 million euros  consisting in financial debt of 118.5 million euros and available cash of 105.2 million euros.The working capital requirement at June 30  2022 was a negative 16.5 million euros.BUSINESS TRENDS IN 2022In its 2021 Financial Report  published February 9  2022  the Group indicated that the acquisitions made in 2021  and particularly the acquisition of Gerber  give the Group a new dimension and open new perspectives.It further explained that uncertainties persist regarding the evolution of the pandemic and its impacts on the macroeconomic environment and could continue to weigh on investment decisions by the Group’s customers. To those uncertainties have been added the consequences of the war in Ukraine and of the strict lockdown measures implemented in China.At the beginning of 2022  the Group set itself objectives of achieving  in the current fiscal year  revenues in the range of 508 to 556 million euros (+31% to +43%) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 92 to 104 million euros (+41% to +60%). These objectives were prepared on the basis of the closing exchange rates on December 31  2021  and particularly $1.13 to the euro.While the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment renders the level of order intake in the second half of the year uncertain  the order backlog at June 30 remains high and provides Lectra with good visibility regarding revenues in the coming months. Furthermore  the Group stands to benefit from the strength of the dollar against the euro  were the dollar to remain strong.In light of the above  the Group now anticipates achieving full-year 2022 revenues in the range of 514 to 534 million euros (+33% to +38%) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 95 to 102 million euros (+46% to +57%). These new scenarios were established on the basis of the actual exchange rates in H1  and the rates on June 30  2022  particularly $1.04/€1  for the second half of 2022.The 2021 Annual Financial Report  as well as the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for H1 2022 are available on lectra.com.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov ). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  July 28  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity”  which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

8331,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/geojunxion-nv-ticker-gojxn-formerly-060000333.html,GeoJunxion NV (ticker: GOJXN.AS) Formerly called AND International Publishers NV (AND.AS) - Business update Full Year 2021-2022,Capelle aan den IJssel  The Netherlands  28 July 2022  GeoJunxion generated positive cash flow for full year 2021-22 and delivered on guided revenue growth...,"GeoJunxion N.V.Capelle aan den IJssel  The Netherlands  28 July 2022  GeoJunxion generated positive cash flow for full year 2021-22 and delivered on guided revenue growth of 40% year-over-year  while keeping costs down compared to 2020-2021.The closure of June 2022 also represents the end of the Financial Year 2021/22 (1 July 21 – 30 June 22) for GeoJunxion: our Location data and technology business has proven to be solid  despite the external challenging variables like the Covid-19 pandemic persisting  the unexpected extended war in Ukraine  the market volatility  the raising inflation rates and the general concerns about a potential upcoming recession. GeoJunxion performed in line with the guidance  with a revenue growth of 40% YOY.“We are continuously encouraged by the market interest in our new premium location aware products. Eco and Safety Alert Zones  in particular Low Emissions and School Safety geofences play a key role in our portfolio of products and services”. Most of our revenues continues to come from the Location Intelligence Services  which have attracted the attention of public and private companies in various industry sectors and resulted in an increased strength of our pipeline of opportunities for the new coming financial year 2022/23. Within the Location Intelligence Services  the Outdoor Venue Plan are getting more traction. This materialized in last mile maps for two major events in The Netherlands during Q2 2022.Our continued focus on cost control is paying off: For the full year 2021-22  operating expenses were slightly lower than last year  despite the 40% revenue growth. The increased revenue paired with cost control measures  resulted in a positive EBITDA for the accounting year 2021-22. Assisted by COVID related government measures (delayed payments of salary taxes) we also managed to generate positive cash flow during the past accounting year. This is a major accomplishment  after years of ongoing negative cash flows.Story continuesOPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATEStrategy UpdateGeoJunxion’s strategy remains solidly focused on creating “map agnostic” data products. Digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into  or overlaid on any commercial or open-source brand of maps. Data to be utilised in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases and in different industries and market sectors. A key role is played by smart dynamic geofences  like the Eco Alert Zones and the Safety Alert Zones. Our Location Intelligence Services continue to represent the most important source for revenue generation.GeoJunxion’s efforts are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with our customers  through the creation of recurring business models rather than one-off opportunities. Although the relationship with clients frequently starts with a proof-of-concept or a custom  one-off project  most of the Company’s development actions go into building value-added  dynamic content  requiring continuous or frequent updates to maintain and increase their value over time. This means that most of our proof-of-concept and one-off projects are a launch-pad for establishing a service or a license contract  converting the initial activities into a recurring  more predictable and sustainable business model.Moreover  when executing projects  GeoJunxion typically retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  which can be subsequently resold to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle.Our mission remains focused on improving road safety and contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions.Central to GeoJunxion’s strategy are:Cost effective sourcing  production  ingestion and aggregation of geodata.Flexible licensing models at competitive pricing.Direct delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIs.Highly customised solutions and content creation.Market DevelopmentsDespite the general situation improved significantly  COVID 19 still impacted our results. Most of the companies remains cautious in their investments delaying some scheduled activities. While clear signs of improvement were raising in some industry sectors  the conflict in Ukraine has brought other concerns and forced existing and potential customers to pay even more attention in their expenditures  given the general instability and uncertainty.At the time of publishing this report  we had no relevant material business exposure to the recent events in Ukraine. There are no active customers  or deliveries due to be received from Ukraine or Russia. We have no staff located in Ukraine or Russia. GeoJunxion’s pipeline of opportunities has limited exposure towards both countries. GeoJunxion is however exposed to raising inflation rates  as any other Company  due to increased energy and other raw material prices  which has started impacting the salary & benefit expenses of our teams.GeoJunxion continues to develop opportunities in the Automotive and Autonomous driving sector  in Transport and Logistics  Insurtech and Real Estate markets. This is done through our portfolio of geofences  which is constantly expanding and under frequent maintenance. Significant efforts have been made to expand the existing relationships with big Global Tech Companies and Public Administrations  not only through the delivery of unique data content to be utilized as geofences in a variety of use cases  but also through custom Location Intelligence Services.Within the Location Intelligence Services  GeoJunxion is experienced in building location-aware maps for indoor and outdoor settings. We combine data insights with cartographic technologies to create bespoke mapping solutions that benefit venue employees  visitors and stakeholders. In support of this  we released a dedicated e-book: ""The Potential for Location- Aware Technologies in Tracking Both People and Assets in Indoor and Outdoor Venues"". This completes a series of e-books started in the second half of last year  that touched also the Insurance and Insurtech market (e-book title: “Can Location Aware Content reduce Insurance claims?”) and Transport and Logistics (e-book title: “Solving Business-Critical Transport & Logistics challenges with Geo-Data"").In order to strengthen GeoJunxion presence in the market  our leadership team attended a few important events during the first half of 2022. We participated in investor events like VFB (Vlaamse Federatie van Beleggers) in Kinepolis  Antwerp in April. We were present in several business and technical events like: Home Delivery World Europe in Amsterdam  Intertraffic Amsterdam 2022  HAN Kennisfestival Intelligente Mobiliteit in Arnhem  NGF Datagedreven Ecosysteem in Utrecht and ASITA Annual Conference in Genoa  Italy.Business DevelopmentIn the quarter from April to June 2022  GeoJunxion continued to develop the High Alert Zones data suite. The focus has been on keeping Eco Alert Zones up to date  for passenger cars  commercial light vehicles and heavy vehicles  and launching the new School Safety Zones  as part of the Safety Alert Zones. Both Eco and Safety Zones are categorized as smart dynamic geofences.A geofence is a virtual boundary  delimiting a real-world geographical location. Such virtual boundaries can be of any size or shape: a straight line between two points  a circle around a specific geo-located center point  or a complex geometry like an intricated polygon delimiting the road-network of a city (like is case in our Eco and Safety Alert Zones).Like a physical fence  a geofence defines a separation between what is inside the virtual boundary and what is outside. A geofence can also be smart: smart geofences may change in shape  size and other characteristics (for instance active or inactive) depending on the attributes assigned to them. Geofences can be visualized on a map  visible to the users  or they can be hidden  readable only by dedicated software  providing geo-targeted push notifications and messages to end users  including security alerts. Its purpose is to allow asset and people tracking or triggering any other action or collect location data. The process of using geofences  is called geofencing  and it’s a vital part of any navigation systems  routing or route optimization application  fleet management system and more.In April 2022 the School Safety Zones have been officially launched  generating a lot of interest from our clients. School Safety Zones are specialized dynamic smart geofences (complex polygons)  with meta data such as school opening and closing times  around schools and kindergartens. The precise location of the school is the geo-localized starting point. In creating the Safety Zone around it  GeoJunxion takes in consideration the relevant infrastructure  which is used in reaching the destination. Think of bus stops  zebra crossings  walking paths and dangerous intersections  to mention a few of them.In addition to this new dataset  the Location Intelligence Services have played a primary role in the business development of the period. We continued with the diligent execution and completed the successful deliveries for all the three tailor-made Location Intelligence Services  won in Q1/2022. Thereby serving two large global Tech Companies. Two of those contracts were Proofs of Concept  perfectly aligned with GeoJunxion’s strategic focus on safety on the road and environmental sustainability. The efforts invested in such development may lead to very interesting contracts extensions and additional opportunities in the new coming financial year 2022/23.The most relevant efforts in business development during the first half of 2022 has been on the acquisition of a significant Location Intelligence contract with an important Navigation and Infotainment Systems supplier in the Automotive industry. The contract was signed at the very beginning of Q2/2022. We embraced this opportunity as a long-term partnership with clear common technical and commercial objectives and with the intent to establish a solid and fruitful long-term relationship.Our Outdoor Venue Plan and Location Intelligence Services continue receiving interest from existing and prospect customers. This interest comes from local Municipalities  engaged in their path to the digitalization of their services. Interest came also from private organizations  with the goal to improve their customers’ experience. This led to the acquisition and development of two Outdoor Venue Plans during Q2/2022  for a jumping sports events and a large festival in The Netherlands (CHIO Rotterdam 2022 and Zwarte Cross 2022).During the quarter  GeoJunxion has also invested in strategic cooperations and partnerships with other Companies. The partnership between NextBillion.ai  an industry-leading spatial data and AI platform and GeoJunxion  the leading Low Emission Zones and Restricted Traffic Areas data provider is proof of that. This strategic cooperation will help to improve the effectiveness of the Low Emission Zone (LEZ) — an initiative that is designed to protect the environment.Product DevelopmentProduct development during the last quarter of the fiscal year 2021/22 (April-June ‘22) was mainly focused on the diligent execution of the Location Intelligence Services projects won in the first months of 2022. Product Development has been done in geo-location services for heavy vehicles and trucks regulations  but also for “leisure” markets on hiking trails and walking areas.The biggest development efforts went into the Location Intelligence contract with an important Navigation and Infotainment Systems supplier in the Automotive industry. The current challenging market conditions (for the automotive market) and the introduction of new regulations (like ISA) are imposing significant changes in the strategy of most of the suppliers of infotainment systems. GeoJunxion continues to support these and other requirements.The European Commission has taken unprecedented action to help the transport sector and public authorities prepare for the mobility of tomorrow  with introduction of the General Vehicle Safety Regulation (EU) 2019/2144. The objective is to protect European citizens against traffic accidents  poor air quality and climate change. To empower them with new mobility solutions that match their changing needs and defend the competitiveness of European industry. As of 23 June 2022  the delegated act “Technical requirements and test procedure for approval of intelligent speed assistance (ISA)” has been adopted. From July 2022  Intelligent speed assistance (ISA) will be mandatory for new models/types of vehicles introduced on the European market. The ISA will become mandatory for all new cars that will be sold from July 2024.Product development was dedicated to keep Eco Alert Zones dataset and related APIs  up to date. To enable an easier and more effective delivery to the clients. This authoritative and dynamic dataset perfectly fits GeoJunxion’s mission to foster safety and sustainability through location-aware content. It creates added value to B2B clients operating in the Automotive  Transport & Logistics  Real Estate  Utilities & Services markets  as well as public organizations.GeoJunxion’s Eco Alert Zones database continues to expand: It currently includes over 2.500 areas in 35 Countries. Zones can be divided in three major categories:Low Emission and Congestion Zones for passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles up to 3 5T;Low Emission and Congestion Zones for Heavy Vehicles over 3 5T;Limited Traffic Zones for all types of vehicles.The dataset is monitored daily and updated as soon as any modification in the geometry or attributes is announced by the responsible governmental authority.Regarding the bespoke Outdoor Venue Plans for CHIO Rotterdam 2022 and ZWARTE CROSS 2022:CHIO Rotterdam is the only Dutch equestrian 5 stars outdoor event and belongs to the very best international events in the world. With a 72 years history in top level showjumping and dressage  CHIO Rotterdam is also the eldest international top sports event in Rotterdam. For business  the CHIO is the place to be. Many prominent politicians and top executives visit the event every year. Together with the KLM Open and the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament  the CHIO belongs to the top 3 of hospitality events in the Netherlands (Ref: CHIO Rotterdam website).GeoJunxion is also proud to have supported the Dutch Red Cross for emergency management and response at the Zwarte Cross Festival in Lichtenvoorde (NED). GeoJunxion developed a navigable  digital map of the area with all relevant Points of Interest (POI)  such as entrances  campgrounds  stages  and the Red Cross first aid locations. On top of the Outdoor Venue Plan of the event area  GeoJunxion created a grid to help the Red Cross volunteers to identify the precise locations. In case of an emergency  the volunteers receive the grid location of the emergency  and are guided to this location on their mobile device. This way  they can easily find and navigate to the emergency location and respond quickly. “In case of an emergency  every second counts! In the past  the Red Cross volunteers used a paper map. They needed to find their location and navigate manually to the place of the emergency. Now they save precious minutes in response time  which can be critical in case of emergency.”GeoJunxion continues exploring the combination of geo-localized interactive content and virtual immersive reality to offer a unique and attractive combination of services.ORGANIZATIONGeoJunxion has received Level 2 certification on Social Entrepreneurship: the “Prestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen (PSO)”. This independent assessment shows that GeoJunxion offers high-quality employment to people who have difficulty accessing the labor market and collaborates with organizations that also do or strive to achieve this. With this certification  GeoJunxion provides an above-average contribution in the field of social entrepreneurship in a sustainable way. GeoJunxion is one of the first publicly listed organizations in The Netherlands with a PSO quality certification. “GeoJunxion has valued diversity  integration and investment in social responsibility for years. We are committed to offering our daily contribution towards a better and more sustainable work environment. Every single action count and we are conscious about that”.During the Financial Year 2021/22  GeoJunxion went through a partial reorganization. The roles “Head of Marketing” and “Head of Business Strategy & Enablement” have been made redundant. At the same time new investments have been made in the R&D and Operations departments. New resources were hired to support the projects in Location Intelligence Services  accelerate innovation in some key areas like API development  deep learning and to strengthen the data sourcing team.FINANCIAL POSITIONGeoJunxion has closed the current accounting year per 30 June 2022 with a cash balance of Euro 953K. This represents a positive cash flow over the past 12 month of Euro 131K. Based on our current outlook  the available cash on hand is estimated to be sufficient to cover our operational requirements for at least the next 12 months.EXTERNAL AUDITOR – Status updateGeoJunxion is one of 9 actively trading companies  quoted on Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange  that have been unable to present audited financial statements  because of unavailability of a PIE/OOB licensed auditor. The proposed legislation regarding the future of the Dutch Accountancy Sector (voorstel voor de Wet toekomst accountancysector)  includes a proposed process whereby the NBA (Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants)  at the request of the company  can assign a PIE/OOB licensed auditor and determine a reasonable fee for the auditing activities. The Management Board continues to support this initiative and hopes that this proposal obtains the necessary political support to be converted into legislation in a timely way.In the meantime  we have connected with all 6 Dutch PIE/OOB licensed auditors and requested a quotation to audit our 2021-2022 annual accounts. Four company have declined to quote  one is in process of reviewing our request and one company has not responded to our request (to date).RISK MANAGEMENTRisk management is an integral managerial task. Our risk management and control procedures take into consideration the size of the company and the character of the business to identify the most significant risks which the company is exposed to. The risks identified are discussed on a periodical basis and mitigated or fully resolved  where possible. Such a system cannot provide absolute certainty that objectives will be realized. Neither can it guarantee prevention of potential cases of material mistakes  damage  fraud  or breaches of statutory laws.The 2020-21 annual report  as published in October 2021  describes the principal strategic  operational  and financial risks. The risks and uncertainties described in the annual report are relevant and are deemed incorporated and repeated by reference in this report. There were no cases of material damage  fraud or breaches of law detected since issuing the Annual Accounts.On the Social aspect  we continue to pay particular attention on preventive actions to limit exposure of our people to Covid-19  encouraging and supporting smart working from home  and establishing clear rules for those that need to be physically present in our offices. Our people are our key assets  and we do whatever we can to keep them safe and healthy.GROUP STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATIONDuring the past year the GeoJunxion group structure was significantly simplified: AND Data India Private Ltd was liquidated and the entity was removed from the corporate registry in India.

Our organic revenue growth outside China reached +43.1% in H1 2022 and +34.7% in Q2 2022. This performance has been driven by the strong growth of digital and the strong recovery of our roadside activities especially Street Furniture which was already back to pre-Covid revenue levels in H1  while Transport remained impacted by mobility restrictions  including major lockdowns in China.Digital Out Of Home (DOOH) grew strongly at +79.6% in H1 2022  +72.0% on an organic basis  to reach 30.0% of Group revenue vs 22.8% in H1 2021. Our programmatic advertising revenue more than doubled vs the same period last year through the VIOOH SSP (Supply Side Platform)  the most connected of the OOH industry  which offers DOOH inventory from JCDecaux for 17 countries now  including Brazil since June  as well as from other OOH media owners. We have concluded in July a strategic alliance including the acquisition of a majority stake  with Displayce  a leading DSP (Demand Side Platform)  that will enable us to offer a full-stack solution  from DSP to SSP  to our clients  while continuing to offer complete and direct access for advertisers and media agencies to all DOOH media by keeping Displayce independent and fully open.Story continuesBy activity  Street Furniture was strong at +37.6% organically in H1 2022 and was back to H1 2019 levels globally and above in Europe (including France and UK) and in North America; Billboard grew significantly as well at +21.9% organically in H1 2022  above 2019 in Asia-Pacific; Transport grew strongly at +27.3% reflecting the strong return of US air travel at 90% of pre-Covid level with US airport adverting revenue also at 90% of pre-Covid level  in the Middle-East with air travel at 75% of pre-covid levels  our airport advertising revenue being above 90% of pre-Covid levels  but Transport remained meaningfully impacted by mobility restrictions in China and by lower commuter traffic in public transport than pre-pandemic.All geographies grew strongly in H1 2022 except Asia-Pacific which was down single digit organically due to its Transport exposure and to local mobility restrictions especially in China in Q2.Our adjusted operating margin has significantly improved by €152.2m to reach €183.6 million  a +484.8% increase year-on-year reflecting a strong operating leverage due to a tight control over our cost base growing at a much slower pace than the revenue growth and despite the negative impact from the decrease of revenue in China year-on-year in Q2. Our other financial performance indicators improved accordingly. With a positive funds from operations at €80.7 million from -€74.4 million in H1 2021 and a tight control over working capital requirements  our Free-Cash Flow improved by €20.1 million. Our net debt decreased by €186.4 million compared to the same period last year to €976.9 million as of June 30th  2022.Recognized as best-in-class by extra-financial rating agencies  we have reaffirmed the excellence of our sustainable practices by unveiling in May our ambitious 2030 ESG Strategy. This aims to support the circular economy  promote outdoor advertising as a catalyst for ecological and social transition and work towards the decarbonisation of the economy and society.As far as Q3 is concerned  organic revenue growth rates continue to be either high single digit or double digit in most countries while in China our advertising revenue remains negatively impacted by mobility restrictions. We now expect an organic revenue growth rate at around +7% with Street Furniture revenue above the same quarter in 2019.As the most digitised global OOH company with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet and the high quality of our teams across the world  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.”Following the adoptions of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014 and IFRS 16 from January 1st  2019  and in compliance with the AMF’s instructions  the operating data presented below are adjusted:to include our prorata share in companies under joint control  regarding IFRS 11 to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on our core business lease agreements (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” on page 5 of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros.

As a percentage of revenue  this represented a 1420bp increase to -1.2%  from -15.4% in H1 2021  Street Furniture EBIT margin turning positive at +2.9%. The positive variation is mainly due to the increase of the operating margin as net amortisation and provisions were relatively stable over the period.The impairment on tangible and intangible assets of +€3 million in H1 2022 is related to the mechanical reversal of the provisions for onerous contracts recognised from our historical impairment tests.Adjusted EBIT  after impairment charge  has improved by €148.5 million from -€163.5 million in H1 2021 to -€14.9 million in H1 2022.NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (LOSS) (3)In the first half of 2022  interest expenses on IFRS 16 leases were quite stable at -€41.8 million compared to -€42.1 million in the first half of 2021  the mechanical reduction of the IFRS 16 lease liability related to the contract life progression being compensated by the additions coming from new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed.In the first half of 2022  excluding IFRS 16  other net financial income / (loss) was -€25.9 million compared to -€21.0 million in the first half of 2021  a variation of -€4.9 million mainly due to the financial interest expenses relating to the €500 million bond placed in January 2022 and discounting charges on dismantling provision and employee benefits.EQUITY AFFILIATESIn the first half of 2022  the share of net profit from equity affiliates was €7.1 million  increasing significantly compared to the same period last year (-€6.7 million)  reflecting the improvement in the overall operational performance of our affiliates in line with the recovery of our activitiesNET INCOME GROUP SHAREIn the first half of 2022  net income Group share before impairment charge increased by +€143.3 million to -€13.5 million compared to -€156.9 million in H1 2021.Taking into account the net impact from the impairment charge  net income Group share increased by €142.6 million to -€11.7 million compared to -€154.4 million in H1 2021.ADJUSTED CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn the first half of 2022  adjusted net capex (acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals of assets) at €122.4 million remain below H1 2019 capex by 10.4%.

Changes in our working capital had almost no impact on the cash-flow generation during the period (-€1.4 million) despite the strong increase in revenue due to an ongoing tight management over cash collection and payments. After capital expenditure  adjusted free cash flow amounted to -€43.1 million  an improvement of €20 1 million vs H1 2021.DIVIDENDThe AGM held on May 11th  2022 decided not to distribute a dividend  in order to continue to optimize our financial flexibility.NET DEBT (5)Net debt amounted to €976.9 million as of June 30th  2022  a slight increase vs €924 5 million as of the end of December 2021 but significantly below (-€186.4 million) June 30th  2021 where it stood at €1 163.3 million.In January 2022  we decided to take advantage of the good market conditions to extend our debt maturity schedule and secured our financing profile with the issuance of a €500 million bond with a maturity in 2030 and a coupon at 1.625%. Subscribed more than 3 times and placed with investors of high quality  the success of this new issuance demonstrates both the quality of JCDecaux’s signature and the investors’ confidence in the rebound capacity and in the growth potential of the Group.RIGHT-OF-USE & LEASE LIABILITIES IFRS 16Right-of-use IFRS 16 as of June 30th  2022 amounted to €2 949.4 million compared to €2 964.8 million as of December 31st  2021  a slight decrease related to the amortisation of rights-of-use and contracts renegotiations partially offset by foreign exchange rate impacts  new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed.IFRS 16 lease liabilities increased by €29.1 million from €3 655.8 million as of December 31st  2021 to €3 684.8 million as of June 30th  2022 (€3 789.6 million as of June 30th  2021). The increase  mainly related to new contracts and renewals and a positive foreign exchange rates impact is partly offset by repayments occurred on the first half of 2022 as well as renegotiations and end of contracts.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.Under IFRS 16  applicable from January 1st  2019  a lease liability for contractual fixed rental payments is recognised on the balance sheet  against a right-of-use asset to be depreciated over the lease term. As regards P&L  the fixed rent expense is replaced by the depreciation of the right-of-use in EBIT  below the operating margin  and a lease interest expense on the lease liability in financial result  below EBIT. IFRS 16 has no impact on cash payments but payment of debt (principal) is booked in funds from financing activities.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group and the readability of our performance  our operating management reports used to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance continue:To integrate on proportional basis operating data of the companies under joint control and;To exclude the IFRS 16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).As regards the P&L  it concerns all aggregates down to the EBIT. As regards the cash flow statement  it concerns all aggregates down to the free cash flow.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In the first half of 2022  the impacts of IFRS 11 and IFRS 16 on our adjusted aggregates are:-€106.9 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue (-€87.9 million for IFRS 11 in H1 2021) leaving IFRS revenue at €1367.8 million (€994.4 million in H1 2021).-€21.3 million for IFRS 11 and €387.6 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted operating margin(-€16.0 million for IFRS 11 and €406.2 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2021) leaving IFRS operating margin at €549.9 million (€421.6 million in H1 2021).-€12.7 million for IFRS 11 and €50.3 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT before impairment charge (-€6.3 million for IFRS 11 and €56.2 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2021) leaving IFRS EBIT before impairment charge at €19.8 million (-€117.0 million in H1 2021).-€11.8 million for IFRS 11 and €50.3 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT after impairment charge (-€6.3 million for IFRS 11 and €56.2 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2021) leaving IFRS EBIT after impairment charge at €23.6 million (-€113.6 million in H1 2021).-€0.8 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted capital expenditure (€1.5 million for IFRS 11 in H1 2021) leaving IFRS capital expenditure at -€123.2 million (-€58.4 million in H1 2021).€8.4 million for IFRS 11 and €313.6 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted free cash flow (€0.8 million for IFRS 11 and €317.0 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2021) leaving IFRS free cash flow at €278.9 million (€254.6 million in H1 2021).The full reconciliation between adjusted figures and IFRS figures is provided on page 9 of this release.NOTESOperating Margin: Revenue less Direct Operating Expenses (excluding Maintenance spare parts) less SG&A expenses. EBIT: Earnings Before Interests and Taxes = Operating Margin less Depreciation  amortization and provisions (net) less Impairment of goodwill less Maintenance spare parts less Other operating income and expenses. Net financial income / (loss): Excluding the net impact of discounting and revaluation of debt on commitments to purchase minority interests (-€1.2 million and -€1.4 million in H1 2022 and H1 2021 respectively). Free cash flow: Net cash flow from operating activities less capital investments (property  plant and equipment and intangible assets) net of disposals. Net debt: Debt net of managed cash less bank overdrafts  excluding the non-cash IAS 32 impact (debt on commitments to purchase minority interests)  including the non-cash IFRS 9 impact on both debt and hedging financial derivatives excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities.ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 H1 2021 adjusted revenue (a) 454.3 628.1 1 082.3 2022 IFRS revenue (b) 628.5 739.3 1 367.8 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 54.4 52.5 106.9 2022 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 683.0 791.8 1 474.8 Currency impacts (e) -20.9 -28.3 -49.2 2022 adjusted revenue at 2021 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 662.1 763.5 1 425.6 Change in scope (g) 0.0 0.0 0.0 2022 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 662.1 763.5 1 425.6 Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +45.7% +21.6% +31.7%€m Impact of currencyas of June 30th  2022 USD -10.6 CNY -10.6 BRL -4.4 GBP -4.4 Others -19.2 Total -49.2Average exchange rate H1 2022 H1 2021 USD 0.9147 0.8296 CNY 0.1412 0.1283 BRL 0.1802 0.1541 GBP 1.1874 1.1521Next information:Q3 2022 revenue: November 3rd  2022 (after market)Key Figures for JCDecaux2021 revenue: €2 745m (a) – H1 2022 revenue: €1 474.8m (a)N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of more than 850 million people in more than 80 countries957 706 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 518 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants10 720 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (4.2/5)  CDP (A Leadership)  MSCI (AA) and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100 (committed to 100% renewable energy)Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (530 143 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 154 airports and 215 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (340 753 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (72 611 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (596 831 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (232 268 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (64 893 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (20 808 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (14 177 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube .Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its results for the first half of 2022.Commenting on the results  Philippe Berterottière  Chairman and CEO of GTT  said: “With 88 orders for LNG carriers  our core business sales performance for the first half of 2022 beats our record for the whole of 2021  highlighting particularly strong momentum. Furthermore  the final investment decisions on new liquefaction plants taken in the second quarter  the expected ramp-up of LNG carrier orders from Qatar and increasing demand for LNG in Europe have confirmed the need for infrastructure and LNG carriers in the years to come.The first half is also promising for LNG as fuel  with 38 orders already placed  well above last year’s level. In addition  the growing number of mid-sized container ships in our order book is evidence of our enlarged market share in this sector.In order to meet the needs of the market  new shipyards have been marketing our technologies since the first half of the year.GTT maintains a tireless focus on R&D to meet its customers’ energy transition needs and the increased requirements they face. During the first half  we obtained a number of approvals from classification bodies to develop new innovative technologies across a wide range of fields  notably for our future NEXT1 containment system and for designing a LH 2 carrier as part of our partnership with Shell.Story continuesFrom a financial perspective  revenues for the first half of 2022 were  as expected  lower than for the first half of 2021. This decline is attributable to a base effect  as the first half of 2021 still benefitted from the excellent momentum experienced in 2020  whereas the first half of 2022 didn’t get the full impact of the high order intake in 2021 and 2022. It is worth noting that revenues increased by 11.5% between Q1 and Q2 2022. Margin levels achieved in the first half of 2022 are also lower than in H1 2021  due to lower revenues  partly offset by cost reductions.As regards 2022 targets  in the second quarter the Group noted some delays in shipbuilding schedules  resulting in a postponement of revenue recognition. These delays have various reasons: supply difficulties related to sanctions  lockdowns and social movements in Asia. Given these delays  we are confirming our annual targets  but we now expect to be in the lower half of the range announced in February.Furthermore  work on projects in which the Group is involved in Russia is continuing in compliance with the applicable sanction regimes. However  given the increasing impact of international sanctions on LNG liquefaction projects in Russia  the continuation and proper execution of these contracts are exposed to risks of postponement or cancellation.However  the crisis has highlighted the global scale of gas demand  the need for European countries to achieve energy independence in respect of Russia and  more specifically  the strategic importance of maritime transport of LNG  GTT’s core business.”Business activity- Record order intake for LNG carriersIn the first half of 2022  GTT booked 88 orders for LNG carriers  continuing the excellent sales momentum achieved in Q1 2022. Delivery is scheduled between Q3 2024 and Q2 2027. It should be noted that orders for projects in Qatar amounted to 24 vessels in the first half of the year.- New record for fitting LNG-powered vesselsFollowing the record number of orders received in 2021 (27 vessels)  GTT received 38 orders for LNG-powered vessels in the first half of 2022  confirming another record year in this segment. These orders were received from various Chinese and Korean shipyards on behalf of several major global ship-owners. Delivery of the vessels is scheduled between Q1 2024 and Q1 2026.- Smart Shipping: flagship contract signedGTT has signed a contract with a major player in the liquefied gas transport industry for GTT Digital to equip 30 vessels with Smart Shipping solutions. The contract includes the installation and activation of sensors  automatic data collection systems and smart software to manage and optimise the vessels’ energy and environmental performance. It also provides for the regular intervention of GTT Digital experts to carry out customised data analysis and produce dedicated operational reporting.- Elogen reaches new key milestones in its developmentThree key partnerships have been signed to facilitate Elogen’s international development:Exclusive collaborative agreement with HIFraser Group to market and supply electrolysers in Australia and New Zealand for the production of green hydrogen. HIFraser will locally assemble the BOP 2 for Elogen’s electrolysers and adapt them to Australian standards and local customer requirements.Collaboration agreement between Elogen and Valmax Technology Corporation for the supply of electrolysers in South Korea. Valmax will locally assemble the BOP 2 for Elogen’s electrolysers and will work with local certification bodies  such as the Korea Gas Safety Corporation  in order to obtain approval and install the electrolysers.Non-binding letter of intent with Charbone Hydrogen Corporation (Charbone) to enter into a long-term framework supply agreement no later than November 30  2022. Under the terms of the agreement  Elogen will supply Charbone with PEM3 electrolysers for a capacity of up to 100 megawatts over a four-year period (2023-2026) for Charbone’s green hydrogen projects in North America.On July 15  2022  Elogen’s “gigafactory” and R&D reinforcement project was selected by the European Commission to form part of the Hydrogen IPCEI4. As a reminder  the Elogen “gigafactory” will start production in 2025 with a production capacity of 1 GW.Finally  in July  Elogen was selected by Symbio to supply an electrolyser with an initial capacity of 2.5 MW for Symbio’s new fuel cell plant. This new contract represents an important milestone for Elogen  as it highlights the company’s ability to deploy its technologies on multi-megawatt capacities for large industrial projects.Development of new technologies - GTT once again leading the way in number of patents filedIn 2021  for the third year in a row  GTT ranked first in the list of medium-sized companies filing patents published by the INPI. This ranking highlights GTT’s outstanding innovative momentum.In the first half of 2022  GTT received numerous approvals from classification bodies:In March and April 2022  GTT received several approvals in principle in the field of LNG as fuel  including from Bureau Veritas for a new LNG conversion concept for very large container ships  from ClassNK for a new design of LNG fuel tank with 2 bar gauge pressure applicable to PCTC 5 vessels as well as LNG-powered cruise ships  and lastly from DNV for an innovative design for an LNG-powered PCTC vessel.In the second quarter  GTT received further approvals in principle  including from Lloyd’s Register for its future NEXT1 containment system and from Bureau Veritas for Shear-Water  a ballast-free vessel concept for LNG bunkering and refuelling vessels.Finally  late July 2022 GTT obtained approvals in principle from DNV for the containment system of the transport of liquid hydrogen  as well as for the concept of a “hydrogen carrier” vessel. These approvals in principle were obtained in the framework of the partnership with Shell announced early 2022 and reflect the progress of this project.Order book at June 30  2022On January 1  2022  GTT’s order book excluding LNG as fuel comprised 161 units  and subsequently changed as follows:Deliveries completed: 15 LNG carriers  4 ethane carriers  1 FLNGOrders received: 88 LNG carriersAt June 30  2022  the order book excluding LNG as fuel stood at 229 units  breaking down as follows:210 LNG carriers2 ethane carriers2 FSUs3 GBSs12 onshore storage tanksRegarding LNG as fuel  with the deliveries of two ultra-large container ships and orders for 38 container ships  the number of vessels in the order book stood at 68 units at June 30  2022.Change in consolidated revenues for the first half of 2022(in thousands of euros) H1 2021 H1 2022 Change Revenues 165 286 144 223 -12.7% New builds 153 885 130 656 -15.1% LNG carriers/VLEC 132 542 112 704 -15.0% FSUs6 5 851 10 202 +74.4% FSRUs7 6 958 - nm FLNGs8 1 460 1 218 -16.6% Onshore storage tanks 611 3 116 +410.0% GBSs9 1 719 2 292 +33.3% LNG-powered vessels 4 745 1 124 -76.3% Electrolysers 2 466 1 723 -30.1% Services 8 935 11 844 +32.6%Consolidated revenues for H1 2022 amounted to €144.2 million  down 12.7% versus H1 2021.New build revenues totalled €130.7 million  down 15.1% versus H1 2021  when the cycle was still at its peak. Royalties amounted to €112.7 million from LNG and ethane carriers  €10.2 million from FSUs  €1.2 million from FLNGs  €3.1 million from onshore storage tanks and €2.3 million from GBSs. LNG as fuel royalties (€1.1 million) were not yet impacted by the high order intake in 2021 and 2022.First half revenues from Elogen’s electrolyser business amounted to €1.7 million.First half revenues from services rose sharply  up 32.6% to €11.8 million  driven by growth in digital  maintenance and intervention operations on vessels in operation and new project studies.Analysis of first half 2022 consolidated income statementSummary consolidated income statement(in thousands of euros  except earnings per share) H1 2021 H1 2022 Revenues 165 286 144 223 Operating income before depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets (EBITDA10) 96 478 79 706 EBITDA margin (on revenues  %) 58.4% 55.3% Operating income (EBIT11) 92 851 75 937 EBIT margin (on revenue  %) 56.2% 52.7% Net income 76 564 63 692 Net margin (on revenues  %) 46.3% 44.2% Net earnings per share12 (in euros) 2.07 1.73Operating income before depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets (EBITDA) amounted to €79.7 million  down 17.4% versus H1 2021. The EBITDA margin on revenue evolved from 58.4% in H1 2021 to 55.3% in H1 2022. External expenses decreased by 5.9% versus H1 2021  mainly due to a 35.5% decrease in testing and research expenses. Personnel expenses rose 3.8%  mainly due to the increase in headcount in the subsidiaries.First half operating income amounted to €75.9 million  down 18.2% from €92.9 million in H1 2021.Net income decreased from €76.6 million in H1 2021 to €63.7 million in H1 2022  resulting in a reduction in the net margin from 46.3% to 44.2%.Other consolidated financial data(in thousands of euros) H1 2021 H1 2022 Capital expenditure(including acquisitions of non-current assets) (6 115) (8 340) Dividends paid (65 951) (64 553) Cash position 164 209 168 242 Change in cash (vs. 31/12) +22 466 -35 563The - €35.6 million change in cash at June 30  2022 is mainly due to the temporary increase in trade receivables. At June 30  2022  the Group had a positive net cash position of €168.2 million.Update on Russian exposureWork on projects in which the Group is involved in Russia is currently continuing in compliance with the applicable sanction regimes.In Russia  the Group is involved in tank design for 15 ice-breaker LNG carriers currently being built at the Zvezda Shipbuilding Complex (Zvezda)  as well as in the design of 3 GBSs currently under construction by Saren B.V.13 At July 1  2022  €78 million of revenues has yet to be recognised in respect of the ice-breaker LNG carriers by 2025  including €11 million in 2022  while €13 million of revenues has yet to be recognised in respect of the GBSs by 2026  including €3 million in 2022.Given the increasing impact of international sanctions on LNG liquefaction projects in Russia  the continuation and successful execution of these contracts are exposed to risks of postponement or cancellation. In particular  the Group notes that sanctions are affecting Russian imports of certain products and equipment used in current projects  including the Zvezda project. Furthermore  GTT was notified in July by Saren B.V. of its intention to terminate the contract between them. In this context  GTT is investigating solutions to ensure the proper implementation and integrity of its technology  in strict compliance with applicable international sanctions.As a reminder  other orders in progress in Asian shipyards for six ice-breaker LNG carriers and two FSUs14 are specifically intended for Russian Arctic projects. To date  these projects are proceeding according to plan. At July 1  2022  these orders represent for GTT a total of €38 million revenues to be recognised by 2023  including €17 million in 2022.Finally  eight conventional LNG carriers ordered by international ship-owners  under construction in Asian shipyards  are intended for the Arctic LNG2 project  but can operate in all types of conditions.Outlook for 2022In its 2021 annual results press release dated February 17  2022  the Group issued the following targets for 2022  assuming no significant order deferrals or cancellations:consolidated revenues between €290 million and €320 million consolidated EBITDA between €140 million and €170 million a dividend amount for the 2022 financial year at least equivalent to the 2021 dividend.Given the first half delays in some shipbuilding schedules  the Group now expects these figures to reach the lower half of the ranges of revenues and EBITDA announced in February.The crisis has also highlighted the global scale of gas demand  the need for European countries to achieve energy independence in respect of Russia and  more specifically  the strategic importance of maritime transport of LNG  GTT’s core business.In the longer term  the Group should benefit from the current strong order momentum and expects to achieve significantly higher revenues and earnings from 2023 onwards versus 2022.Interim dividendOn July 28  2022  the Board of Directors decided on the distribution of an interim dividend of €1.55 per share for the 2022 financial year  to be paid in cash according to the following schedule:December 13  2022: Ex-dividend date;December 15  2022: Payment date.***First half 2022 results presentationPhilippe Berterottière  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  and Virginie Aubagnac  Chief Financial Officer  will comment on GTT’s first half results and answer questions from the financial community during a webcast held  in English  on Friday  July 29  2022  at 8:30 a.m. (Paris time).This conference will be broadcast live on GTT’s website (www.gtt.fr/finance).To participate in the conference call  please dial one of the following numbers five to ten minutes before the start of the conference:France: + 33 1 70 91 87 04UK: +44 1 212 818 004USA: +1 718 705 87 96Confirmation code: 555877The presentation document will be available on the website on July 29  2022 from 8:30 a.m.Financial agendaQ3 2022 results: October 27  2022 (after close of trading)Payment of an interim dividend of €1.55 per share for the 2022 financial year: December 15  2022About GTTGTT is the technological expert in membrane containment systems dedicated to the transport and storage of liquefied gases.

The electrification trends that we have highlighted during our Capital Markets Day are clearly at play and benefiting us. To reinforce Rexel even further in an environment of economic uncertainty  we started actively implementing our Power Up 2025 strategic plan. By continuously increasing digital sales  focusing on electrification trends and ESG  and concentrating our portfolio on our strengths  as we have done with two acquisitions and two divestments  we will continue to enhance our growth profile and further reinforce our resilience and our agility.”FINANCIAL REVIEW FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30  2022First-half 2022 financial report was authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on July 27  2022. It has been subjected to a limited review by statutory auditors.The following terms: Reported EBITA  Adjusted EBITA  EBITDA  EBITDAaL  Recurring net income  Free Cash Flow and Net Debt are defined in the Glossary section of this document.Unless otherwise stated  all comments are on a constant and adjusted basis and  for sales  at same number of working days.SALESIn Q2  sales were up +26.3% year-on-year on a reported basis and up +12.0% on a constant and same-day basis.In the second-quarter  Rexel posted sales of €4 705.4 million  up +26.3% on a reported basis  including:A positive currency effect of €176.6 million (i.e. +4.7% of Q2 2021 sales)  mainly due to the appreciation of the US and Canadian dollars;A positive net scope effect of €295.5 million (i.e. +7.9% of Q2 2021 sales)  mainly resulting from the acquisition of Mayer in the US;An almost neutral calendar effect of +0.1%.Key figures (€m) Q2 2022 YoY change H1 2022 YoY change Sales on a reported basis 4 705.4 +26.3% 9 082.8 +28.7% On a constant and actual-day basis +12.1% +15.3% On a constant and same-day basis +12.0% +13.9%Sales were up +12.0% a constant and same-day basis (or +12.1% on a constant and actual-day basis)  notably driven by robust volumes in North America and additional selling price increases on non-cable products in all geographies  offsetting the situation in China and a more difficult volume base effect in Europe.The same-day sales growth of +12.0% in the quarter resulted from an +0.6% rise in volumes  an increase of 9.2% in the selling price of non-cable products and 2.2% on cable products. More specifically  The non-cable contribution of 9.2% was similar to the 9.1% posted in Q1 22  thanks to additional price increases in the quarter that offset the expected lower carryover effect of circa 130bps. While the carryover effect will ease in H2 22 to converge towards zero in Q4 22  we anticipate further selling price increases in H2 22. The cable products pricing contribution stood at 2.2% in Q2 22 compared to 4.1% in Q1 22  as the copper price rose sharply in Q2 21  creating a more difficult comparable base. Based on the current copper price  we anticipate the contribution to be lower and potentially negative in H2 22.While volumes were robust in the quarter in North America  growing by +5.1%  volumes in Asia were down (23.0)% due to the lockdown in China in April/May and Europe faced the most difficult base effect as business recovered sharply post-Covid in Q2 21. Without China  group volumes would have grown by +1.7% in Q2 (vs. +0.6% reported).Our teams again showed agility to ensure business continuity in an environment that remains marked by labor and supply chain tensions (notably on products embedding electronics components)We posted further growth in digitalization in all three geographies  with digital sales now representing 25.0% of sales  up +244bps compared to Q2 2021. Trends were positive in Europe (34.9% of sales  an increase of +109 bps)  Asia-Pacific (up +25bps  now representing 4.8% of sales) and North America (16.7% of sales  an increase of +467 bps) with the strong progression in the US fueled by the transformation journey.In addition  during the quarter  we have also:Accelerated the development of our webshop search engine  customer seamless experience (Rexel Easy program) and email to EDI (Esker project started in 7 countries)Scaled up AI solutions deployment to fuel growth and performance with increased scope of sales alerts  new roll outs of assortment optimization in the US  and AI pricing in SwitzerlandIn H1 2022  Rexel posted sales of €9 082.8 million  up +28.7% on a reported basis. On a constant and same-day basis  sales were up +13.9%  including a positive impact of +3.1% from the change in copper-based cable prices (vs. a positive impact of +4.6% in H1 2021) and a positive impact from non-cable copper prices of +9.2%.The +28.7% increase in sales on a reported basis included:A positive currency effect of €280.9 million (i.e. +4.0% of H1 2021 sales)  mainly due to the appreciation of the US and Canadian dollars;A positive net scope effect of €535.4 million (i.e. +7.6% of H1 2021 sales)  mainly resulting from the acquisition of Mayer in the US;A positive calendar effect of +1.4%.Europe (50% of Group sales): +10.4% in Q2 and +11.9% in H1  on a constant and same-day basisIn the second quarter   sales in Europe increased by +10.5% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +0.3%  or €7.5 million  mainly due to the appreciation of the Swiss Franc and the British pound against the euro and a limited scope effect of (0.1)%  or €(3.2) million. On a constant and same-day basis  sales were up +10.4%  including a slightly negative volume contribution (0.5)%Key figures (€m) Q2 2022 YoY change H1 2022 YoY change Europe 2 370.2 +10.4% 4 655.0 +11.9% France 897.0 +7.6% 1 762.5 +9.0% Scandinavia 308.0 +9.3% 586.4 +10.8% Benelux 266.5 +16.1% 524.1 +16.5% Germany 241.2 +15.5% 467.7 +16.2% UK 195.8 +8.7% 419.1 +13.4% Switzerland 147.7 +3.6% 293.0 +4.6% Italy 43.9 +24.4% 81.4 +18.9%Sales in France (38% of the region’s sales) posted solid +7.6% growth on a difficult comparable base  driven by an increased number of active customers and significant price increases. While sales growth is tapering from Q1 22 due to a strong base effect  we recorded further market share gains in the quarter. Q2 22 was supported by strong demand in the industrial segment and  to a lesser extent  in the commercial end-market  offsetting lower growth in the residential market.Sales in Scandinavia (13% of the region’s sales) were up +9.3%  notably driven by commercial activity and strong demand in photovoltaic products.Benelux (11% of the region’s sales) was up +16.1%  outperforming the market  with very strong growth in EV and PV. The PV business growth was notably driven by the increase in energy prices.Sales in Germany (10% of the region’s sales) were up +15.5%  gaining further market share. Demand is accelerating very strongly in photovoltaics (above 200%) as a result of efforts to increase the country's energy independence in the context of the war in Ukraine.In the UK (8% of the region’s sales)  sales were up by +8.7%  lower than in Q1 22 from a more difficult base effect  notably in the commercial business. First-half 2022 benefited until June from a contract with the Department of Education (school air filtration and CO2 equipment) contributing for 200bps in Q2 22.Sales in Switzerland (6% of the region’s sales) were up +3.6%  lower than Q1 22 on slightly lower building installation and cable business.Sales in Italy (2% of the region's sales) were up +24.4% in Q2 22  accelerating compared to Q1 22 and confirming that the recent strategic decisions are paying off.North America (42% of Group sales): +17.2% in Q2 and +19.2% in H1 on a constant and same-day basisIn the second quarter   sales in North America were up +59.8% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +11.7%  or €144.8 million  due to the appreciation of the US and Canadian dollars against the euro and a positive scope effect of €301.5 million  or +24.3%  from the acquisition of Mayer in the US.

The three end-markets grew at a similar pace compared to Q2 21. When compared to their pre-crisis level and looking at the different markets  growth potential is higher in the industrial market and  to a lesser extent  commercial We benefited from strong overall momentum in the Mountain Plains and Gulf Central regions  notably driven by Oil & Gas  as well as robust growth in commercial The Mayer integration is going well and performance is progressing above expectations  up +8.3%  on a more difficult base effect as Mayer recovered earlier from Covid in 2021. We are on track to achieve our upgraded synergy ambitions The backlog remains very important  up +81% year-on-year at end June yoy  representing c. 3 months of salesIn Canada (19% of the region’s sales)  sales grew by +14.0% on a same-day basis  notably thanks to robust performance driven by industrial end-markets (O&G and mining specifically)  offsetting stable demand in residential. Backlog is also very strong  representing circa 4 months of sales.Asia-Pacific (8% of Group sales): (2.6)% in Q2 and +1.2% in H1 on a constant and same-day basisIn the second-quarter   sales in Asia-Pacific were up +3.3% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +7.2%  or €24.3 million  due to the appreciation of all currencies against the euro and more specifically the Australian dollar and the Chinese renminbi.

It includes c. 90bps of non-recurring impact from inventory price inflation on non-cable products  net of higher performance-linked bonuses.North America:Gross margin was up +178 bps vs. H1 2021 at 25.6% of sales  illustrating the benefits of Mayer's integration and our capacity to pass through prices increases as well as a positive channel mix (proximity vs project) in the US. Adjusted EBITA margin was up +297 bps at 8.5% of sales  benefiting from Mayer synergies (contributing for c. 65bps)  the strong momentum in sales growth and a favorable calendar effect in H1 22 (19 bps)  which will be reversed in H2 22.

Strengthening our platform is a key priority  especially important in the current environment. The five topics of this pillar are: talent culture  supplier relationships  supply chain & footprint  digital and productivity. Applied to the current environment  we are specifically focusing on resilience plans  with all countries putting increased emphasis since Q1 on headcount control  inventory quality control  credit control or mix optimizationWith the second pillar of the strategy (""Strive to be a differentiated leader"")  we will focus on five areas where we believe Rexel can have a strong competitive advantage in the short- and medium-term: data & AI  advanced services  Energy solutions transition  ESG and M&A. By doing so we will position ourselves to benefit from accelerating and more resilient macro electrification trends.ACTIVE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENTRexel announced 4 transactions to reinforce its portfolio and its local footprint in key regions. They include :Two acquisitions of quality businesses in Belgium and US  highly complementary with our existing footprint  as illustrated by the high level of expected synergiesThe disposal of Rexel's activities in two non-core countries  Spain and Portugal.The combined operations will contribute positively to our sales  earnings and Return On Capital Employed in year 1. More specifically  they will add c. €75m in sales (FY 2021) on a net basis and be accretive in adjusted Ebita margin.Acquisition of Trilec in BelgiumOn July 4th  Rexel Belgium closed the acquisition of Trilec  a Belgian family-owned electrical distributor operating mostly in Flanders  with 15 branches  172 employees and a semi-automated distribution center.Trilec is a high-quality asset with a number 3 position in Belgium  and €80m of sales generated in 2021. Its commercial footprint and supply chain organization are very complementary to our existing base  as reflected by the high level of targeted synergies.Acquisition of Horizon Solutions in the USOn July 7th  Rexel USA signed a definitive agreement to acquire Horizon Solutions headquartered in Rochester  New York with 10 branches and 219 employees. The Industrial automation business specialist generated sales of USD 170m in 2021.With the acquisition  Rexel USA will benefit from a strong management team with deep industry expertise and a sound culture and strengthen its presence as an Industrial automation distributor in the Northeast Region.The transaction is projected to be accretive to Rexel’s Earnings Per Share in year 1 and value-creating in year 2  fully in line with the Group’s commitment  notably thanks to targeted synergies.The transaction is expected to close in Q3 22.Disposal of Rexel in Spain & PortugalRexel has entered into a binding agreement with Sonepar for the sale of Rexel Spain and Rexel Portugal.

Cables accounted for approximately 17% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

The review process started in the fourth quarter of 2021 in light of the Put Option’s expiry date on 31 July 2022.Considering the independent expert report prepared by Moore Corporate Finance  which values the 2% shareholding in NN2 in a range of EUR 0 million to EUR 3.4 million  the opinion of the independent directors of the Company  questions and comments raised by certain minority shareholders and other information made available to it  the Company believes it is in its corporate benefit to exercise the Put Option. Further  the exercise of the Put Option limits the Company’s liquidity risks for the foreseeable future and avoids insolvency that would  on the basis of current projections  have arisen in the second quarter of 2023. A full summary of the background  the process followed and the summary of the analysis is made below. The Company informs that it will exercise the Put Option before the expiry on 31 July 2022.BackgroundIn October 2018  the former Nyrstar group initiated a review of its capital structure (the ""Capital Structure Review"") in response to the challenging financial and operating conditions being faced by the Nyrstar group. The Capital Structure Review identified a very substantial additional funding requirement that the Nyrstar group was unable to meet without a material reduction of the Nyrstar group's indebtedness. Consequently  the Capital Structure Review necessitated negotiations between the Nyrstar group's financial creditors that ultimately resulted in the restructuring of the Nyrstar group  which became effective on 31 July 2019 (the “Restructuring”). As a result of the Restructuring  Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd.  via its indirect 98% ownership of the new holding company NN2  became the ultimate parent company of the former (direct and indirect) subsidiaries of the Company (the ""Operating Group”)  with the remaining 2% stake in NN2 (and thereby the Operating Group) being owned by the Company.Story continuesThe lock-up agreement (“Lock-Up Agreement”) entered into on 14 April 2019 between  among others  the Company and representatives of its key financial creditor groups  envisaged that the Company  Trafigura Pte Ltd (“Trafigura”) and Nyrstar Holdings Limited (""Nyrstar Holdings""  a Trafigura special-purpose vehicle incorporated  amongst other things  for the purpose of implementing the Restructuring  now known as Nyrstar Holdings Plc) would enter into a deed confirming their agreement in respect of (i) certain steps necessary for the implementation of the restructuring as envisaged in the Lock-Up Agreement and (ii) the terms of the ongoing relationship between the Company and the Trafigura group (the ""NNV-Trafigura Deed""). The NNV-Trafigura Deed was duly executed on 19 June 2019.Pursuant to the NNV-Trafigura Deed  the Company and Trafigura also agreed that Trafigura granted an option to the Company to require Nyrstar Holdings(or another Trafigura entity) to purchase the Company's entire interest in NN2. The terms of this option are set out in a separate deed  dated 25 June 2019  between the Company  Trafigura and Nyrstar Holdings (the ""Put Option Deed""). Under the terms of the Put Option Deed  the Company can put all (but not only a part) of its 2% holding in NN2 to Trafigura at a price equal to EUR 20 million (subject to any applicable mandatory regulatory conditions to the sale being satisfied). The Put Option served to give liquidity to the Company for  and enhance and crystallise the value of  an otherwise illiquid 2% minority holding in NN2  a non-listed company  in the corporate benefit of the Company. The Put Option can be exercised by the Company until 31 July 2022.Report by Independent DirectorsAs a result of Urion Holdings (Malta) Ltd  a subsidiary of Trafigura B.V.  holding 24 42% in the Company and also indirectly controlling Nyrstar Holdings  Nyrstar Holdings constitutes a related party of the Company in the meaning of IAS 24 such that article 7:97 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations (the “BCCA”) applies to the decision whether or not to exercise the Put Option.On 18 November 2021  the Company announced that it had appointed Moore Corporate Finance  to prepare an independent expert’s opinion (the “Expert Report”) for the independent directors of the Company (“Committee of Independent Directors”)  in the framework of article 7:97 BCCA. The independent expert’s opinion was to advise the Committee of Independent Directors in examining the benefit to the Company  taking all relevant circumstances into account  of the exercise or non-exercise of the Put Option that the Company has in relation to its (entire) 2% investment in NN2. In making its decision on whether or not to exercise the Put Option  the Committee of Independent Directors was to also duly consider any substantiated third-party bids  including of the Company’s shareholders other than Trafigura and/or of other stakeholders and third parties  that it may receive in respect of the 2% shareholding in NN2. Any such bids for the 2% shareholding in NN2 were requested to be addressed to the Company prior to 15 February 2022. As advised by the Company in the annual report and financial statements issued on 13 April 2022  via a press release on 27 May 2022 and at the annual general shareholders meeting on 28 June 2022  the Company has not received any bids.Moore Corporate Finance was asked to advise on the following:The current valuation of the Operating Group and the equity value to be assessed for the Company’s 2% equity interest in NN2. The financial consequences of (not) exercising the Put Option for the Company and possible other consequences related to such decision. Benefits and disadvantages for the Company if the Board resolves to exercise the Put Option  including considering the alternative investments that the Board could consider pursuing with the proceeds of the Put Option. In doing so  the expert was instructed to consider the financial viability of the Company over at least the next 24 months  after date of issuance of the Expert Report if it decides to not exercise the Put Option. The potential outcomes under the alternative options to the exercise of the Put Option  including the ability of the Company to sell the 2% stake in NN2 to a third party and the likely sales proceeds that the Company may be able to generate from such a sale.In preparing the Expert Report  Moore Corporate Finance has reviewed the information made available by Nyrstar and by the Operating Group to conduct the valuation of the Operating Group and was given the opportunity to request additional information and engage in a question-and-answer process with both Nyrstar and the Operating Group. In addition  Moore Corporate Finance has  among other things  reviewed certain publicly available business and historic financial information relating to the Company and the Operating Group as well as other market data to test the robustness and reasonableness of the information and projections provided by the Company and the Operating Group management. Moore Corporate Finance has confirmed that it found no indication to doubt the reliability of the information provided. The information was requested pursuant to the information rights granted to the Company by Trafigura in the framework of the Restructuring and stored in an electronic data room. The Committee of Independent Directors requested the Company’s management to facilitate this process and monitored that BDO  the Company’s statutory auditor  was duly informed early in the process and was given the opportunity to raise questions  including with Moore Corporate Finance.As part of the review process  the Company’s management assessed the amounts that would be repayable under the Company’s EUR 13.5 million Limited Recourse Loan Facility (“LRLF”) with NN2 if the decision of the Board were to exercise the Put Option. This assessment of the repayment obligations of the LRLF was shared with Moore Corporate Finance. It is noted that there are limited recourse provisions in the LRLF which limit the Company’s obligations to make any repayments under the LRLF and NN2’s recourse to the Company  to the extent of the Company ’s net assets (as defined in the LRLF). . It has been concluded by the Company’s analysis of the LRLF that there will be no immediate repayment obligation of the EUR 9.8 million that is currently outstanding under the LRLF  nor for the foreseeable future given the current and forecast value of the Company’s net assets (as defined in the LRLF). The Company will continue to monitor the development of its net asset position to consider whether any repayment of the LRLF would be needed.Certain minority shareholders have raised questions and comments in the framework of the Put Option for Moore Corporate Finance at the occasion of the Company’s annual shareholders meeting on 28 June 2022 (see minutes on the Company’s website). The Committee of Independent Directors has considered these questions and also ensured that these questions and comments were passed to Moore Corporate Finance and/or considered by the Company’s management in the memoranda prepared by management for the Committee of Independent Directors.The Expert Report concluded that the benefits for the Company of exercising the Put Option is a degree of financial security considering that its valuation shows that the strike price of the Put Option (EUR 20 million) by far exceeds its valuation of the 2% holding in NN2 (which lies in a range of EUR 0 million to EUR 3.4 million as at 31 May 2022). This in turn limits the Company’s liquidity risks for the foreseeable future and avoids insolvency that would risk  on the basis of current projections  to arise in the second quarter of 2023. Further  based on the valuation  the exercise of the Put Option for EUR 20 million is significantly higher than the amount a third party would be likely willing to pay. The disadvantages are that the Company’s major asset will be realised and thus its activity will now consist in managing the proceeds of the Put Option and the management of the ongoing legal and other regulatory proceedings. The Expert Report lists a number of investments for the Company that are suited in such circumstances  which the Board of Directors is considering.Decision to exercise the Put OptionThe Committee of Independent Directors has considered the Expert Report  as well as the information provided by the Company’s management when evaluating the decision whether or not to exercise the Put Option as well as the comments raised by certain minority shareholders at the occasion of the latest annual shareholders meeting. On this basis  the Committee of Independent Directors has advised the Company’s board of directors on the exercise or non-exercise of the Put Option in accordance with article 7:97 of the BCCA.The key conclusions from the detailed review conducted by the Committee of Independent Directors in accordance with article 7:97 of the BCCA which were material for the decision by the Company to exercise the Put Option are summarised as follows:The valuation performed by Moore Corporate Finance shows that the fair market valuation of the Company’s 2% equity interest is in the range of EUR 0 million to EUR 3.4 million as at 31 May 2022. This valuation is substantially below the EUR 20 million exercise price of the Put Option. The amount of EUR 20 million that the Company would receive upon exercising the Put Option would thus result in a clear financial advantage to the Company compared to not exercising it. The Put Option expires on 31 July 2022. The exercise of the Put Option would result in the cancellation of NN2’s commitments under the LRLF and the requirement for repayment of certain amounts outstanding thereunder (subject to the limited recourse provisions). The net effect of any obligation to repay amounts under the LRLF would be to reduce the portion of the EUR 20 million proceeds received from the exercise of the Put Option available for use by the Company. However  the limited recourse provisions of the LRLF result in the Company not being required to pay amounts under the LRLF to the extent it would not have sufficient Company net assets (as defined in the LRLF). This allows deduction of the Company’s non-LRLF liabilities (including its contingent liabilities)  which are broadly defined. (The Company net assets are defined in the LRLF and such definition is unrelated to IFRS or Belgian GAAP rules and reporting).As long as the Company net asset position  calculated on the basis of the provisions of the LRLF  remains negative  the EUR 20 million that the Company will receive upon exercising the Put Option (and the sale completing subject to any applicable mandatory regulatory conditions being satisfied) will therefore not be required to be used towards repayment of the LRLF. However  exercising the Put Option would terminate the provision of certain ongoing operational and administrative services under the LRLF (the “Ongoing Services”). The effect of the latter would be minimal as the Ongoing Services period also automatically expires on 31 July 2022.As a result of the limited recourse provisions in the LRLF  the exercise of the Put Option provides the Company with sufficient headroom to cover its expected near-term costs and consider appropriate use for the net proceeds In this context  however  and as noted above  the Company will continue to monitor the development of its Company Net Asset position to consider whether any repayment of the LRLF needs to be made in accordance with its terms. The consequence of exercising the Put Option (and the sale completing subject to any applicable mandatory regulatory conditions being satisfied) will result in the Company forfeiting the opportunity to receive future dividends from NN2  if any  and will result in the Company no longer having the option to dispose of the Company’s 2% equity interest in NN2 to a third party or Trafigura at a potentially higher price than the Put Option exercise price of EUR 20 million. The Company has assessed the probability of not exercising the Put Option and instead waiting until a future moment in time when the value of the Company’s 2% equity interest would exceed EUR 20 million or a third party or Trafigura would offer more. The Company considers  based on the Expert Report and lack of interest shown  including by sector players  that this seems a very unlikely hypothesis as the Company has already approached the market to learn whether there would be a possibility of any substantiated third-party bids and did not receive any bids since the announcement in its press release on 18 November 2021. Importantly  the proposition not to exercise the Put Option before it is set to expire on 31 July 2022 would likely place the Company in insolvency during H1 2023 as the Company’s liquidity forecasts  in the absence of the EUR 20 million of Put Option proceeds  show the Company becoming illiquid in Q2 2023.The opinion of the Committee of Independent Directors is therefore as follows:On the basis of the considerations set out above  including the Expert Report  the information provided [by management] in Annex 2 as well as the comments made by minority shareholders  the Committee is of the opinion that the decision to exercise the Put Option is not such as to imply a disadvantage to the Company that  in light of its current policies  would be manifestly illegitimate.Furthermore  the Committee is of the opinion that it is unlikely that the decision to exercise the Put Option would lead to disadvantages for the Company which will not be outweighed by the benefits for the Company of such decision.The Company’s statutory auditor  BDO  has reviewed the Expert Report  the report by the Committee and the minutes of the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with article 7:97 BCCA and its assessment is as follows.Based on our review  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial and accounting data reported in the advice of the committee of independent directors dated 27 July 2022 and in the minutes of the administrative body dated 27 July 2022  which justify the proposed transaction  are not consistent  in all material respects  compared to the information we have in the context of our assignment as statutory auditor of Nyrstar NV.Our assignment is solely executed for the purposes described in article 7:97 of the Code of Companies and Associations and therefore our report is not to be used for any other purpose.The Expert Report  the report by the Committee and BDO’s report are all available on the Company’s website: https://www.nyrstar.be/en/investors/results-reports-and-presentations/2022About Nyrstar NVThe Company is incorporated in Belgium and  following completion of the recapitalisation/restructuring has a 2% shareholding in the Nyrstar group.

The review process started in the fourth quarter of 2021 in light of the Put Option’s expiry date on 31 July 2022.Considering the independent expert report prepared by Moore Corporate Finance  which values the 2% shareholding in NN2 in a range of EUR 0 million to EUR 3.4 million  the opinion of the independent directors of the Company  questions and comments raised by certain minority shareholders and other information made available to it  the Company believes it is in its corporate benefit to exercise the Put Option. Further  the exercise of the Put Option limits the Company’s liquidity risks for the foreseeable future and avoids insolvency that would  on the basis of current projections  have arisen in the second quarter of 2023. A full summary of the background  the process followed and the summary of the analysis is made below. The Company informs that it will exercise the Put Option before the expiry on 31 July 2022.BackgroundIn October 2018  the former Nyrstar group initiated a review of its capital structure (the ""Capital Structure Review"") in response to the challenging financial and operating conditions being faced by the Nyrstar group. The Capital Structure Review identified a very substantial additional funding requirement that the Nyrstar group was unable to meet without a material reduction of the Nyrstar group's indebtedness. Consequently  the Capital Structure Review necessitated negotiations between the Nyrstar group's financial creditors that ultimately resulted in the restructuring of the Nyrstar group  which became effective on 31 July 2019 (the “Restructuring”). As a result of the Restructuring  Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd.  via its indirect 98% ownership of the new holding company NN2  became the ultimate parent company of the former (direct and indirect) subsidiaries of the Company (the ""Operating Group”)  with the remaining 2% stake in NN2 (and thereby the Operating Group) being owned by the Company.The lock-up agreement (“Lock-Up Agreement”) entered into on 14 April 2019 between  among others  the Company and representatives of its key financial creditor groups  envisaged that the Company  Trafigura Pte Ltd (“Trafigura”) and Nyrstar Holdings Limited (""Nyrstar Holdings""  a Trafigura special-purpose vehicle incorporated  amongst other things  for the purpose of implementing the Restructuring  now known as Nyrstar Holdings Plc) would enter into a deed confirming their agreement in respect of (i) certain steps necessary for the implementation of the restructuring as envisaged in the Lock-Up Agreement and (ii) the terms of the ongoing relationship between the Company and the Trafigura group (the ""NNV-Trafigura Deed""). The NNV-Trafigura Deed was duly executed on 19 June 2019.Pursuant to the NNV-Trafigura Deed  the Company and Trafigura also agreed that Trafigura granted an option to the Company to require Nyrstar Holdings(or another Trafigura entity) to purchase the Company's entire interest in NN2. The terms of this option are set out in a separate deed  dated 25 June 2019  between the Company  Trafigura and Nyrstar Holdings (the ""Put Option Deed""). Under theterms of the Put Option Deed  the Company can put all (but not only a part) of its 2% holding in NN2 to Trafigura at a price equal to EUR 20 million (subject to any applicable mandatory regulatory conditions to the sale being satisfied). The Put Option served to give liquidity to the Company for  and enhance and crystallise the value of  an otherwise illiquid 2% minority holding in NN2  a non-listed company  in the corporate benefit of the Company. The Put Option can be exercised by the Company until 31 July 2022.Report by Independent DirectorsAs a result of Urion Holdings (Malta) Ltd  a subsidiary of Trafigura B.V.  holding 24 42% in the Company and also indirectly controlling Nyrstar Holdings  Nyrstar Holdings constitutes a related party of the Company in the meaning of IAS 24 such that article 7:97 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations (the “BCCA”) applies to the decision whether or not to exercise the Put Option.On 18 November 2021  the Company announced that it had appointed Moore Corporate Finance  to prepare an independent expert’s opinion (the “Expert Report”) for the independent directors of the Company (“Committee of Independent Directors”)  in the framework of article 7:97 BCCA. The independent expert’s opinion was to advise the Committee of Independent Directors in examining the benefit to the Company  taking all relevant circumstances into account  of the exercise or non-exercise of the Put Option that the Company has in relation to its (entire) 2% investment in NN2. In making its decision on whether or not to exercise the Put Option  the Committee of Independent Directors was to also duly consider any substantiated third-party bids  including of the Company’s shareholders other than Trafigura and/or of other stakeholders and third parties  that it may receive in respect of the 2% shareholding in NN2. Any such bids for the 2% shareholding in NN2 were requested to be addressed to the Company prior to 15 February 2022. As advised by the Company in the annual report and financial statements issued on 13 April 2022  via a press release on 27 May 2022 and at the annual general shareholders meeting on 28 June 2022  the Company has not received any bids.Moore Corporate Finance was asked to advise on the following:i. The current valuation of the Operating Group and the equity value to be assessed for the Company’s 2% equity interest in NN2.ii. The financial consequences of (not) exercising the Put Option for the Company and possible other consequences related to such decision.iii. Benefits and disadvantages for the Company if the Board resolves to exercise the Put Option  including considering the alternative investments that the Board could consider pursuing with the proceeds of the Put Option. In doing so  the expert was instructed to consider the financial viability of the Company over at least the next 24 months  after date of issuance of the Expert Report if it decides to not exercise the Put Option.iv. The potential outcomes under the alternative options to the exercise of the Put Option  including the ability of the Company to sell the 2% stake in NN2 to a third party and the likely sales proceeds that the Company may be able to generate from such a sale.In preparing the Expert Report  Moore Corporate Finance has reviewed the information made available by Nyrstar and by the Operating Group to conduct the valuation of the Operating Group and was given the opportunity to request additional information and engage in a question-and-answer process with both Nyrstar and the Operating Group. In addition  Moore Corporate Finance has  among other things  reviewed certain publicly available business and historic financial information relating to the Company and the Operating Group as well as other market data to test the robustness and reasonableness of the information and projections provided by the Company and the Operating Group management. Moore Corporate Finance has confirmed that it found no indication to doubt the reliability of the information provided. The information was requested pursuant to the information rights granted tothe Company by Trafigura in the framework of the Restructuring and stored in an electronic data room. The Committee of Independent Directors requested the Company’s management to facilitate this process and monitored that BDO  the Company’s statutory auditor  was duly informed early in the process and was given the opportunity to raise questions  including with Moore Corporate Finance.As part of the review process  the Company’s management assessed the amounts that would be repayable under the Company’s EUR 13.5 million Limited Recourse Loan Facility (“LRLF”) with NN2 if the decision of the Board were to exercise the Put Option. This assessment of the repayment obligations of the LRLF was shared with Moore Corporate Finance. It is noted that there are limited recourse provisions in the LRLF which limit the Company’s obligations to make any repayments under the LRLF and NN2’s recourse to the Company  to the extent of the Company ’s net assets (as defined in the LRLF). . It has been concluded by the Company’s analysis of the LRLF that there will be no immediate repayment obligation of the EUR 9.8 million that is currently outstanding under the LRLF  nor for the foreseeable future given the current and forecast value of the Company’s net assets (as defined in the LRLF). The Company will continue to monitor the development of its net asset position to consider whether any repayment of the LRLF would be needed.Certain minority shareholders have raised questions and comments in the framework of the Put Option for Moore Corporate Finance at the occasion of the Company’s annual shareholders meeting on 28 June 2022 (see minutes on the Company’s website). The Committee of Independent Directors has considered these questions and also ensured that these questions and comments were passed to Moore Corporate Finance and/or considered by the Company’s management in the memoranda prepared by management for the Committee of Independent Directors.The Expert Report concluded that the benefits for the Company of exercising the Put Option is a degree of financial security considering that its valuation shows that the strike price of the Put Option (EUR 20 million) by far exceeds its valuation of the 2% holding in NN2 (which lies in a range of EUR 0 million to EUR 3.4 million as at 31 May 2022). This in turn limits the Company’s liquidity risks for the foreseeable future and avoids insolvency that would risk  on the basis of current projections  to arise in the second quarter of 2023. Further  based on the valuation  the exercise of the Put Option for EUR 20 million is significantly higher than the amount a third party would be likely willing to pay. The disadvantages are that the Company’s major asset will be realised and thus its activity will now consist in managing the proceeds of the Put Option and the management of the ongoing legal and other regulatory proceedings. The Expert Report lists a number of investments for the Company that are suited in such circumstances  which the Board of Directors is considering.Decision to exercise the Put OptionThe Committee of Independent Directors has considered the Expert Report  as well as the information provided by the Company’s management when evaluating the decision whether or not to exercise the Put Option as well as the comments raised by certain minority shareholders at the occasion of the latest annual shareholders meeting. On this basis  the Committee of Independent Directors has advised the Company’s board of directors on the exercise or non-exercise of the Put Option in accordance with article 7:97 of the BCCA.The key conclusions from the detailed review conducted by the Committee of Independent Directors in accordance with article 7:97 of the BCCA which were material for the decision by the Company to exercise the Put Option are summarised as follows:I. The valuation performed by Moore Corporate Finance shows that the fair market valuation of the Company’s 2% equity interest is in the range of EUR 0 million to EUR 3.4 million as at 31 May 2022. This valuation is substantially below the EUR 20 million exercise price of the PutOption. The amount of EUR 20 million that the Company would receive upon exercising the Put Option would thus result in a clear financial advantage to the Company compared to not exercising it. The Put Option expires on 31 July 2022. II. The exercise of the Put Option would result in the cancellation of NN2’s commitments under the LRLF and the requirement for repayment of certain amounts outstanding thereunder (subject to the limited recourse provisions). The net effect of any obligation to repay amounts under the LRLF would be to reduce the portion of the EUR 20 million proceeds received from the exercise of the Put Option available for use by the Company. However  the limited recourse provisions of the LRLF result in the Company not being required to pay amounts under the LRLF to the extent it would not have sufficient Company net assets (as defined in the LRLF). This allows deduction of the Company’s non-LRLF liabilities (including its contingent liabilities)  which are broadly defined. (The Company net assets are defined in the LRLF and such definition is unrelated to IFRS or Belgian GAAP rules and reporting).As long as the Company net asset position  calculated on the basis of the provisions of the LRLF  remains negative  the EUR 20 million that the Company will receive upon exercising the Put Option (and the sale completing subject to any applicable mandatory regulatory conditions being satisfied) will therefore not be required to be used towards repayment of the LRLF. However  exercising the Put Option would terminate the provision of certain ongoing operational and administrative services under the LRLF (the “Ongoing Services”). The effect of the latter would be minimal as the Ongoing Services period also automatically expires on 31 July 2022.III. As a result of the limited recourse provisions in the LRLF  the exercise of the Put Option provides the Company with sufficient headroom to cover its expected near-term costs and consider appropriate use for the net proceeds In this context  however  and as noted above  the Company will continue to monitor the development of its Company Net Asset position to consider whether any repayment of the LRLF needs to be made in accordance with its terms.IV. The consequence of exercising the Put Option (and the sale completing subject to any applicable mandatory regulatory conditions being satisfied) will result in the Company forfeiting the opportunity to receive future dividends from NN2  if any  and will result in the Company no longer having the option to dispose of the Company’s 2% equity interest in NN2 to a third party or Trafigura at a potentially higher price than the Put Option exercise price of EUR 20 million. The Company has assessed the probability of not exercising the Put Option and instead waiting until a future moment in time when the value of the Company’s 2% equity interest would exceed EUR 20 million or a third party or Trafigura would offer more. The Company considers  based on the Expert Report and lack of interest shown  including by sector players  that this seems a very unlikely hypothesis as the Company has already approached the market to learn whether there would be a possibility of any substantiated third-party bids and did not receive any bids since the announcement in its press release on 18 November 2021.V. Importantly  the proposition not to exercise the Put Option before it is set to expire on 31 July 2022 would likely place the Company in insolvency during H1 2023 as the Company’s liquidity forecasts  in the absence of the EUR 20 million of Put Option proceeds  show the Company becoming illiquid in Q2 2023.The opinion of the Committee of Independent Directors is therefore as follows:On the basis of the considerations set out above  including the Expert Report  the information provided [by management] in Annex 2 as well as the comments made by minority shareholders  the Committee is of the opinion that the decision to exercise the Put Option is not such as to imply a disadvantage to the Company that  in light of its current policies  would be manifestly illegitimate.Furthermore  the Committee is of the opinion that it is unlikely that the decision to exercise the Put Option would lead to disadvantages for the Company which will not be outweighed by the benefits for the Company of such decision.The Company’s statutory auditor  BDO  has reviewed the Expert Report  the report by the Committee and the minutes of the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with article 7:97 BCCA and its assessment is as follows.Based on our review  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial and accounting data reported in the advice of the committee of independent directors dated 27 July 2022 and in the minutes of the administrative body dated 27 July 2022  which justify the proposed transaction  are not consistent  in all material respects  compared to the information we have in the context of our assignment as statutory auditor of Nyrstar NV.Our assignment is solely executed for the purposes described in article 7:97 of the Code of Companies and Associations and therefore our report is not to be used for any other purpose.The Expert Report  the report by the Committee and BDO’s report are all available on the Company’s website: https://www.nyrstar.be/en/investors/results-reports-and-presentations/2022About Nyrstar NVThe Company is incorporated in Belgium and  following completion of the recapitalisation/restructuring has a 2% shareholding in the Nyrstar group.

At the same time  McPhy is pursuing its strategy to develop its pressurized alkaline electrolysis technology with an investment in capacity at its San Miniato plant  complemented by the recruitment of engineering and R&D teams in Wildau. These investments mark the Group's change of scale and increase its production capacity to meet the demand of the European market. Finally  also in the electrolyzers area  the validation of the Gigafactory project by the European Commission within the framework of the PIIEC scheme confirms the potential of low-carbon hydrogen  and is a key step in the Group's decision-making process.Story continuesOn the operational side  McPhy has started to benefit this semester from the implementation of the large-scale hydrogen projects in which it is engaged. Intrinsic performance was affected by the take back of two stations already ordered due to non-standard technical and commercial requirements for both the two customers concerned and for McPhy.This adjustment neutralizes the dynamism observed in the good progress of the last few months in the first half of the year.”Dynamic commercial activity with increased order intake2022 First-Half Revenue is stable compared to 2021 at €5.2 million . This is mainly due to the repurchase of two old generation stations sold in previous years to German customers  whose related amount has been subtracted from 2022 First-Half Revenue. The buyback of this equipment was deducted from 2022 First-Half Revenue. Adjusted for this effect  revenue would be €7.4 million compared with €5.2 million in the first half of 2021  representing growth of 42%. This solid performance is the result of the completion of the first orders on the major projects in which McPhy is involved  while the market continues to show a wait-and-see attitude regarding the release of public funding.The supply of electrolyzers  either large capacity (McLyzer) or from the Piel range  and McFilling hydrogen stations contribute to this half-year performance and demonstrate their perfect complementarity in generating growth.The Group’s recently won tenders on large-scale projects are beginning to generate substantial revenues  which are expected to increase significantly with new orders received under the framework of these projects: R-Hynoca 2   regarding the implementation of the first hydrogen station in Strasbourg; CEOG 3   regarding the construction of the West Guyana Power Plant. It will combine photovoltaic energy and massive electricity storage  mainly in the form of hydrogen;McPhy also signed a contract at the beginning of the year with a subsidiary of Eiffage to equip a site in Belfort 4 with a 1 MW electrolyzer and a refueling station able to distribute up to 800 kg per day in order to fuel a fleet of hydrogen buses.Finally  McPhy received two first orders under the framework of its strategic partnership with Hype5  consisting in supplying: (i) two 2 MW alkaline electrolyzers whose capacity can be increased to 4MW  and (ii) two Dual Pressure stations with a capacity of 800 kg per day respectively  to be installed in the Paris region.The commercial dynamism during the first half of the year is reflected in firm orders totaling €16.1 million  bringing the backlog to €29.1 million at 30 June 2022  an increase of 44% compared to 31 December 2021.Recurring operating result reflecting growth investments and prudent project managementDuring the first half of the year  in order to support the expected growth of its business  the Group continued its development strategy. This resulted in an increase in current expenses due to: the development of its industrial capacities with the opening of the new station production site in Grenoble; innovation and R&D expenses in relation to the future introduction of its new range of electrolyzers and stations; the structuring of the teams and the active recruitment policy.In this environment  personnel costs increased by €2.2 million year-on-year to €7.9 million in the first half of 2022  reflecting the net recruitment of 32 new employees during the period. Other expenses amounted to €4.4 million in the first half of 2021 and €9.6 million in the first half of 2022  of which €6 million were incurred to strengthen the Group's industrial and R&D teams (industrial subcontracting  recruitment costs and technical expertise).To cover a possible additional cost related to the technical warranty of its installed base of new generation electrolyzers  the Group has also made a provision of around €3 million in non-recurring expenses.The recurring operating loss thus reached - €19.4 million in the first half of 2022  compared with - €8.3 million in the first half of 2021.Net loss for the first half of 2022 was €19.7 million  compared with €8.6 million for the same period in 2021.Strong cash position thanks to controlled cash consumptionAs of 30 June 2022  McPhy had a cash position of €141.8 million compared to €177.2 million at 31 December 2021. Cash consumption amounted to slightly more than €35 million during the first half of the year  including €12 million for the financial investment in the Hype Convertible Bonds subscribed under the framework of the strategic partnership with this company6. The balance of €23 million is the result of the cash consumption required by the Group to finance its industrial and R&D investment policy.2022 First-Half highlights: accelerating industrial scale-up and strengthening partnershipsMcPhy finalized the consolidation of all the activities dedicated to refueling stations on its new site in the heart of Grenoble on an existing industrial building of more than 4 000 m 2 . The new site will have a production capacity seven times higher than today’s  increasing from 20 to 150 units per year  and will lead to the creation of around one hundred direct jobs at full load. This new facility completes the Group’s network of stations and strengthens its presence in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes   one of the most dynamic regions in Europe for the development of green hydrogen solutions. It perfectly illustrates McPhy’s ambition to become a major player in the hydrogen mobility segment.At the same time  McPhy maintained its efforts to scale up the electrolyzer part of its business with a major investment bringing the production capacity to 300 MW on the San Miniato site   in order to meet the market traction while waiting for the potential commissioning of the Gigafactory. To begin with  its facilities will be based on the Wildau site for the design and engineering of very high capacity electrolysis systems (multi-MW / GW)  and on the San Miniato site for the design  production and assembly of stacks . The construction of the Gigafactory   with the addition of 1 GW  would bring the production capacity to 1.3 GW and McPhy would thus have a pan-European industrial facility unmatched by any other electrolyzer manufacturer.McPhy pursued the strengthening of its partnership ecosystem with key players such as Chart Industries  Technip Energies and TSG  which complement and confirm the quality of McPhy’s offer while providing important commercial leverage. McPhy thus participated in various tenders through joint bids  notably with Technip Energies.Continued active recruitment policy and implementation of a structured ISR policyThe Group strengthened its governance with the appointments of Laëtitia Peyrat as General Counsel and Secretary to the Board  and Benoît Barrière as Chief Technology Officer 7 .McPhy hired 32 net new employees in the first half of 2022 in a context of intensified talent hunting. At the same time  the Group developed internal mobility in order to retain its managers  while pursuing an active policy to attract young graduates to the hydrogen sector through the promotion of internships which  in most cases  lead to hiring.In terms of ISR  the Group is pursuing the implementation of a structured policy to get closer to the best standards with the aim of achieving a demanding certification by 2025.Post-closing event: validation by the European Commission of the McPhy Gigafactory project under the Hydrogen IPCEI program8The European Commission validated the electrolyzer Gigafactory project among the projects submitted by France under the framework of the Hydrogen IPCEI . This decision demonstrates the interest of the project for the hydrogen sector in France and in Europe.The final investment decision will be taken by McPhy soon  after final confirmation by the French authorities of the amount of public aid and the contractualization of the terms of the provision of this aid with Bpifrance.OutlookBased on 2022 First-Half Results  McPhy observes that the low-carbon hydrogen market is still gradually gaining momentum and anticipates a more moderate growth of its revenue for the year 2022 than initially anticipated.During the second half of the year  the Group will continue its industrial investments  notably by communicating its final decision on the construction of a Gigafactory. It also intends to maintain its active human resources policy  with a target of more than 60 net recruitments in 2022.As the market in which McPhy operates remains strong  the Group will also continue to accelerate its growth investments  in particular in R&D  which will consequently impact its profitability.AgendaAvailability of the half-yearly financial report: September 15  2022   after market closePublication of Full-Year Revenue: January 24  2023  after market closeAbout McPhy EnergySpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

No product net sales were recognized during the same period in 2021.Collaboration revenue for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $0.4 million and $2.6 million  respectively  compared to $312.2 million and $470.4 million for the same periods in 2021. The collaboration revenue for the three and six months ended June 30  2021 was primarily attributable to the recognition of the transaction price as a consequence of the termination of the collaboration agreement with Janssen  resulting in the recognition of $311 million in collaboration revenue.Other operating income for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $10.0 million  and $18.1 million  respectively  compared to $7.8 million and $28.2 million for the same periods in 2021. During the three months ended June 30  2022  the fair value of the argenx profit share in AgomAb Therapeutics NV increased by $4.3 million. The increase is a result of the extension of a Series B financing round by AgomAb for which the Company maintains a profit share in exchange for granting the license for the use of HGF-mimetic antibodies from the SIMPLE Antibody™ platform.Total operating expenses for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $259.7 million and $513.9 million  respectively  compared to $224.9 million and $403.5 million for the same periods in 2021  and consists of:Cost of sales for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $5.0 million and $6.4 million  respectively. The cost of sales were recognized with respect to the sale of VYVGART during the first half of 2022. There were no cost of sales recognized in the comparable prior year periods.Research and development expenses for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $126.9 million and $278.9 million  respectively  compared to $151.6 million and $273.9 million for the same periods in 2021. The research and development expenses mainly relate to external research and development expenses and personnel expenses incurred in the clinical development of efgartigimod in various indications and the expansion of our other clinical and preclinical pipeline candidates.Selling  general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $127.8 million and $228.7 million  respectively  compared to $73.3 million and $129.6 million for the same periods in 2021. The selling  general and administrative expenses mainly relate to professional and marketing fees linked to the commercialization of VYVGART in the U.S. and Japan and personnel expenses.Exchange losses for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 were $46.2 million and $53.4 million  respectively  compared to exchange gains of $10.4 million and exchange loss of $18.4 million for the same periods in 2021. Exchange losses are mainly attributable to unrealized exchange rate losses on our cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets position in Euro.Income tax for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $8.2 million and $11.1 of tax income  respectively  compared to $1.7 million and $12.8 million of tax expense for the same periods in 2021. Tax income for the three months ended June 30  2022 consists of $2.7 million of income tax expense and $10.9 million of deferred tax income  compared to $3.2 million of income tax expense and $1.5 million of deferred tax income for the same period in 2021.Net loss for the second quarter and year-to-date in 2022 was $208.7 million and $435.9 million  respectively  compared to net profit of $103.6 million and $63.2 million for the same periods in 2021.Cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets totaled $2 597.4 million as of June 30  2022  compared to $2 336.7 million as of December 31  2021. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets resulted primarily from the closing of a global offering of shares  including a U.S. offering and a European private placement  which resulted in the receipt of $761.0 million in net proceeds in March 2022  partially offset by net cash flows used in operating activities.FINANCIAL GUIDANCEBased on current plans to fund anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures  argenx continues to expect its 2022 cash burn to be up to $1 billion. This will support the global VYVGART launches  clinical development of efgartigimod in 10 indications and ARGX-117 in two indications  investment in the global supply chain  and continued focus on pipeline expansion through the Immunology Innovation Program.EXPECTED 2022 FINANCIAL CALENDAROctober 27  2022: Q3 2022 financial results and business updateCONFERENCE CALL DETAILSThe half-year financial results and second quarter 2022 business update will be discussed during a conference call and webcast presentation today at 2:30 pm CEST/8:30 am ET.

This demand led to an organic net revenue growth of 8.1% in the quarter  continued strong order intake  resulting in an organic backlog growth of 5.9%  and a healthy pipeline of opportunities.Our new operating model  launched in January 2022 and focused on the Global Business Areas (GBAs): Resilience  Places and Mobility  is yielding the expected results. We are seeing increased global collaboration  and scaling and cross selling of services across the business areas  which is helping to serve our clients more efficiently and effectively. We delivered continued strong performance particularly with clients in transportation  energy & resources  and industrial manufacturing  driving margin improvement to 9.3% for the quarter  while making further investments in Digital solutions for clients  and in the attraction  retention and development of key industry talent.As we look to the remainder of the year  we are encouraged by increasing order intake from clients to support their Net Zero ambitions  the increased focus on global electric vehicle roll-out and the need for sustainable industrial manufacturing solutions  particularly in North America. In the current geopolitical reality  both public and private clients are looking to reduce their energy dependencies  leading to a growing appetite for energy transition solutions and sustainability advisory. The recently announced intended acquisition of the Canadian IBI Group will bring increased presence in the highly attractive North American market  enhances our Digital capabilities and positions us well for further acceleration of our profitable growth  all fully supporting our strategic agenda.Story continuesWe will continue to closely watch the geo-political situation as well as the economic developments and outlook. I am confident that with the accelerated demand we are experiencing combined with the pipeline of private and public sector opportunities and our financial discipline  we are on track to deliver on our strategic targets.”KEY FIGURESin € millions Half year Second quarter Period ended 30 June 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Gross revenues 1 847 1 660 11% 968 848 14% Net revenues 1 418 1 276 11% 729 644 13% Organic growth (%)1) 6.9% 8.1% EBITDA 178 167 7% 91 83 10% EBITDA margin (%) 12.6% 13.1% 12.5% 12.9% EBITA 130 113 15% 65 57 13% EBITA margin (%) 9.2% 8.9% 8.9% 8.9% Operating EBITA2) 133 116 14% 68 58 16% Operating EBITA margin (%) 9.3% 9.1% 9.3% 9.1% Net Income 86 77 12% 44 31 40% Net Income from Ops.

Growth was very strong in the UK  North America  and Australia  with Continental Europe and Brazil contributing as well. Organic growth was slightly offset by a decline in Greater China  as a result of ongoing lockdowns. The currency impact was 7.0%  mainly driven by a strong US Dollar. The operating EBITA improved to 9.3% (Q2 2021: 9.1%)  driven by a better year-on-year performance from Places. Globally  the margin improved while we increased our investments in both Digital Solutions and People.REVIEW OF THE HALF YEAR 2022Net revenues totaled €1 418 million and increased organically by 6.9%  driven by all GBAs. The currency impact was 5.9% driven by a strong US Dollar. Non-operating costs were in line with last year and driven by restructuring costs for the wind-down of our business in the Middle East. The income tax rate was 28% (Q2 2021: 21%) and was impacted by  amongst others  non-deductible expenses and non-taxable income from divestitures. Net finance expenses decreased to €5.6 million (HY 2021: €12.5 million)  driven by a lower net debt position. Net income from operations increased by 16% to €93 million (HY 2021: €80 million)  or €1.04 per share (HY 2021: €0.89)  driven by higher revenues  and lower interest expenses.1) Underlying growth excluding the impact of currency movements  acquisitions or footprint reductions  such as the Middle East  winddowns or divestments2) Excluding restructuring  acquisition & divestment costs3) Net income before non-recurring items (e.g. valuation changes of acquisition-related provisions  acquisition & divestment costs  expected credit loss on shareholder loans and corporate guarantees and one-off pension costs)OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTSRESILIENCE42% of net revenuesin € millions Half year Second quarter Period ended 30 June 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 589 513 14.9% 308 261 17.8% Organic growth (%)1) 7.7% 8.5% Operating EBITA 60 55 7.8% Operating EBITA margin (%) 10.1% 10.8% Backlog net revenues (millions) 842 746 Backlog organic growth (yoy)1) 5.5%Resilience showed continued solid revenue and backlog growth for the second quarter  driven by both public and private clients in North America  UK  Australia and Brazil. Client demand and performance continues to be strong in environmental restoration  e.g. caused by clients adhering to their environmental obligations and tightening regulation around PFAS. The current economic and geopolitical unrest has further driven public as well as private investments in climate adaptation  energy transition and water optimization  which was reflected in solid organic backlog growth. The margin for the half year was in line with our strategic margin target set for 2023  and driven by good performance from North America and Europe. The margin decrease versus last year was to a large extent driven by increased investments in Digital Solutions and People  as we continue to invest in attracting and retaining key industry talent to execute our growing backlog.PLACES33% of net revenuesin € millions Half year Second quarter Period ended 30 June 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 463 447 3.7% 235 228 3.1% Organic growth (%)1) 3.1% 5.1% Operating EBITA 41 30 36.0% Operating EBITA margin (%) 8.9% 6.8% Backlog net revenues (millions) 968 961 Backlog organic growth (yoy)1) 3.1%Places demonstrated good revenue growth in the second quarter in particular driven by UK  North America and Australia  further supported by good growth in Continental Europe and partially offset by COVID-19 lockdowns in China and CallisonRTKL. Key clients in Industrial Manufacturing (e.g. Life Sciences  Automotive and Technology)  Government and Energy & Resources  were main contributors to the revenue and backlog growth  as they made investments in creating sustainable manufacturing facilities  EV giga factories  energy efficient data centres or resilient public transport places. The margin improved year-on-year and was driven by strong performance  and a higher contribution from UK and North America  last year’s margin was impacted by losses on projects in Asia. We see a healthy pipeline of opportunities across a resilient client and solutions portfolio  with very strong demand and investments in EV giga factory space for support in permitting  D&E and program management  but also increasing capex investments in industrial manufacturing driving resource efficiency and productivity.MOBILITY25% of net revenuesPeriod ended 30 June 2022 2022 2021 change 2022 2021 change Net revenues 366 317 15.4% 187 155 20.2% Organic growth (%)1) 10.2% 11.1% Operating EBITA 35 33 6.6% Operating EBITA margin (%) 9.5% 10.3% Backlog net revenues (millions) 521 418 Backlog organic growth (yoy)1) 11.9%Revenue and backlog growth was very strong in Mobility for the first half year  particularly for public and private clients in the UK and Australia  with additional contribution from North America and Continental Europe. Highways and Rail clients increasingly looked to improve efficiency and reliability of travel with the use of digital tools to reduce disruption and congestion  ultimately lowering cost and improving quality of life. The client demand for New Mobility was also strong  with increased investments in additional capacity for EV charging infrastructure  amongst others. We experienced increased GBA cross selling as Mobility clients look for Resilience solutions  driving transport decarbonization for highways  ports  airports  and rail. The margin was very strong in UK and Australia  and slightly offset by performance in Greater China  again caused by ongoing lockdowns. The margin decrease versus last year was driven by increased investments in Digital Solutions and People  as well as the ramp up of large projects.BALANCE SHEET & CASH FLOWNet working capital as a percentage of annualized gross revenues improved to 13.3% (Q2 2021: 14.3%) and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) improved to 69 days (Q2 2021: 74 days)  resulting from disciplined working capital management. Both well within the strategic targets set for 2023. The balance sheet strengthened year-on-year  resulting in a significantly lower net debt of €283 million (Q2 2021: €368 million).Free cash flow was €41 million during the second quarter (Q2 2021: €68 million)  improved EBITDA performance versus last year was offset by cash outflow from high unbilled receivables  a result of a sharp increase in gross revenues for June 2022.STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTSOn July 18  2022  Arcadis announced the acquisition of IBI Group: a forward thinking  technology-driven design firm  which will:Accelerate Arcadis’ Digital Leadership strategy with technology driven industry talent from IBI Group  and enable Arcadis to combine all of its digitally enabled client solutions and software products in a new fourth Global Business Area “Intelligence”Complement and strengthen our position in North America  leveraging on the Global Key Client program and use of GECs. Our Places clients in Industrial Manufacturing  Government and Energy & Resources are key drivers of revenue and backlog growth  which will be a strong match with IBI Buildings’ expertise in master planning  smart city design and structural & electrical engineering (e.g. in Automotive and Aerospace) In our Mobility GBA we see very strong demand across our client base with  for example  a critical ask for more efficient and reliable Highways and Rail solutions and public transport places. IBI Group’s solutions such as Transport Planning and -Engineering and -Management with a strong digitally-enabled solutions and state of the art Transport Information Systems are expected to improve our client proposition Our Resilience GBA will benefit from increasing further scale through IBI Group’s water and wastewater as well as its environmental services activitiesProvide a strong position in the highly attractive Canadian marketDuring the first half 2022 and as part as its ‘Focus and Scale’ strategic axis  Arcadis divested its activities in Czech Republic  Slovakia  and Thailand. Given the limited financial size of these businesses  these divestments have no significant impact on group metrics.FINANCIAL CALENDAR27 October 2022 2022 Q3 Trading update 16 February 2023 2022 Q4 & full year ResultsARCADIS INVESTOR RELATIONSChristine DischMobile: +31 6 15376020E-mail: christine.disch@arcadis.comARCADIS CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONSTanno MassarMobile: +31 6 11589121E-mail: tanno.massar@arcadis.comABOUT ARCADISArcadis is the leading global design & consultancy organization for natural and built assets.

First-half revenues climbed to €30.5m  up 72% for the new scope(1) and 26% for the consolidated Group. Driven by technological and regulatory advances  and thanks to the visibility provided by the current geopolitical context  demand for high-performance and secure drone equipment and solutions is accelerating.During the first half of 2022  the Group generated:87% growth in revenues for microdrones (+81% at constant exchange rates) to €15.4m  reflecting the deliveries of ANAFI USA microdrones to agencies & defense forces  as well as the start of ANAFI Ai sales to professionals. In a specific geopolitical context  the alignment between supply and demand for microdrones is facilitating the growing integration of its technologies on the core target markets (inspection  surveillance  mapping).29% growth in revenues from data analysis software (+21% at constant exchange rates) to €15.1m  reflecting the success of Pix4D’s international deployment in a market that is expanding. The robust commercial development is continuing to be supported by Pix4Dmapper  the most widely-used drone-based photogrammetry solution  combined with the gradual ramping up of the new business solutions launched since 2020.Revenues (€m) H1 2022 H1 2021 Change FY 2021 A Parrot Drones 15.4 50% 8.2 34% +87% 20.9 38% B Of which  consumer products(2) 0.4 1% 2.1 9% - 6.2 11% C Pix4D 15.1 50% 11.7 48% +29% 26.2 48% D Parrot SA 0.3 1% 0.1 0% - 0.3 1% E Intragroup eliminations -0.3 -1% -0.5 -2% - -0.8 -2% F SenseFly (activity divested in October 2021) - - 4.7 19% - 7.7 14% G MicaSense (activity divested in January 2021) - - - 9% - 0.0 0% CONSOLIDATED PARROT GROUP TOTAL 30.5 100% 24.3 100% +26% 54.3 100% NEW SCOPE TOTAL (1) (=A-B+C+D+E) 30.1 99% 17.5 72% +72% 40.4 74%(1) “New scope total” is a performance indicator reflecting the impact of the strategy rolled out since end-2018.

Professional drones and solutions generated 99% of these revenues  which no longer include sales for the business units (MicaSense Inc  Sensefly SA  Sensefly Inc) that were divested in 2021 and contributed €4.7m in the first half of 2021. Excluding revenues from the business units divested and from consumer products  like-for-like revenues represent €30.1m  compared with €17.5m for the first half of 2021  up 72%. The Group estimates that around 9% of its microdrone sales are directly related to the conflict in Ukraine.The gross margin rate came to 80% for the period  compared with 73% for the first half of 2021. This increase primarily reflects a favorable mix effect for professional drone equipment and the reversal of provisions  with some linked to the clearance of old product ranges which have now been fully written down  while others were no longer applicable.For the first half of 2022  the Parrot Group’s consolidated operating expenditure totaled €36.4m  compared with €37.0m for the same period in 2021. €0.4m was recorded in 2021 for economic support measures during the health crisis  but this was not recorded in 2022. The disposals are reflected in a €5.4m reduction in operating expenditure  with the majority reallocated to the Group’s R&D  notably following on from the CHF 10m capital increase carried out in February 2022 to support Pix4D. As a result  R&D spending is stable at €20.8m for the first half of this year compared with the same period in 2021. For its next innovation phase  the Group is harnessing artificial intelligence and extended connectivity to automate missions and processes for all types of sites or infrastructures.The reduction (-27%) in sales and marketing spending  which came to €5.6m  compared with €7.7m for the first half of 2021  mainly reflects the impact of the disposals combined with the effective management of BtoB marketing budgets.Production and quality spending is virtually stable (-3%)  highlighting the good management of procurement and supplies. Against the backdrop of significant health constraints in China and disruption affecting the components market  Parrot is maintaining its agile approach and increasing the resources allocated to production management.The increase in administrative costs and overheads (+26%) for the first half of 2022 primarily reflects non-recurring impacts that reduced the figure for 2021 (reversal of provisions for disputes) and led to an increase in 2022 (recruitments  employee-related provisions recorded).At end-June 2022  income from ordinary operations shows an improvement of €7.0m  with a first-half current operating loss of -€12.1m  versus -€19.2m at end-June 2021. The Group’s workforce (permanent and fixed-term contracts) represented 514 people (448 at December 31  2021 and 547 at June 30  2021)  in addition to 63 external contractors (49 at December 31  2021 and 50 at June 30  2021). 56 people joined the Group during the first half of 2022  with 34 focused on R&D.The non-recurring operating expenses of -€4.2m concern the impacts of the divestments. On the one hand  a capital loss on the sale of the AgEagle Systems Inc shares received as payment for the equivalent of $3m corresponding to part of Sensefly’s sale. These shares were sold in March for a total of €1.8m on the NYSE American market  generating a capital loss of €1.2 m. On the other hand  negotiations launched with the buyer in June were completed on July 22 and recognized in the accounts at June 30. They concern the early payment and the securing of the remaining sums payable in 2022 and 2023  representing approximately $7.5m. A payment of $3.7 million is now expected in the next few days  the difference of $3.7 million provisioned at June 30  2022. As a reminder  in June 2021  €16.2m of non-recurring operating income linked to the sale of Micasense at the start of 2021 was recorded in the accounts. End of June 2022 EBIT therefore came to -€16.3m.After €3.1m of financial income and expenses and a -€0.9m share of income from associates  consolidated net income (Group share) came to -€14.1m for the first half of 2022.Changes in the cash position and balance sheet at June 30  2022The Group had €70.0m of net cash at June 30  2022  compared with €82.0m at end-December 2021  excluding the impact of IFRS 16. Cash and cash equivalents totaled €70.0m  with €12.8m consumption during the first six months of 2022.Cash flow from operations came to -€9.3m (versus -€18.4m at end-June 2021). The loss for the period includes the reversal of provisions  the capital loss on the sale of the AgEagle Aerial Systems shares  and the IFRS 2 costs for the Group’s various stock option and bonus share plans. Factoring in the -€4.8m change in working capital requirements  cash from operating activities totaled -€14.1m  compared with -€22.9m at end-June 2021.The change in working capital requirements reflects the following developments: (i) a +€1.9m impact linked to a reclassification of €3.2m of tax receivables allocated against various liabilities for a similar amount (VAT) and offsetting an increase in trade receivables for €1.7m  (ii) a -€3.9m change in trade and other payables  resulting from the decrease in advances and deposits received on orders  tax and employee-related liabilities  and prepaid income  and (iii) a -€2.7m change in inventories  linked to the ramping up of professional microdrone sales (finished products and components). With net inventories raised to €8.1m at June 30  2022  versus €4.9m at December 31  2021  Parrot is ramping up the production of its microdrones with its subcontractors in the United States and Asia.Cash flow from investment activities came to €3.5m  linked primarily to the payment instalments received on the sales of SenseFly and Micasense during the first half of 2022. These amounts  which totaled €4.8m  offset the operating investments for -€1.2m.Cash flow from financing activities came to -€3.5m  with -€1.5m of IFRS 16 costs  as well as -€1.6m of costs linked to the unwinding of a stock option plan concerning Pix4D.In terms of the balance sheet  the application of IFRS 5 (Assets Held for Sale for €1.8m) concerns a proposed operation to sell the interest in Planck Aerosystems Inc  which is consolidated on an equity basis and was 47.2% owned by Parrot at end-June 2022. The valuation of this interest has led to a -€1.0m impairment in goodwill  recognized in “Share of profit of companies accounted for by the equity method” on the income statement. This item has no cash impact.Outlook for 2022Realigned  streamlined and driven by professional solutions at the forefront of innovation  Parrot is looking ahead to 2022 with confidence in its strategy and vigilance concerning the changes in the international environment. During the second half of this year  the deliveries for orders received from NATO countries defense forces will generate a further acceleration in growth.The Group is continuing to allocate its resources to an ambitious R&D roadmap. Supported by its advances in the field of artificial intelligence and the growing integration between hardware and software  Parrot aims to continue facilitating the adoption of drone technologies and offer new use cases that are aligned with the needs of professionals  businesses and institutions  focused on (i) 3D Mapping  Geomatics and Inspection  (ii) Defense and Security  and (iii) Precision Farming.To secure its production capacity over the medium and long term  and respond to the growing interest in its microdrones at the start of this year  Parrot is further strengthening its synergies between R&D  procurement and production tracking. The increase in the resources allocated to these operations will be combined with an agile sourcing management approach. These transformational initiatives are limiting the reduction of costs in 2022  and their efficiency and effectiveness are still strongly correlated with changes in the health context in China  where the situation has deteriorated at the start of this year.Looking beyond the disruption linked to the economic and geopolitical environment  which is difficult to predict  the Group plans to move forward with its roadmap for revenue growth on its “new scope” and capitalize on the opportunities opened up by the growing adoption of drone technologies in businesses and the public sector. The Group will continue to closely monitor the allocation of its cash  and will be ready to respond and adapt to potential changes in the conditions.Next financial dates2022 third-quarter business: Thursday November 17  2022ABOUT PARROTFounded in 1994 by Henri Seydoux  Parrot is today the leading European drone manufacturer in this rapidly expanding market.Visionary  at the forefront of innovation Parrot has a complementary range of equipment and software adapted to the needs of companies  large groups and government organizations.

8341,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,http://blockworks.co/jacobis-new-ceo-to-oversee-europes-first-bitcoin-etf-future-crypto-funds/,Jacobi’s New CEO To Oversee Europe’s First Bitcoin ETF  Future Crypto Funds,Incoming chief executive is hoping to use his experience at BlackRock’s iShares to help the firm build out its crypto ETF rangeThe post Jacobi’s New CEO To Oversee Europe’s First Bitcoin ETF  Future Crypto Funds appeared first on Blockworks.,Martin Bednall was previously co-head of iShares’ European ETP team and led FinEx Capital Management’s ETF businessBlackRock is “many years away” from launching a bitcoin ETF  says the former managing directorJacobi Asset Management has named a new CEO with deep ETF experience as the firm is set to launch a first-of-its-kind product in Europe  with additional crypto funds in the works.Former Goldman Sachs investment banker Jamie Khurshid has led London-based Jacobi since it launched in May 2021  and Martin Bednall will replace him as CEO on Aug. 1  the company revealed Thursday. Khurshid will become the chairman of the company’s board  and current chair Roy McGregor remains as a director at the firm.Bednall served as a managing director at BlackRock from 2000 to 2013  according to his LinkedIn profile. There  he was co-head of the iShares product team responsible for new exchange-traded product (ETP) development and management in Europe  the Middle East and Africa.More recently  Bednall led FinEx Capital Management’s ETF business  including portfolio management  capital markets  operations and product development.The Jacobi Bitcoin ETF  the first such product in Europe  is set to launch on Euronext Amsterdam next month with a 1.5% annual management fee  and Bednall will help the firm expand its crypto fund slate.Bednall called ETFs the “go-to structure” for investors  arguing that they are superior to the exchange-traded notes (ETNs) currently on the European market.While ETNs are debt instruments that are typically collateralized by the underlying exposure  such as bitcoin  he told Blockworks  Jacobi’s ETF was approved by a regulator and holds bitcoin directly.“You’re bringing the digital exposures but doing it in a way that investors are very comfortable with ” Bednall said. “If you put the time and the effort in  you get a better product  and that’s what Jacobi has.”Regulatory process and future productsJacobi’s upcoming bitcoin ETF product had received regulatory approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission last October  but it took months for the firm to find a place to list it.Christopher Jehan  head of fund architecture and former chair of the Guernsey Investment & Funds Association  helped the bitcoin ETF meet regulatory standards. Several exchanges in the region “didn’t have the appetite” for the ETF  he told Blockworks.“Being the first thing of a kind  it is satisfying but it is always significantly more work and a lot more handholding than taking the well-traveled path ” Jehan added.Jehan said he expects launching more crypto products will be a more “streamlined” process going forward. Executives noted that the company could seek to launch additional single-asset crypto funds  such as one that owns ether  as well as crypto basket products and funds that hold crypto alongside non-crypto assets  such as traditional commodities.“Already there has been discussion going on about potential funds two  three  four and five ” Jehan said. “Have we got an absolute sense of direction yet? No.”Bednall added that investors are expressing interest in yield products.“We have to be very wary of that  as we know there have been issues in the market around stablecoins ” he noted. “So when we look at that  we’ll need to design it so there’s a lot of investor protection.”Who will emerge as competitors?Bednall called this a pivotal time for digital assets  noting that many interested institutional investors have been on the sidelines seeking the best way into the space.“[This] is going to be the product that many of the institutional investors have been waiting for ” he explained. “It then gives them that first taste  that first access and then builds their comfort around investing in digital assets.”While Bednall expects smaller  nimble companies to launch similar crypto ETFs  he said BlackRock  for example  — the world’s largest asset manager — is likely “many years away” from doing so.BlackRock added the iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF (IBLC) to its megatrends product suite  but has declined to comment on whether it would seek to launch products that hold cryptoassets directly.“There are a lot of competing voices within those institutions where many will be wary  some people will be totally against it and then you’ll have people that want to do it ” Bednall said. “They’re slow-moving organizations and the bureaucracy doesn’t allow them to come into something like this at this stage.”Just 3 days left to redeem our biggest DAS discount!

Net sales recorded the acceleration of the profitable shift of product sales towards marketplace sales  which are only recognized for the amount of the associated commissions.Gross margin was €201.0m in the 1st half 2022  representing 22.8% of net sales  a slight decrease of -0.4 point compared to 2021 but a significant increase of +5.3 pts compared to pre-pandemic level (1st half of 2019). This gross margin increase over the past three years demonstrates the success of the implementation of the strategic plan  with a marketplace growing +19% compared to the 1st half of 2019 and advertising services nearly doubling in revenues vs. the same pre-pandemic level. Compared to 2021  Cnova accelerated its shift towards the marketplace with direct sales margin negatively impacted by increase in transportation costs and destocking initiatives in a context of Efficiency Plan to optimize working capital needs and inventory levels to current level of activity. Despite those underlying drivers  dynamic advertising services helped maintaining a relatively flat gross margin compared to 2021.SG&A costs amounted to €(184.4)m in the 1st half 2022  representing 20.9% of net sales  a -2.5 points decrease y-o-y. During the 2nd quarter  an efficiency plan to recalibrate cost structure to current level of activity was launched with first significant positive impact expected in the 2nd half and full run-rate impact in 2023. Fulfillment costs  at 7.1% of net sales (+0.2 point)  decreasing by €7m compared to the same period of last year as this cost line was favorably impacted by lower volume in H1 for its variable part (logistics  after sales and payment processing) and first benefits from the Efficiency Plan for its fixed part. Marketing costs represented 5.9% of net sales (+0.8 point)  stable in value with lower volume driving down marketing variable costs offset by a media campaign over the months of May and June. Technology & Content costs increased at 5.1% of net sales (+1.1 point) mainly impacted by the acceleration of the product & commercial development of Octopia’s solutions. General & Administrative expenses decreased in value as head office costs increase to support the acceleration of the new B2B activities was compensated by first quick wins from the Efficiency Plan. SG&A savings from the Efficiency Plan are not material yet but will generate  together with CAPEX savings  significant cost reductions of more than €30m in the 2nd half of 2022 and €75m in 2023 on a full-year basis.As a result  1st half EBITDA decreased to +€17m compared to last year  representing 1.9% of net sales (-2.9 point vs. 2020). In a context of significant market headwinds  EBITDA benefited from a resilient marketplace performance and increased revenues from advertising services while destocking initiatives negatively impacted Direct Sales gross margin.Operating EBIT decreased to -€32m  with depreciation and amortization increasing by €6m y-o-y (5.5% of net sales  +1.3 pt vs. 1H21) mainly due to accelerated investments in relation to Octopia over the past 12 months.Net financial expenses – mainly related to 4-installment payment solutions offered to customers – amounted to €42m  a significant increase compared to last year as a result of an increase in 4x payment take rate in GMV since the 2nd half of 2021 and higher refinancing interest rates.As part of the Efficiency Plan  4-installment payment share of GMV and its associated cost of risk are being optimized with positive results expected in the coming months with the full-year impact expected in 2023.Net loss amounted to €(70)m  an important decrease compared to last year level. 1H21 result was favorably impacted by exceptional circumstances in a pandemic context while 1H22 was heavily impacted by low demand and high inflation headwinds at EBITDA level and cost of risks increase at financial results level.Free cash flow figures(€ millions)Half-yearJune 2022Half-yearJune 2021Changevs. 2021EBITDA 16.8 48.9 -65.6% (-) non-recurring items -6.3 -2.9 x2.2 (-) rents -17.7 -16.5 +7.3% Cash from continuing operations  incl. rents -7.2 29.5 -36.7 Net CAPEX (incl.

This strategy  supported by inventory reduction  is one of the key pillar of the Efficiency Plan launched in 2Q22 and will be pursued in the 2 nd part of the year. P ositive one-off impact of c. € 45 m from the sale of hypermarket Géant inventories to the Casino Group in June 2022.Net capital expenditures slightly decreased (excluding €20m one-off Floa transaction impact) in the first 6 months  thanks to a rationalization of investments to adapt to current level of activity.Key Business AchievementsMarketplace growing double-digit over the past three years  driving up revenues and profitabilityThe marketplace gained +3.2 points of GMV share in the 1 st half 2022 compared to 2021 to reach 49.6%Marketplace revenues amounted to €89.5m in the 1 st half 2022 receding by -7.1% but increased +25.1% vs. pre-pandemic level (1 st half of 2019)Expansion of express delivery eligible marketplace SKUs is a key driver of growth  customer satisfaction and contributes to the development of our loyalty program  Cdiscount à Volonté (CDAV).

This marked rebound in all regions and for all of our brands. The summer will confirm these trends and the fall promises to be strong with the recovery of major seminars and conventions. Nevertheless  the Group remains attentive to the evolution of the geopolitical and economic environment. At this stage  the Group should report a strong growth in EBITDA  with a target of more than €550 million for the full-year 2022”.The Group’s business rebounded significantly in H1 2022 after two years of major pandemic-related disruptions in the tourism and hospitality industry. In Q2 2022  activity recovered to levels close to  if not above  the 2019 levels in almost all of our geographies. The only laggards were China  which is impacted by travel restrictions as part of its strict enforcement of a “zero-Covid” policy  and South East Asia  which is highly dependent on Chinese visitors.This rebound reflects both the recovery of the number of business and leisure domestic guests  and border reopenings which accelerated the return of international travelers. It was accompanied by a sharp increase in prices  driven by demand and emphasized by inflation.During first-half 2022  Accor opened 85 hotels  representing 11 700 rooms  i.e.  net system growth of 1.8% in the last 12 months. At end-June 2022  the Group had a hotel portfolio of 777 945 rooms (5 300 hotels) and a pipeline of 212 000 rooms (1 215 hotels).For 2022  the Group is confirming its forecast of net unit growth in the network of around 3.5%.Consolidated revenueThe Group reported H1 2022 revenue of €1 725 million  up 97% like-for-like compared with H1 2021. By activity  this growth breaks down into a 119% increase for HotelServices and 57% for Hotel Assets & Other. To provide a comparison with RevPAR (change presented versus 2019 throughout this release)  the like-for-like decline in revenue versus H1 2019 is 10%.Changes in the consolidation scope  mainly due to the consolidation of Ennismore  and the reopening of Pullman Montparnasse contributed positively by €31 million.Currency effects had a positive impact of €69 million  mainly due to the US dollar ((9)%).Source: AccorHotelServices revenueHotelServices  which includes fees from Management & Franchise (M&F) and Services to Owners  reported €1 276 million in revenue  up 119% like-for-like versus H1 2021 (down 12% like-for-like versus H1 2019). This increase reflects the significant recovery seen in the first half of the year.Revenue in Management & Franchise (M&F) stood at €434 million  up 153% like-for-like versus H1 2021 (down 15% like-for-like versus H1 2019)  with regional performances correlated to the business recovery in the considered countries. In general  the slightly sharper decline in M&F revenue compared with RevPAR (down 11% in H1 2022 versus H1 2019) can be attributed to the decrease in incentive fees based on the hotel operating margin generated from management contracts.Source: AccorConsolidated RevPAR was down 11% overall in H1 2022 versus H1 2019 and up 1% in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2019. These figures reflect a month-after-month sequential improvement in business with a sharp increase in prices  driven by demand and emphasized by inflation. Therefore  activity reached levels close to  or even higher than 2019 levels in almost all of our regions in the second quarter.In Q2 2022  RevPAR in South Europe was 2% above the Q2 2019 level.In France   Q2 2022 RevPAR was 3% above the Q2 2019 level. The recovery of international travelers helped Paris to close the gap with province  both now above 2019 level in Q2. Prices were higher than those of the same period in 2019  with a favorable combination of public events in May (UEFA Champions League Final  Roland-Garros Tournament …).

In Spain  RevPAR was up 2% in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2019.In Q2 2022  RevPAR in North Europe was down 7% versus Q2 2019  but business improved sequentially month after month.In the United Kingdom   the strength of the recovery was comparable to that seen in France. Both London and the province recovered to RevPAR levels above those of Q2 2019.  the strength of the recovery was comparable to that seen in France. Both London and the province recovered to RevPAR levels above those of Q2 2019. In Germany  which took longer to lift its health restrictions related to the Covid crisis  business recovered at a slower pace. Nevertheless  in June  the country’s RevPAR performance came close to the levels recorded in neighboring countries.RevPAR continued to improve sequentially in Asia-Pacific (+25 percentage points between Q1 2022 and Q2 2022). It was down 18% in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2019.Pacific confirmed the recovery already seen in Q1 2022 and ended the second quarter up 9% versus Q2 2019.

However  the restrictions implemented as part of the strict enforcement of its “zero-Covid” policy adversely affected its performance and resulted in a 38% decline in RevPAR versus Q2 2019. In South East Asia  RevPAR was down 31% in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2019. Although the main travel restrictions have been lifted  the region’s dependence on Chinese visitors had an adverse impact on the recovery speed.In the India  Middle East  Africa & Turkey region  the rebound in RevPAR  which exceeded 2019 level (+32% in Q2 2022)  was confirmed for a third consecutive quarter.The United Arab Emirates continued to outperform after a strong Q1 boosted by the world Expo 2020.continued to outperform after a strong Q1 boosted by the world Expo 2020. In Saudi Arabia  the broader reopening of the holy cities for pilgrimages has led to a sharp rebound in activity  particularly during April Ramadan period. This recovery is also expected to continue with the Hajj in July.In the Americas  Q2 2022 RevPAR was 5% higher than in Q2 2019.In North/Central America and the Caribbean   RevPAR was in line with 2019 levels in Q2 2022  driven by a sharp increase in prices.and the   RevPAR was in line with 2019 levels in Q2 2022  driven by a sharp increase in prices. In South America  and particularly Brazil  the pick-up in business volumes was notably impressive  with occupancy rates above the 2019 level throughout Q2 2022.Services to Owners revenue  which includes the Sales  Marketing  Distribution and Loyalty division  as well as shared services and the reimbursement of hotel staff costs  came to €842 million in H1 2022  down 10% compared with 2019  in line with consolidated RevPAR for the period.Hotel Assets & Other revenueAt end-June 2022  this segment  which includes owned and leased hotels  represented 114 hotels and 22 417 rooms.Revenue in the “Hotel Assets & Other” segment was up 57% like-for-like in H1 2022 versus H1 2021 and down 8% like-for-like versus H1 2019. This segment  which is closely tied to activity in Australia  benefited in particular from renewed leisure and business tourism demand.Since early 2021  this segment has included concierge services  luxury home rentals  private sales of hotel stays and digital services for hotel owners. All these activities benefited from the uptrend in tourism.Positive EBITDAConsolidated EBITDA was €205 million in H1 2022  versus €(120) million in H1 2021. This performance was linked to the activity recovery. In the first half  immediate marketing actions were activated to capture and convert this rebound. On top  we are faced with an unexpected cost inflation  which structurally affects our cost base. The RESET cost saving plan  that is being delivered per plan  is helping to offset all the above.Source: AccorSource: AccorHotelServices EBITDA by businessHotelServices EBITDA was positive at €208 million in H1 2022. This performance breaks down as positive EBITDA for Management & Franchise (M&F) and a negative contribution from Services to Owners. This negative contribution reflects both marketing expenses incurred to capture the pick-up in business and general cost inflation. Rebilling of hotel costs (with revenue at €497 million)  included in Services to Owners  structurally remains at breakeven at the EBITDA level.Management & Franchise EBITDA by regionSource: AccorThe Management & Franchise division of HotelServices reported an EBITDA of €297 million in H1 2022  significantly higher than in H1 2021 (at €55 million) but still below H1 2019 ((19)% like-for-like). All regions are now generating positive EBITDA.Hotel Assets & Other EBITDAHotel Assets & Other EBITDA came to €58 million in H1 2022 versus €25 million in H1 2021. This segment is mainly driven by Australia  where the activity has recovered. New Businesses  included in this segment since early 2021  reported positive EBITDA in the first half of the year.Source: AccorNet profit  Group share was €32 million in H1 2022  compared with €67 million in H1 2021.The Share of net profit of associates & JVs came to €(27) million in H1 2022  stemming very largely from AccorInvest’s contribution  which was much more limited than in H1 2021.

This slight increase is related to the finalization of the restructuring plan and some investments including in Reef  a US dark kitchen operator.On June 30  2022  the average cost of Accor’s debt was 1.9% (a decrease due to the redemption of bonds that had a higher coupon) with an average maturity of about 4 years and with no major repayments due before 2026.As of end-June 2022  combined with the undrawn credit facilities of €1.2 billion  Accor had a liquidity position of €2.5 billion.

Taking a longer view however  the performance is resilient  with Group GMV 18% above H1 2019  and online GMV up 61% over 3 years  notably thanks to the continued success of our marketplace.To navigate through the exceptionally challenging market conditions  we deployed a comprehensive action plan to support sales  contain costs and optimize cash.

June showed no improvement compared to May  and the mixed results of the traditional summer sale season confirmed the clear Europe-wide slowdown  particularly in the home and living category  which benefitted from strong consumer spending during the pandemic.Taking a longer view  Maisons du Monde showed resilience as H1 2022 sales were up 11% compared to H1 2019.Summary of ActivityQ2 22Q2 21%ChangeH1 22H1 21%Change(in EUR million) GMV 314.5 330.0 -4.7% 643.4 658.6 -2.3% Marketplace 29.0 16.6 +74.7% 48.7 30.5 +59.7% Sales 290.9 317.2 -8.3% 603.9 634.4 -4.8% % like-for-like change -10.3% +32.3% -7.1% +34.3% Maisons du Monde 289.8 315.9 -8.3% 601.6 632.0 -4.8% % like-for-like change -10.2% +32.2% -7.1% +34.2% Sales by distribution channel Stores 198.2 176.3 +12.5% 407.1 373.5 +9.0% % of sales 68.1% 55.6% 67.4% 58.9% Online 92.7 140.9 -34.2% 196.8 260.8 -24.5% % of sales 31.9% 44.4% 32.6% 41.1% Sales by geography France 151.0 150.7 +0.2% 312.6 332.1 -5.9% % of sales 51.9% 47.5% 51.8% 52.4% International 139.9 166.5 -15.9% 291.3 302.2 -3.6% % of sales 48.1% 52.5% 48.2% 47.6% Sales by category Decoration 152.9 156.5 -2.3% 327.4 331.9 -1.3% % of sales 52.6% 49.3% 54.2% 52.3% Furniture 138.0 160.7 -14.1% 276.5 302.5 -8.6% % of sales 47.4% 50.7% 45.8% 47.7%Sales by channelDuring the first half  store and online sales recalibrated in an environment which  unlike last year  was unaffected by Covid  but was impacted this year by the inflationary context and the decline in consumer confidence across Europe.Online GMV was EUR 237 million (-16.9%)  while online sales decreased by -24.5% vs. H1 21  reflecting a challenging comparable base: online net sales reached all-time-highs in Q1 and Q2 21 on the back of strong demand for the category and a highly dynamic channel  with stores closed on average 30% of the time in H1 21. Online activity  mainly driven by furniture sales  was still impacted in Q2 22 by continued sub-optimal (but rising) inventory levels  which in turn hit the conversion rate. Consequently  both online traffic and the conversion rate were below their H1 21 levels (-13% and -16%  respectively).The marketplace maintained its strong dynamic as GMV reached €49 million in H1 22 (+60% yoy)  fueled by a solid performance in France (+44% yoy  marketplace GMV representing 35% of French online GMV)  and the successful launch of our second marketplace in Spain  which already accounts for 31% of Spanish online GMV after only three months.The continued success of the Maisons du Monde marketplace demonstrates the relevance of our online strategy and our ability to maintain our competitive edge. In the face of supply chain challenges impacting online more than stores  online represented 37% of Group GMV in H1 and 33% of sales. Compared to H1 19  online GMV and online net sales were up +61% and +34%  respectively.Store sales grew by (+9.0% vs. H1 21)  benefitting from a favorable base effect as stores were partially closed during this period in 2021. In Q2  like-for-like store traffic decreased by 17% on average vs 2019 to the end of April before significantly eroding in May  worsening to about -30%  and even -40% at certain times. The trend was still strongly negative in early June (-25%)  until the seasonal sales season. Decoration sales evolution was above traffic  with an uplift both on conversion rate and average order size  and a limited price effect. Furniture sales  on the other hand  declined more than traffic  reflecting the impact of low product availability.At 30 June 2022  Maisons du Monde had 350 stores  compared to 357 at 31 December 2021  with an average retail trading space per store of 1 226 m2. The first six months of 2022 saw the opening of two new stores  one in France and one in Spain. During the same period  the Group closed six stores in France  two in Belgium and one in Italy. Total store network commercial area at 30 June 2022 of 429 000 m2 decreased 4 000 m2 compared to 31 December 2021.Sales by categoryDecoration sales remained broadly stable (-1.3%) versus H1 21 at EUR 327 million despite the very high comparable base (H1 21 grew by +40% yoy) and the May-June 10% yoy store traffic decline. This resilience reflects the quality of our collections  which  according to consumers as well as to press and influencers  are increasingly desirable and sustainable.Furniture sales decreased to EUR 276 million (-8.6% yoy)  impacted by supply chain disruptions that led to limited availability in certain product families  including best-seller products. China’s Covid-related measures in Q2 and ongoing freight disruptions added to the supply chain challenge. Amid a slowdown in commercial activity  however  our teams’ efforts to rebuild inventories  led to an improving level of furniture availability. At the end of June  immediate availability reached 59%  a level not reached since June 2020  and this should support sales dynamics over H2.Sales by geographySales in France reached EUR 313 million (52% of total sales)  down 6% vs H1 21  and up 2% vs H1 19. Store sales in France  representing 55% of total store sales  were EUR 222 million  up 8% yoy. Store sales performance was supported by a favorable base effect as French stores were closed on average 33% of the time in H1 last year. Online GMV in France was down 16% yoy and up 78% vs H1 2019. It accounted for 36% of France’s total GMV  compared to 42% in H1 21 and 23% in H1 19.International sales totaled EUR 291 million  down 3.6% vs H1 21  and up a solid +24% vs H1 2019. Sales vs 2021 in the two largest countries  Italy and Spain  were up 10% and 1%  respectively. International Online GMV was down 18% yoy and up 46% vs. 2019 and represented 38% of total international GMV in H1 22  compared to 45% in H1 21 and 32% in H1 19.Financial p erformanceThe first-half 2022 financial performance was marked by the lower sales yoy. Furthermore  2021 was a non-normative year as it was still impacted by the pandemic which led to its gross margin being exceptionally high given the low level of promotions (low product availability  stores closed 30% of the time  high customer demand). Also the Group benefitted in 2021 from one-off COVID-related measures that temporarily lowered its cost base.First-half 2022 gross margin came in at 64.0%  down 145 pts yoy  but stable vs 2019 (excluding Modani). Compared to 2019  gross margin this year benefited from a favorable product mix (46% of sales in furniture vs. 48% in 2019). However it started to be impacted by the adverse market conditions (further freight price increases  raw material and energy cost inflation as well as EUR/USD currency rate deterioration). These headwinds had not yet fully materialized over the first half. H2 sales  on the other hand  will reflect the combined effect of higher freight and purchasing costs  while our hedging policy protects us for most of the year against the weakened euro.EBIT of EUR 28 million with margin of 4.7%Gross margin  EBITDA  EBIT(in EUR million) H1 2022 H1 2021 %change Sales 603.9 634.4 -4.8% Cost of goods sold (217.2) (219.0) -0.8% Gross margin 386.7 415.4 -6.9% As a % of Sales 64.0% 65.5% -145 bps Store operating and central costs (170.7) (164.3) +3.9% Advertising costs (32.1) (33.6) -4.4% Logistics costs (84.5) (92.4) -8.6% Operating Costs (287.3) (290.2) -1.0% EBITDA 99.4 125.2 -20.6% As a % of Sales 16.5% 19.7% -328 bps Depreciation  amortization and allowance for provisions (70.9) (77.3) -8.2% EBIT 28.4 47.9 -40.6% As a % of Sales 4.7% 7.6% -284 bpsTo mitigate the effect of these external factors at gross and net margin levels  the Group has launched an action plan that aims to drive additional operational optimization programs in sourcing  logistics and transportation (see H2 2022 action plan below for full details). In addition  after a first series of price increases over the course of Q1 in line with its collectioning calendar  a second wave of price increases will go into effect by the end of the summer  as H2 collections are introduced. In a context of constrained purchasing power  low consumer confidence and high risk of arbitrage in our category  the Group has chosen to implement pricing gradually and selectively  in order to preserve customer loyalty and longer-term growth. This sequential approach allows us to base our price uplifts on sales elasticity  safeguarding our market competitiveness.Logistics costs in the first half decreased by 8.6% to EUR 84.5 million on the basis of lower volumes. From a ratio perspective  logistics costs decreased by 57 bps as a percentage of net sales due to enhanced efficiencies in warehouse operations and transportation  as well as favorable product and channel mix.Store operating and central costs increased by EUR 6 million (+3.9% yoy)  mainly reflecting EUR 11 million of the one-off unemployment subsidies and lease payment reductions accounted for in H1 21  and increases in direct costs in 2022 in relation to the inflationary context  which were partially offset by other cost adjustments.The action plan mentioned above also includes cost containment and savings totaling EUR 20 million (full details below). Only a marginal amount was achieved by the end of June  while the bulk is expected to be realized in H2 22.EBITDA was down 20.6% to EUR 99.4 million (EBITDA margin: 16.5%  -328 bps vs H1 21 and -121 bps vs H1 2019).After taking into consideration lower D&A expense thanks to some risk and litigation accrual releases  H1 2022 EBIT reached EUR 28.4 million with an associated margin of 4.7% (-284 bps yoy and -106 bps over H1 2019).Other net operating expenses were mainly related to store closure costs.Net financial expense declined to EUR 9 million due to lower long-term debt and revolving credit facility interest expense compared to H1 21 as well as gains on currency transactions.Income tax declined to EUR 4 million on lower sales volume. The effective tax rate was 26%.Net income from continuing operations amounted to EUR 8 million  down 51% yoy. EPS was EUR 0.19  compared to EUR 0.43 in H1 21.Free cash flow: EUR (7) millionFree cash flow came in at EUR (7) million compared to EUR 51 million in H1 2021. This decrease mainly reflects i) the EBITDA decrease (EUR 26 million)  ii) an increase in the change of working capital requirement related to inventory rebuild (EUR 37 million)  and iii) an increase in capex (EUR 8 million) mainly related to the opening of the new distribution center in northern France  which started operations in July.(in EUR million) 30 June 2022 30 June 2021 EBITDA 99.4 125.2 Change in working capital (12.3) 25.1 Change in other operating items (4.2) (19.6) Net cash generated by/ (used in) operating activities 82.8 130.7 Capital expenditures (Capex) (31.8) (23.8) Change in debt on fixed assets (0.2) (0.6) Proceeds from sale of non-current assets 0.2 0.8 Decrease in lease debt (52.0) (50.4) Decrease in lease debt/Lease interest paid (5.6) (5.6) Free cash flow (6.6) 51.2Net financial debtThe Group’s gross debt position at 30 June 2022 was EUR 194 million  virtually unchanged vs EUR 191 million at the end of June 2021. Taking into account its cash and cash equivalents position of EUR 102 million  Maisons du Monde’s net debt position at 30 June 2022 was EUR 92 million (leverage of 0.64x  compared to 0.22x at 30 June 2021).Net debt & leverage(in EUR million)Net debt calculation 30 June 2022 30 June 2021 Convertible bonds (“OCEANE”) 193.4 188.8 Term loan (0.5) 0.0 Revolving Credit Facilities (RCFs) (0.8) (0.1) Other debt2 2.1 2.0 Cash & cash equivalents (102.4) (153.0) Net debt 91.8 37.7 LTM EBITDA (ex IFRS 16) 143.2 191.8 Leverage3 0.64x 0.22xBanking Credit Facility RenewalThe Group renewed its banking credit facility in April 2022. This new EUR 250 million credit agreement (RCF for EUR 150 million and Term Loan for EUR 100 million)  contracted with the Group's main banking partners  secures the Group’s liquidity and will enable the reimbursement of the convertible program by the end of 2023. It was also an opportunity to confirm Maisons du Monde’s ESG commitment by inaugurating its first sustainability-linked loans.H2 2022 action planFor the remainder of 2022  the Group aims to best balance the equation between profit and cash protection and fueling sustainable growth.Short-term profitability optimization is driven by:sales boost and the limitation of gross margin erosion in a highly inflationary contextfurther productivity gains in logistics and transportation to offset the operational deleveraging effect of lower sales volumes and the higher fuel pricessolid action plan minimizing all discretionary spending to offset some fixed cost increases (wages  energy)capex rationalization given the low visibility on market conditionsworking capital requirement optimization in a context of inventory rebuild.Sales support & net margin optimizationIn a context of soft demand and a highly promotional competitive environment  the Group will allocate a higher than usual  yet reasonable  markdown budget to H2 (by c.2-3 pp of sales vs LY) to support sales. Gross margin will also be impacted by higher COGS. Price increases will partly offset the impact on margins. In this context  the Group has implemented the following measures to bring EUR 5 million extra savings this year and secure our gross margin around 63%:Additional rounds of negotiations with major suppliers  applicable as of 2022  andOperational efficiency plans in the collectioning and sourcing process as well as extra optimization initiatives in logistics.We are also optimizing our upcoming collections to best balance our customer value proposition and profit protection. The impact of this detailed approach will be mainly visible in 2023 as per our collectioning calendar.Fixed cost containmentRising inflation  a higher store cost base driven by the 2021 store openings as well as the rebasing effect of 2021 Covid-related measures should add additional costs of around EUR 25-30 million over the year. To compensate for these factors  an operating cost containment program of EUR 20 million has been launched and includes:Hiring freeze and restrictive replacement policyTravel limitation and fee reduction programs throughout the companyMarketing spend reduction based on a stricter ROI approach.Capex and WCR optimizationGiven the highly volatile environment  our selective approach to capex has been further reinforced. The Group will adjust all capex spending except for the launch of its second warehouse  a key pillar to deliver its longer-term agenda. Excluding this project  capex would be back to a level comparable to that of 2019.Regarding working capital requirement  the Group plans to keep rebuilding inventories to support 2023 sales. Given the context  however  it has materially reduced its shipping plans for the second half and started discussions with suppliers to reorganize manufacturing and purchasing planning and optimize payment terms.2022 guidanceIn a high-inflation environment marked by rising raw material prices as well as persistent supply chain bottlenecks  the Group revised its guidance on May 26. Today  despite the ongoing challenging environment and thanks in part to our H2 2022 action plan  we confirm our updated full-year 2022 objectives:Top line decrease in the mid-single digit rangeAn EBIT margin of 5% or aboveFCF of EUR 10 million to 30 millionReduction of the Group’s carbon intensity: CO2 neutrality for scopes 1 and 2Dividend payout ratio of 30% to 40%.New share buyback program and share cancellationDespite the current environment  the Group remains fully confident in the fundamental strength of its business model and the relevance of its strategic choices. The Board of directors and the management team believe the Group’s current market value is not an accurate reflection of the business’s value creation and cash generation potential. As a result  utilizing the Group’s solid balance sheet  Maisons du Monde is today opportunistically launching a new share buyback program. The Group believes this buyback is an attractive investment opportunity for the benefit of its long-term shareholders.Under this new plan  the Group intends to repurchase up to 10% of its outstanding shares at market price over a period of several months beginning 29 July 2022. This program will be carried out within the limits of the authorization granted to purchase shares  as per the 18th resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 31 May 2022. A description of this share buyback program is available on the Group's website: www.corporate.maisonsdumonde.com.The shares acquired under this new buyback program are intended to be cancelled to reduce the share capital of Maisons du Monde as soon as the program is completed.Furthermore  the Board of Directors yesterday decided to cancel 1 953 797 of the treasury shares (or 4.3% of total shares) it acquired under the previous share buyback program launched in November 2021 and fully completed in March 2022. The cancellation will be effective 29 July 2022. As a result  the Group’s share capital will amount to EUR 140.3 million  comprised of 43 288 097 shares.***Conference call for investors and analystsDate: 28 July 2022 at 09.00 CESTSpeakers: Julie Walbaum.

They mainly exclude:customer contribution to delivery costs  revenue for logistics services provided to third parties  andfranchise revenue.The Group uses the metric of “Sales” rather than “Total revenue” to calculate growth at constant perimeter  like-for-like growth  gross margin  EBITDA margin and EBIT margin.Like-for-like sales (LFL) growth: Represents the percentage change in sales from the Group’s retail stores  websites and B2B activities  net of product returns between one financial period (n) and the comparable preceding financial period (n-1)  excluding changes in sales attributable to stores that opened or were closed during either of the comparable periods. Sales attributable to stores that closed temporarily for refurbishment during any of the periods are included.Gross margin: Is defined as sales minus cost of sales. Gross margin is also expressed as a percentage of Sales.EBITDA: Is defined as current operating profit  excluding:depreciation  amortization  and allowance for provisions and  the change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.The EBITDA margin is calculated as EBITDA divided by Sales.LTM EBITDA: Last twelve months EBITDA.EBIT: Is defined as EBITDA minus depreciation  amortization  and allowance for provisions. The EBIT margin is calculated as EBIT divided by Sales.Net debt: Is defined as the Group’s finance leases  convertible bond (“OCEANE”)  unsecured term loan  unsecured revolving credit facilities  the French state guaranteed term loan  short- and long-term rental  deposits and bank borrowings  net of cash and cash equivalents.Leverage ratio: Is defined as net debt less finance leases divided by LTM EBITDA.Free cash flow: Is defined as net cash from operating activities less the sum of capital expenditures (capital outlays for property  plant and equipment)  intangible and other non-current assets  change in debt on fixed assets  proceeds from disposal of non-current assets and reduction of and interest on rental debt.Endnotes1 LFL: Like for like – Represents the percentage change in sales from the Group’s retail stores  websites and B2B activities  net of product returns between one financial period (N) and the comparable preceding financial period (N-1)  excluding changes in sales attributable to stores that opened or were closed during either of the comparable periods. Sales attributable to stores that closed temporarily for refurbishment during any of the periods are included.2 Including other borrowings  deposits & guarantees and banks overdrafts.3 Leverage: Net debt divided by LTM (Last twelve months) EBITDA2 Defined as merchandise sales as well as other commissions and services less franchise and promotional sales (€2.1 mn in 1H22 and €2.5 mn in 1H21).3 Gross margin (sales less cost of sales) is a non-IFRS financial metric and is presented here for informational purposes only.6 Excluding franchise stores.Attachment",neutral,0.05,0.92,0.03,mixed,0.57,0.2,0.23,True,English,"['MAISONS DU', 'FIRST-HALF 2022 RESULTS', 'MONDE', '63% SG&A cost mitigation plan', 'active working capital optimization program', 'EUR 20 million cost containment measures', 'SG&A action plans', 'new distribution center investment', 'new share buyback plan', 'EUR 20 million Capex prioritization', 'First Half Key Figures', 'Top 5 global Love Brand', 'H1 22 key c ommercial', 'cash savings action plan', 'First-half free cash flow', 'shipment optimization plan', 'comprehensive action plan', 'FY 2022 objectives Cost', 'challenging global environment', 'logistics efficiency programs', 'strong balance sheet', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'challenging market conditions', 'differentiated business model', 'Total active customers', 'influencer Lisa Gachet', 'nature decoration items', 'current share price', 'current stock price', 'FY22 updated guidance', 'unaudited consolidated results', 'low consumer confidence', 'sustainable decoration products', 'inspiring product catalog', 'Maisons du Monde', 'Beautiful brand movement', 'sourcing lead time', 'Beautiful living spaces', '4.7% margin Gross margin', 'current business context', 'share capital', '5.4 million followers', 'FIRST-HALF 2022 RESULTS', 'current context', 'cash Initiatives', 'low visibility', 'full-year guidance', 'CSR objectives', 'sustainable offer', 'product categories', 'second half', 'product families', 'living brand', 'First-half GMV', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'GM level', 'rising inflation', 'intrinsic value', 'Euronext Paris', 'European leader', 'affordable home', 'six months', 'Julie Walbaum', 'high inflation', 'longer view', 'continued success', 'collectioning, procurement', 'short-term profitability', 'strategic agenda', 'fundamental strength', 'strategic choices', 'best use', 'Net Income', 'Basic EPS', 'Net debt', 'customer dynamics', 'Instagram community', 'broader agenda', 'Major achievements', 'Women initiative', 'gender equality', 'durable home', 'limited-edition collection', 'Kids collection', 'outdoor furniture', 'First-half EBIT', 'online GMV', 'first-half performance', 'inventory rebuild', 'early July', 'CSR commitment', 'Online sales', 'Store sales', 'Group GMV', 'H1 sales', '28 July', 'Launch', 'Modani', 'costs', 'revenues', 'COGS', 'impact', 'company', 'NANTES', '07:00 CEST', 'MDM', 'inspirational', 'board', '3 years', 'marketplace', 'effect', 'Story', 'teams', 'opening', 'schedule', 'last', 'Change', 'Leverage', 'evelopments', 'The', '6% yoy', '30 June', 'project', 'Deployment', 'Good', 'donations', 'NGOs', 'need', 'Talkwalker', 'Hootsuite', 'recognition', 'sustainability', 'Collections', 'mission', 'desirable', '30 creative', 'parallel', 'terms', 'tableware', 'garden', '2019', '€']",2022-07-28,2022-07-29,finance.yahoo.com

Market trends  driven by continued underinvestment in exploration and production and intensified by elevated energy security concerns  continue to support our view of a multi-year upcycle with increased spending from all clients  as they progressively refocus on exploration to meet future energy demand. The development of our Beyond the Core businesses continues to make good progress with encouraging commercial wins  successful pilots  and recent acquisition of Geocomp and successful bidding to acquire ION Geophysical Corporation’s software business that are reinforcing and expanding the portfolio of our Sensing and Monitoring business. In an inflationary market environment  the business case for our high–end technology  which enables higher efficiency for our clients  becomes even stronger  and I am enthusiastic about the opportunities in front of us.”Q2 2022: A strong quarter for Data  Digital and Energy TransitionIFRS figures : revenue at $228m  EBITDAs at $114m  OPINC at $59mSegment revenue at $240m  up 66% proforma* year-on-year and up 57% sequentially Geoscience at $70m  up 16% proforma* year-on-year.

The growth was led by continued buoyant market conditions in Metals & Minerals (up 15.2% organically) as well as improving trends in the Oil & Petrochemicals segment.more than half of the portfolio (Marine & Offshore  Buildings & Infrastructure  Certification and Consumer Products Services) grew at 4.3% organically on average. Marine & Offshore (up 6.0%) was fueled by solid activity levels in both in-service activity and the new-build activity which continued to benefit from decarbonization trends. Buildings & Infrastructure recorded an increase of 3.8% in the first half of the year as it benefited notably from strong momentum across its Americas platform while the second quarter was impacted by the lockdown measures implemented across many cities in China. Certification grew 4.1% fueled by the rising demand for Sustainability and ESG-driven services. Lastly  Consumer Products Services delivered very healthy revenue growth (up 4.3% organically in H1  with a 4.0% increase maintained in Q2) driven by its South East and Southern Asian operations which offset the disruption caused by the lockdown in China in the second quarter of the year.Disciplined and selective bolt-on M&A in the first half of 2022During the first half of 2022  Bureau Veritas continued to pursue its bolt-on M&A  completing two transactions in strategic areas  representing circa EUR 34 million in annualized revenue (or 0.7% of 2021 Group revenue). This complements the acquisition of PreScience completed on December 29  2021.Consumer Products ServicesAdvanced Testing Laboratory (ATL)Headquartered in Cincinnati  Ohio  Advanced Testing Laboratory (ATL) is a leader in scientific sourcing services for the North American Consumer Healthcare Products  Cosmetics & Personal Care and Medical Device markets. Its services span the entire product life cycle  from research and development to substance and product qualification to manufacturing. Services include Analytical Chemistry  Engineering  Life Science  Product Performance  Product Safety & Regulatory  Quality Assurance and Regulatory Compliance. With the acquisition of ATL  Bureau Veritas is accelerating the diversification of the Consumer Products Services division into new markets and services models by expanding its footprint in North America. This major step enables the Group to enter the fast-growing Consumer Healthcare market.AMSfashionAMSfashion is an expert in sustainability  quality and conformity services for the fashion industry. It offers advanced analytical solutions for the textile and footwear sectors  and extensive experience in cosmetics analysis. It supports brands and suppliers of all sizes in verifying the quality and conformity of products and materials against customer and regulatory requirements. This contributes to a reduction in claims  penalties  product recalls  customs blockages and shipment delays. The acquisition strengthens Bureau Veritas’ presence in Iberia  a key hub for the expansion of its Consumer Products Services business  supporting the continuing growth in near shoring from South Europe and Africa. This also enables the Group to support European Retailers and Brands looking to improve their supply chain reliability and resilience.ANNUALIZED REVENUE COUNTRY DATE FIELD OF EXPERTISE Buildings & Infrastructure PreScience c.

PreScience has been consolidated in Bureau Veritas books since January 1  2022.The pipeline of opportunities is healthy  and the Group will continue to deploy a very selective bolt-on acquisitions strategy  in targeted areas (notably Buildings & Infrastructure  Consumer Products Services  Sustainability Assurance  renewable energy and cybersecurity) and geographies (North America notably).IMPACT OF THE CHINESE LOCKDOWNS IN THE SECOND QUARTERFollowing the Chinese government’s “zero covid policy”  the Group has been facing selective lockdowns in several cities across the country since the end of March 2022.Given its strong exposure to China (c.15% of total revenue in H1 2022)  the lockdown measures had a material impact on performance in the second quarter of 2022. The impact varied however by business:in Consumer Products Services  which makes up half of the Group’s Chinese revenues  Bureau Veritas was proactive and adapted to the constraints. The impact in Q2 was thereby contained as the teams were able to divert samples from one location to another across the country or outside of China to the Group’s South Asia testing capabilities (Vietnam  Bangladesh  India and Sri Lanka). All the Group’s labs reopened and were fully back to normal by the end of June 2022.in Buildings & Infrastructure (representing roughly 30% of China’s revenue  solely focused on infrastructure assets in the transportation field and energy)  construction sites were shut down for a few weeks (up to eight weeks) in areas where mobility restrictions were imposed (Shanghai and Shenzhen notably). Once the mobility restrictions had been removed  the Group operated in a stop & go situation with sites required to shut down as soon as the slightest suspicion of Covid arose. Since mid-June  the construction sites have gradually restarted  and the Group expects to recover from Q3 2022 onwards.LIMITED EXPOSURE TO THE RUSSIA/UKRAINE ARThe Group generated c.1% of its Group consolidated revenue in 2021 with Russia and Ukraine together  mainly related to commodities markets.In Ukraine (0.3% of Group revenue)  the Group has put its people’s safety at the heart of crisis management. Since the start of the war  Bureau Veritas has stopped operating while ensuring the payment of its employees’ salaries.In Russia (0.8% of Group revenue)  the Group has reduced its activities to essential services in quality  health & safety  environmental protection and social responsibility to domestic and international companies. Since the beginning of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine  Bureau Veritas has regularly assessed and monitored its position in Russia. As of this date  the Group has downsized its business in this country in the sectors where the company was previously operating i.e.  Marine  Aeronautics and Commodities. The Group will continue to downsize its operations and presence as the situation evolves.Overall  the Group considers that most of its activities are not materially impacted by the current war in Ukraine.A SOLID PRICE DISCIPLINEIn the current inflationary environment  as a service company  Bureau Veritas is mainly impacted by wage inflation. The Group has overall good traction on pricing with variations across sectors and geographies: price realization is more favorable in the mass market and in highly regulated activities but more complex with a delayed impact for multi-year and large contracts.SOLID FINANCIAL POSITIONAt the end of June 2022  the Group's adjusted net financial debt increased compared with the level at December 31  2021. The Group has a solid financial structure with the bulk of its maturities beyond 2024.At the end of the first half of 2022  Bureau Veritas had EUR 1.4 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and EUR 600 million in undrawn committed credit lines.At June 30  2022  the adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio was further reduced to 1.10x (from 1.30x last year) and the EBITDA/consolidated net financial expense ratio was 16.67x.The average maturity of the Group’s financial debt was 3.8 years with a blended average cost of funds over the half year of 2.5% excluding IFRS 16 impact (compared with 2.4% in the first half of 2021 excluding the impact of IFRS 16).In July 2022  Bureau Veritas decided to cancel 1 915 000 shares (0.4% of the capital) which had been bought back between April and June 2022 under the share buyback program authorized by the AGM of June 25  2021.Bureau Veritas shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend for the 2021 financial yearAt the Bureau Veritas Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting  shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of EUR0.53 per share for the 2021 financial year (3rd resolution  approved at 99.98%)  paid in cash on July 7  2022BUREAU VERITAS IS COMMITTED TO ITS EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCECorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) key indicatorsUNITED NATIONS’SDGS H1 2022 FY 2021 2025 target SOCIAL & HUMAN CAPITAL Total Accident Rate (TAR) 2 #3 0.24 0.27 0.26 Proportion of women in leadership positions3 #5 29.2% 26.5% 35.0% Number of learning hours per employee (per year) 4 #8 14.2 29.9 35.0 ENVIRONMENT CO 2 emissions per employee (tons per year) 5 #13 2.38 2.49 2.00 GOVERNANCE Proportion of employees trained to the Code of Ethics #16 95.9% 95.8% 99.0%CSR key initiatives and awards in first half 2022Over the first half 2022  several CSR-related actions and initiatives were implemented:Environ m ent : Eco-efficiency assessments have been conducted in some of Bureau Veritas’ buildings and offices in Africa and solar panels were installed on the roofs of several laboratories (Nigeria  South Africa  Ivory Coast) within the framework of direct Power Purchase Agreement’s (PPA); Initiatives have been implemented to reduce and offset CO 2 emissions as part of the deployment of Earth Day (compensation programs through afforestation and reforestation); Some contracts were renegotiated to enable access to renewable energy for some of Bureau Veritas’ large labs across the World;Safety : Dedicated campaigns and training sessions were rolled out (e.g. “2 minutes for my Safety” training) as part of the World Day for Safety & Health at Work celebrations; Bureau Veritas provided support to its employees and their family members in Ukraine through the supply of transport  accommodation  and access to essential goods and services  as well as through donations given by the Group and by its employees; Support was also provided to the employees and families facing Covid-19 lockdown measures in China and Hong Kong in Q2 2022 (access to goods  assistance programs);Social : Improvements and implementation of leadership development programs dedicated to high potential women across all Operating Groups; Development and implementation of an employee on-boarding and off-boarding survey as part of the Group's overall employee engagement assessment; Bureau Veritas became a signatory of the United Nations Women’s Empowerment Principles;Awards:Bureau Veritas received several CSR-related awards in the first-half of 2022:The Economic Times has recognized Bureau Veritas as one of the best Organizations for Women for 2022.

The rest of the portfolio grew steadily  with Marine & Offshore  Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) Certification and Consumer Products Services  up from 3.8% to 6.0% organically.By geography  Americas was the best performing region (27% of revenue; up 16.4% organically)  led by a 9.8% increase in North America (driven by Buildings & Infrastructure) and by a 28.4% increase in Latin America (led by Brazil notably). Europe (34% of revenue; up 2.9% organically) was primarily led by strong growth in Italy and the Netherlands. Business in Asia Pacific (30% of revenue; up 1.9% organically) was impacted by the lockdown measures in China (concentrated in Q2) while double digit growth was delivered in Southern Asia (led by India) and high single digit growth in Australia. Finally  Africa and the Middle East (9% of revenue)  strongly outperformed the rest of the Group with organic revenue growth of 12.3%  essentially driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 0.4%  reflecting bolt-on acquisitions realized in the past few quarters.Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of 4.5% (of which 5.6% in Q2)  mainly due to the appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries’ currencies.Adjusted operating profit up 8.7% to EUR 410.9 millionAdjusted operating profit increased by 8.7% to EUR 410.9 million; the half-year 2022 adjusted operating margin decreased by 38 basis points to 15.3%  including a 4-basis-point positive impact from foreign exchange and a 2-basis-point positive impact from scope. It was mainly attributed to the impact from the lockdowns occurred in China in the second quarter.CHANGE IN ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN IN PERCENTAGE AND BASIS POINTS H1 2021 adjusted operating margin 15.6% Organic change (44)bps Organic adjusted operating margin 15.2% Scope +2bps Constant currency adjusted operating margin 15.2% Currency +4bps H1 2022 adjusted operating margin 15.3%The revenue improvement and operating leverage drove organic margins higher in Marine & Offshore and in Agri Food & Commodities.The businesses that saw the biggest margin decline came from Buildings & Infrastructure and to some extent Consumer Products services  having suffered the most from the lockdowns in China in Q2. Together  they represented the bulk of the organic decrease in the Group’s margin in the first half of 2022.Other operating expenses slightly increased to EUR 35.7 million versus EUR 32.1 million in the first half of 2021. These include:EUR 22.0 million in amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (down from EUR 28.9 million in H1 2021);EUR 3.7 million in write-offs of non-current assets related to the Agri Food & Commodities and Industry businesses;EUR 8.9 million in restructuring costs  relating chiefly to Industry andcommodities-related activities (EUR 4.4 million in H1 2021);EUR 1.1 million in net losses on disposals and acquisitions (net gain of EUR 4.1 million in H1 2021).Operating profit totaled EUR 375.2 million  up 8.4% from EUR 346.1 million in the first half of 2021.Adjusted EPS of EUR 0.55  up 15.2% year on yearNet financial expense amounted to EUR 29.5 million in the first half of 2022  compared with EUR 36.9 million in the same period one year earlier.The slight increase in net finance costs to EUR 38.9 million in H1 2022 (compared with EUR 37.6 million in H1 2021) is mainly attributable to the impact of the appreciation of the US dollar on the interest on the US Private Placements denominated in US dollars.The Group posted foreign exchange gains of EUR 14.2 million in H1 2022 owing to the appreciation of the US dollar and the euro against most emerging market currencies (foreign exchange gains of EUR 2.4 million in H1 2021). The interest cost on pension plans remained nearly stable at EUR 0.8 million in H1 2022 compared with EUR 0.7 million in H1 2021.Income tax expense totaled EUR 111.1 million in H1 2022  compared with EUR 97.1 million in H1 2021.This represents an effective tax rate (ETR) of 32.1% for the period  compared with a 31.4% in H1 2021.The adjusted effective tax rate was 31.3%  down 0.9 percentage points compared to the first half of 2021. It corresponds to the effective tax rate adjusted for the tax effect of adjustment items. The decline is mainly due to the lower tax rate in France and the increase in pre-tax income compared with taxes not calculated on taxable income  notably withholding taxes and value-added taxes in France and Italy.Attributable net profit for the period was EUR 225.2 million  versus a EUR 196.9 million in H1 2021.Earnings per share (EPS) stood at EUR 0.50 versus EUR 0.44 in H1 2021.Adjusted attributable net profit totaled EUR 248.6 million  up 15.8% versus EUR 214.7 million in H1 2021.Adjusted EPS stood at EUR 0.55  a 15.2% increase versus H1 2021 (EUR 0.48 per share).Solid Free cash flow at EUR 129.9 million despite the Chinese situationHalf-year 2022 operating cash flow decreased by 35.2% to EUR 213.0 million versus EUR 328.9 million in H1 2021. The increase in profit before tax was largely offset by a strong working capital requirement outflow of EUR 176.7 million  compared to a EUR 68.5 million outflow the previous year. The change is due to the strong growth delivered in the second quarter (+11.0% overall) and the temporary impact of the invoice settlement delays triggered by the Chinese lockdowns.Working capital requirement (WCR) stood at EUR 517.2 million at June 30  2022  compared withEUR 367.2 million at June 30  2021. As a percentage of revenue  WCR increased by 220 basis points to 9.8%  compared to 7.6% in H1 2021.Purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals (Net Capex)  amounted to EUR 52.0 million in the first half of 2022  on a par with the H1 2021 figure of EUR 52.6 million. This showed disciplined control over the Group’s net capex-to-revenue ratio at 1.9% (focusing on maintenance essentially)  down slightly on H1 2021 (2.2%).Free cash flow (operating cash flow after tax  interest expenses and capex) wasEUR 129.9 million  compared to EUR 228.9 million in H1 2021  down 43.2% year on year. On an organic basis  free cash flow reached EUR 124.7 million.CHANGE IN FREE CASH FLOW IN EUR MILLIONS Free cash flow at June 30  2021 228.9 Organic change (104.2) Organic free cash flow 124.7 Scope 2.0 Free cash flow at constant currency 126.7 Currency 3.2 Free cash flow at June 30  2022 129.9At June 30  2022  adjusted net financial debt was EUR 1 088.8 million  i.e. 1.10 trailingtwelve-month EBITDA as defined in the calculation of the bank covenant  compared with 1.30x at December 31  2021. The increase in adjusted net financial debt of EUR 37.4 million versusDecember 31  2021 (EUR 1 051.4 million) reflects:Free cash flow of EUR 129.9 million;Dividend payments totaling EUR 9.8 million corresponding mainly to dividends paid tonon-controlling interests and withholding taxes on intra-group dividends;Acquisitions (net) and repayment of amounts owed to shareholders  accounting for EUR 45.7 million;Lease payments (related to the application of IFRS 16)  accounting for EUR 61.1 million;Share buyback  accounting for EUR50.8 million;Other items that decreased the Group's debt by EUR 1.3 million.2022 OUTLOOK CONFIRMEDBased on a solid sales pipeline around the Group’s diversified portfolio and the significant growth opportunities related to its sustainability range of services and solutions  and assuming there are no new Covid-19 lockdowns in its main countries of operation  Bureau Veritas still expects for the full year 2022 to:Achieve mid-single-digit organic revenue growth;Improve the adjusted operating margin;Generate sustained strong cash flow  with a cash conversion above 90%.H1 2022 BUSINESS REVIEWMARINE & OFFSHOREIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 204.5 189.2 +8.1% +6.0% - +2.1% Adjusted Operating Profit 50.1 44.4 +12.9% Adjusted Operating Margin 24.5% 23.5% +106 +83 - +23The Marine & Offshore business recorded solid 6.0% organic revenue growth in the first half of 2022.In the second quarter  organic revenue was up 5.6%.The half-year organic performance results mainly from:Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in New Construction (40% of divisional revenue)  primarily fueled by North Asia  Europe (primarily Greece) and Africa. This was cushioned by the lockdowns in China during the second quarter.Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in the Core In-service activity (45% of divisional revenue)  which benefited from the favorable timing of inspections by ship owners  an increased level of occasional surveys  combined with some price increases. At end-June  the fleet classified by Bureau Veritas comprised 11 533 ships  representing 140.1 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT)  stable year on year (based on the number of ships).High single-digit organic revenue growth for Services (15% of divisional revenue  including Offshore)  was driven by a combination of strong commercial development for non-classification services (including consulting services related to energy efficiency stimulated by a context of high oil prices) and increased demand for risk assessment services in the Offshore Oil & Gas market. [The first half of 2022 was marked by an increase in projects in the wind energy sector  both for onshore and offshore wind turbines].The new build market remained well oriented in the first half of the year. Bureau Veritas new orders reached 4.8 million gross tons in June 2022  a stable level compared to the prior-year period. As a result  the order book stood at 18 million gross tons at the end of the quarter  up 17.9% year on year compared to 16.3 million gross tons in December 2021. It is composed of LNG fueled ships  container ships and specialized vessels.Marine & Offshore continued to focus on efficiency levers through digitalization and high added-value services (including digital twin  mobility surveyor at yard  machinery maintenance portal). In Q2  the Group introduced the use of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model for corrosion detection  which will be deployed for augmented surveys in the second half of the year.Adjusted operating margin for the half year improved by 106 basis points to 24.5% on a reported basis compared to H1 2021  positively impacted by foreign exchange effects (23 basis points). Organically  it rose by 83 basis points  benefiting from operating leverage  a positive mix and operational excellence.Sustainability achievementsThe Group continued to address the challenges of sustainability and the energy transition by providing rules and guidelines on the safety  risk and performance requirements for innovation in future fuels and propulsion systems. The Group supported its customers in complying with environmental regulations  implementing sustainable solutions on board  and measuring progress in decarbonization.In the second quarter of 2022  the Group carried out a study aiming at de-risking the use of ammonia as a marine fuel  with a specific focus on leak mitigation and treatment  in collaboration with TotalEnergies. Ammonia is one of the main zero-carbon fuel options currently envisioned by shipping as the industry seeks to decarbonise.AGRI-FOOD & COMMODITIESIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 588.0 517.6 +13.6% +8.6% (0.3)% +5.3% Adjusted Operating Profit 76.2 66.1 +15.3% Adjusted Operating Margin 13.0% 12.8% +20 +20 +2 (2)The Agri-Food & Commodities business recorded 8.6% organic revenue growth in the first half of 2022  led by strong markets for Metal & Minerals and Government services  alongside an improvement in the Oil & Petrochemicals segment. In Q2  Group organic revenue increased by 7.9%.The Oil & Petrochemicals segment (O&P  30% of divisional revenue) delivered mid-single-digit organic growth overall. The O&P Trade market benefited from increased activity in a context of higher fuel consumption  notably for aviation fuel/gasoline. All regions grew apart from Europe  which remained penalized by weak market conditions and the impact of the Russia/Ukraine war  which triggered changes in the routes for trade. Strong growth was achieved in the Middle East and Africa alongside robust growth in both the Americas and Asia. Throughout the first half  Bureau Veritas continued to further reposition its portfolio towards new services (such as laboratory outsourcing) and value-added segments across many geographies. These include sustainability-driven solutions such as Oil Condition Monitoring (OCM)  Carbon 14 traceability for Biofuels  Sustainable Aviation Fuel or a fuel marking program.The Metals & Minerals segment (M&M  33% of divisional revenue) achieved double-digit organic growth overall  across the entire value chain. Upstream (two-thirds of M&M) continued to record strong growth (up 16.7% organically)  across most geographies  led by the Group’s key hubs (Australia  Canada and Latin America). It benefited from a sustained high level of exploration drilling activity across all the major commodities (with gold  copper  coal and iron ore leading the way)  a growing backlog of samples and the continuing success of the Group’s on-site laboratories strategy with several important wins in the period (including copper mines in Chile and Peru  an iron ore mine in Chile and a gold mine in Australia). Trade activities recorded double digit organic revenue growth. It was fueled by the main metals  with strong trade volumes for copper  iron ore and coal across all geographies. Copper demand remained strong  notably driven by electrification trends in several economies  while coal was in high demand as an energy source.Agri-Food (22% of divisional revenue) reported positive organic revenue growth in the first half  led by Agricultural products. The agricultural inspection activities grew strongly  led by Latin America and Brazil notably  which benefited from a very early harvest campaign for soybeans and corn as well as an extension of services (transgenic testing). In Europe  business was impacted by the Russia/Ukraine war on Black Sea exports. The Food business saw better resilience of testing activities versus inspection; it reflected a contrasted situation by geography: strong growth in the Middle East and Africa alongside the US (driven by new greenfield labs opening)  but weak growth in Canada (slow restart following the cyber-attack in Q4 2021) and in Asia Pacific (mobility restriction measures). In Australia  which mainly relies on dairy products  business was hampered by reduced Chinese demand for infant milk formula as well as the closure of Food producers’ plants in Victoria during the summer break.Government services (15% of divisional revenue) achieved double-digit organic growth in the first half (of which an 11% increase in the second quarter). Strong growth was delivered in Africa led by the strong development of VOC (Verification of Conformity) in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)  Nigeria  Zimbabwe  Tanzania  Ghana  and Single Window (DRC) contracts. This segment also benefited from the increased value of inspected goods on existing contracts  supported by high commodities prices.The adjusted operating margin for the Agri-Food & Commodities business increased to 13.0%  up 20 basis points compared to last year. This was led by a topline recovery and a positive business mix.Sustainability achievementsCompanies and organizations are stepping up their efforts to meet ambitious decarbonization targets set by the Paris Agreements. In Q2  Bureau Veritas and Climate Neutral Commodity (CNC) joined forces to support their clients as they took action to accelerate the energy and ecological transitions. To do this  CNC defined the first ever certification standard for carbon-neutral transactions and services in the raw materials industry and BV will be the preferred verification body to validate these commodities.INDUSTRYIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 564.3 487.2 +15.8% +10.8% (0.5)% +5.5% Adjusted Operating Profit 62.2 53.7 +15.8% Adjusted Operating Margin 11.0% 11.0% (1) (22) +13 +8Industry was the best performing business within the Group’s portfolio in the first half of 2022 with organic growth of 10.8%  including 9.8% growth in the second quarter.By geography  most regions delivered strong growth in H1 with Latin America and the Middle East leading the way alongside Asia Pacific. Growth was more moderate in both the US and in Europe.By market  Power & Utilities (14% of divisional revenue) continued to be a key driver of growth for the portfolio with a double-digit organic performance during the half year (including Q2). Growth was driven mainly by Latin America (Chile and Colombia) thanks to the ramp-up of large contract wins with various Power Distribution clients  volume increases on existing contracts and price renegotiation. Europe also contributed to the growth led by France  the UK and Spain (power generation). Similarly  France and the UK benefited from high activity levels in nuclear power plants (the EPR project at Flamanville 3 for France).In renewable power generation (solar  wind  hydrogen)  the opportunities remained significant  backed by a strong sales pipeline. Several contracts were awarded during the first half  including Broad Reach Power which owns a 21-gigawatt portfolio of utility scale solar  wind and energy storage projects in the Western part of the United States. Bureau Veritas will provide Project Management services during the design and construction phases of six Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Projects in Texas. Since the beginning of the year  the Group’s renewable energy services now exceed Oil & Gas capex projects in terms of revenues.The Oil & Gas segment (33% of divisional revenue) experienced double-digit organic revenue growth benefiting from the combination of strong sales development  the restart of many projects triggered by rising oil prices and favorable comparables. Opex-related activities (representing two-thirds of the Oil & Gas business) maintained a double-digit pace and were essentially driven by Latin America (with Brazil and Argentina leading the way for both onshore and offshore services)  and the Middle East and Europe (led by Spain). Capex-related activities  including Procurement Services  grew mid-single digit organically  essentially attributable to the US (with drilling activity in full speed)  Asia and the Middle East (with projects resuming in the UEA). As of today  the share of Oil & Gas Capex in Group revenue totaled 2%.Elsewhere  the aerospace business in relation to Russia was stopped and thus impacted the revenue stream while the Automotive business (5% of divisional revenue) delivered a stable performance still impacted by supply chain disruption.Adjusted operating margin for the half year was 11.0%  broadly stable year on year (with the slight margin decline offset by a positive scope effect). It is attributable to mobilization costs on large Opex contracts.Sustainability achievementsThrough the BV Green Line of services and solutions dedicated to Sustainability  the Group is supporting its clients notably in the transition towards a better use of natural resources  the reduction of their carbon footprint  and the promotion of more sustainable practices. In the second quarter of 2022  Bureau Veritas developed a voluntary certification framework for assessing the carbon footprint of Hydrogen production facilities. In the absence of internationally recognized statutory certification schemes  this scheme applies as an independent framework to assist stakeholders in the Hydrogen value chain to assess the environmental impact of different Hydrogen production pathways.Bureau Veritas also assisted ORLEN Group  the largest oil & gas company in Central Europe  to calculate its carbon footprint in accordance with the latest recommendations and internationally recognized standards. Carbon footprint inventory will make it possible to quantify key sources of GHG emissions of the company and its entire value chain. It will support the development of effective decarbonization strategies.BUILDINGS & INFRASTRUCTUREIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 775.9 709.2 +9.4% +3.8% +1.6% +4.0% Adjusted Operating Profit 103.9 104.1 (0.2)% Adjusted Operating Margin 13.4% 14.7% (130) (135) (2) +7The Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) business achieved solid organic growth of 3.8% in the first half of 2022  primarily fueled by the Americas and by the Middle East. In Q2  revenue grew 0.7% on an organic basis as it reflects the impact from the Covid-19 related shutdowns across several cities in China.By service  Construction-related activities (54% of divisional revenue) grew faster than Buildings In-service activities benefiting from strong dynamics for new projects in the Americas and the Middle East.The Americas (26% of divisional revenue) was the best performing region  led by a 15.2% increase in the United States and by a stellar performance in Latin America (led by Brazil notably). In the US  where the Group has built its platform over the past few years  the growth drivers are numerous and include i) large project management assistance and transactional activity for Opex-related services across most sectors (Retail essentially); ii) sustained strong dynamics for data center commissioning services to support the increase in remote workforces; iii) increasing revenue for the business related to Electrical Vehicle Charging stations (EVCS). Through the acquisition of PreScience  the Group has positioned itself on the very attractive transportation infrastructure market. In Latin America  business benefited from the very strong recovery of Brazil (fueled by commercial development for both Opex and Capex services) alongside strong trends in both Argentina and Colombia.In Europe (52% of divisional revenue)  growth was moderate overall. A strong performance was delivered in both Italy (ramp-up of large contract wins on the motorway network) and the Netherlands (Opex led) alongside good growth in Spain. France  the region’s largest contributor (41% of divisional revenue) delivered organic revenue growth. This was driven by the In-service activity (around three quarters of the French business) with the delivery of a solid backlog as well as by the continuing strong performance of Bureau Veritas Solutions (technical assistance; consulting services) led by the increase in headcount. The growth of capex-related works remained muted in a declining new build market. The pipeline of sales related to the EU Green Deal (including the one in France and the upcoming 2024 Olympic Games in France) continued to grow with opportunities mainly focused on energy efficiency programs.The Asia Pacific region (19% of divisional revenue) recorded a high-single digit organic revenue decrease (including a double digit decrease in Q2) with a contrasted situation by country. In China  business was severely impacted by the Covid-19 situation (down c. 30% organically in Q2)  with construction sites fully stopped for up to eight weeks  in areas where lockdowns had been imposed (Shanghai  Shenzhen notably). Once the mobility restrictions had been lifted  the Group operated in a stop & go situation with sites required to shut down as soon as the slightest suspicion of Covid arose. This created inefficiencies  which materially impacted operations. Since mid-June  the construction sites have gradually restarted  and a recovery is expected from Q3 2022 onwards. Elsewhere  business recovered strongly in India as lockdown measures were lifted  while Japan improved  led by code compliance services.Lastly  in the Middle East & Africa region (3% of divisional revenue)  the Group experienced very strong growth primarily led by Saudi Arabia  and by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) which continued to benefit from the development of numerous projects supported by the rebound in oil prices. In Saudi Arabia  for instance  the Group is involved in the NEOM project  a smart city that will be powered by renewable energy.Adjusted operating margin for the half year declined by 135 basis points to 13.4% from 14.7% in the prior year. This was primarily attributed to the impact of the lockdowns in China and a mix effect.Sustainability achievementsIn the second quarter of 2022  the Group continued to accompany owners/concessionaires of buildings and infrastructure with services for energy efficiency and carbon footprint monitoring. it supports notably asset managers towards the achievements of their Net Zero commitments.CERTIFICATIONIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 209.2 196.9 +6.2% +4.1% +0.2% +1.9% Adjusted Operating Profit 40.0 38.1 +4.9% Adjusted Operating Margin 19.1% 19.3% (26) (27) (6) +7The Certification business delivered solid organic growth of 4.1% in the first half of 2022 (including 4.0% in the second quarter)  against challenging comparables (year of recertification for several schemes related to QHSE and Transportation). This was supported by strong sales development  notably as regards Sustainability and robust price increases.Most geographies experienced solid organic growth. The Americas  Africa and the Middle East performed above the divisional average  fueled notably by stellar growth in Latin America (and Brazil in particular)  Asia was at a par (led by South & Southern Asian countries) while Europe grew below the average (primarily led by the UK and Italy). The countries that grew the most are those where the mix has been diversified in recent years (shift from traditional schemes towards new services)  as illustrated by Brazil  Australia  Thailand and some Eastern countries  which all saw high double-digit organic growth in the period.Within the Group’s portfolio  strong growth was achieved in Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability  Enterprise Risks (led by Cybersecurity and IT management systems solutions)  Food certification (fueled by food product certification  food safety and food sustainability) as well as in Training & Personnel services; conversely  business declined for QHSE and Transportation (reflecting fewer man days) due to tough comparables against the prior year linked to the year of recertification.During H1  Bureau Veritas Sustainability services grew by more than 16%  driven notably by buoyant demand for Greenhouse gas emission verification services related to Carbon footprint assessments  Offsetting & removals projects and Neutrality or net zero goals.Business continued to benefit from the overall rising client demand for more brand protection  traceability  and social responsibility commitments all along the supply chain. While a major part of the demand for ESG is on a voluntary basis  the regulatory framework is expected to be a growth driver in the medium-term. The EU corporate sustainability reporting directive (CSRD) currently sets the rules for European non-financial data reporting in a more standardized way and opens the sustainability assurance market to independent assurance service providers (IASP)  including TIC players. This will support growth from 2025 onwards.In the first half  the Group accelerated the commercial deployment of its new offering Clarity  from both a geographic and a business point of view. Clarity was launched in December 2021  and supports companies in managing their ESG strategy  measuring their performance and tracking their implementation. The commercial pipeline is well oriented and contract wins are now capturing a large range of sectors  including Food & Beverage  industry  Retail and Hospitality.The adjusted operating margin for the half year was a very healthy 19.1%  compared to 19.4% in the prior year. This reflects a 26-basis-point decrease against the record level  driven by strong operational leverage  price increases and tight cost management.Sustainability achievementsDuring the first half of 2022  Bureau Veritas was awarded numerous contracts in the Sustainability field. This ranged from a carbon footprint assessment for a Chinese ecommerce platform to a Clarity program with PepsiCo to review CSR metrics for a number of their internal sites. The Group also signed a long-term contract with a battery producer for electric vehicles to perform the Sustainability assessment of its supply chain and ensure full traceability along the value chain. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Bureau Veritas’ partner  Optel  to track and trace products along the entire chain through the use of digital tools.CONSUMER PRODUCTS SERVICESIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2022 H1 2021 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 351.5 318.3 +10.4% +4.3% +0.3% +5.8% Adjusted Operating Profit 78.5 71.8 +9.4% Adjusted Operating Margin 22.3% 22.6% (21) (19) (3) +1The Consumer Products Services business achieved organic revenue growth of 4.3% in the first half of 2022 including a Q2 organic growth of 4.0%  despite the various lockdowns implemented in China. This demonstrated the Group’s strong resilience and agility to operate in a complicated environment.By geography  all regions apart from China grew with a particularly strong organic revenue performance in the countries and regions where the Group has focused on diversification  namely in the Middle East & Africa (led by Turkey) alongside South Asia which delivered double digit growth (including India and Bangladesh) as well as South America. Europe grew above the divisional average  mainly fueled by Italy. Conversely business levels were impacted by lockdown measures in China and by capacity and logistics issues in Vietnam.Softlines (36% of divisional revenue) performed better than the divisional average  with similar growth in both quarters  and contrasted performances by country. In its largest Chinese operations  the Group has shown strong proactivity in adapting to the lockdowns. By leveraging its unique platform composed of a network of integrated laboratories across the country  the Group’s teams have been able to divert samples from locations under lockdown to others across the country or outside of China to the Group’s South Asia testing capabilities. All the laboratories in China reopened and were fully back to normal by end of June. In South Asia (India  Bangladesh and Sri Lanka essentially)  the Group delivered double digit growth. These countries benefited from both the short-term transfer of activity outside of China due to the regional Covid-19 shutdowns and from the continuing structural sourcing shift outside of China. Similarly  Turkey strongly benefited from nearshoring patterns from European retailers and saw a sharp increase in testing volumes. This underlines the importance of the Group’s geographic diversification strategy towards new production countries that are closer to the countries of consumption. The acquisition of AMSfashion reinforces the Group’s exposure in Iberia and strengthens its offering in Sustainability.Hardlines/Toys/Health & Beauty (31% of divisional revenue) performed below the divisional average. Small appliances and do-it-yourself products were impacted by the China lockdowns in the second quarter. South Korea benefited from its ongoing diversification into Cosmetics  Health & Beauty while Italy remained fueled by luxury products. Inspection and Audit services reported high single digit organic growth  as they continued to benefit from strong demand for Social & CSR audits across all geographies (including China where the audits were performed remotely). In Q2  the acquisition of US company ATL focusing on scientific sourcing services for the Consumer Healthcare Products  Cosmetics & Personal Care and Medical Device markets will enable the Group to accelerate its geographic diversification and move towards new services.Lastly  Technology6 (33% of divisional revenue) performed below the divisional average  with a double-digit organic performance in both electrical and electronics products and in Automotive (reliability testing and homologation services). The growth in Wireless Testing was impacted by the China’s Covid-19 shutdowns and by project delays in Korea. In Asia  5G-related products/infrastructure continued to show good momentum with the Group’s test platforms (Taiwan  South Korea) running at full capacity.Adjusted operating margin for the half year reached a very healthy 22.3% level (down 21 basis points  year-on-year)  as the negative impact from the lockdowns in China was mostly offset by the benefit of several cost actions  government subsidies and overall strong agility.Sustainability achievementsIn the first half of 2022  the Group was awarded a contract with a large European sportswear company to perform energy audits of its suppliers across many geographies; through these services  Bureau Veritas supports its clients in managing their ESG strategy and providing the proof of their commitments.PRESENTATION H1 2022 results will be presented on Thursday  July 28  2022  at 3:00 p.m. (Paris time) A video conference will be webcast live.

These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (“TIC”) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  or organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGINAdjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the performance of the business  excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the Group’s underlying intrinsic performance owing to their nature. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators  presented at Group level and for each business  are more representative of the operating performance in its industry.Adjusted operating profitAdjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following:amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions;impairment of goodwill;impairment and retirement of non-current assets;gains and losses on disposals of businesses and other income and expenses relating to acquisitions (fees and costs on acquisitions of businesses  contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses);restructuring costs.When an acquisition is carried out during the financial year  the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis.Since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may  in some cases  be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period  once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known.Organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit.Adjusted operating marginAdjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates  thereby  in the latter case  providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control.ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe effective tax rate (ETR) represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre-tax profit.The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre-tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition).ADJUSTED NET PROFITAdjusted attributable net profitAdjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition) and for the tax effect on adjustment items. Adjusted attributable net profit excludes non-controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations.Adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates  thereby providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control. The currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.Adjusted attributable net profit per shareAdjusted attributable net profit per share (adjusted EPS or earnings per share) is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares in the period.FREE CASH FLOWFree cash flow represents net cash generated from operating activities (operating cash flow)  adjusted for the following items:purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;interest paid.Net cash generated from operating activities is shown after income tax paid.Organic free cash flow represents free cash flow at constant scope and exchange rates over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of net cash generated from operating activities and free cash flow.FINANCIAL DEBTGross debtGross debt (or gross finance costs/financial debt) represents bank loans and borrowings plus bank overdrafts.Net debtNet debt (or net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents gross debt less cash and cash equivalents.

We expect the average gross debt coupon in FY22 to be approximately 4.0%. Net finance costs will continue to be impacted by any gains and losses related to the hedging of our share-based payment programs. Effective Tax Rates (ETR): We expect the normalized ETR in FY22 to be in the range of 28% to 30%  excluding any gains and losses relating to the hedging of our share-based payment programs.

Our cash outflow from financing activities amounted to 5 392 million USD in HY22  as compared to a cash outflow of 10 107 million USD in HY21. The decrease is primarily driven by lower debt redemption in HY22 compared to HY21.Our net debt decreased to 75.9 billion USD as of 30 June 2022 from 76.2 billion USD as of 31 December 2021.Our net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio was 3.86x as of 30 June 2022. Our optimal capital structure is a net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio of around 2x.We continue to proactively manage our debt portfolio. After redemptions in January 2022  94% of our bond portfolio holds a fixed-interest rate  44% is denominated in currencies other than USD and maturities are well-distributed across the next several years.In addition to a very comfortable debt maturity profile and strong cash flow generation  as of 30 June 2022  we had total liquidity of 17.0 billion USD  which consisted of 10.1 billion USD available under committed long-term credit facilities and 6.9 billion USD of cash  cash equivalents and short-term investments in debt securities less bank overdrafts.Figure 15. Terms and debt repayment schedule as of 30 June 2022 (billion USD)NotesTo facilitate the understanding of AB InBev’s underlying performance  the analyses of growth  including all comments in this press release  unless otherwise indicated  are based on organic growth and normalized numbers. In other words  financials are analyzed eliminating the impact of changes in currencies on translation of foreign operations  and scope changes. Scope changes represent the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  the start or termination of activities or the transfer of activities between segments  curtailment gains and losses and year over year changes in accounting estimates and other assumptions that management does not consider as part of the underlying performance of the business. All references per hectoliter (per hl) exclude US non-beer activities. References to the High End Company refer to a business unit made up of a portfolio of global  specialty and craft brands across more than 30 countries. Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a “normalized” basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. They are presented separately because they are important for the understanding of the underlying sustainable performance of the Company due to their size or nature. Normalized measures are additional measures used by management and should not replace the measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company’s performance. We are reporting the results from Argentina applying hyperinflation accounting  starting from the 3Q18 results release in which we accounted for the hyperinflation impact for the first nine months of 2018. The IFRS rules (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period. These impacts are excluded from organic calculations and are identified separately in the annexes within the column labeled “Hyperinflation restatement”. In HY22  we reported a negative impact on the profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev of 26 million USD. The impact in HY22 normalized EPS was -0.01 USD. Values in the figures and annexes may not add up  due to rounding. 2Q22 and HY22 EPS is based upon a weighted average of 2 012 million shares compared to a weighted average of 2 004 million shares for 2Q21 and HY21.Legal disclaimerThis release contains “forward-looking statements”.

(“ClearStream” or the ""Company"") (TSX: CSM) today announced its results for the six months ended June 30  2022. All amounts are in Canadian dollars and expressed in thousands of dollars unless otherwise noted.“EBITDAS” and “Adjusted EBITDAS” are not standard measures under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of these items and limitations of their use.“Activity levels in the second quarter reached record levels as we successfully completed 20 turnaround projects to build and maintain the integrity of our customers’ infrastructure. We onboarded over 2 000 employees to support these projects. We are proud of our employees who delivered these services in a safe and timely manner ” said Barry Card  Chief Executive Officer.“Revenues in the second quarter grew to $173 million  representing an increase of 79% from the second quarter of 2021. We have been working closely with our customers  suppliers and stakeholders to proactively manage inflationary cost pressures and material shortages in the first half of the year. This will continue to be a key focus in the second half of the year ” added Mr. Card.HIGHLIGHTSRevenues for the three months ended June 30  2022 were $173.2 million  representing an increase of $76.6 million or 79.3% from Q2 2021 and an increase of $63.3 million or 57.7% from Q1 2022.Gross profit for the three months ended June 30  2022 was $15.7 million  representing an increase of $5.3 million or 50.4% from Q2 2021 and an increase of $6.0 million or 61.2% from Q1 2022.Gross profit margin for the three months ended June 30  2022 was 9.1%  as compared to 10.8% in Q2 2021 and 8.9% in Q1 2022.Adjusted EBITDAS for the three months ended June 30  2022 were $7.9 million  representing an increase of $3.5 million or 77.8% from Q2 2021 and an increase of $4.9 million or 163.1% from Q1 2022.Adjusted EBITDAS margin for the three months ended June 30  2022 was 4.6%  same as Q2 2021 and an increase of 1.8% from Q1 2022.Selling  general and administrative expenses for three months ended June 30  2022 were $9.8 million  representing an increase of $3.2 million or 48.8% from Q2 2021 and an increase of $1.7 million or 21.7% from Q1 2022. The increase is largely due to our business recovering and stabilizing in 2022  therefore  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022. In addition  2022 expenses are higher than 2021 due to ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness.Liquidity  including cash and available credit facilities  was $13.8 million at June 30  2022  as compared to $33.7 million at December 31  2021.New project awards and contract renewals were $110 million for the three months ended June 30  2022 and $17 million for the month of July 2022. A majority of that work is expected to be completed in the next 12 months.Story continuesMaintenance and Construction ServicesRevenues for the three months ended June 30  2022 were $160.3 million  representing an increase of $73.0 million or 83.7% from Q2 2021 and $60.8 million or 61.2% from Q1 2022. The increase was due to the completion of a record 20 turnaround projects in the second quarter. We continue to focus on consolidating various scopes of work with existing or new customers by bundling our services in order to enable more efficient execution and lower costs for our customers on each work site.Wear Technology Overlay ServicesRevenues for the three months ended June 30  2022 were $14.3 million  representing an increase of $4.5 million or 46.0% from Q2 2021 and an increase of $1.9 million or 15.7% from Q1 2022. Gross profit margin was lower due to the mix of business and inflationary cost pressures from work that was bid in 2021 and executed in 2022.

ClearStream accounts for inter-segment sales based on transaction price.(2) ""Adjusted EBITDAS” is not a standard measure under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of this measure and limitations of its use.Revenues for the three and six months ended June 30  2022 were $173 195 and $283 043 compared to $96 596 and $178 800 for the same periods in 2021  representing an increase of 79.3% and increase 58.3%. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong market momentum in the first half of 2022  with an increase in activity across all areas of the business.Gross profit for the three and six months ended June 30  2022 was $15 701 and $25 441 compared to $10 440 and $18 485 for the same periods of 2021  representing an increase of 50.4% and 37.6%. Gross profit margin for the three and six months ended June 30  2022 were 9.1% and 9.0% compared to 10.8% and 10.3% for the same periods in 2021. Consistent with Q1 2022  the decrease in gross profit margin was driven by a change in the mix of services and products provided with lower gross profit margins.Selling  general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three and six months ended June 30  2022 were $9 799 and $17 851  in comparison to $6 586 and $12 554 for the same periods in 2021  representing an increase of 48.8% and 42.2%. As a percentage of revenue  SG&A expenses for the three and six months ended June 30  2022 were 5.7% and 6.3% compared to 6.8% and 7.0% for the same periods in 2021. Consistent with the last three quarters of 2021  the increase in SG&A expenses is partially due to the ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy. These investments  which will extend throughout 2022  are expected to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. In addition  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022.For the three and six months ended June 30  2022  Adjusted EBITDAS was $7 908 and $10 914 compared to $4 448 and $6 677 for the same periods in 2021. As a percentage of revenue  Adjusted EBITDAS was 4.6% and 3.9% for the three and six months ended June 30  2022 compared to 4.6% and 3.7% for the same periods in 2021.Income from government subsidies includes the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (""CERS"") received from the Government of Canada to assist with the payment of employee wages and rent as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CEWS and CERS programs ended in 2021. Therefore  the Company did not have any income from government subsidies during the three and six months ended June 30  2022  compared to $4 415 and $11 170 for the three and six months ended June 30  2021.Loss from continuing operations for the three and six months ended June 30  2022 was $974 and $8 757 compared to income of $494 and a loss of $7 076 for the same periods in 2021. The loss variance was driven by the reduction in government subsidies in 2022  an increase in SG&A expenses and an increase in restructuring expenses  partially offset by an increase in gross profit and the impairment of right-of-use assets recognized in 2021.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOn April 14  2022  ClearStream established a new $25 million asset-based revolving credit facility with a three-year term with a Canadian chartered bank (the “ABL Facility”) to replace its existing $15 million asset-based revolving credit facility that matured on April 14  2022. Pursuant to an amending agreement dated June 23  2022  the ABL Facility was amended to increase the maximum borrowings available thereunder to $30 million during the period commencing on June 23  2022 and ending on November 30  2022 to provide additional working capital needed to finance the higher level of activity experienced in the second quarter.On June 30  2022  ClearStream paid the interest owing on its 8% senior secured debentures due March 23  2026 (the “Senior Secured Debentures”) by issuing an additional 4 449 Senior Secured Debentures at a principal amount of $1 000 per Senior Secured Debenture. Following this issuance  the principal amount of Senior Secured Debentures outstanding as at June 30  2022 was $115.7 million.The Company anticipates that its liquidity (cash on hand and available credit facilities) and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with its financial covenants through June 30  2023.As at June 30  2022  issued and outstanding share capital included 110 001 239 common shares  127 732 Series 1 preferred shares  and 40 111 Series 2 preferred shares.The Series 1 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $127.732 million) are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of $0.35/share and the Series 2 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $40.111 million) are convertible into common shares at a price of $0.10/share.The Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares have a 10% fixed cumulative preferential cash dividend payable when the Company has sufficient monies to be able to do so  including under the provisions of applicable law and contracts affecting the Company. The board of directors of the Company does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends until such times as the Company's balance sheet and liquidity position supports the payment. As at June 30  2022  the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series 1 and Series 2 shares totaled $68.21 million. Any accrued and unpaid dividends are convertible in certain circumstances at the option of the holder into additional Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares.OUTLOOKClearStream's business model continues to prove its resilience as we are working closely with our customers to help them effectively manage their operations. Our organic growth strategy involves cross-selling our suite of more than 40 services that encompass the full asset lifecycle to generate efficiencies and cost reductions for our customers.

We expect activity levels to remain strong in the second half of 2022.The growth in our served markets continues to drive some near-term challenges  including inflationary pressure on labour  equipment and materials as well as supply chain disruptions. We are working closely with our customers and suppliers to manage these challenges.

In some cases  forward-looking information can be identified by terminology such as “may”  “will”  “should”  “expect”  “plan”  “anticipate”  “believe”  “estimate”  “predict”  “potential”  “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. This press release contains forward-looking information relating to: our business plans  strategies and objectives; that management of inflationary cost pressures and material shortages will be a key focus in the second half of the year; contract renewals and project awards  including the estimated value thereof and the timing of completing the associated work; that the demand for our AssetArmor™ products will increase as customers increase production levels; that customers will continue to allocate expenditures for the closure  reclamation and remediation of oil and gas wells  pipelines and facilities in Western Canada; that the investments being made to support our enterprise systems and digital strategy will drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness; the sufficiency of our liquidity and cash flow from operations to meet our short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with our financial covenants through June 30  2023; our dividend policy; the pricing outlook for commodities in the end markets we serve; that our customers will increase spending on both maintenance and capital projects; and activity levels for the second half of 2022.Forward-looking information involves significant risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events and results discussed in the forward-looking information including  but not limited to  the success of our response to the COVID-19 global pandemic  compliance with debt covenants  access to credit facilities and other sources of capital for working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs  availability of labour  dependence on key personnel  economic conditions  commodity prices  interest rates  regulatory change  weather and risks related to the integration of acquired businesses. These factors should not be considered exhaustive. Risks and uncertainties about ClearStream’s business are more fully discussed in ClearStream’s disclosure materials  including its annual information form and management’s discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results  filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada and available at www.sedar.com. In formulating the forward-looking information  management has assumed that business and economic conditions affecting ClearStream will continue substantially in the ordinary course  including  without limitation  with respect to general levels of economic activity  regulations  taxes and interest rates. Although the forward-looking information is based on what management of ClearStream consider to be reasonable assumptions based on information currently available to it  there can be no assurance that actual events or results will be consistent with this forward-looking information  and management’s assumptions may prove to be incorrect.This forward-looking information is made as of the date of this press release  and ClearStream does not assume any obligation to update or revise it to reflect new events or circumstances except as required by law. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is provided for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.Advisory regarding Non-Standard MeasuresThe terms ‘‘EBITDAS’’ and “Adjusted EBITDAS” (collectively  the ‘‘Non-standard measures’’) are financial measures used in this press release that are not standard measures under IFRS. ClearStream’s method of calculating the Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore  ClearStream’s Non-Standard Measures  as presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.EBITDAS refers to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS  before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  income tax expense (recovery) and long-term incentive plan expenses. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of ClearStream as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of ClearStream’s reportable segments and believes that in addition to net income or loss and cash provided by operating activities  EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and income taxes. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three and six months ended June 30  2022.Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring expense  gain (loss) on sale of property  plant and equipment  loss of contingent consideration liability  one time incurred expenses  impairment of right-of-use assets and government subsidies. ClearStream has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance. Adjusted EBITDAS is a measure that management believes (i) is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures  and income taxes  and (ii) facilitates the comparability of the results of historical periods and the analysis of its operating financial performance which may be useful to investors. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three and six months ended June 30  2022.Investors are cautioned that the Non-Standard Measures are not alternatives to measures under IFRS and should not  on their own  be construed as an indicator of performance or cash flows  a measure of liquidity or as a measure of actual return on the shares. These Non-Standard Measures should only be used with reference to ClearStream’s consolidated interim and annual financial statements available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on ClearStream’s website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca.",neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,mixed,0.41,0.25,0.34,True,English,"['Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results', 'ClearStream', 'Wear Technology Overlay Services', 'ClearStream Energy Services Inc.', 'SECOND QUARTER 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTS', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'growing customer base', 'government funded programs', 'global energy demand', 'professional services capabilities', 'inflationary cost pressures', 'New project awards', 'full production levels', 'Gross profit margin', 'available credit facilities', 'record 20 turnaround projects', 'record levels', 'Construction Services', 'Environmental Services', 'cost reductions', 'cost competitiveness', 'Activity levels', 'second half', 'EBITDAS margin', 'GLOBE NEWSWIRE', 'six months', 'standard measures', 'press release', 'timely manner', 'Barry Card', 'material shortages', 'first half', 'Mr. Card', 'three months', 'previous years', 'increased volume', 'ongoing investments', 'enterprise systems', 'digital strategy', 'longer-term efficiencies', 'contract renewals', 'next 12 months', 'various scopes', 'efficient execution', 'lower costs', 'continued rise', 'commodity prices', 'AssetArmor™ products', 'market segment', 'gas wells', 'Western Canada', 'governance) matters', 'new customers', 'Canadian dollars', 'key focus', 'administrative expenses', 'oil sands', 'share amounts', 'Revenue Maintenance', 'customers’ infrastructure', 'quarterly revenues', 'work site', 'Adjusted EBITDAS', '2022 expenses', 'CALGARY', 'Alberta', 'July', 'Company', 'TSX', 'CSM', 'thousands', 'IFRS', 'Advisory', 'end', 'description', 'items', 'limitations', 'use', 'integrity', '2,000 employees', 'safe', 'suppliers', 'stakeholders', 'HIGHLIGHTS', 'June', 'Q2', 'Q1', 'Selling', 'general', 'business', 'elements', 'order', 'addition', 'Liquidity', 'cash', 'December', 'majority', 'Story', 'completion', 'existing', 'mix', 'closure', 'reclamation', 'remediation', 'pipelines', 'ESG', 'social', 'expiry', 'Change', '10.']",2022-07-28,2022-07-29,finance.yahoo.com

However  net sales increased during the second quarter  mainly driven by the first commercial production batches of Estetrol for Mithra on the new manufacturing unit in Villeneuve-la-Garenne  with the completion of validation batches. Demand remains buoyant at the Turku and Aramon sites and the level of sales was also boosted by price increase initiatives launched at the end of 2021 and in the second quarter of 2022 in order to preserve margins in a context of inflation. However  the R&D and intermediates activity remains below what it used to be in 2021.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled €42.4 million  a 24.9% increase compared to 2021 (+21.8% at a constant exchange rate). A very strong demand in Electronics and Cosmetics and a positive trend in Lubricants and Fine Chemicals account for most of the strong increase in net sales in the first half-year. The rise in the costs of raw materials and energy could be passed on to customers and thus contributed to the growth in net sales. Projects are still being driven by a good momentum  with a significant number of industrialization phases carried out since the beginning of the year.Story continuesOutlookThe PCAS Group will generate a further significant current operational loss in the first half of 2022  still negatively affected by business levels that are still not sufficient to cover the fixed costs incurred at several Pharmaceutical synthesis sites  and inventory depreciations linked to non-compliant productions. Further  the 2022 half-year financial statements will include an expense of €14.5 million corresponding to an impairment of the Group's goodwill  as an immediate consequence of an increase in the discount rate used to determine future operating cash flows as part of impairment tests.All the PCAS Group teams  with the support of its majority shareholder Seqens for the financing of its activities and its development  however  remain fully committed to improving the results in 2022 and a return to positive results in 2023  helped by gradual growth in Estetrol volumes for Mithra.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:Results of the 1rst semester of 2022  September 8  2022ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies. With about 12% of its net sales earmarked for R&D and a large international footprint  PCAS is the preferred industrial partner for market-leading major global groups.

The savings plan announced at the start of June will make it possible to reduce operating expenditure by at least €4m on a full-year basis  with a maximum cost of approximately €1.2m in 2022. It is focused on scaling back its workforce (163 staff at end-June 2022) by around 60 positions in France and 10 in other countries  with four non-priority commercial business units shut down (Romania  Italy  UK  Canada) and the management of their clients reassigned to the seven other subsidiaries.To support the upturn in demand for its assisted reality solutions  AMA has made two major updates to XpertEye. Following version 6.6  which was launched at the start of April  version 6.7  released at the start of July  notably incorporates a number of features to facilitate and secure the management of multi-user exchanges. It covers new specific needs for frontline workers by offering bandwidth control to optimize flows for instance. Alongside this  when adapted for its use  in the medical sector for instance  XpertEye now includes Full HD video. Following the inclusion of several connected devices and glasses with version 6.6  version 6.7 has been further enhanced with a night-vision camera and a bodycam for armed forces and security services. Lastly  with the inclusion of Arabic  XpertEye’s suite of solutions is now available in 20 languages.Story continuesBuilding on its progress  AMA recorded a 10% increase in orders during the second quarter compared with the first quarter of 2022. At end-June 2022  AMA had 439 clients  including 61 new accounts  while maintaining its international commercial organization in Europe  the United States and Asia.With revenue recognition spread over the term of contracts for software solutions  and considering the pace and features of orders (software vs. quantity of equipment) over the coming months  it is not possible at present to confirm the return to revenue growth in the second half of 2022. However  AMA expects the growth in its levels of orders to continue over the second half of the year. Further details will be able to be provided when the 2022 first-half consolidated earnings are published on October 31.Unaudited consolidated revenues (IFRS  €’000)At constant exchange rates 2022 2021 Change 2020 First quarter 1.1 2.2 -52% 0.5 Second quarter 1.0 1.8 -44% 1.2 First half 2.1 4.0 -48% 1.7 Third quarter 1.3 1.5 Fourth quarter 1.3 3.1 Second half 2.6 4.6 Full-year 6.6 6.4Next date:2022 first-half earnings and third-quarter revenues: October 31  2022 (before start of trading)DisclaimerThis press release contains certain non-factual elements  including but not restricted to certain statements concerning its future results and other future events.

This was driven by strong traction of the professional segment  which more than compensated headwinds from the lockdowns in China  the effect of the war in Ukraine on our Eastern European market  and a weaker consumer environment. This top-line increase – achieved despite a challenging comparison base – illustrates our improved profile for growth  fueled by the continuing shift towards connected lighting. At the same time  currency movements and inflationary pressures affected our gross margin and adjusted EBITA  although the impact on the latter was partially compensated by cost management. We maintain our CSG guidance for the full year  given continued momentum in the professional segment and our solid order book. The challenging external environment has led us to revise our outlook for the adjusted EBITA margin. In addition  persistent supply chain disruption and long supplier lead times will impact our free cash flow performance ” said CEO Eric Rondolat.“We are taking adaptive measures and expect margin headwinds to ease in the second half of the year. Cash flow generation will normalize once supplier lead times shorten. We remain firmly committed to investing in our business and driving our long-term growth objectives. Our extensive portfolio of sustainable and connected lighting solutions uniquely positions Signify to capture the heightened demand for energy efficient lighting.”Brighter Lives  Better World 2025Story continuesIn the second quarter of the year  Signify was on track for three of its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainability program commitments that contribute to doubling its positive impact on the environment and society.Double the pace of the Paris Agreement:Cumulative carbon reduction over the value chain is ahead of track. This is mainly driven by the sales of energy-efficient and connected LED lighting  which drive emissions reduction in the use phase.Double Circular revenues to 32%:Circular revenues increased to 31%  well on track for the 2025 target of 32%. This positive trend continues to be driven by the upgrade of luminaires to serviceable luminaires.Double Brighter lives revenues to 32%:Brighter lives revenues of 26% were off track  yet Signify remains confident that it will achieve the 2025 target of 32%.Double the percentage of women in leadership positions to 34%:The percentage of women in leadership positions was 27%  on track. This quarter  Signify continued to drive actions to achieve its 2025 commitment  including inclusive job posting and diverse hiring panels. In addition  Signify conducted training sessions together with Hult International Business School. These training sessions equip teams with the right tools to realize the company's diversity ambitions.OutlookSignify maintains its CSG guidance of 3-6% for the year  driven by continued momentum in the professional segment and its solid order book.The company revises its Adjusted EBITA margin guidance for the full year to 11.0-11.4%  reflecting the lower margin performance in Q2 2022.Signify also revises its 2022 free cash flow guidance to 5-7% of sales  including the proceeds from real estate divestments.

Nominal sales included a positive currency effect of 6.6%  mainly from the appreciation of the USD  and a positive contribution from the recently acquired Fluence and Pierlite businesses.The Adjusted gross margin decreased from 39.7% to 36.7%. While continued price increases more than offset the input cost increases  Signify was not able to offset within the quarter the surge of energy costs  nor the negative impact from currency movements.Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 130 bps to 29.3%  driven by operating leverage and strengthened cost discipline in view of the pressure on gross margin.Adjusted EBITA decreased slightly to EUR 174 million. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased by 140 bps to 9.5%  reflecting the lower gross margin  which was partly offset by operating leverage and indirect cost savings. Currency movements also had a negative effect of 110 bps on the Adjusted EBITA margin.Adjusted items of EUR 166 million include a EUR 184 million gain from the disposal of non-strategic real estate  while year-on-year restructuring and acquisition-related costs decreased from EUR 22 million to EUR 12 million. As a result  net income increased from EUR 82 million to EUR 248 million.The number of employees (FTE) decreased from 39 143 to 35 407  reflecting the exceptionally high base in the previous year related to the strong volume recovery and additional staff requirements in factories  following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Amundi Technology continued to develop and saw its revenues increase sharply.”I. Business activity held up well   in unfavourable market conditionsStory continuesAmundi’s assets under management totalled €1 925bn at 30 June 2022  up +7.3% year-on-year and down -4.8% vs. the end of March 2022  with a negative market effect of -€98bn in Q2.Business activity in Q2 2022The second quarter was characterised by unfavourable market conditions:equity markets dropped sharply: in Q2  the EuroStoxx decreased by -12% 6 ; in average  markets fell by -7.3% vs. Q2 2021 and -7.6% vs. Q1 2022 7 ;bond markets also declined (-7% between 31/03/2022 and 30/06/2022 8 )  with rates up around 100bp between 31/03/2022 and 30/06/2022;a general environment of increased risk aversion.This unfavourable environment was illustrated by the significant outflows observed across the entire European asset management market.Against this backdrop  Amundi’s business activity held up particularly well  with positive inflows of +€1.8bn.In Retail   activity held up well in medium/long-term assets 9 (-€0.9bn). Inflows from third-party distributors (+€1.6bn) were positive in the main European markets (France  Italy  Germany). In the French networks  activity was positive in MLT assets (+€0.6bn)  but was offset by outflows (before maturity) from structured products (-€0.9bn). In the international networks (excluding the Amundi BOC WM subsidiary in China)  flows were stable (-€0.1bn); business activity remained robust in Italy  in unit-linked and thematic funds (as illustrated by the success of CPR Hydrogen). For the Chinese subsidiary Amundi BOC WM  the slowdown in activity can be explained by the maturities of the funds launched in 2021  and by the market environment and sanitary situation in China.For institutional clients  MLT assets posted outflows of -€9.1bn   due to the derisking strategy of some clients  particularly in the Institutional and Sovereign segment. In the Employee Savings segment  inflows were positive (+€2.9bn) due to the seasonal effect. The Insurers segment recorded moderate outflows (-€1.5bn)  in connection with the sale of a subsidiary by CA Assurances.Activity in treasury products was virtually stable (-€1.3bn excluding JVs) with seasonal outflows from corporate clients (dividend payments)  partially offset by inflows related to derisking by institutional clients .Activity in the JVs saw solid levels of inflows (+€13.1bn). The Indian JV SBI MF maintained its leading position in the Indian market10 with +€8.9bn in inflows  particularly from pension funds. In China (ABC-CA)  business activity was good  with flows remaining solid at +€3.7bn  particularly in Institutionals  and with -€1.3bn of outflows from low-margin products (Channel Business). In Korea  flows remained positive (+€1.9bn  mainly in treasury products).Continued development of Amundi TechnologyAmundi Technology continues its development with the acquisition of Savity  an Austrian fintech offering a robo advisor white label solution for the retail market  available in Austria and Germany.AG2R  an insurance client with AuM of €120bn  successfully migrated to ALTO Investments.Sabadell Bank chose Amundi Technology and its ALTO W&D product to develop a new solution for its private banking business  with a robo advisor solution for its new online banking offer.Business activity in H1 2022Overall  the first half of the year  Amundi posted positive flows of +€5.0bn.Flows in MLT assets ex JVs were brisk (+€11.0bn)  with notably a good momentum in Retail (+€13.4bn in MLT  mainly with third-party distributors); for Institutional clients  outflows were limited (-€2.4 in MLT) in a “derisking” context.Active management: in sharply declining markets  Amundi's inflows were still even; investment performance remained at a good level  with more than 68% of open-ended fund AuM in the top two quartiles  according to Morningstar 11   and more than 78% based over five-years. With 298 funds rated 4 and 5 stars  Amundi is the third largest player in Europe by the number of funds. The success of the Multi Asset strategies  ESG mandates and OCIO 12 solutions was also noteworthy.Activity in Real Assets was strong  with +€2.8bn in inflows  particularly in Private Equity  Real Estate and Private Debt  bringing assets under management to €66bn at 30/06/2022.Passive management  ETFs and smart beta had a good first half of the year with +€11.4bn in net inflows  bringing AuM to €284bn at end-June 2022. This performance is remarkable in the context of the merger with Lyxor  whose advantages are confirmed. While Amundi ETFs had a particularly solid first quarter  inflows were affected in the second quarter by the wait-and-see attitude of some clients looking to reduce risk in their portfolios.In ETFs  by recording the second highest inflows in the market in the first half of the year  Amundi consolidated its position as the number two player in Europe and leading European ETF manager with a market share of around 14%13.In Asian JVs  business activity was high  at +€21.5bn  notably in India and China.II. Continued high level of profitabilityFirst half of 2022Note: figures reported for the first half of 2021 did not include Lyxor. The reported and combined H1 2021 income statements (on a like-for-like basis  with Lyxor) are presented in the notes.Adjusted data14Stable revenues excluding financial income (€1 615m vs. €1 623m in H1 2021):Net management fees 15 rose significantly by +12.0%  thanks to the acquisition of Lyxor and the strong inlfows over 12 months. On a like-for-like basis 16 the increase was +4.6%. The average margin was stable (17.5bp) compared to H1 2021 17 thanks to a favourable mix effect.As expected  performance fees (€95m) were lower than the exceptional level seen in H1 2021 (€266m).Amundi Technology's revenues continued to grow to €22m (+15.5%).Operating expenses increased to €844m due to the acquisition of Lyxor  but were stable on a like-for-like basis. Amundi demonstrated its ability to maintain its operational efficiency  even in a difficult market environment. Its cost/income ratio stood at 53.1%  one of the best in the industry.The contribution to net income from equity-accounted entities (mainly joint ventures in Asia) increased by +6.5% vs. H1 2021  to €41m  with a notable increase in the Indian JV (SBI FM)  whose contribution increased from €21m to €25m  thanks to business momentum.Adjusted net income remained high at €593m. On a normalised basis18  this result was up +8.1% compared to H1 2021  and +5.6% on a like-for-like basis19.Accounting dataAccounting net income (Group share) amounted to €527m. It includes the usual amortisation of intangible assets  as well as integration costs related to Lyxor.Note: as a reminder  H1 2021 also included an exceptional tax gain (with no impact on cash flow) of +€114m  linked to the application of the “Affrancamento” scheme in Italy.Second quarter 2022Adjusted dataAmundi’s quarterly adjusted net income remained high at €269m. Its change compared to the first quarter of 2022 can be explained by the sharp drop of the markets and of performance fees.Net revenues excluding financial income were €769m:Net management fees (excluding Amundi Technology’s revenues) held up well at €733m; their evolution (-4.3% vs. Q1 2022) is more moderate than the markets overall (-7 6% 20 ).The normalisation of performance fees was accentuated by the market environment; they amounted to €24m compared to a quarterly average of €42m between 2017 and 2020.Amundi Technology’s revenues rose 24.5% vs. Q1 2022 to €12m.Operating expenses were stable (€422m)  despite continued IT investments  and included in particular an exceptional (non-cash) accounting expense of -€4m (IFRS 2)  related to the capital increase reserved for employees (see Section IV). Excluding this one-off expense  operating expenses would have been down slightly vs. Q1 2022.As a result  the cost/income ratio was 55.9% vs. 50.6% in Q1 2022 (51.8% on a normalised basis21)  in line with the decline in revenues linked to the market effect.The contribution to income from equity-accounted entities (mainly Asian joint ventures) increased by +6.3% vs. Q1 2022  to €21m.Accounting dataAccounting net income (Group share) amounted to €224m. It includes the usual amortisation of intangible assets  as well as integration costs related to Lyxor (€40m before tax and €30m after tax)  including the charges provisioned for employee departures plans.Note: as a reminder  Q2 2021 also included an exceptional tax gain (with no impact on cash flow) of +€114m  linked to the application of the “Affrancamento” scheme in Italy.III. Continued com mitment to Responsible InvestmentAmundi continued to implement its 2025 action plan.Responsible Investment assets under management were €793bn at 30 June 2022  stable compared with 30 June 2021. The change from 31 December 2021 (€847bn in assets under management) is linked to a negative market effect  partially offset by the continued integration of ESG criteria into investment management  and sustained inflows (+€8.8bn in MLT22 in H1)  mostly in active management.H1 2022 highlights:Good momentum for Climate and Environment solutions  ESG fixed-income funds  and the Equity thematic funds;Continued product innovation  in particular with the launch of the Amundi Euro Corporate Short Term Green Bond fund  as well as the CPR Blue Economy thematic fund (a global equity fund to support marine economic ecosystems and protect sustainably the oceans).In addition  Amundi continues to align its internal policy with its commitments: Amundi was the first asset manager in the world to present a “Say on Climate” resolution to a shareholder vote (AGM held on 18th of May 2022). Almost 98% of shareholders approved this resolution.IV. A solid financial structureTangible equity23 amounted to €3.3bn at 30 June 2022  down slightly compared to end-2021 due to the payment of dividends (€0.8bn) for the 2021 financial year.The CET1 ratio was 17.9% at the end of June 2022  well above regulatory requirements  to be compared with 16.1% at end 2021.Note: in May 2022  rating agency Fitch confirmed Amundi’s A+ rating with a stable outlook  one of the best in the sector.V. Other informationSuccessful capital increase reserved to employeesThe “We Share Amundi” capital increase reserved to employees (announced on 20 June) was successfully completed on 26 July 2022: over one in three employees worldwide  and over half of employees in France  participated to the capital increase  which  for the fifth consecutive year  offered a share subscription with a discount. Nearly 2 000 employees present in 15 countries subscribed to this capital increase for a total amount of nearly €29m.The deal  which was executed under existing legal authorisations approved by the General Shareholders’ Meeting on 18 May 2022  reflects Amundi's ambition to involve its employees not only in the company's growth but also in economic value creation. It also allows to increase employees’ feelings of belonging.The impact of this capital increase on net earnings per share is negligible: 785 480 shares were created (representing 0.4% of capital before the shares issuance). This issuance brings the number of shares making up Amundi's share capital to 203 860 131 on 27 July 2022.Employees now hold more than 1% of Amundi’s share capital  compared with 0.8% before the capital increase.Launch of a share buyback programme as part of performance shares plansAfter obtaining the necessary regulatory approval  Amundi announces the launch of a share buyback programme limited to a maximum of €60m  or a maximum of 1 million shares  representing around 0.5% of the share capital. This programme is intended to cover the performance shares plans already awarded.In order to avoid dilution for existing shares shareholders  Amundi has decided not to issue any new shares  but to buy back the shares that will be delivered to beneficiaries starting in 2023 (following a vesting period and subject to performance and presence conditions24).See appendix for further details.Financial disclosure schedulePublication of Q3 and 9M 2022 results: 28 October 2022Publication of Q4 and FY 2022 results: 8 February 2023Publication of Q1 2023 results: 28 April 2023Publication of H1 2023 results: 28 July 2023Publication of 9M 2023 results: 27 October 2023***Reminder of sensitivities to markets variationsChanges in the equity markets : +/- 10% → +/- €125 m in net revenuesChanges in interest rates : +/- 100 bps → -/+ €50m in net revenuesSensitivity on run-rate net management fees (excluding performance fees).Market sensitivities do not take into account potential impact of market movements on flows.Income StatementsH1 2022 H1 2021new presentation Chg.H1 2022 /H1 2021 new presentation Chg.H1 2022 /H1 2021 like-for-like Adjusted net revenue 1 589 1 619 -1.9% -7.4% Net asset management revenue 1 594 1 604 -0.6% -6.4% o/w net management fees 1 499 1 338 12.0% 4.6% o/w performance fees 95 266 - - Technology 22 19 15.5% 15.5% Net financial income and other net income (27) (4) - - Operating expenses (844) (764) 10.5% 0.8% Adjusted gross operating income 744 855 -13.0% -15.2% Adjusted cost/income ratio 53.1% 47.2% 6 pts 4.3 pts Cost of risk & Other (4) (20) - - Equity-accounted entities 41 38 6.5% 6.5% Adjusted income before taxes 781 874 -10.5% -12.7% Adjusted corporate tax (187) (223) -16.3% -18.9% Minority interests (1) 4 - - Adjusted net income  Group share 593 654 -9.3% -11.2% Amortisation of intangible assets after tax (29) (24) 20.5% 27.4% Integration costs net of tax (37) 0 - - Net income  Group share 527 630 -16.4% -18.4% Impact of Affrancamento 0 114 - - Net income  Group share including Affrancamento 527 744 -28 7% -30 2%Q2 2022 Q2 2021new presentation Chg.Q2 2022 / Q2 2021 Chg.Q2 2022 /Q2 2021like-for-like Q1 2022 Chg.Q2 2022 /Q1 2022 Adjusted net revenue 754 849 -11.2% -16.4% 835 -9.7% Net asset management revenue 757 835 -9.3% -14.7% 837 -9.5% o/w net management fees 733 679 7.9% 0.2% 766 -4.3% o/w performance fees 24 155 - - 71 -65.9% Technology 12 12 2.2% 2.2% 10 24.5% Net financial income and other adjusted net income (15) 3 - - (12) 30.3% Adjusted operating expenses (422) (388) 8.6% -1.7% (423) -0.2% Adjusted gross operating income 332 461 -27.9% -29.8% 412 -19.4% Adjusted cost/income ratio 55.9% 45.7% 10.2 pts 8.4 pts 50.6% 5.3 pts Cost of risk & Other (0) (18) - - (4) Equity-accounted entities 21 21 2.1% 2.1% 20 6.3% Adjusted income before taxes 353 464 -23.9% -25.7% 428 -17.6% Corporate tax 1 2 (84) (120) -29.8% -32.1% (103) -18.3% Minority interests 0 1 - - (1) - Adjusted net income  Group share 269 345 -22.1% -23.7% 324 -17.0% Amortisation of intangible assets after tax (15) (12) 20.5% 29.9% (15) 0.0% Integration costs net of tax (30) 0 - - (8) - Net income  Group share 224 333 -32.6% -34.2% 302 -25.7% Impact of Affrancamento 0 114 - - 0 - Net income  Group share including Affrancamento 224 446 -49.7% -50.6% 303 -26.0%Adjusted data: excluding amortisation of intangible assets  Lyxor integration costs  and  in Q2 and H1 2021  excluding the impact of Affrancamento.New presentation of revenues with Amundi Technology revenues presented on a separated lineConstant scope: with LyxorThe accounting net income for Q2 2021 includes a net one-time tax gain (net of a substitution tax) of +€114m (no cash flow impact): “Affrancamento” mechanism of the Italian Budget Law for 2021 (Law no. 178/2020)  resulting in the recognition of Deferred Tax Assets on intangible assets (goodwill); this was excluded from Adjusted Net Income.Change in assets under management1 from end-December 2020 to end-June 2022(€bn) Assetsunder management Netinflows Market and foreign exchangeeffect Scopeeffect Change in AuM vs. previous quarter As of 31/12/2020 1 729 +4.0% Q1 2021 -12.7 +39.3 / As of 31/03/2021 1 755 +1.5% Q2 2021 +7.2 +31.4 / As of 30/06/2021 1 794 / +2.2% Q3 2021 +0.2 +17.0 / As of 30/09/2021 1 811 / +1.0% Q4 2021 +65.6 +39.1 +14825 As of 31/12/2021 2 064 / Q1 2022 +3.2 -46.4 / -2.1% As of 31/03/2022 2 021 / Q2 2022 +1.8 - 97.8 / As of 30/06/2022 1 925 -4.8%1.

Accounting and adjusted data1. Accounting data:For the first six months of 2021 and 2022  data after amortisation of intangible assets (distribution agreements with Bawag  UniCredit and Banco Sabadell; Lyxor client contracts); and after the integration costs related to Lyxor.2. Adjusted data:To present an income statement that is closer to the economic reality  the following adjustments have been made: restatement of amortisation of intangible assets (deducted from net revenues); the integration costs related to Lyxor.In the accounting data  amortisation of intangible assets:Q2 2021 : €17m before tax and €12m after taxQ1 2022 : €20m before tax and €15m after taxQ2 2022 : €20m before tax and €15m after taxH1 2021 : €34m before tax and €24m after taxH1 2022: €41m before tax and €29m after taxIn the accounting data  integration costs related to Lyxor:Q2 2021 : 0Q1 2022 : €10m before tax and €8m after taxQ2 2022 : €40m before tax and €30m after taxH1 2021 : 0H1 2022: €51m before tax and €37m after taxII. Acquisition of LyxorIn accordance with IFRS 3  recognition on Amundi’s balance sheet as of 31/12/2021 of:goodwill ;an intangible asset  representing client contracts  of €40m before tax (€30m after tax)  which will be amortised on a straight-line basis over 3 years;In the Group income statement  the above-mentioned intangible asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over 3 years starting in 2022; the full-year impact of this amortisation is €10m net of tax (i.e. €13m before tax). This amortisation is recognised as a deduction from net income and added to the existing amortisation of distribution agreements.III.

(NYSE: GTLS) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30  2022. Further...,"Chart Industries  Inc.ATLANTA  July 29  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chart Industries  Inc. (NYSE: GTLS) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30  2022. Further details can be found in the supplemental presentation accompanying this release and published in the investor relations section of our website.Second quarter 2022 was all-time record orders ($887.8 million)  record backlog ($1 953.3 million)  record sales ($404.8 million)  record reported gross margin ($94.8 million) and record reported operating income ($29.6 million)Second quarter 2022 sales of $404.8 million were our highest quarter of sales in our history and increased 25.7% (19.0% organic) when compared to the second quarter of 2021 and 14.3% (12.4% organic) compared to the first quarter 2022Second quarter reported 7.3% operating income as a percent of sales (adjusted 9.9%) was our highest in the past yearNet cash provided by operating activities was $35 million (adjusted of $54 million)  resulting in free cash flow (“FCF”) of $18 million (adjusted FCF of $37 million)  providing further confidence to our full year 2022 adjusted FCF outlook of $175 million to $225 millionAcquired Fronti Fabrications (“Fronti”)  a vacuum insulated cold box manufacturer  and CSC Cryogenic Service Center AB (“CSC”)  a Nordic region service and repair businessReceived our American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) XII certificate at our Theodore  Alabama facility  making us one of only 30 companies globally (34 sites) with this certificationSecond quarter 2022 reported non-diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.36; adjusted non-diluted EPS of $0.88 (excluding Mark-to-Market (“MTM”) from investment activity ($0.22 net of tax) and other specific one-time costs ($0.30 net of tax))2022 full-year sales guidance range of $1.725 billion to $1.80 billion is within the prior guidance range of $1.725 billion to $1.85 billion; associated 2022 full-year adjusted non-diluted EPS guidance is in the range of $5.20 to $5.60 (prior guidance of $5.35 to $6.50) on 35.86 million shares outstanding (prior 35.83 million) and a tax rate of 20% (prior tax rate of 19%)Story continuesNew records were set in the second quarter 2022 across the business.In the second quarter 2022  we achieved the highest order quarter in our history ($887.8 million)  the highest sales quarter in our history ($404.8 million) and our seventh consecutive record backlog quarter ($1 953.3 billion).In addition to record orders  backlog and sales  our second quarter 2022 was our all-time record gross margin dollars of $94.8 million (adjusted gross margin of $102.4 million) as well as record operating income of $29.6 million (adjusted operating income of $40.0 million). Reported operating income as a percent of sales of 7.3% was the highest in the past year and when adjusted for one-time costs from deal  integration  startup/capacity and restructuring  was 9.9%  also the highest in the past year. Reported gross margin as a percent of sales for the second quarter 2022 was 23.4%  and when adjusted for one-time costs related to integration and startup/capacity specific projects  was 25.3% adjusted as a percent of sales  reflecting both our continued progress on pricing versus input costs as well as the high shipment quarter of price/cost lagged backlog in our Cryo Tank Solutions (“CTS”) segment  which had the most long-term agreement price indexing timed into the second quarter 2022. As mentioned in prior quarters  realizing the continued benefits of these price and cost control actions sets up the second half of 2022 to continue to incrementally increase operating margin and gross margin  as well as both metrics as a percent of sales; with the additional backlog shipped in the second quarter from CTS  we expect CTS margin to sequential improve. Reported gross margin as a percent of sales in the second quarter 2022 was sequentially up more than 170 basis points in three out of our four segments when compared to the first quarter 2022. Additionally  both reported and adjusted operating income as percent of sales sequentially increased in three of the four segments  each increasing more than 270 basis points.Our reported earnings per share of $0.36 included negative $0.22 from our mark-to-market adjustment as well as one-time specific costs primarily related to deals  year-one integration  startup & capacity of $0.30. In the second quarter  we completed the Tulsa  OK to Beasley  Texas air-cooled heat exchanger relocation/restructuring  substantially completed the SriCity  India capacity expansion and completed the Richburg  SC greenfield expansion costs (therefore  none of these costs will be addbacks going forward). Note that we did not addback the negative impact to sales or EPS from the foreign exchange (“FX”) rate changes and we anticipate that these will continue to be variable throughout the second half of 2022. We estimate the second quarter 2022 impact from the foreign exchange rate changes to be approximately negative $12 million to sales and approximately negative $0.05 to EPS. Adjusted EPS of $0.88 is our second highest in our history and reflects our continuing execution of price increases  cost controls while including an offset from the high shipment quarter of price/cost lagged backlog in our CTS segment.The following table shows our records in the second quarter 2022 for orders  sales and backlog.Segment/Division Orders Net Sales Backlog Cryo Tank Solutions Storage Equipment ● Engineered Tanks & Systems ● Mobile Equipment Heat Transfer Systems ● ● Brazed Alum Heat Exchangers ● Systems ● ● ● Air Exchangers ● ● Fans ● VRV ● ● Repair  Service & Leasing ● Parts  Repairs  & Services ● Cryo Lease Lifecycle Group Air Coolers Aftermarket Fans Aftermarket ● ● L.A.

Our second quarter 2022 topped that record  with orders of $887.8 million  including approximately $300 million related to Big LNG (specifically our full notice to proceed on Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Stage Three LNG export terminal (“Cheniere CCL 3”)). Total Chart content on Cheniere’s CCL 3 project is over $350 million; the entire amount is in backlog as of June 30  2022. The second quarter 2022 also marked our fifth out of the last six quarters setting new historical record orders and is our third consecutive record order quarter. This resulted in our seventh consecutive quarter of record backlog ($1 953.3 million); backlog is 80% higher than one year ago and sequentially 32% higher than the first quarter 2022. We continued our trend of more consistent and frequent orders that each were over $1 million  with 61 of them booked in the second quarter 2022  making this our fourth consecutive quarter with over 60 individual orders each greater than $1 million.We continue to witness what we shared during our first quarter 2022 earnings call regarding the increase in actual orders as well as inquiries from both public and private sector entities surrounding the need for infrastructure to access molecules to support energy security  access  independence and resiliency  all with the backdrop of the requirement for alternative sources of supply and continued focus on sustainability. The increase in immediacy for energy security has not come at the expense of the clean energy transition – rather there is a heightened focus on all energy. As the International Energy Agency (“IEA”) shared – the world has both the resources and technologies to tackle the energy security crisis and the climate crisis  addressing the need for immediate practical actions to navigate the current energy market turmoil  while underscoring the urgency of massively scaling up investment in clean energy. To that point  the IEA also recently stated that clean energy investments will be above $1.4 trillion this year  constituting about three-quarters of overall energy spending. And this week’s news on The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022  which addresses the United States’ adoption of solutions through strategic investments in technologies needed for all fuel types – from hydrogen  nuclear  renewables  fossil fuels and energy storage – to be produced and used in the cleanest way possible - certainly will further support the continued traction we have already seen in the commercial adoption of our Nexus of Clean offerings.It was not only LNG related activity in the second quarter 2022 driving these new historical records. In the second quarter 2022  we booked orders with 85 new customers and 23 first-of-a-kind (“FOAK”) orders  bringing year-to-date FOAKs to 51 and orders with new customers to 169  both of which are on track to meet or exceed 2021’s FOAKs and new customers  demonstrating that there is considerable potential growth in our addressable market globally.We continue to expect additional progress from other LNG export terminal operators to FID with the potential for additional Big LNG as well as ssLNG orders with Chart releases in the next six to twelve months.Specialty Products orders continued to demonstrate consistency and strength  with the second quarter 2022 being our highest Specialty Products order quarter in our history as well as our sixth consecutive quarter of Specialty Products orders above $100 million. The $265.7 million of Specialty Products orders in the second quarter 2022 were driven by record orders for hydrogen  space exploration (including a $16 million commitment from a large space customer for product that will be produced in our supersized tank facility in Theodore  Alabama) and water treatment as well as continued elevated activity in the food & beverage end markets  including receiving our largest ever order for CO2 ORCAs (mobile units) and continued national accounts’ (such as Chick-Fil-A) store openings and replacement programs. The majority of the project work that was booked in the second quarter 2022 will primarily be revenue recognized in 2023 through 2025.Also  our customer and potential customer base continues to expand in the specialty applications. For example  as of the end of the second quarter 2022  we are in various different stages of discussions with over 550 different potential hydrogen customers (compared to just over 300 one year ago and just over 30 in April 2020) and over 300 different potential large-scale (SES) carbon capture potential customers  whereas at the end of 2021  we were speaking with just under 200 potential customers.LNG  LNG  LNG.We have previously discussed our LNG addressable market in three ways – first  Big LNG  for which year-to-date we have booked $528.9 million of related orders; second  small-scale and utility-scale LNG  which includes floating LNG and regasification opportunities; and third  LNG infrastructure  such as ISO containers  fueling stations  and trailers. Now  we will speak to our LNG addressable market in four ways – these three plus retrofit  refurbishment and replacement opportunities for which we are seeing increasing inquiries and activity. For example  we have jobs completed or underway year-to-date 2022 including removal and install of fans and motors and numerous field service repairs  and the Southeastern utility customer’s small-scale LNG order in the second quarter 2022 for $26 million is a replacement as well as an expansion project. The other opportunities in aftermarket are global and include heavy hydrocarbon removal systems  nitrogen rejection units  vacuum insulated pipe and Boil Off Gas (BOG) reliquefaction  to name a few.In the second quarter 2022  we booked our third New Fortress Energy FastLNG liquefaction project (“Fast3”) as well as a small-scale LNG retrofit and expansion project with a Southeastern United States utility company. Combined  we booked $73.1 million of small-scale and floating LNG work in the second quarter 2022.Also in our LNG and other molecule offering are our numerous regasification (“regas”) options for our customers  with our most recently introduced being our modular  movable and quick to deploy regas solution  the Drop and Go Regas (“DAGR 2.0”). This amongst our other regas equipment and technology has increased in demand since the focus on energy access and security has heightened. As an example  in the second quarter 2022 we sold two ISO containers and two skidded vaporizers to AFP (Alternative Fuel Partners)  who connects the container with the vaporizer to make a unit that is shown on slide 27 of the supplemental presentation to provide emergency gas supply. Another customer  ITALGAS  has deployed 26 LNG regas units and we are also the 24/7 maintenance provider for these systems. We are currently quoting dozens of these opportunities for customers in Central Europe  in particular in Germany  where alternatives to pipeline gas are being explored.Organic capacity expansions are on track and supported by backlog.As our demand continues to be broad-based  we strategically choose to begin organic capacity expansions  and currently have four meaningful expansions underway. Portions of the related capital expenditures (“capex”) are in our full year capex outlook of approximately $55 million to $60 million (year-to-date through June 30  2022 our capex was $29.8 million) as well as into our 2023 outlook. It is worth noting that these expansions all have backlog seeded to be first volumes when the capacity comes online.SriCity  India bulk tank capacity expansion (on existing property): construction work is complete as of the end of June 2022. Inspection  final occupancy certification and additional machinery is anticipated to be complete by the end of the third quarter 2022.Tulsa  Oklahoma (USA) brazed aluminum heat exchanger line (at existing facility): all equipment and training is on track  including delivery of the brazing furnace in the third quarter 2022.Goch  Germany GOFA industrial gas and hydrogen trailer capacity expansion (on existing property): underway  with operations set to begin in mid to late 2023. We received our first order totaling more than $20 million which will be produced in this expanded facility. The facility will also include a repair and service shop.Theodore (Teddy)  Alabama (USA) supersized and jumbo tank new capacity (on existing property with opportunity to add adjacent property): Site work and equipment procurement is underway  with our first orders for this expansion received in the second quarter 2022  totaling $16 million for a space exploration customer (total space exploration orders in the second quarter 2022 were a record $30.7 million).Margin improvement continues as we continue to respond to cost changes with pricing and surcharges  improving productivity; supported by certain macro challenges tempering.We continued to implement price increases in the second quarter 2022 and held our surcharge the entire quarter as well. In addition to maintaining our short bid validity timing on project quotations  we have implemented five separate base price increases over the past six quarters and had three surcharge increases since implementing in the third quarter 2021. This is in addition to the quarterly or semiannual index-based adjustments in our long-term agreements with specific industrial gas customers.Given the enormity of the macro challenges over the past 18 months  we monitor any changes needed on a daily basis. There have been some challenges that we have seen improving  albeit none to pre-COVID “normal”  and others that exist at the same challenging levels that we have been navigating for the past year  including an unprecedented inflationary environment.The Good & The Improving:Availability of material is improving  although lead times continue to be much longer than typical. Our material and stock build throughout the second half of 2021 and first quarter of 2022 combined with our multiple sources of global and local supply has helped us with these challenges  as reflected in: Our 11 manufacturing locations that had 100% on-time delivery in the second quarter 2022  Our SriCity  India facility posted record sales and an increase of 25% in our tank capacity. Chart China had first half 2022 record tank production of 333 units  while first half sales of vacuum insulated pipe from this site exceeded the total 2021 sales. Historical record sales for Europe. Historical record sales for European storage tanks. Highest number of shipped and completed bulk tanks (Europe and India) in our history.Cost of two of our top three raw materials have tempered. Specifically  as of June 30  2022  aluminum was down from the past three quarters’ highs and carbon steel (coil) was back to first quarter 2021 pricing.While regional logistic costs remained a challenge (and availability in Europe in particular)  the second quarter 2022 was our first quarter (perhaps in our history  but at least in the past two years!) where our freight and logistics costs incurred were net neutral with what we were able to pass to our customers (net zero impact to our P&L). We expect this pattern of net neutrality to continue for the foreseeable future. Previously  logistics costs had a net negative margin impact of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter 2021 and net negative of $0.6 million in the first quarter 2022.Our team members around the world continue to execute and support the broad-based demand lead-time requirements. This is reflected in our low total Chart voluntary turnover of 6%  compared to 28% from other global industrial companies (based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics 2021 manufacturing voluntary turnover rate; the Bureau of Labor Statistics has indicated that the measure of employee-initiated job separations is likely to remain elevated for the rest of 2022) as well as the dedication of our teams to deliver. Chart China deserves special recognition for exceeding their original forecast for the second quarter 2022 on sales and operating income even while they were under COVID-19 related lockdowns for the majority of the quarter. From a global perspective  we have seen less COVID-19 related absences in the second quarter 2022.As of June 30  2022  our team has achieved our lowest total recordable incident rate (“TRIR”) in our history at 0.57.The Not Yet Improving:We continue to be under Force Majeure on certain United States gas supply since the first quarter 2022 which causes additional cost and inefficiencies  yet it has become part of our normal operating procedure to utilize one of our leasing fleet trucks to transport our own gasses as/if needed.Material input costs  while tempering as described above  continue to be much higher than pre-COVID levels.Inflationary pricing for non-Bill-of-Material (“BOM”) items such as utilities  expenses and service items remain high.Whereas we have seen certain tempering in raw material input costs  specific component buy-outs continue to face significant pricing challenges; we have been addressing these in changes to our pricing index constructs in specific agreements as well as in our surcharges.More certifications drive further differentiation.As we have previously indicated  our competitive advantage stems from a variety of portfolio attributes  whether our core cryogenic engineering and manufacturing expertise  our global manufacturing footprint  or our broad-based certifications around the world for handling high pressure  low temperature molecules. In many cases  these certifications are difficult to achieve  rare in some cases  and generally all take process and time. Therefore  the more we have  in particular in earlier stage end markets  the more competitive advantage we have. We received our American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) XII certificate at our Theodore  Alabama facility in the second quarter 2022; there are only 30 companies globally (34 sites) that have this certificate  including us. Also  our Chart China factory is now certified for our duracyl product with a GB and DOT certification  and we are seeing international traction for our Earthly Labs small-scale carbon capture offering with our latest certification being the Canadian Registration in Alberta  Canada. Earlier in July 2022  our Chart China trailer facility passed the ASME XII qualification.Continuing to build capabilities and expand addressable markets via acquisitions and new partnerships; all with immediate synergies.In May 2022  we completed the acquisition of Fronti Fabrications  Inc. (“Fronti”) for $20 million (subject to customary adjustments). Fronti is a specialist in engineering  machining and welding for the cryogenic and gas industries  and also supplies new build pressure vessels  cold boxes and performs repairs with certification to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code. With over 20 years of experience in liquefaction  heat exchangers and cold boxes  Fronti adds a known team to expand Chart’s cold box manufacturing capacity and capability  including work currently underway on Chart hydrogen and helium liquefiers. Given our continued demand for Big LNG  small-scale LNG and hydrogen/helium liquefaction  having more than one United States cold box fabrication facility (in addition to our New Iberia  Louisiana location) adds agility and capacity to further improve our delivery lead-times and to prepare for the anticipated increase in demand in the coming years.Also  within the second quarter 2022  we completed the acquisition of CSC Cryogenic Service Center AB  a Swedish company (“CSC”) for approximately $4 million. CSC brings a strong service footprint in the Nordic Region with many overlapping customers to Chart  allowing us to broaden our service and repair presence geographically. Our strong original equipment installed base and continued forecasted growth in the Nordic region will benefit from this localized support. Not only does this expand our geographic footprint  it broadens our repair and service capabilities for mobile equipment  in particular trailers  as well as ISO containers  stationary and transportable tanks  pumps  flowmeters and LNG fueling stations. An immediate synergy success with CSC was our June 2022 signing of a full care service and maintenance services agreement with one of our original equipment Nordic region customers for their LNG vehicle fueling station network.In addition to this service & repair agreement  we signed seven other MOUs or long-term agreements (“LTA”) in the second quarter 2022  including another agreement for LNG  three for carbon capture (“CCUS”)  two for hydrogen and one for air-cooled heat exchanger master supply.Free cash flow positive and ahead of our prior expectations.In the second quarter 2022  our net cash provided by operating activities was $35 million  and when adjusted for unusual items  was $54 million. Second quarter 2022 free cash flow (net of capital expenditures of $17 million) was $18 million (adjusted FCF of $37 million). We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow will be in the range of $175 million to $225 million.“We continue to see broad-based demand across our end markets  with expectations for additional LNG projects and retrofits as well as a global focus on the energy transition ” stated Jill Evanko  Chart’s President and CEO. “Our team continues to execute on delivering our record backlog while keeping all acquisition integrations  capacity and productivity projects on schedule. Stronger than anticipated free cash flow in the second quarter 2022 coupled with our sequential quarterly margin improvement  record order book and cost controls set up not only a strong second half of 2022 but an even stronger 2023 and 2024.”2022 Guidance; Increased confidence in 2023 to 2025 outlooks.Our current 2022 full year sales guidance is narrowed within the prior guidance range. Full year 2022 sales guidance is in the range of $1.725 billion and $1.80 billion  compared to the prior sales guidance range of $1.725 billion to $1.85 billion. Current associated adjusted non-diluted EPS guidance is in the range of $5.20 to $5.60  compared to prior adjusted non-diluted EPS guidance range of $5.35 to $6.50. Our prior higher-end guidance range is not likely at this point in the year given timing of revenue recognition on larger project work  less than anticipated HLNG vehicle tank demand recovery early in 2022 (which is timing versus lost business)  and current macroeconomic market factors  including the inflationary environment and foreign exchange volatility. We have included in our current guidance the following considerations:(1) There were specific sales recognized in the second quarter 2022 that were pulled in from our previously forecasted third quarter 2022  taking advantage of the ability to ship older backlog sooner in the year. These were not additional sales above our guided sales.(2) The majority of the orders booked in the second quarter 2022  in particular given the widespread project work  will primarily be revenue recognized in 2023 through 2025  and have minimal to no impact on 2022 sales or EPS.(3) We do not include any second half 2022 additional Big LNG revenue from new orders in this outlook since the timing for revenue recognition is likely after 2022.(4) We do not include any meaningful second half 2022 recovery in our HLNG over the road vehicle tank demand in this guidance  which year-to-date 2022 has been significantly lower than originally anticipated heading into the year (this is viewed and articulated by our customers as temporary yet has been at very low order levels for longer than originally forecasted and is short-cycle book and ship product). Year-to-date through the second quarter 2022 HLNG vehicle tank orders were $10.7 million as compared to the same period in 2021 of $71.6 million.(5) We do not include any second half 2022 upside or “surprise” book and ship orders (product that books and ships in one to three months) for standard product (this does frequently occur yet is difficult to predict).(6) An increase to our current shares outstanding in our outlook are 35.86 million (prior guidance was 35.83 million).(7) Full year estimated tax rate of 20% (prior guidance was 19%).Our capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million for the full year 2022 (compared to prior outlook of $50 million to $55 million)  while our adjusted FCF is anticipated to be in the range of $175 million to $225 million (unchanged from prior guidance).And to conclude  given that we have over $1.1 billion of backlog for 2023 and beyond  our confidence in our next three-year forecast is high.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain statements made in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

8418,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/intercos-beauty-innovation-italy-1235262857/,After 50 Years in Business  Intercos’ Innovation Plans Keep Multiplying,Dario Ferrari  the visionary entrepreneur behind the Italian cosmetics manufacturer  recalls the turning points of his career and reveals what’s next for the beauty player.,MILAN — Fifty years young.That’s the impression one gets of Intercos Group through the words of Dario Ferrari  the visionary entrepreneur who established the Italian cosmetics manufacturer in 1972.“It’s just the beginning  in a certain way ” he said during a lengthy conversation at his office in Agrate Brianza — a 40-minute drive from Milan — where the company is headquartered.Ferrari said it took him all his life to put the firm in a “stronger than ever” position. After half a century of tweaks in the business model  IPOs (three tentative  one effective)  supply chain disruptions as well as experimenting with different approaches to trend forecasting and plenty of formulations  the founder believes there’s room to further grow in the industry.To do so  he might spice up his business’ recipe with new elements but said he’d never change its secret ingredient: innovation.Today  Intercos has 11 research centers  16 production plants and 16 sales offices worldwide  manufacturing and supplying everything from lipsticks and eye shadows to pencils and skin care to more than 700 international clients. Almost 1 000 out of its global 5 200 employees are dedicated to R&D  developing more than 1 300 new formulas per year.You May Also LikeInnovation has been the guiding force of the company  putting Ferrari in a privileged position to observe the many shifts in the beauty industry over the past five decades.Among his personal highlights  he mentioned the launch of the Prisma Shine patented technology for powders in 2011  which combine performance with special effects  such precise drawings on the texture; new technologies on the lipstick category centered on filling and assembly with silicon molds  as well as ideas borrowed from other fields.“I remember I went to see a pharmaceutical company not long time ago  and they were using an air system to grind the active ingredients to make them micro  very refined…We took the idea and we started to use it as well ” said Ferrari.Yet Intercos’ pivotal moment in terms of innovation traces back to the very beginning  when Ferrari got inspired by the production process behind decaffeinated coffee he saw at a friend’s coffee plant. “Coffee is a powder. To extract the caffeine they used a solvent  and when I saw the technology I said: ‘Wow we can adapt it to powder and eye shadow’ ” he recalled  underscoring how eye shadows at the time used to be “very dry and not comfortable.”The discovery enabled Intercos to develop unprecedented creamy  shiny formulations  with the extra benefit of being “easy to produce  less expensive and definitely longer lasting.”“Nobody had a product like this. That was really breaking through the system ” said Ferrari. Shortly after  this innovation led to the first turning point of his career.“I think that in 50 years  the first important step for the company occurred in 1982 ” he said  stressing that the first decade was spent to “learn a little bit about [the industry] and put together our business model.”“We’ve been very creative and innovative in those years. And in fact  what happened in 1982? Somebody knocked at the door and it was Estée Lauder ” said Ferrari  explaining that the American company offered him a $30-million deal at the time at the condition he started producing in the U.S. Ferrari agreed and set up a plant Stateside  but after finding out that Intercos also worked with other clients overall  the deal was turned into a 50-50 joint venture  with Estée Lauder taking over the whole American company after three years. “We built the best factory for them and they still have it in Bristol… While we kept our position as a creative lab for them ” said Ferrari.“But suddenly everybody started to wonder ‘Who’s this company making a joint venture with Estée Lauder?’ That’s why in the 1990s we grew tremendously… And it created a big problem because at the end of that [decade] everybody would think Intercos was a fantastic company but that didn’t deliver. In reality  our capacity was 100 and we had orders for 200. So from the early 2000s  we started to build factories ” said Ferrari  citing operations in the U.S.  China  Italy  Brazil  South Korea and  most recently  India.The group’s global presence came in handy even years later  as during the pandemic the local facilities and research hubs handed the firm a competitive advantage both in speeding up production and anticipating trends.“We gained a lot of space ” admitted Ferrari. “First  our big customers  the multinational groups  had [slowed down] for a couple of years because nobody went to the office… Our competitors have been somehow struggling  too ” he said. Conversely  a small group of top managers and R&D staffers at Intercos managed to go to the HQ and “keep the innovation going.”As result  the company maintained a strong position on the market  despite lockdowns and the disruption of the supply chain. To wit  in the first quarter of 2022  revenues grew 21 percent to 174.6 million euros compared to the same period last year. In 2021  the group totaled 673.7 million euros in revenues  up 11.1 percent versus 2020.Before the pandemic  other key changes of paradigm included transitioning from a solely product company to incorporating branding skills  therefore “acquiring a completely different know-how compared to what we used to have ” such as extra knowledge of customers and distribution.The listing on Euronext Milan at the end of last year added another piece to the acceleration puzzle. It also enabled Ferrari to finally tick off from his personal list the IPO goal  after that several plans shelved due to sudden changes in the economic climate throughout the years. “Being public  we can now attract investors and people. It’s a different situation to be in… And we’re going to have a very aggressive plan for the next three years.”Looking ahead  trend forecasting will play an increasing role for the company. Ferrari said this aspect “is becoming the most difficult part” of the job  noting that if Intercos has been anticipating trends for many years based on its experience  now that is no longer enough. The rapid change in young consumers’ behavior forced the company to invest heavily in “a completely different system of forecasting” called Intercos Intelligence and based on data collected both off- and online.Overall  Ferrari believes that open innovation will be the main driver across all industries. “Either you believe that only bright people work for you or you have to rely on bright people outside  so why not doing that? Big corporations have already started and so have we.”Last year the company inked a five-year agreement with the University of Milano-Bicocca to jointly conduct scientific research on new raw materials  formulations and sustainable processes aimed at developing innovative beauty products.Ferrari revealed he has also tapped an American start-up specialized in AI to further help with formulations. “We are very close to starting this process. It takes a long time because AI works well only if it is full of data  so we’ve been focusing on this part for the last six months ” he said.,neutral,0.07,0.91,0.02,mixed,0.27,0.15,0.58,True,English,"['Intercos’ Innovation Plans', '50 Years', 'Business', 'unprecedented creamy, shiny formulations', 'Italian cosmetics manufacturer', 'half a century', 'past five decades', 'Estée Lauder', 'first turning point', 'first important step', 'supply chain disruptions', '50-50 joint venture', 'R&D staffers', 'Intercos’ pivotal moment', 'U.S. Ferrari', 'first decade', 'first quarter', 'visionary entrepreneur', 'lengthy conversation', 'Agrate Brianza', 'business model', 'different approaches', 'trend forecasting', 'business’ recipe', 'new elements', 'secret ingredient', '11 research centers', '16 sales offices', 'eye shadows', 'skin care', '700 international clients', 'global 5,200 employees', '1,300 new formulas', 'guiding force', 'many shifts', 'personal highlights', 'Prisma Shine', 'special effects', 'precise drawings', 'new technologies', 'lipstick category', 'silicon molds', 'other fields', 'active ingredients', 'extra benefit', 'plant Stateside', 'other clients', 'best factory', 'creative lab', 'big problem', 'early 2000s', 'South Korea', 'global presence', 'local facilities', 'research hubs', 'competitive advantage', 'big customers', 'multinational groups', 'top managers', '174.6 million euros', 'same period', '673.7 million euros', '16 production plants', 'production process', 'decaffeinated coffee', 'coffee plant', 'privileged position', 'air system', '$30-million deal', 'small group', 'strong position', 'pharmaceutical company', 'American company', 'fantastic company', 'beauty industry', 'Dario Ferrari', 'three years', 'Intercos Group', '50 years', 'MILAN', 'impression', 'words', 'beginning', 'way', '40-minute', 'life', 'firm', 'stronger', 'tweaks', 'IPOs', 'tentative', 'effective', 'plenty', 'founder', 'room', 'innovation', 'everything', 'lipsticks', 'pencils', 'launch', 'technology', 'powders', 'performance', 'texture', 'filling', 'assembly', 'ideas', 'terms', 'friend', 'caffeine', 'solvent', 'time', 'discovery', 'career', 'Somebody', 'door', 'condition', 'Bristol', 'everybody', '1990s', 'reality', 'capacity', 'orders', 'factories', 'operations', 'China', 'Italy', 'Brazil', 'India', 'pandemic', 'trends', 'lot', 'space', 'couple', 'competitors', 'HQ', 'result', 'market', 'lockdowns', 'revenues']",2022-07-29,2022-07-29,wwd.com

(Cboe: CBOE) today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2022.""Cboe delivered strong second quarter results to close out an exceptional first half of 2022. Activity across our ecosystem—cash  data and derivatives—was robust "" said Edward T. Tilly  Cboe Global Markets Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""Many of our newer initiatives  like the extension of trading hours for SPX and VIX Options to nearly 24 hours-a-day  five days-a-week and the addition of Tuesday and Thursday expirations for SPX Weekly options  have outperformed our early expectations in 2022  further accelerating the strong growth across our core businesses. With the closing of the ErisX and NEO acquisitions in the second quarter  the entire Cboe team remains focused on extracting even greater value from the ecosystem we have created. The digital asset market environment has changed dramatically since we closed the ErisX transaction on May 2nd  which resulted in an accounting adjustment. We believe that the $220 million book carrying value reflects the reality of the market today  but in no way changes our enthusiasm for the digital asset space. We are intently focused on integrating our platforms and positioning Cboe for its next wave of growth in the quarters ahead.""""In the second quarter  Cboe produced record-setting revenue results as overall net revenues grew 21% year-over-year "" said Brian N. Schell  Cboe Global Markets Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. ""The benefits of the Cboe flywheel were apparent given the strong year-over-year growth from each category during the quarter  with net revenues from derivatives markets1 growing 30%  data and access solutions1 up 20%  and cash and spot markets1 growing 7%. Moving forward  we are increasing our 2022 total organic net revenue growth2 expectations  targeting 9% to 11% growth  up from our prior guidance range of 5% to 7%. In addition  our 2022 organic net revenue growth2 expectations for our Data and Access Solutions business are increasing to 10% to 13%  up from our prior guidance range of 8% to 11%. The upgraded guidance is a testament to not only the strength of the first half results  but the durability we expect to see in the revenue base moving forward. We look forward to building on the first half momentum with continued investment and integration across the Cboe platform.""*All comparisons are second quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.

(2) Specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the company's organic growth guidance  adjusted operating expenses guidance and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings guidance are not available. The company believes that there is uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to certain of its GAAP measures  primarily related to acquisition-related revenues and expenses that would be required to reconcile to GAAP revenues less costs of revenues  GAAP operating expenses and GAAP effective tax rate  which preclude the company from providing accurate guidance on certain forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

These measures are not in accordance with  or a substitute for  GAAP  and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include net transaction and clearing fees  adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  adjusted operating margin  adjusted net (loss) income allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share  effective tax rate on adjusted earnings  adjusted cash  EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release  including adjusted operating income  organic net revenue and adjusted operating expenses  provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.Organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  organic non-transaction revenue and organic net revenue guidance: These are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for the impact of our acquisitions for the period or guidance  as applicable. Management believes the organic net revenue growth and guidance measures provide users with supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing and future potential revenue performances and trends by presenting revenue growth and guidance excluding the impact of the acquisitions. Revenues from acquisitions that have been owned for at least one year are considered organic and are no longer excluded from organic net revenue from either period for comparative purposes.Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such  if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures  it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses  the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore  we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.Acquisition-related expenses: From time to time  we have pursued acquisitions  which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs  as well as legal  due diligence  impairment charges  and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size  timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly  we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.The tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of those items detailed below and are referred to as adjusted financial measures.Organic Net Revenue ReconciliationTable 3Three Months EndedSix Months Ended(in millions)June 30 June 30 Reconciliation of Revenue Less Cost of Revenue to Organic Net Revenue2022202120222021Revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue)$ 424.1$ 350.6$ 842.2$ 716.1Less acquisitions:Acquisition revenue less cost of revenues (inorganic net revenue)$ (9.9)$ —$ (18.3)$ —Organic net revenue$ 414.2$ 350.6$ 823.9$ 716.1Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP InformationThree Months EndedSix Months EndedTable 4June 30 June 30 (in millions  except per share amounts)2022202120222021Reconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to Non-GAAP(As shown on Table 1)Net (loss) income allocated to common stockholders$ (184.5)$ 105.2$ (74.9)$ 242.0Non-GAAP adjustmentsAcquisition-related expenses (1)14.31.816.35.2Investment establishment costs (2)——3.0—Gain on investment (3)(7.5)—(7.5)—Loan forgiveness (4)(1.3)—(1.3)—Amortization of acquired intangible assets (5)30.130.560.763.4Goodwill impairment (6)460.1—460.1—Impairment of investment (7)10.6—10.6—Total Non-GAAP adjustments506.332.3541.968.6Income tax expense related to the items above(143.2)10.0(151.9)(15.9)Tax reserves (8)——48.5—Deferred tax re-measurements———17.7Net income allocated to participating securities - effect on reconciling items(1.3)(0.1)(1.6)(0.2)Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders$ 177.3$ 147.4$ 362.0$ 312.2Reconciliation of Diluted EPS to Non-GAAPDiluted (loss) earnings per common share$ (1.74)$ 0.98$ (0.70)$ 2.26Per share impact of non-GAAP adjustments noted above3.410.404.100.65Adjusted diluted earnings per common share$ 1.67$ 1.38$ 3.40$ 2.91Reconciliation of Operating Margin to Non-GAAPRevenue less cost of revenue$ 424.1$ 350.6$ 842.2$ 716.1Non-GAAP adjustments noted above————Adjusted revenue less cost of revenue$ 424.1$ 350.6$ 842.2$ 716.1Operating expenses (9)$ 661.5$ 160.6$ 839.9$ 321.5Non-GAAP adjustments noted above504.532.3537.168.6Adjusted operating expenses$ 157.0$ 128.3$ 302.8$ 252.9Operating (loss) income$ (237.4)$ 190.0$ 2.3$ 394.6Non-GAAP adjustments noted above504.532.3537.168.6Adjusted operating income$ 267.1$ 222.3$ 539.4$ 463.2Adjusted operating margin (10)63.0 %63.4 %64.0 %64.7 %Reconciliation of Income Tax Rate to Non-GAAP(Loss) income before income taxes(256.8)179.2(31.9)372.1Non-GAAP adjustments noted above506.332.3541.968.6Adjusted income before income taxes$ 249.5$ 211.5$ 510.0$ 440.7Income tax (benefit) provision(72.3)73.743.0129.4Non-GAAP adjustments noted above143.2(10.0)103.4(1.8)Adjusted income tax expense$ 70.9$ 63.7$ 146.4$ 127.6Adjusted income tax rate28.4 %30.1 %28.7 %29.0 %(1) This amount includes professional fees and outside services and impairment charges related to the company's acquisitions.

The expenses or income related to the deferred compensation plans areincluded in ""Compensation and benefits"" ($1.9 million and $1.1 million in expense for the three months ended June 30  2022 and 2021  respectively and $2.5 million and $1.4 million in expense for the six months ended June 30  2022 and 2021  respectively)  and are directly offset by deferredcompensation income  expenses and dividends included within ""Other income  net"" ($1.9 million and $1.1 million in income  expense and dividendsin the three months ended June 30  2022 and 2021  respectively  and $2.5 million and $1.4 million in income  expense and dividends in the six monthsended June 30  2022 and 2021  respectively)  on the condensed consolidated statements of income. The deferred compensation plans' expenses arenot excluded from ""adjusted operating expenses"" and do not have an impact on ""Income before income taxes."" (10) Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenue less cost of revenue.EBITDA ReconciliationsEBITDA (earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to EBITDA acquisition-related expenses  gain on investment  loan forgiveness  investment establishment costs  goodwill impairment  and impairment of investment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income  as an indicator of the company's operating performance  or for cash flow  as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition  because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.Table 5Three Months EndedSix Months Ended(in millions  except percentages)June 30 June 30 Reconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to EBITDA and AdjustedEBITDA (Per Table 1)2022202120222021Net (loss) income allocated to common stockholders$ (184.5)$ 105.2$ (74.9)$ 242.0Interest expense  net14.612.325.424.6Income tax (benefit) provision(72.3)73.743.0129.4Depreciation and amortization40.240.681.182.6EBITDA$ (202.0)$ 231.8$ 74.6$ 478.6EBITDA Margin(47.6) %66.1 %8.9 %66.8 %Non-GAAP adjustments not included in above line itemsAcquisition-related expenses14.31.816.35.2Gain on investment(7.5)—(7.5)—Loan forgiveness(1.3)—(1.3)—Investment establishment costs——3.0—Goodwill impairment460.1—460.1—Impairment of investment10.6—10.6—Adjusted EBITDA$ 274.2$ 233.6$ 555.8$ 483.8Adjusted EBITDA Margin64.7 %66.6 %66.0 %67.6 %Table 6(in millions)June 30 December 31 Reconciliation of Cash and Cash Equivalents to Adjusted Cash20222021Cash and cash equivalents$ 373.3$ 341.9Financial investments68.537.1Less deferred compensation plan assets(25.5)(28.0)Less cash collected for Section 31 Fees(67.2)(25.9)Adjusted Cash$ 349.1$ 325.1Table 7(in millions)Reconciliation of Net Transaction and Clearing Fees by Business Segment –Three Months Ended June 30  2022 and 2021ConsolidatedOptionsN.A.

My name is Courtney and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note this call is being recorded and for the duration your lines will be on listen-only. [Operator Instructions]And I will now hand you over to your host  Stephane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board joined by Giorgio Modica  CFO to begin today's conference. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahGood morning  everybody  and thank you for joining us this morning for the Euronext second quarter 2022 result conference call and webcast. I am Stephane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext.And I will start with the highlights of the second quarter  before handing over to Giorgio Modica  Euronext CFO  who will further develop the main business and financial highlights of the quarter.Euronext  as you have seen  reported a solid performance in the second quarter of 2022  with revenue reaching EUR374.7 million. This demonstrated once again the strength of our business model in a quarter marked by continuous volatility. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew double-digit  compared to what was already a very good second quarter of 2021. This growth is  of course  partly due to the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group in the latest quarter compared with only two months of consolidation in Q2 2021. As you may remember  we completed the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on the 29th of April 2021.But this strong performance is also the outcome of solid organic growth across all our activities  driven by several specific factors. First  both non-volume-related revenue and trading activities were up plus 2.5% pro forma  compared to the performance of the second quarter of 2021 underlying revenue. Second  we continued the deployment of our strategic plan  unlocking the first revenue synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group  thanks to the migration of our Core Data Center to Bergamo. Non-volume-related revenue accounted that quarter for 59% of the total revenue and covered 144% of underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A.And on the cost side  the reported increase that you observe is -- in underlying expenses  excluding the D&A  primarily reflects the consolidation of costs from the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. But please note that we managed to partially offset this impact by continued cost control and delivery of additional synergies. Overall  these numbers translated into a plus 2.5% increase pro forma in adjusted EBITDA to EUR221.7 million  resulting in a net adjusted EBITDA margin of 59.2%  in the context of ongoing strategic project and integration costs. And this led to a solid plus 6.4% growth of our adjusted net income to EUR143.2 million. And adjusted EPS was up at EUR1.34  down by 6.1%.This second quarter  moving to Slide five  was a significant one for the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group. First  we successfully completed a key milestone Growth for Impact 2024 strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Center to new  fully green facilities in Bergamo near Milan. This success paves the way for the forthcoming migration of the Italian cash and derivatives markets to the Euronext state-of-the-art European proprietary trading platform optic by the end of H1 2023.Also  we moved one step closer to the European expansion of Euronext clearing with the adoption of the value at risk margin metallurgy for fixed income instruments in June and also the derisking of our investment portfolio that we have undertaken in July. This is a very significant set of steps because these two milestones are two important pillars for building the future of European operating -- or the European operating model of Euronext herein.I would like also to highlight that the contemplated acquisition of the underlying technology powering MTS and Euronext securities Milan from Nexi's capital markets activities that we announced in June is an important accelerator for the integration of your next leading fixed income trading platform and for Euronext securities Milan. In the second quarter 2022  we delivered EUR8.9 million of additional synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. These additional synergies are mainly related to the first phase of revenue synergies arising from the successful migration of Euronext Core Data Center.With regards to the targeted synergies related to the acquisitions of the Borsa Italiana Group and to the integration  we have now reached EUR24.1 million of cumulated run rate EBITDA synergies at the end of the second quarter. In other words  we have already achieved 25% of the targeted synergies four quarters after the closing of the acquisition. In total  we spent EUR36.7 million of cumulative implementation costs incurred at the end of the second quarter 2022. Out of which  EUR5.4 million were spent this quarter.Moving to Slide six. We are very proud to have completed this unprecedented migration of Euronext Core Data Center from Basildon in the U.K. near London to the Aruba Cloud data center in Bergamo near Milan in Italy  only 14-months after we first announced it in April 2021. Of course  beyond the strong rationale for relocating the Euronext Core European trading activities within the European Union following Brexit  this new best-in-class facility presents several very interesting business opportunities. It allows us to control and directly manage our core IT infrastructure  as well as to offer colocation services to our client  which were previously outsourced. The new revenue generated through colocation services are booked under the Euronext Technology Solutions business line. And the synergies-related to this Core Data Center achieved this quarter represent a first phase of synergies  with more services to come in 2023.The new core data center also represents a big advancement of our fit for 1.5 degree climate commitment. Because it is 100% powered by renewable energy  most -- much of which is self-produced through a large photovoltaic system and hydroelectric unit. It therefore allows Euronext to reduce the carbon footprint of the company  while also enabling colocation clients to lower their own environmental impact. This migration contributes materially to the achievement of our science-based climate target.Moving to Slide seven precisely on our climate commitments. As you may know it  in June  we disclosed our detailed greenhouse gas emission reduction targets  which are in line with the Paris Agreement and based on the principles of the Science-based Targets Institute. Concretely  we aim to reduce Euronext Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030  compared to the level of 2020  with further plans to reduce Euronext Scope 3 travel emissions by 46.2% by 2030  compared to the level of 2019.We recognize that the transition towards a more sustainable financial ecosystem is only possible if we do it collectively. Therefore  we will require Euronext suppliers  which represent 67% of Euronext greenhouse gas emission  to set their own Scope 1 and Scope 3 emission reduction target by 2027.These ambitious objectives will be achieved. And I want to stress that these ambitious objectives will be achieved without any purchase of offsetting credit in any way whatsoever. The ambition will be achieved to a performance transformation of our operations  mapped with tangible actions targeting Scope 1  Scope 2 and Scope 3 emission. And those include energy efficiency upgrades  the decommissioning of our vehicle fleet and the implementation of a sustainable travel program.Moving to Slide eight. Lastly  let me turn the spotlight on the successful launch of Euronext Tech Leaders initiative  which we launched last month  together with a network of 13 European and international key partners. The European-wide program consists of several complementary stand: first  the newly created market segment  with more than 100 tech leaders listed on Euronext market  representing more than EUR1 trillion of aggregated market capitalization; second  a full suite of services  providing visibility  communication and promotion of the tech leaders for international investors  and improved trading conditions  notably for retail investors; third  the creation of a community of European tech leaders within Euronext market; and finally  an enlarged pre-IPO services offerings for technology companies.Following the kickoff of the Tech Leaders Initiatives  two new companies have already joined the segment via their listing on Euronext market. DE NORA which listed in Milan in June  and Deezer which is in July on Euronext Paris. We have early July launched the Euronext Tech Leaders Index  tracking the performance of the 110 companies within this segment. Thanks to this initiative  we are now more than ever positioned to support today's and tomorrow's financing of the growth of Euronext -- the growth of European unicorns.I now hand over to Giorgio Modica for the review of our second quarter performance.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much  Stephane  and good morning  everyone.I'm now on Slide 10. In the second quarter of 2022  Euronext's consolidated revenue and income grew 2.3%  compared to the second quarter of 2021  underlying revenue pro forma for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Please note that this excludes EUR6.5 million of non-underlying transitional income related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group in April 2021  i.e.  prior to the closing of the acquisition.On a reported basis  income revenue grew 14% to EUR374.7 million  representing an increase of EUR45.9 million. On a like-for-like basis  which means excluding pretty much the Borsa Italiana consolidation  Euronext's consolidated revenue was up 2.4%  compared to the second quarter of 2021. These solid results were driven by the growth of our non-volume-related business and trading operation. Trading revenue increased to EUR129.2 million  up 3.7% pro forma and 14.6% on a reported basis  resulting from a dynamic activity in all asset classes  strong revenue capture and a good performance of the fixed income business.Post trade revenue increased 1.8% pro forma and 12.6% on a reported basis to EUR93.9 million  driven by the continued strong activity in clearing  exceptionally high level of net treasury income and a good performance of Euronext securities  despite the normalizing settlement environment. Advanced data service revenue increased to EUR52 million  up 2.4% pro forma and 11.9% on a reported basis due to a solid core data business performance.Listing revenue grew 7.8% pro forma and 15% on a reported basis to EUR55.4 million  demonstrating the resilience of the business and the attractivity of the offering. In terms of revenue mix  this quarter  non-volume-related revenue accounted for 59% of total group revenue versus 60% pro forma the same quarter last year  demonstrating the weight of our non-volume-related activity even during periods of high volatility in volumes. Lastly  non-volume-related revenue covered 144% of our underlying operating costs  excluding D&A  compared to 150% pro forma last year.Let's move now to the next slide for listing. Listing revenue was EUR55.4 million this quarter  an increase of 7.8% on a pro forma basis and 15% on a reported basis  compared to the second quarter of 2021. As I already mentioned during our last call  according to the principle of IFRS 15  admission revenues are recognized over a period of time  which for Euronext mostly ranges between three and five years. As a result  this quarter  we continue to benefit from the exceptional level of activity we recorded last year in 2021.In detail  during the second quarter of 2022  Euronext maintained its leading position in Europe for primary equity listing  counting 19 new listing in a challenging environment. This quarter  EUR1.1 billion was weighed on Euronext primary markets  which represented more than 50% of the total money raised on primary markets in Europe.As far as secondary issue are concerned  EUR11.1 billion was raised in the second quarter of 2022. Euronext also reinforced its position as the leading venue for bond listing worldwide  with over 52 000 bonds listed across all Euronext markets  and continuous growth of our ESG bond listing franchise. This quarter EUR241.7 billion in net was raised on Euronext markets. Overall  this brings us to a total of EUR253.8 billion raised in equity and debt on Euronext market in the second quarter of 2022.Now moving to the next slide. Before dipping dive into the financial performance of our trading business  I would like to spend a minute and walk you through the different metrics demonstrating the superior market quality of our cash market. This quality is even more emphasized during periods of high volatility. Throughout the COVID crisis  we observed a much more resilient liquidity environment on Euronext market  compared to competing MTFs  where liquidity faded as soon as volatility started to spike.During the last two quarter  Euronext maintain its position as the largest  deepest and most stable single liquidity pool in Europe  offering the highest quality of execution to its market participants. On average  during the second quarter of 2022  Euronext recorded that EBBO present on blue chip stocks that was 20% higher than the one of any competing MTF. The difference becomes even more visible when looking at the EBBO setting  which was 4 times to 5 times higher on average at Euronext versus the multilateral trading facilities.Another indicator of our market quality are the lower markouts  thanks to the heterogeneity of investors in our market  which provides a much healthier liquidity environment than competing MTFs. Lastly  I would also like to stress that even during periods of volatility  which generally lead to widening of spreads across European equity markets  Euronext maintain the lowest average spreads  compared to the other markets.Let's move now to the financial performance of our trading business next on Slide 13  and let's start with trading. On a pro forma basis  including Borsa Italiana  ADV increased by 3.3% to EUR11.6 billion  supported by a volatile trading environment. Average revenue capture over the quarter was at 0.51 basis point  resulting from an active management  and the market share averaged 67.1%  both including cash markets in Italy. Cash trading revenue increased 1.4% pro forma and 7.4% on a reported basis to EUR75.3 million.Moving on to derivatives. Derivatives trading revenue was up 8.3% pro forma and 14.3% on a reported basis to EUR14.9 million  due to lower volumes  but higher average fees mainly linked to a better mix of products. Pro forma average daily volumes on financial derivative was down 4.7% from the second quarter of 2021  reflecting a decrease in equity future and option trading. Commodities pro forma average daily volume decreased 4.4% this quarter  reflecting the high price environment for agriculture commodity derivatives. On the other side of the quarter  the average revenue capture for derivative reached EUR0.32 per lot  as I said  mainly thanks to a mix effect.Lastly  on to fixed income trading. Fixed income trading reported revenues at EUR24.9 million  primarily resulting from the consolidation of MTS. On a pro forma basis  fixed income revenue increased 2.4%. In the second quarter of 2022  MTS cash generated EUR16.6 million of revenues and MTS Repo generated EUR5.4 million of revenues  in a market dominated by increasing interest rates.MTS cash posted a solid performance  mainly thanks to the very high level of activity in the first two months of the second quarter. And ADV record at EUR22.7 billion  down 16.8% versus a very strong second quarter of 2021. MTS Repo trading saw a strong traction this quarter  with term adjusted ADV up 25% to EUR347.5 billion.Continuing with trading  let's move on Slide 14. The second quarter of 2022 saw a strong performance for Euronext FX in terms of both revenue and average daily volumes  thanks to the positive impact of volatility. Euronext reported average spot effect trading volumes of EUR23.6 billion  up 27% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Spot effects trading revenue increased 27.6%  compared to the second quarter of 2021 at EUR7.3 million. Our trading reported EUR6.9 million in revenue  a growth of 3.4%  compared to the same quarter last year as a result of a larger footprint of Central Europe and in the U.K. and a very strong position in the Nordics in the second quarter of 2022.Average daily day ahead power traded was 2.52 terawatt hour  with an increase of 15.9% versus the same quarter last year. And average daily intraday power traded was 0.09 terawatt hour  up 27.5% compared to the second quarter of 2021.Moving to Slide 15. Revenue from our post-trade activities  including net treasury income  increased 18%  EUR109.6 million. Clearing revenue was up 18% this quarter and 5.5% on a pro forma basis to EUR31.4 million  resulting from the volatile trading environment as well to the higher treasury income from LCH SA. On a like-for-like basis  clearing revenue was up 4.1% year-on-year. Net treasury income through the CCP business of Euronext Clearing reached an exceptionally high level of EUR15.7 million. This performance reflects a very high level of margin posted over the quarter and should not consider as a stable one.But let me further develop on the net treasury income. In line with the road map to make Euronext Clearing a leading European clearinghouse  we decided to take step to neutralize the expected impact of interest rate variation on our net trading treasury income going forward. Euronext Clearing held a portfolio of fixed income security of approximately EUR4 billion to EUR5 billion  with a 12-month average maturity. This portfolio represented approximately 25%  30% of the margin collected from clearing members  while the rest was deposit at variable rate  mainly at ECB.In the context of the increasing interest rate  we decided to progressively exit our investment portfolio. In particular  Euronext Clearing disposed the part of its portfolio maturing after the 1st May 2023  which represent approximately 50% of the overall portfolio  while it will hold until maturity the rest of the portfolio. This means that at beginning of the second quarter of 2023  Euronext Clearing will hold no outright portfolio investment portfolio.This decision will have the following implication. The surplus regulatory capital of Euronext is expected to increase. The decrease of regulatory capital requirement for Euronext Clearing linked to the divestment of the portfolio will more than compensate the negative impact on regulatory capital of the EUR35 million let loss resulting from the disposal. This loss will be booked in the third quarter of 2022 as a part of our non-underlying net treasury income. The net treasury income on the margin collected will stabilize then around 20 basis point  except in the fourth quarter of 2022 when we expect a margin of around 10 basis point and in the first quarter of 2023  when we expect a margin of around 15 basis point.Finally  as the sale of the portfolio will have no negative impact on the regulatory available capital of the Group  Euronext decided that the dividend for the fiscal year 2022 will be adjusted exceptionally to neutralize any negative impact of this operation.Now let's move back to the business performance of the quarter and move to the custody and settlement. Custody and settlement and other post-trade revenue encompassing the activity of the four CSD we operate under Euronext Securities brand was up 10.1% to EUR62.5 million on a reported basis. The performance illustrates a significant contribution of Euronext Security Milan and a diversified business model  enabling to capture value in the context of normalizing settlement activity. On a pro forma basis  revenue is up 0.1%.Moving to Slide 16. Advanced Data Service revenue was up 11.9% to EUR52 million  this represent a 2.4% increase on a pro forma basis  compared to the second quarter of 2021  driven by strong traction of our Core Data business. Investor Service revenue was at EUR2.3 million in the second quarter of 2022  up 4.9%  reflecting the continued expansion of the franchise. Lastly  on Technology Solution  revenue was up 5.6%  compared to the second quarter of ‘21 to EUR24.1 million as a result of the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Technology business. On a pro forma basis  Technology Solution revenue decreased 8.4%.Moving to Slide 18 for the financial highlights of the quarter. I would like to start with the EBITDA bridge. Euronext adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 12.3% to EUR221.7 million. On a pro forma basis  adjusted EBITDA was up 2.5%  demonstrating our ability to capture value and maintain our trademark cost discipline. Please note that the increase of cost in the second quarter of 2022 is not linked to inflation  but to the post-pandemic context. The normalization of the context triggers higher costs linked to be back at the office  higher travel and marketing expenses.The adjusted EBITDA margin slightly decreased to 59.2% this quarter from 60% the same quarter last year. On a like-for-like basis  EBITDA margin was 58.3% this quarter and adjusted EBITDA increased 1.7%. Finally  the non-underlying costs  excluding D&A  are mainly linked to the integration of Borsa Italiana.Moving to Slide 19 for the bridge on net income. Net income increased this quarter 37.2% to EUR118.9 million. On a pro forma basis  the net income increased 25.6%  resulting from the following elements. Pro forma EBITDA grew EUR23.8 million  as we just discussed. D&A was broadly in line  with a slight increase of EUR0.5 million. The net financing income is down versus last year as it is not impacted by the cost of the bridge financing for the acquisition of Borsa Italiana  I would like also to highlight that we exited the swap we had on our EUR500 million inaugural bond. This means that now 100% of our debt benefit from fixed and very competitive terms.Results from equity investment decreased by EUR1.1 million. As exceptionally  in the second quarter of 2021  we received the dividend of Sicovam  not distributed in 2020  due to the pandemic situation. I would like to highlight as well that the non-underlying costs in the bridge are mainly represented by DNA  namely the PPA amortization of our acquisition.Lastly  income tax for the second quarter of 2022 was EUR45.2 million. This translated into an effective tax rate for the quarter of EUR27.1 million. Adjusted for non-underlying costs  adjusted net income was EUR143.2 million. And adjusted EPS is down 6.1% to EUR1.43 per share this quarter. If we look at the performance of the first six months  adjusted EPS is at EUR2.89 per share  up 0.6% versus the first six months of last year at EUR2.87 per share.Moving to the next slide  Slide 24  the cash flow generation and leverage. Net operating cash flow amounted to EUR76.8 million. Excluding the impact on net working capital from Nord Pool and Euronext Clearing  net operating cash flow accounted for 42.1% of EBITDA  impacted by the seasonal payment of taxes.I would like to remind that there are specifically high tax outflows in France and Italy in the second quarter of the year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.4 times in the second quarter of '21 at the end  slightly up compared to the previous quarter  reflecting the payment of the 2021 dividend  partially offset by the cash flow generation of the period.Moving on to Slide 21  for the evolution of our liquidity position over the quarter. I would like to highlight that our liquidity position remains strong  above EUR1.3 billion  including the undrawn RCF of EUR600 million  and excluding the cash currently in Transit and Nord Pool.That's it for me. And with this  I would like to give back the floor to Stephane.Stephane BoujnahThank you  Giorgio. I would like to -- before moving to the Q&A  I would like to emphasize that our 2022 dividend will not be impacted negatively by the change in our investment portfolio policy and will be adjusted accordingly  as Giorgio said  I'm now available for your questions  together with Giorgio Modica  Anthony Attia and Simon Gallagher.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes in from the line of Kyle Vytorin from KBW. Please go ahead.Matt MoonHi  good morning. This is actually Matt Moon on for Kyle Vyt. I just had one on the Euronext Clearing investment portfolio rundown by the first quarter '23 end. Just to be clear  can you just clarify the size of that contribution to NTI? Is that the entirety of that NTI line? Or will there still be a portion of the margin that will be invested in shorter duration  if not overnight rates?And could you provide a little bit more detail on how much capital this actually frees up for you on an ongoing basis as well? And maybe just expand upon the broader rationale for the decision. It sounds like it's related to reducing interest rate volatility. But just wanted to hear your thoughts -- expanded thoughts there. Thanks.Stephane BoujnahGiorgio?Giorgio ModicaYes  absolutely. So what was implicit in what I just described is the proceeds of the disposal are going to be invested at TCB at variable rate. So what we're going to see is that progressively  the 25%  30% that we were investing in fixing some security are going to gradually reduced to zero  which means that everything is going to be invested at variable rates.So what are the steps? The first step  as I said  is that we did cut the position by two. So we moved from 25% to around 10% invested in fixed income securities. And then in the next six  seven months  this position will gradually go to zero. And at that point in time  the result of our investment are going to be completely at variable rate. So the logic is simply as we are entering a phase of expected increase of interest rate  and the number of hikes between now and the next couple of years can be significant. We wanted to have a portfolio that better reflects the current environment. So as I said  I already commented on the level that this new strategy will provide around 20 basis point. And as well in terms of size  I believe that I covered that as well  the portfolio was in between EUR4 billion and EUR5 billion. Now it's divided by two. And again  by the beginning of next year  it's going to be zero.Matt MoonOkay  great. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Haley Tam calling from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.Haley TamGood morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Can I have three  please? Two on synergies and one on fixed income. Firstly  on the synergies from the data center migration  can you confirm whether all of those synergies are now affected in the EUR8.9 million annualized benefit you saw in Q2? Or is there still further opportunities to capture from the extra services you can offer to your users?Secondly  Nexi  Capital Markets Technology business. You said it'd be an accelerator of integration of MTS fixed income and Euronext Securities Milan. Are there any further comments on the likely timing and scale of the additional synergies from that acquisition?And then the third question  just on fixed income  I guess  both from a listing and a trading perspective. Can you give us any idea of what you might expect in terms of the impact on trading and listing of the current environment? So I guess I'm thinking about the political uncertainty in Italy  the rising ECB rates  the end of the pandemic emergency purchase program and also the new transmission protection instruments. I guess there's a lot going on. Your help to understand how this might impact you would be very much appreciated. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahMaybe  Anthony  you can answer on the outlook for the listing business considering the macro environment. And Giorgio will answer your question on synergies and on the Nexi capital markets position.Anthony AttiaThank you  Stephane. Good morning  Hal. Your question was about the bond listing business in Europe. So we have several observations we can share with you. The first one is the current environment has significantly slow down the CLOs program  the collateral loan obligation program  so that's the first impact. Now from a corporate bond point of view  we see a sustained demand so far. And so it's -- we don't see any negative impact. And obviously  from the point of view of the sovereign debt  there is a significant activity.Giorgio ModicaYes. First  I wanted to start because I now remember that I missed the part of the previous question. So when it comes to capital release  I cannot be super specific  but I can give you an order of magnitude. We are talking of high single-digit million euro in terms of capital release net loss. The second element on the synergies  the EUR8.9 million are for the vast majority linked to the transition of the data center  but are not 100% linked to that. We expect further synergies in the course of 2023 related to that activity. And overall  we're expecting a number of synergies coming from the data center  which is of around EUR10 million.And then when it comes to the next question  which is around the acquisition  the transaction is not yet closed. We confirm that we expect the transaction to close by the end of the year. It's too early to give more details. But we confirm that we expect this transaction to generate a positive return and in line with our cost of capital.Haley TamThank you.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Arnaud Giblat calling from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.Arnaud GiblatGood morning. I've got three questions  please. You helpfully gave guidance on the future net interest margin to be expected. I'm just wondering if you could talk about the drivers of cash balances and what the sensitivities are to different market inputs.Second  you're running quite a bit ahead of your cost guidance if I annualize H1. Are you expecting a significant step-up in investments for H2 to get you to your guidance? Or more -- or is the upside risk there? And finally  I hear that there might be some realignment of pricing in Italy. It's coming up soon. Is that something you can confirm? And could you maybe quantify the upside risk there? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahArnaud  could you -- this is Stephane. I believe I got it. Can you rephrase your first question  because it was not very clear to me? The second question on the cost guidance and the third one on pricing was very clear  but the first one was not clear to me.Arnaud GiblatYes. No. So the guidance you gave on net interest margin is pretty clear  20 basis points once you've disposed your portfolio. I'm just wondering how to think about cash balances. What are the drivers for that to think about? What are the macro inputs?Stephane BoujnahOkay. So Giorgio.Giorgio ModicaAbsolutely. So there are three elements to the question. One element is clearly the volatility of the market  because the more volatile  the more -- the risk model command for a higher level of collateral from clearing members. And it is under clearly -- is difficult to predict. But assuming a situation that stays as it is today  we should expect a relatively high level of collateral. If I look in the last 12  24 month  the range of collateral required is around -- in between EUR15 billion and EUR22 billion  this is what we have recorded.Then going forward  there are going to be a number of moving part. And clearly  I can comment on the situation  pre-expansion of services provided by Euronext Clearing to the Euronext market. So we have announced migration to a change to the VAR model. This will have a slight impact  which is single-digit  but it's difficult to be quantified the next year. So the more precise range that I can give to you is that in the past  we have had between EUR15 billion and EUR22 billion. The impact on VAR should not be disproportionate on those level. And if the level of volatility is going to remain high  we should expect to have high level of collateral.Then on your second question around the cost  we did reduce by EUR10 million last quarter. The target  we are holding up well to achieve that. And this quarter  we don't feel comfortable in changing that. We will clearly  as always  reassess. Then the final point on fee changes  I wouldn't call it fee changes. Clearly  as you know  next year  we're going to migrate to a new technology. And we will look at some form of harmonization between the fees across our markets. The impact of that  we will -- it's too early to comment.Arnaud GiblatThanks.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Mike Werner calling from UBS. Please go ahead.Mike WernerThank you very much for the presentation. Just one question. We've seen Europe developing or in the process of trying to develop a consolidated tape for the markets here. I just wanted to get your view on that and what the potential impact could be to Euronext? Thanks.Stephane BoujnahWe are in intense conversations with all the relevant constituencies involved in those debates. At this particular moment  the debate is on the table of the Council of the European Union and at the European Parliament. There is a proposal in the table from the European Commission. There is an initial view from the reporter in the Parliament. We do believe that there is still room for flexibility  because clearly  there is a misunderstanding at this stage about what is the core -- what are the core fragmentation issues. And the core fragmentation issues in Europe are with the OTC derivatives  ETFs and fixed income  not with equity markets. So these discussions are ongoing.Clearly  it's too early to tell what would be the implications for Euronext  because we don't even know whether it will be a post-trade consolidated tape  a pre-trade consolidated tape  a real-time consolidated tap. Beyond the phrase consolidated tape  you have plenty of solutions that will have fundamentally different implications  not only for Euronext  but for the full market. And also  these discussions are taking in parallel to other discussions about the market architecture and the future of systematic internalizers and the rules applying thereof. So it's really  really too early to give a final care to provide you something that you could put in your model because it was in progress.Mike WernerThank you.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Benjamin Goy calling from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Benjamin GoyYes  hi. Good morning. Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank. Just one major question left  and sorry to stand at one of these conference calls. Because your yield management was again very good  so I just was wondering  because there seems to be a recurring element  what is the outlook here? And are you more positive on a sustainably higher rate in cash equities going forward? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo I'll leave the floor to Simon Gallagher  the Head of Cash and Derivative Markets.Simon GallagherThank you for your questions. So as we said  the robust yield management at Euronext is a result of a highly segmented pricing strategy. And the outlook for the yield management is broadly stable over the next quarters. And as Giorgio said  there'll be opportunities with the onboarding of the Italian markets for further segmentation and yield management.Giorgio ModicaMaybe a follow-up comment on my side. You might remember in the past  we guided for a 0.50 basis point. That was Euronext standalone  the 0.51 we're posting today includes the durative impact from Borsa Italiana. Just to clarify that.Benjamin GoyYes. And should we then take the 0.51 as the run rate going forward? Or what was the stability we're referring to?Giorgio ModicaI mean  what I would say is that if we look at the previous quarter at 0.47  we were -- in Euronext term standalone  we were ahead of the target of 0.50 on a stand-alone basis. So I would look at the 0.51 as a high number. So I guess  standing slightly below 0.5 is something that is a sustainable longer term.Benjamin GoyUnderstood. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Johannes Thormann calling from HSBC. Please go ahead.Johannes ThormannGood morning  everybody. Two questions from my side left. First off  on the net interest margin in the Clearing business. Do you -- just because it was not clear to me  do you keep it flat at 20 bps? Or also  do you want to benefit from future ECB rate hikes?And secondly  on your agriculture trading activity  it looks a bit counterintuitive that the volumes continue to trend down. As normally with higher prices  trading activity goes up  also in other commodities like oil and gas. Okay  you can also hint to power probably where the effects are mixed. But normally  you would say historically high prices trigger higher activity. So what is your reason or your thinking why those volumes are so weak? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahGiorgio?Giorgio ModicaYes. So starting with your second question -- on your first question. So the idea  and what we're going to implement is pretty simple  a variable -- fully variable liability and fully variable assets. So the 20 bps are going to be independent of the level of interest rate as long as  at least  but it's too early to tell  and we don't see that coming in the short future  the situation will stabilize.Your second question on commodities. You need to consider several elements  including the seasonal effect  and the fact that the harvest season is happening in the third quarter. So you should not look directly at the second quarter as a good proxy of what could happen going forward.And final comment in this respect  that we remain mainly a physical market  which means that the significant portion of the trading is done by not by the financial player  but by farmers hedging the product. And this gives us to a certain extent a limitation to the volumes. But again  you should look at the evolution of volumes  considering that -- especially milling wheat is a seasonal activity and a seasonal business. And in the third quarter  we have a good sign that seems to point out that the third quarter  which is  again  the harvesting is going to be a good quarter.OperatorThank you. The next question comes in from the line of Ian White calling from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.Ian WhiteHi  good morning. Thanks for the presentation. Thanks for taking my questions. I also had three  please. First of all  on the previous call  I think you said with regard to the medium-term revenue guidance of 3% to 4% that you were kind of considering whether that was still the right range  and you might think about coming back to us with an update on that. Just wondered if you could provide latest thoughts around whether that 3% to 4% is still the correct range  please.Secondly  just in terms of the IPO market. I acknowledge the points you made about market share. But obviously  IPO market has been very weak across Europe in the first half of the year. Is there anything you can say in terms of the pipeline  for example  that you see in terms of appetite to issue on Euronext markets when conditions normalize?And just final one on regulation again. There seems to be some discussion at the sort of European level about regulation for dark pools  and in particular  scrapping the double volume cap mechanism to sort of stave off competition from the U.K. effectively. Just wondered if you could share any thoughts around that too  please  and the impact you might see on Euronext markets.Giorgio ModicaYes. Basically  the limits on dark pool trading were to be removed?Ian WhiteThank you.Stephane BoujnahI'll take the third question and second question and Giorgio will cover the question on the top line guidance. On the regulatory questions  as I told on the consolidated tape issues  the discussions are ongoing. The discussions you are referring to are part of a debate on the market architecture relating in part to the future of systematic internalizers. Whatever the solution will be will be a package deal consolidating the -- all the parameters of the debate  the future dark pool  the future of systematic internalizers  the future of consolidated tape  if any. So I think it would be totally speculative and artificial and unstable to make any comments about the likely consequences of that particular discussion at the moment.On the IPO markets  we are in a situation which is ambivalent. On the one hand  there is definitely a post in a number of listing. But the IPO market is not closed. Since the beginning of the year  we had 41 listing on Euronext market  which compares to 104 last year. This is not as dynamic for sure  but this is not a closed market. It's a market where -- which is more selective and where many issuers are postponing their project.What is really interesting is that Euronext remains the venue of choice for listing  in particular  for international listing. When you compare the numbers of listings on Euronext since the beginning of the year with the other European venues  you have 41 listing on Euronext since the beginning of the year. You have 19 on the London Stock Exchange and 3 on Deutsche Borse. And when it comes to international listings  i.e.  listings from companies that are not from issuers that have their legal headquarter within Euronext countries  we had 10 of those listings out of 41  whereas there were only four non-U.K. listing in the London Stock Exchange since the beginning of the year and two at Deutsche Borse.So my point is that the competitiveness of Euronext as the venue of choice for listing  in particular  for international listing in Europe is there  just because we now have 25% of the equity traded in Europe that are trading on Euronext market. And we have now the deepest liquidity pool and the deepest aggregate market capitalizations. It's between EUR6.4 trillion and EUR6.8 trillion of aggregate market capitalization that you find on Euronext market  compared to -- which is approximately twice the size of the aggregate market capitalization of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange and approximately 3 times the size of the Deutsche Borse aggregate market capitalization. So this is the venue of choice big time.And I just want to underline that 50% of the listings this year were tech companies. And with the initiatives we have launched  the Euronext tech leaders initiative  we are seeing a momentum and appetite for technology companies in Europe that consider that this segment  this European tech leader segment  is now the place to list when you are a technology company in Europe. That's why we had already just in the past few weeks two tech listings  one in Milan  one in Paris  in this segment. So we are confident that despite the current volatility  uncertainty on pricing and valuation  the fundamental pipeline is there. Companies are there. Appetite of investors is there. It's just that volatility makes standard IPO process more complicated than when the outlook is more predictable  so I'm confident.Giorgio  on the top line?Giorgio ModicaYes. And maybe last time around  there was a slight misunderstanding that I wanted to clarify. So it's clear that we are always looking to give to the market the most accurate targets. But I didn't mean that every quarter  we would have reopened the topic on long-term target. Again  it's not even 12 months since the beginning of -- when we launched the Investor Day. And the market situation is such that we believe that it is not the right moment to do that. And it might not be the right moment even next or the following one. So we will proactively communicate when we believe that the conditions are such to update this target. But again  I was not intending to give an update this quarter. Thank you.Ian WhiteThanks. Appreciate it.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Tobias Lukesch calling from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.Tobias LukeschYes. Good morning  also three questions from my side  please. First  again  on the disposal of the investment books. Just out of curiosity  were you in discussions with the regulators about that investment portfolio? And to understand the mechanics basically of the net interest income  so you're charging 20 bps as a base  if I understand you correctly  which at a EUR20 billion cash balance makes a kind of EUR40 million per year. So -- and if the ECB rates were to rise into a positive territory  i.e.  25%  would that imply kind of a 5 bps top-up basically on the whole amount?Secondly  on the squeeze of the sub-CSDs  can you quantify basically the positive impact on your business from that side?And thirdly  on the listing again  how should we think about the revenue line development in ‘23 given the lower share prices in general and the fact that it's -- the base is also for your fees? I mean  with IFRS  I know you kind of smoothed these revenue generation. So should we rather expect to continue to see solid growth in '23? Or might there be a little bad surprise on that side? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahTobias  can you repeat the second question  which was not very clear?Tobias LukeschOn the squeeze of the sub-CSDs? Yes  I mean  in that market  I mean we realize  especially also some of the countries where sub-CSDs providers go out of business  basically and where the business is then shared between primary clients  be it a big investment bank and you guys  to favor potentially of the client. But there  I think there's a chunk of business also that flows then in your P&L. And I was just wondering if this is something which moves the needle a bit on the revenue outlook and growth potential.Stephane BoujnahSo I'll take the questions on the listing and on the fees. And Anthony will take the question on CSDs and Giorgio will answer on the regulators on the NTI. So clearly  our listing fees are not massively driven by underlying valuations. So in general  the underlying valuation is not affecting our listing policy revenues. So that's clear. So I'll leave the floor to Anthony to complement that point or to provide additional nuances and to cover the CSDs point.Anthony AttiaThank you  Stephane. Just to complement the yearly fees on equity listing  the valuation that is taken into account is the one at the year-end. And so that gives you an idea of the impact of the evolution of the valuations. But so currently  the revenues that we declare are both impacted by IFRS 15  obviously  as you said  the virus. But also they are capturing the market situation at the end of last year. On your CSD question.Tobias LukeschSorry. And that I was just wondering  looking into next year  if this is a kind of a linear approach we should apply i.e.  market down 10%  listing down 10%? Is that something we can assume? Or would that be penalizing you too much?Anthony AttiaNo  no. First of all  we don't want to provide any kind of forward-looking view on this. But again  the level of reported leasing fees capture the IFRS 15 element. And also  we have a fee adjustment that are done in order to remain close to the market. So we -- your statement is not correct.And now on the Nordic CSD situation  as you pointed out  there are some changes in the ecosystem in the Nordic countries around the value chain. As we explained during the Investor Day last year  we are working with our clients to capture some of these changes and deliver some services as an outsourcing partner. So this is the development of post-trade services in the Nordics. Also  you might have seen that we have published a news about some significant U.K. custodian becoming a direct client of Euronext Securities Copenhagen. This is also part of these changes. So for our CSD business  the trend is positive on that particular topic.Giorgio ModicaYes. So on my side  just an additional element on listing. It is important to highlight that the equity annual fees represent 25%  30% of the total revenues. So it's a relatively small portion. And as Anthony said  a decrease in market capitalization is not equally reflected in a decrease on the revenue capture.So on the NTI  another element to clarify  our decision is a decision of value maximization. It has nothing to do with regulatory approval  et cetera. So we always operate within the boundaries of what we can do. We are only adjusting our investment strategy to an evolving market condition. And the result of that is that  as this part of the clearing business is  in fact  the spread business  we -- this is the margin that we will apply  having assets and liabilities at variable rate. So just -- I take the opportunity of your question to say that  again  this decision has nothing to do with funding workforce. It's a decision of maximization. We don't want to take any risk. Our clearing houses are more than sufficiently capitalized. And actually  as I said  this decision will further increase the level of regulatory capital available. So it's more of a business decision than anything else.Tobias LukeschUnderstood. Thank you  Giorgio. But sorry for asking again here. If the ECB rates go to 50 bps  do we then have a 50 bps on the cash balances? Or how would that move?Giorgio ModicaAs the asset and the liability will be linked to the same variable rate  is going to be indifferent. If the ECB will go up to whatever level  then we would pay and receive the same variable element on asset and liability. And therefore  the spread would remain the same. The only part for which this is not true is  on a temporary basis  between now and the moment where we will have completely run down the portfolio. And this is the reason why I gave specific guidance with respect to the level to expect in the fourth quarter this year and in the first quarter next year. But then from that moment on  again  the 20 basis point are going to be independent on of the ECB decisions.Tobias LukeschVery clear. Thank youOperatorThank you. That was the final question in the queue. So I shall hand the call back across to yourself  Stephane Boujnah  for any concluding remarks. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahThank you very much for your time.
