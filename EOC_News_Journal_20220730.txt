However  net sales increased during the second quarter  mainly driven by the first commercial production batches of Estetrol for Mithra on the new manufacturing unit in Villeneuve-la-Garenne  with the completion of validation batches. Demand remains buoyant at the Turku and Aramon sites and the level of sales was also boosted by price increase initiatives launched at the end of 2021 and in the second quarter of 2022 in order to preserve margins in a context of inflation. However  the R&D and intermediates activity remains below what it used to be in 2021.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled €42.4 million  a 24.9% increase compared to 2021 (+21.8% at a constant exchange rate). A very strong demand in Electronics and Cosmetics and a positive trend in Lubricants and Fine Chemicals account for most of the strong increase in net sales in the first half-year. The rise in the costs of raw materials and energy could be passed on to customers and thus contributed to the growth in net sales. Projects are still being driven by a good momentum  with a significant number of industrialization phases carried out since the beginning of the year.Story continuesOutlookThe PCAS Group will generate a further significant current operational loss in the first half of 2022  still negatively affected by business levels that are still not sufficient to cover the fixed costs incurred at several Pharmaceutical synthesis sites  and inventory depreciations linked to non-compliant productions. Further  the 2022 half-year financial statements will include an expense of €14.5 million corresponding to an impairment of the Group's goodwill  as an immediate consequence of an increase in the discount rate used to determine future operating cash flows as part of impairment tests.All the PCAS Group teams  with the support of its majority shareholder Seqens for the financing of its activities and its development  however  remain fully committed to improving the results in 2022 and a return to positive results in 2023  helped by gradual growth in Estetrol volumes for Mithra.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:Results of the 1rst semester of 2022  September 8  2022ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

The savings plan announced at the start of June will make it possible to reduce operating expenditure by at least €4m on a full-year basis  with a maximum cost of approximately €1.2m in 2022. It is focused on scaling back its workforce (163 staff at end-June 2022) by around 60 positions in France and 10 in other countries  with four non-priority commercial business units shut down (Romania  Italy  UK  Canada) and the management of their clients reassigned to the seven other subsidiaries.To support the upturn in demand for its assisted reality solutions  AMA has made two major updates to XpertEye. Following version 6.6  which was launched at the start of April  version 6.7  released at the start of July  notably incorporates a number of features to facilitate and secure the management of multi-user exchanges. It covers new specific needs for frontline workers by offering bandwidth control to optimize flows for instance. Alongside this  when adapted for its use  in the medical sector for instance  XpertEye now includes Full HD video. Following the inclusion of several connected devices and glasses with version 6.6  version 6.7 has been further enhanced with a night-vision camera and a bodycam for armed forces and security services. Lastly  with the inclusion of Arabic  XpertEye’s suite of solutions is now available in 20 languages.Story continuesBuilding on its progress  AMA recorded a 10% increase in orders during the second quarter compared with the first quarter of 2022. At end-June 2022  AMA had 439 clients  including 61 new accounts  while maintaining its international commercial organization in Europe  the United States and Asia.With revenue recognition spread over the term of contracts for software solutions  and considering the pace and features of orders (software vs. quantity of equipment) over the coming months  it is not possible at present to confirm the return to revenue growth in the second half of 2022. However  AMA expects the growth in its levels of orders to continue over the second half of the year. Further details will be able to be provided when the 2022 first-half consolidated earnings are published on October 31.Unaudited consolidated revenues (IFRS  €’000)At constant exchange rates 2022 2021 Change 2020 First quarter 1.1 2.2 -52% 0.5 Second quarter 1.0 1.8 -44% 1.2 First half 2.1 4.0 -48% 1.7 Third quarter 1.3 1.5 Fourth quarter 1.3 3.1 Second half 2.6 4.6 Full-year 6.6 6.4Next date:2022 first-half earnings and third-quarter revenues: October 31  2022 (before start of trading)DisclaimerThis press release contains certain non-factual elements  including but not restricted to certain statements concerning its future results and other future events.

This was driven by strong traction of the professional segment  which more than compensated headwinds from the lockdowns in China  the effect of the war in Ukraine on our Eastern European market  and a weaker consumer environment. This top-line increase – achieved despite a challenging comparison base – illustrates our improved profile for growth  fueled by the continuing shift towards connected lighting. At the same time  currency movements and inflationary pressures affected our gross margin and adjusted EBITA  although the impact on the latter was partially compensated by cost management. We maintain our CSG guidance for the full year  given continued momentum in the professional segment and our solid order book. The challenging external environment has led us to revise our outlook for the adjusted EBITA margin. In addition  persistent supply chain disruption and long supplier lead times will impact our free cash flow performance ” said CEO Eric Rondolat.“We are taking adaptive measures and expect margin headwinds to ease in the second half of the year. Cash flow generation will normalize once supplier lead times shorten. We remain firmly committed to investing in our business and driving our long-term growth objectives. Our extensive portfolio of sustainable and connected lighting solutions uniquely positions Signify to capture the heightened demand for energy efficient lighting.”Brighter Lives  Better World 2025Story continuesIn the second quarter of the year  Signify was on track for three of its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainability program commitments that contribute to doubling its positive impact on the environment and society.Double the pace of the Paris Agreement:Cumulative carbon reduction over the value chain is ahead of track.

This positive trend continues to be driven by the upgrade of luminaires to serviceable luminaires.Double Brighter lives revenues to 32%:Brighter lives revenues of 26% were off track  yet Signify remains confident that it will achieve the 2025 target of 32%.Double the percentage of women in leadership positions to 34%:The percentage of women in leadership positions was 27%  on track. This quarter  Signify continued to drive actions to achieve its 2025 commitment  including inclusive job posting and diverse hiring panels.

While continued price increases more than offset the input cost increases  Signify was not able to offset within the quarter the surge of energy costs  nor the negative impact from currency movements.Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 130 bps to 29.3%  driven by operating leverage and strengthened cost discipline in view of the pressure on gross margin.Adjusted EBITA decreased slightly to EUR 174 million. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased by 140 bps to 9.5%  reflecting the lower gross margin  which was partly offset by operating leverage and indirect cost savings. Currency movements also had a negative effect of 110 bps on the Adjusted EBITA margin.Adjusted items of EUR 166 million include a EUR 184 million gain from the disposal of non-strategic real estate  while year-on-year restructuring and acquisition-related costs decreased from EUR 22 million to EUR 12 million. As a result  net income increased from EUR 82 million to EUR 248 million.The number of employees (FTE) decreased from 39 143 to 35 407  reflecting the exceptionally high base in the previous year related to the strong volume recovery and additional staff requirements in factories  following the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of FTE can be affected by fluctuations in volume and seasonality.¹ This press release contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios  such as comparable sales growth  EBITA  adjusted EBITA and free cash flow  and related ratios  which are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS.

Amundi Technology continued to develop and saw its revenues increase sharply.”I. Business activity held up well   in unfavourable market conditionsStory continuesAmundi’s assets under management totalled €1 925bn at 30 June 2022  up +7.3% year-on-year and down -4.8% vs. the end of March 2022  with a negative market effect of -€98bn in Q2.Business activity in Q2 2022The second quarter was characterised by unfavourable market conditions:equity markets dropped sharply: in Q2  the EuroStoxx decreased by -12% 6 ; in average  markets fell by -7.3% vs. Q2 2021 and -7.6% vs. Q1 2022 7 ;bond markets also declined (-7% between 31/03/2022 and 30/06/2022 8 )  with rates up around 100bp between 31/03/2022 and 30/06/2022;a general environment of increased risk aversion.This unfavourable environment was illustrated by the significant outflows observed across the entire European asset management market.Against this backdrop  Amundi’s business activity held up particularly well  with positive inflows of +€1.8bn.In Retail   activity held up well in medium/long-term assets 9 (-€0.9bn). Inflows from third-party distributors (+€1.6bn) were positive in the main European markets (France  Italy  Germany). In the French networks  activity was positive in MLT assets (+€0.6bn)  but was offset by outflows (before maturity) from structured products (-€0.9bn). In the international networks (excluding the Amundi BOC WM subsidiary in China)  flows were stable (-€0.1bn); business activity remained robust in Italy  in unit-linked and thematic funds (as illustrated by the success of CPR Hydrogen). For the Chinese subsidiary Amundi BOC WM  the slowdown in activity can be explained by the maturities of the funds launched in 2021  and by the market environment and sanitary situation in China.For institutional clients  MLT assets posted outflows of -€9.1bn   due to the derisking strategy of some clients  particularly in the Institutional and Sovereign segment. In the Employee Savings segment  inflows were positive (+€2.9bn) due to the seasonal effect. The Insurers segment recorded moderate outflows (-€1.5bn)  in connection with the sale of a subsidiary by CA Assurances.Activity in treasury products was virtually stable (-€1.3bn excluding JVs) with seasonal outflows from corporate clients (dividend payments)  partially offset by inflows related to derisking by institutional clients .Activity in the JVs saw solid levels of inflows (+€13.1bn). The Indian JV SBI MF maintained its leading position in the Indian market10 with +€8.9bn in inflows  particularly from pension funds. In China (ABC-CA)  business activity was good  with flows remaining solid at +€3.7bn  particularly in Institutionals  and with -€1.3bn of outflows from low-margin products (Channel Business). In Korea  flows remained positive (+€1.9bn  mainly in treasury products).Continued development of Amundi TechnologyAmundi Technology continues its development with the acquisition of Savity  an Austrian fintech offering a robo advisor white label solution for the retail market  available in Austria and Germany.AG2R  an insurance client with AuM of €120bn  successfully migrated to ALTO Investments.Sabadell Bank chose Amundi Technology and its ALTO W&D product to develop a new solution for its private banking business  with a robo advisor solution for its new online banking offer.Business activity in H1 2022Overall  the first half of the year  Amundi posted positive flows of +€5.0bn.Flows in MLT assets ex JVs were brisk (+€11.0bn)  with notably a good momentum in Retail (+€13.4bn in MLT  mainly with third-party distributors); for Institutional clients  outflows were limited (-€2.4 in MLT) in a “derisking” context.Active management: in sharply declining markets  Amundi's inflows were still even; investment performance remained at a good level  with more than 68% of open-ended fund AuM in the top two quartiles  according to Morningstar 11   and more than 78% based over five-years. With 298 funds rated 4 and 5 stars  Amundi is the third largest player in Europe by the number of funds. The success of the Multi Asset strategies  ESG mandates and OCIO 12 solutions was also noteworthy.Activity in Real Assets was strong  with +€2.8bn in inflows  particularly in Private Equity  Real Estate and Private Debt  bringing assets under management to €66bn at 30/06/2022.Passive management  ETFs and smart beta had a good first half of the year with +€11.4bn in net inflows  bringing AuM to €284bn at end-June 2022. This performance is remarkable in the context of the merger with Lyxor  whose advantages are confirmed. While Amundi ETFs had a particularly solid first quarter  inflows were affected in the second quarter by the wait-and-see attitude of some clients looking to reduce risk in their portfolios.In ETFs  by recording the second highest inflows in the market in the first half of the year  Amundi consolidated its position as the number two player in Europe and leading European ETF manager with a market share of around 14%13.In Asian JVs  business activity was high  at +€21.5bn  notably in India and China.II. Continued high level of profitabilityFirst half of 2022Note: figures reported for the first half of 2021 did not include Lyxor. The reported and combined H1 2021 income statements (on a like-for-like basis  with Lyxor) are presented in the notes.Adjusted data14Stable revenues excluding financial income (€1 615m vs. €1 623m in H1 2021):Net management fees 15 rose significantly by +12.0%  thanks to the acquisition of Lyxor and the strong inlfows over 12 months. On a like-for-like basis 16 the increase was +4.6%. The average margin was stable (17.5bp) compared to H1 2021 17 thanks to a favourable mix effect.As expected  performance fees (€95m) were lower than the exceptional level seen in H1 2021 (€266m).Amundi Technology's revenues continued to grow to €22m (+15.5%).Operating expenses increased to €844m due to the acquisition of Lyxor  but were stable on a like-for-like basis. Amundi demonstrated its ability to maintain its operational efficiency  even in a difficult market environment. Its cost/income ratio stood at 53.1%  one of the best in the industry.The contribution to net income from equity-accounted entities (mainly joint ventures in Asia) increased by +6.5% vs. H1 2021  to €41m  with a notable increase in the Indian JV (SBI FM)  whose contribution increased from €21m to €25m  thanks to business momentum.Adjusted net income remained high at €593m. On a normalised basis18  this result was up +8.1% compared to H1 2021  and +5.6% on a like-for-like basis19.Accounting dataAccounting net income (Group share) amounted to €527m. It includes the usual amortisation of intangible assets  as well as integration costs related to Lyxor.Note: as a reminder  H1 2021 also included an exceptional tax gain (with no impact on cash flow) of +€114m  linked to the application of the “Affrancamento” scheme in Italy.Second quarter 2022Adjusted dataAmundi’s quarterly adjusted net income remained high at €269m. Its change compared to the first quarter of 2022 can be explained by the sharp drop of the markets and of performance fees.Net revenues excluding financial income were €769m:Net management fees (excluding Amundi Technology’s revenues) held up well at €733m; their evolution (-4.3% vs. Q1 2022) is more moderate than the markets overall (-7 6% 20 ).The normalisation of performance fees was accentuated by the market environment; they amounted to €24m compared to a quarterly average of €42m between 2017 and 2020.Amundi Technology’s revenues rose 24.5% vs. Q1 2022 to €12m.Operating expenses were stable (€422m)  despite continued IT investments  and included in particular an exceptional (non-cash) accounting expense of -€4m (IFRS 2)  related to the capital increase reserved for employees (see Section IV). Excluding this one-off expense  operating expenses would have been down slightly vs. Q1 2022.As a result  the cost/income ratio was 55.9% vs. 50.6% in Q1 2022 (51.8% on a normalised basis21)  in line with the decline in revenues linked to the market effect.The contribution to income from equity-accounted entities (mainly Asian joint ventures) increased by +6.3% vs. Q1 2022  to €21m.Accounting dataAccounting net income (Group share) amounted to €224m. It includes the usual amortisation of intangible assets  as well as integration costs related to Lyxor (€40m before tax and €30m after tax)  including the charges provisioned for employee departures plans.Note: as a reminder  Q2 2021 also included an exceptional tax gain (with no impact on cash flow) of +€114m  linked to the application of the “Affrancamento” scheme in Italy.III. Continued com mitment to Responsible InvestmentAmundi continued to implement its 2025 action plan.Responsible Investment assets under management were €793bn at 30 June 2022  stable compared with 30 June 2021. The change from 31 December 2021 (€847bn in assets under management) is linked to a negative market effect  partially offset by the continued integration of ESG criteria into investment management  and sustained inflows (+€8.8bn in MLT22 in H1)  mostly in active management.H1 2022 highlights:Good momentum for Climate and Environment solutions  ESG fixed-income funds  and the Equity thematic funds;Continued product innovation  in particular with the launch of the Amundi Euro Corporate Short Term Green Bond fund  as well as the CPR Blue Economy thematic fund (a global equity fund to support marine economic ecosystems and protect sustainably the oceans).In addition  Amundi continues to align its internal policy with its commitments: Amundi was the first asset manager in the world to present a “Say on Climate” resolution to a shareholder vote (AGM held on 18th of May 2022). Almost 98% of shareholders approved this resolution.IV. A solid financial structureTangible equity23 amounted to €3.3bn at 30 June 2022  down slightly compared to end-2021 due to the payment of dividends (€0.8bn) for the 2021 financial year.The CET1 ratio was 17.9% at the end of June 2022  well above regulatory requirements  to be compared with 16.1% at end 2021.Note: in May 2022  rating agency Fitch confirmed Amundi’s A+ rating with a stable outlook  one of the best in the sector.V. Other informationSuccessful capital increase reserved to employeesThe “We Share Amundi” capital increase reserved to employees (announced on 20 June) was successfully completed on 26 July 2022: over one in three employees worldwide  and over half of employees in France  participated to the capital increase  which  for the fifth consecutive year  offered a share subscription with a discount. Nearly 2 000 employees present in 15 countries subscribed to this capital increase for a total amount of nearly €29m.The deal  which was executed under existing legal authorisations approved by the General Shareholders’ Meeting on 18 May 2022  reflects Amundi's ambition to involve its employees not only in the company's growth but also in economic value creation. It also allows to increase employees’ feelings of belonging.The impact of this capital increase on net earnings per share is negligible: 785 480 shares were created (representing 0.4% of capital before the shares issuance). This issuance brings the number of shares making up Amundi's share capital to 203 860 131 on 27 July 2022.Employees now hold more than 1% of Amundi’s share capital  compared with 0.8% before the capital increase.Launch of a share buyback programme as part of performance shares plansAfter obtaining the necessary regulatory approval  Amundi announces the launch of a share buyback programme limited to a maximum of €60m  or a maximum of 1 million shares  representing around 0.5% of the share capital. This programme is intended to cover the performance shares plans already awarded.In order to avoid dilution for existing shares shareholders  Amundi has decided not to issue any new shares  but to buy back the shares that will be delivered to beneficiaries starting in 2023 (following a vesting period and subject to performance and presence conditions24).See appendix for further details.Financial disclosure schedulePublication of Q3 and 9M 2022 results: 28 October 2022Publication of Q4 and FY 2022 results: 8 February 2023Publication of Q1 2023 results: 28 April 2023Publication of H1 2023 results: 28 July 2023Publication of 9M 2023 results: 27 October 2023***Reminder of sensitivities to markets variationsChanges in the equity markets : +/- 10% → +/- €125 m in net revenuesChanges in interest rates : +/- 100 bps → -/+ €50m in net revenuesSensitivity on run-rate net management fees (excluding performance fees).Market sensitivities do not take into account potential impact of market movements on flows.Income StatementsH1 2022 H1 2021new presentation Chg.H1 2022 /H1 2021 new presentation Chg.H1 2022 /H1 2021 like-for-like Adjusted net revenue 1 589 1 619 -1.9% -7.4% Net asset management revenue 1 594 1 604 -0.6% -6.4% o/w net management fees 1 499 1 338 12.0% 4.6% o/w performance fees 95 266 - - Technology 22 19 15.5% 15.5% Net financial income and other net income (27) (4) - - Operating expenses (844) (764) 10.5% 0.8% Adjusted gross operating income 744 855 -13.0% -15.2% Adjusted cost/income ratio 53.1% 47.2% 6 pts 4.3 pts Cost of risk & Other (4) (20) - - Equity-accounted entities 41 38 6.5% 6.5% Adjusted income before taxes 781 874 -10.5% -12.7% Adjusted corporate tax (187) (223) -16.3% -18.9% Minority interests (1) 4 - - Adjusted net income  Group share 593 654 -9.3% -11.2% Amortisation of intangible assets after tax (29) (24) 20.5% 27.4% Integration costs net of tax (37) 0 - - Net income  Group share 527 630 -16.4% -18.4% Impact of Affrancamento 0 114 - - Net income  Group share including Affrancamento 527 744 -28 7% -30 2%Q2 2022 Q2 2021new presentation Chg.Q2 2022 / Q2 2021 Chg.Q2 2022 /Q2 2021like-for-like Q1 2022 Chg.Q2 2022 /Q1 2022 Adjusted net revenue 754 849 -11.2% -16.4% 835 -9.7% Net asset management revenue 757 835 -9.3% -14.7% 837 -9.5% o/w net management fees 733 679 7.9% 0.2% 766 -4.3% o/w performance fees 24 155 - - 71 -65.9% Technology 12 12 2.2% 2.2% 10 24.5% Net financial income and other adjusted net income (15) 3 - - (12) 30.3% Adjusted operating expenses (422) (388) 8.6% -1.7% (423) -0.2% Adjusted gross operating income 332 461 -27.9% -29.8% 412 -19.4% Adjusted cost/income ratio 55.9% 45.7% 10.2 pts 8.4 pts 50.6% 5.3 pts Cost of risk & Other (0) (18) - - (4) Equity-accounted entities 21 21 2.1% 2.1% 20 6.3% Adjusted income before taxes 353 464 -23.9% -25.7% 428 -17.6% Corporate tax 1 2 (84) (120) -29.8% -32.1% (103) -18.3% Minority interests 0 1 - - (1) - Adjusted net income  Group share 269 345 -22.1% -23.7% 324 -17.0% Amortisation of intangible assets after tax (15) (12) 20.5% 29.9% (15) 0.0% Integration costs net of tax (30) 0 - - (8) - Net income  Group share 224 333 -32.6% -34.2% 302 -25.7% Impact of Affrancamento 0 114 - - 0 - Net income  Group share including Affrancamento 224 446 -49.7% -50.6% 303 -26.0%Adjusted data: excluding amortisation of intangible assets  Lyxor integration costs  and  in Q2 and H1 2021  excluding the impact of Affrancamento.New presentation of revenues with Amundi Technology revenues presented on a separated lineConstant scope: with LyxorThe accounting net income for Q2 2021 includes a net one-time tax gain (net of a substitution tax) of +€114m (no cash flow impact): “Affrancamento” mechanism of the Italian Budget Law for 2021 (Law no. 178/2020)  resulting in the recognition of Deferred Tax Assets on intangible assets (goodwill); this was excluded from Adjusted Net Income.Change in assets under management1 from end-December 2020 to end-June 2022(€bn) Assetsunder management Netinflows Market and foreign exchangeeffect Scopeeffect Change in AuM vs. previous quarter As of 31/12/2020 1 729 +4.0% Q1 2021 -12.7 +39.3 / As of 31/03/2021 1 755 +1.5% Q2 2021 +7.2 +31.4 / As of 30/06/2021 1 794 / +2.2% Q3 2021 +0.2 +17.0 / As of 30/09/2021 1 811 / +1.0% Q4 2021 +65.6 +39.1 +14825 As of 31/12/2021 2 064 / Q1 2022 +3.2 -46.4 / -2.1% As of 31/03/2022 2 021 / Q2 2022 +1.8 - 97.8 / As of 30/06/2022 1 925 -4.8%1.

ObjectiveThe shares will be acquired in the market in order to cover the performance share incentives plans that have already been awarded.In order to avoid dilution for existing shareholders  Amundi has decided to not issue any new shares  but to buy back the shares that will be delivered to beneficiaries starting in 2024 (following a vesting period and subject to performance and presence conditions26).2. Maximum number of shares and amountThe number of shares acquired will not exceed 1 million  representing around 0.5% of the share capital. The total amount allocated to this programme may not exceed €60m.3. Features of the purchased sharesThe Amundi shares in question are those admitted for trading on the Euronext regulated market in Paris under ISIN code FR0004125920.4. Duration of the share buyback programmeThe authorisation of the Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting of 18 May 2022 was granted for a period of eighteen months from the date of this Meeting.This programme is part of the share buyback programme described in Chapter 1 (pages 42-43) of Amundi's 2021 Universal Registration Document filed with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers on 12 April 2022 under number D.22-0281 and available on Amundi's website: https://legroupe.amundi.com/regulated-information . Any amendment to one of the features of this share buyback programme while it is underway will be disclosed in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in II of Article 241-2 of the General Regulation of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers.As a reminder  Amundi already holds 359 468 shares at 30 June 2022 under the liquidity contract entered into with Kepler Cheuvreux and as part of the previous share buyback programmes.Methodology appendixI. Accounting and adjusted data1. Accounting data:For the first six months of 2021 and 2022  data after amortisation of intangible assets (distribution agreements with Bawag  UniCredit and Banco Sabadell; Lyxor client contracts); and after the integration costs related to Lyxor.2. Adjusted data:To present an income statement that is closer to the economic reality  the following adjustments have been made: restatement of amortisation of intangible assets (deducted from net revenues); the integration costs related to Lyxor.In the accounting data  amortisation of intangible assets:Q2 2021 : €17m before tax and €12m after taxQ1 2022 : €20m before tax and €15m after taxQ2 2022 : €20m before tax and €15m after taxH1 2021 : €34m before tax and €24m after taxH1 2022: €41m before tax and €29m after taxIn the accounting data  integration costs related to Lyxor:Q2 2021 : 0Q1 2022 : €10m before tax and €8m after taxQ2 2022 : €40m before tax and €30m after taxH1 2021 : 0H1 2022: €51m before tax and €37m after taxII. Acquisition of LyxorIn accordance with IFRS 3  recognition on Amundi’s balance sheet as of 31/12/2021 of:goodwill ;an intangible asset  representing client contracts  of €40m before tax (€30m after tax)  which will be amortised on a straight-line basis over 3 years;In the Group income statement  the above-mentioned intangible asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over 3 years starting in 2022; the full-year impact of this amortisation is €10m net of tax (i.e. €13m before tax). This amortisation is recognised as a deduction from net income and added to the existing amortisation of distribution agreements.III.

(NYSE: GTLS) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30  2022. Further...,"Chart Industries  Inc.ATLANTA  July 29  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chart Industries  Inc. (NYSE: GTLS) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30  2022. Further details can be found in the supplemental presentation accompanying this release and published in the investor relations section of our website.Second quarter 2022 was all-time record orders ($887.8 million)  record backlog ($1 953.3 million)  record sales ($404.8 million)  record reported gross margin ($94.8 million) and record reported operating income ($29.6 million)Second quarter 2022 sales of $404.8 million were our highest quarter of sales in our history and increased 25.7% (19.0% organic) when compared to the second quarter of 2021 and 14.3% (12.4% organic) compared to the first quarter 2022Second quarter reported 7.3% operating income as a percent of sales (adjusted 9.9%) was our highest in the past yearNet cash provided by operating activities was $35 million (adjusted of $54 million)  resulting in free cash flow (“FCF”) of $18 million (adjusted FCF of $37 million)  providing further confidence to our full year 2022 adjusted FCF outlook of $175 million to $225 millionAcquired Fronti Fabrications (“Fronti”)  a vacuum insulated cold box manufacturer  and CSC Cryogenic Service Center AB (“CSC”)  a Nordic region service and repair businessReceived our American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) XII certificate at our Theodore  Alabama facility  making us one of only 30 companies globally (34 sites) with this certificationSecond quarter 2022 reported non-diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.36; adjusted non-diluted EPS of $0.88 (excluding Mark-to-Market (“MTM”) from investment activity ($0.22 net of tax) and other specific one-time costs ($0.30 net of tax))2022 full-year sales guidance range of $1.725 billion to $1.80 billion is within the prior guidance range of $1.725 billion to $1.85 billion; associated 2022 full-year adjusted non-diluted EPS guidance is in the range of $5.20 to $5.60 (prior guidance of $5.35 to $6.50) on 35.86 million shares outstanding (prior 35.83 million) and a tax rate of 20% (prior tax rate of 19%)Story continuesNew records were set in the second quarter 2022 across the business.In the second quarter 2022  we achieved the highest order quarter in our history ($887.8 million)  the highest sales quarter in our history ($404.8 million) and our seventh consecutive record backlog quarter ($1 953.3 billion).In addition to record orders  backlog and sales  our second quarter 2022 was our all-time record gross margin dollars of $94.8 million (adjusted gross margin of $102.4 million) as well as record operating income of $29.6 million (adjusted operating income of $40.0 million). Reported operating income as a percent of sales of 7.3% was the highest in the past year and when adjusted for one-time costs from deal  integration  startup/capacity and restructuring  was 9.9%  also the highest in the past year. Reported gross margin as a percent of sales for the second quarter 2022 was 23.4%  and when adjusted for one-time costs related to integration and startup/capacity specific projects  was 25.3% adjusted as a percent of sales  reflecting both our continued progress on pricing versus input costs as well as the high shipment quarter of price/cost lagged backlog in our Cryo Tank Solutions (“CTS”) segment  which had the most long-term agreement price indexing timed into the second quarter 2022. As mentioned in prior quarters  realizing the continued benefits of these price and cost control actions sets up the second half of 2022 to continue to incrementally increase operating margin and gross margin  as well as both metrics as a percent of sales; with the additional backlog shipped in the second quarter from CTS  we expect CTS margin to sequential improve. Reported gross margin as a percent of sales in the second quarter 2022 was sequentially up more than 170 basis points in three out of our four segments when compared to the first quarter 2022. Additionally  both reported and adjusted operating income as percent of sales sequentially increased in three of the four segments  each increasing more than 270 basis points.Our reported earnings per share of $0.36 included negative $0.22 from our mark-to-market adjustment as well as one-time specific costs primarily related to deals  year-one integration  startup & capacity of $0.30. In the second quarter  we completed the Tulsa  OK to Beasley  Texas air-cooled heat exchanger relocation/restructuring  substantially completed the SriCity  India capacity expansion and completed the Richburg  SC greenfield expansion costs (therefore  none of these costs will be addbacks going forward). Note that we did not addback the negative impact to sales or EPS from the foreign exchange (“FX”) rate changes and we anticipate that these will continue to be variable throughout the second half of 2022. We estimate the second quarter 2022 impact from the foreign exchange rate changes to be approximately negative $12 million to sales and approximately negative $0.05 to EPS. Adjusted EPS of $0.88 is our second highest in our history and reflects our continuing execution of price increases  cost controls while including an offset from the high shipment quarter of price/cost lagged backlog in our CTS segment.The following table shows our records in the second quarter 2022 for orders  sales and backlog.Segment/Division Orders Net Sales Backlog Cryo Tank Solutions Storage Equipment ● Engineered Tanks & Systems ● Mobile Equipment Heat Transfer Systems ● ● Brazed Alum Heat Exchangers ● Systems ● ● ● Air Exchangers ● ● Fans ● VRV ● ● Repair  Service & Leasing ● Parts  Repairs  & Services ● Cryo Lease Lifecycle Group Air Coolers Aftermarket Fans Aftermarket ● ● L.A.

Our second quarter 2022 topped that record  with orders of $887.8 million  including approximately $300 million related to Big LNG (specifically our full notice to proceed on Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Stage Three LNG export terminal (“Cheniere CCL 3”)). Total Chart content on Cheniere’s CCL 3 project is over $350 million; the entire amount is in backlog as of June 30  2022. The second quarter 2022 also marked our fifth out of the last six quarters setting new historical record orders and is our third consecutive record order quarter. This resulted in our seventh consecutive quarter of record backlog ($1 953.3 million); backlog is 80% higher than one year ago and sequentially 32% higher than the first quarter 2022. We continued our trend of more consistent and frequent orders that each were over $1 million  with 61 of them booked in the second quarter 2022  making this our fourth consecutive quarter with over 60 individual orders each greater than $1 million.We continue to witness what we shared during our first quarter 2022 earnings call regarding the increase in actual orders as well as inquiries from both public and private sector entities surrounding the need for infrastructure to access molecules to support energy security  access  independence and resiliency  all with the backdrop of the requirement for alternative sources of supply and continued focus on sustainability. The increase in immediacy for energy security has not come at the expense of the clean energy transition – rather there is a heightened focus on all energy. As the International Energy Agency (“IEA”) shared – the world has both the resources and technologies to tackle the energy security crisis and the climate crisis  addressing the need for immediate practical actions to navigate the current energy market turmoil  while underscoring the urgency of massively scaling up investment in clean energy. To that point  the IEA also recently stated that clean energy investments will be above $1.4 trillion this year  constituting about three-quarters of overall energy spending. And this week’s news on The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022  which addresses the United States’ adoption of solutions through strategic investments in technologies needed for all fuel types – from hydrogen  nuclear  renewables  fossil fuels and energy storage – to be produced and used in the cleanest way possible - certainly will further support the continued traction we have already seen in the commercial adoption of our Nexus of Clean offerings.It was not only LNG related activity in the second quarter 2022 driving these new historical records. In the second quarter 2022  we booked orders with 85 new customers and 23 first-of-a-kind (“FOAK”) orders  bringing year-to-date FOAKs to 51 and orders with new customers to 169  both of which are on track to meet or exceed 2021’s FOAKs and new customers  demonstrating that there is considerable potential growth in our addressable market globally.We continue to expect additional progress from other LNG export terminal operators to FID with the potential for additional Big LNG as well as ssLNG orders with Chart releases in the next six to twelve months.Specialty Products orders continued to demonstrate consistency and strength  with the second quarter 2022 being our highest Specialty Products order quarter in our history as well as our sixth consecutive quarter of Specialty Products orders above $100 million. The $265.7 million of Specialty Products orders in the second quarter 2022 were driven by record orders for hydrogen  space exploration (including a $16 million commitment from a large space customer for product that will be produced in our supersized tank facility in Theodore  Alabama) and water treatment as well as continued elevated activity in the food & beverage end markets  including receiving our largest ever order for CO2 ORCAs (mobile units) and continued national accounts’ (such as Chick-Fil-A) store openings and replacement programs. The majority of the project work that was booked in the second quarter 2022 will primarily be revenue recognized in 2023 through 2025.Also  our customer and potential customer base continues to expand in the specialty applications. For example  as of the end of the second quarter 2022  we are in various different stages of discussions with over 550 different potential hydrogen customers (compared to just over 300 one year ago and just over 30 in April 2020) and over 300 different potential large-scale (SES) carbon capture potential customers  whereas at the end of 2021  we were speaking with just under 200 potential customers.LNG  LNG  LNG.We have previously discussed our LNG addressable market in three ways – first  Big LNG  for which year-to-date we have booked $528.9 million of related orders; second  small-scale and utility-scale LNG  which includes floating LNG and regasification opportunities; and third  LNG infrastructure  such as ISO containers  fueling stations  and trailers. Now  we will speak to our LNG addressable market in four ways – these three plus retrofit  refurbishment and replacement opportunities for which we are seeing increasing inquiries and activity. For example  we have jobs completed or underway year-to-date 2022 including removal and install of fans and motors and numerous field service repairs  and the Southeastern utility customer’s small-scale LNG order in the second quarter 2022 for $26 million is a replacement as well as an expansion project. The other opportunities in aftermarket are global and include heavy hydrocarbon removal systems  nitrogen rejection units  vacuum insulated pipe and Boil Off Gas (BOG) reliquefaction  to name a few.In the second quarter 2022  we booked our third New Fortress Energy FastLNG liquefaction project (“Fast3”) as well as a small-scale LNG retrofit and expansion project with a Southeastern United States utility company. Combined  we booked $73.1 million of small-scale and floating LNG work in the second quarter 2022.Also in our LNG and other molecule offering are our numerous regasification (“regas”) options for our customers  with our most recently introduced being our modular  movable and quick to deploy regas solution  the Drop and Go Regas (“DAGR 2.0”). This amongst our other regas equipment and technology has increased in demand since the focus on energy access and security has heightened. As an example  in the second quarter 2022 we sold two ISO containers and two skidded vaporizers to AFP (Alternative Fuel Partners)  who connects the container with the vaporizer to make a unit that is shown on slide 27 of the supplemental presentation to provide emergency gas supply. Another customer  ITALGAS  has deployed 26 LNG regas units and we are also the 24/7 maintenance provider for these systems. We are currently quoting dozens of these opportunities for customers in Central Europe  in particular in Germany  where alternatives to pipeline gas are being explored.Organic capacity expansions are on track and supported by backlog.As our demand continues to be broad-based  we strategically choose to begin organic capacity expansions  and currently have four meaningful expansions underway. Portions of the related capital expenditures (“capex”) are in our full year capex outlook of approximately $55 million to $60 million (year-to-date through June 30  2022 our capex was $29.8 million) as well as into our 2023 outlook. It is worth noting that these expansions all have backlog seeded to be first volumes when the capacity comes online.SriCity  India bulk tank capacity expansion (on existing property): construction work is complete as of the end of June 2022. Inspection  final occupancy certification and additional machinery is anticipated to be complete by the end of the third quarter 2022.Tulsa  Oklahoma (USA) brazed aluminum heat exchanger line (at existing facility): all equipment and training is on track  including delivery of the brazing furnace in the third quarter 2022.Goch  Germany GOFA industrial gas and hydrogen trailer capacity expansion (on existing property): underway  with operations set to begin in mid to late 2023. We received our first order totaling more than $20 million which will be produced in this expanded facility. The facility will also include a repair and service shop.Theodore (Teddy)  Alabama (USA) supersized and jumbo tank new capacity (on existing property with opportunity to add adjacent property): Site work and equipment procurement is underway  with our first orders for this expansion received in the second quarter 2022  totaling $16 million for a space exploration customer (total space exploration orders in the second quarter 2022 were a record $30.7 million).Margin improvement continues as we continue to respond to cost changes with pricing and surcharges  improving productivity; supported by certain macro challenges tempering.We continued to implement price increases in the second quarter 2022 and held our surcharge the entire quarter as well. In addition to maintaining our short bid validity timing on project quotations  we have implemented five separate base price increases over the past six quarters and had three surcharge increases since implementing in the third quarter 2021. This is in addition to the quarterly or semiannual index-based adjustments in our long-term agreements with specific industrial gas customers.Given the enormity of the macro challenges over the past 18 months  we monitor any changes needed on a daily basis. There have been some challenges that we have seen improving  albeit none to pre-COVID “normal”  and others that exist at the same challenging levels that we have been navigating for the past year  including an unprecedented inflationary environment.The Good & The Improving:Availability of material is improving  although lead times continue to be much longer than typical. Our material and stock build throughout the second half of 2021 and first quarter of 2022 combined with our multiple sources of global and local supply has helped us with these challenges  as reflected in: Our 11 manufacturing locations that had 100% on-time delivery in the second quarter 2022  Our SriCity  India facility posted record sales and an increase of 25% in our tank capacity. Chart China had first half 2022 record tank production of 333 units  while first half sales of vacuum insulated pipe from this site exceeded the total 2021 sales. Historical record sales for Europe. Historical record sales for European storage tanks. Highest number of shipped and completed bulk tanks (Europe and India) in our history.Cost of two of our top three raw materials have tempered. Specifically  as of June 30  2022  aluminum was down from the past three quarters’ highs and carbon steel (coil) was back to first quarter 2021 pricing.While regional logistic costs remained a challenge (and availability in Europe in particular)  the second quarter 2022 was our first quarter (perhaps in our history  but at least in the past two years!) where our freight and logistics costs incurred were net neutral with what we were able to pass to our customers (net zero impact to our P&L). We expect this pattern of net neutrality to continue for the foreseeable future. Previously  logistics costs had a net negative margin impact of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter 2021 and net negative of $0.6 million in the first quarter 2022.Our team members around the world continue to execute and support the broad-based demand lead-time requirements. This is reflected in our low total Chart voluntary turnover of 6%  compared to 28% from other global industrial companies (based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics 2021 manufacturing voluntary turnover rate; the Bureau of Labor Statistics has indicated that the measure of employee-initiated job separations is likely to remain elevated for the rest of 2022) as well as the dedication of our teams to deliver. Chart China deserves special recognition for exceeding their original forecast for the second quarter 2022 on sales and operating income even while they were under COVID-19 related lockdowns for the majority of the quarter. From a global perspective  we have seen less COVID-19 related absences in the second quarter 2022.As of June 30  2022  our team has achieved our lowest total recordable incident rate (“TRIR”) in our history at 0.57.The Not Yet Improving:We continue to be under Force Majeure on certain United States gas supply since the first quarter 2022 which causes additional cost and inefficiencies  yet it has become part of our normal operating procedure to utilize one of our leasing fleet trucks to transport our own gasses as/if needed.Material input costs  while tempering as described above  continue to be much higher than pre-COVID levels.Inflationary pricing for non-Bill-of-Material (“BOM”) items such as utilities  expenses and service items remain high.Whereas we have seen certain tempering in raw material input costs  specific component buy-outs continue to face significant pricing challenges; we have been addressing these in changes to our pricing index constructs in specific agreements as well as in our surcharges.More certifications drive further differentiation.As we have previously indicated  our competitive advantage stems from a variety of portfolio attributes  whether our core cryogenic engineering and manufacturing expertise  our global manufacturing footprint  or our broad-based certifications around the world for handling high pressure  low temperature molecules. In many cases  these certifications are difficult to achieve  rare in some cases  and generally all take process and time. Therefore  the more we have  in particular in earlier stage end markets  the more competitive advantage we have. We received our American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) XII certificate at our Theodore  Alabama facility in the second quarter 2022; there are only 30 companies globally (34 sites) that have this certificate  including us. Also  our Chart China factory is now certified for our duracyl product with a GB and DOT certification  and we are seeing international traction for our Earthly Labs small-scale carbon capture offering with our latest certification being the Canadian Registration in Alberta  Canada. Earlier in July 2022  our Chart China trailer facility passed the ASME XII qualification.Continuing to build capabilities and expand addressable markets via acquisitions and new partnerships; all with immediate synergies.In May 2022  we completed the acquisition of Fronti Fabrications  Inc. (“Fronti”) for $20 million (subject to customary adjustments). Fronti is a specialist in engineering  machining and welding for the cryogenic and gas industries  and also supplies new build pressure vessels  cold boxes and performs repairs with certification to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code. With over 20 years of experience in liquefaction  heat exchangers and cold boxes  Fronti adds a known team to expand Chart’s cold box manufacturing capacity and capability  including work currently underway on Chart hydrogen and helium liquefiers. Given our continued demand for Big LNG  small-scale LNG and hydrogen/helium liquefaction  having more than one United States cold box fabrication facility (in addition to our New Iberia  Louisiana location) adds agility and capacity to further improve our delivery lead-times and to prepare for the anticipated increase in demand in the coming years.Also  within the second quarter 2022  we completed the acquisition of CSC Cryogenic Service Center AB  a Swedish company (“CSC”) for approximately $4 million. CSC brings a strong service footprint in the Nordic Region with many overlapping customers to Chart  allowing us to broaden our service and repair presence geographically. Our strong original equipment installed base and continued forecasted growth in the Nordic region will benefit from this localized support. Not only does this expand our geographic footprint  it broadens our repair and service capabilities for mobile equipment  in particular trailers  as well as ISO containers  stationary and transportable tanks  pumps  flowmeters and LNG fueling stations. An immediate synergy success with CSC was our June 2022 signing of a full care service and maintenance services agreement with one of our original equipment Nordic region customers for their LNG vehicle fueling station network.In addition to this service & repair agreement  we signed seven other MOUs or long-term agreements (“LTA”) in the second quarter 2022  including another agreement for LNG  three for carbon capture (“CCUS”)  two for hydrogen and one for air-cooled heat exchanger master supply.Free cash flow positive and ahead of our prior expectations.In the second quarter 2022  our net cash provided by operating activities was $35 million  and when adjusted for unusual items  was $54 million. Second quarter 2022 free cash flow (net of capital expenditures of $17 million) was $18 million (adjusted FCF of $37 million). We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow will be in the range of $175 million to $225 million.“We continue to see broad-based demand across our end markets  with expectations for additional LNG projects and retrofits as well as a global focus on the energy transition ” stated Jill Evanko  Chart’s President and CEO. “Our team continues to execute on delivering our record backlog while keeping all acquisition integrations  capacity and productivity projects on schedule. Stronger than anticipated free cash flow in the second quarter 2022 coupled with our sequential quarterly margin improvement  record order book and cost controls set up not only a strong second half of 2022 but an even stronger 2023 and 2024.”2022 Guidance; Increased confidence in 2023 to 2025 outlooks.Our current 2022 full year sales guidance is narrowed within the prior guidance range. Full year 2022 sales guidance is in the range of $1.725 billion and $1.80 billion  compared to the prior sales guidance range of $1.725 billion to $1.85 billion. Current associated adjusted non-diluted EPS guidance is in the range of $5.20 to $5.60  compared to prior adjusted non-diluted EPS guidance range of $5.35 to $6.50. Our prior higher-end guidance range is not likely at this point in the year given timing of revenue recognition on larger project work  less than anticipated HLNG vehicle tank demand recovery early in 2022 (which is timing versus lost business)  and current macroeconomic market factors  including the inflationary environment and foreign exchange volatility. We have included in our current guidance the following considerations:(1) There were specific sales recognized in the second quarter 2022 that were pulled in from our previously forecasted third quarter 2022  taking advantage of the ability to ship older backlog sooner in the year. These were not additional sales above our guided sales.(2) The majority of the orders booked in the second quarter 2022  in particular given the widespread project work  will primarily be revenue recognized in 2023 through 2025  and have minimal to no impact on 2022 sales or EPS.(3) We do not include any second half 2022 additional Big LNG revenue from new orders in this outlook since the timing for revenue recognition is likely after 2022.(4) We do not include any meaningful second half 2022 recovery in our HLNG over the road vehicle tank demand in this guidance  which year-to-date 2022 has been significantly lower than originally anticipated heading into the year (this is viewed and articulated by our customers as temporary yet has been at very low order levels for longer than originally forecasted and is short-cycle book and ship product). Year-to-date through the second quarter 2022 HLNG vehicle tank orders were $10.7 million as compared to the same period in 2021 of $71.6 million.(5) We do not include any second half 2022 upside or “surprise” book and ship orders (product that books and ships in one to three months) for standard product (this does frequently occur yet is difficult to predict).(6) An increase to our current shares outstanding in our outlook are 35.86 million (prior guidance was 35.83 million).(7) Full year estimated tax rate of 20% (prior guidance was 19%).Our capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million for the full year 2022 (compared to prior outlook of $50 million to $55 million)  while our adjusted FCF is anticipated to be in the range of $175 million to $225 million (unchanged from prior guidance).And to conclude  given that we have over $1.1 billion of backlog for 2023 and beyond  our confidence in our next three-year forecast is high.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain statements made in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

8418,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/intercos-beauty-innovation-italy-1235262857/,After 50 Years in Business  Intercos’ Innovation Plans Keep Multiplying,Dario Ferrari  the visionary entrepreneur behind the Italian cosmetics manufacturer  recalls the turning points of his career and reveals what’s next for the beauty player.,MILAN — Fifty years young.That’s the impression one gets of Intercos Group through the words of Dario Ferrari  the visionary entrepreneur who established the Italian cosmetics manufacturer in 1972.“It’s just the beginning  in a certain way ” he said during a lengthy conversation at his office in Agrate Brianza — a 40-minute drive from Milan — where the company is headquartered.Ferrari said it took him all his life to put the firm in a “stronger than ever” position. After half a century of tweaks in the business model  IPOs (three tentative  one effective)  supply chain disruptions as well as experimenting with different approaches to trend forecasting and plenty of formulations  the founder believes there’s room to further grow in the industry.To do so  he might spice up his business’ recipe with new elements but said he’d never change its secret ingredient: innovation.Today  Intercos has 11 research centers  16 production plants and 16 sales offices worldwide  manufacturing and supplying everything from lipsticks and eye shadows to pencils and skin care to more than 700 international clients. Almost 1 000 out of its global 5 200 employees are dedicated to R&D  developing more than 1 300 new formulas per year.You May Also LikeInnovation has been the guiding force of the company  putting Ferrari in a privileged position to observe the many shifts in the beauty industry over the past five decades.Among his personal highlights  he mentioned the launch of the Prisma Shine patented technology for powders in 2011  which combine performance with special effects  such precise drawings on the texture; new technologies on the lipstick category centered on filling and assembly with silicon molds  as well as ideas borrowed from other fields.“I remember I went to see a pharmaceutical company not long time ago  and they were using an air system to grind the active ingredients to make them micro  very refined…We took the idea and we started to use it as well ” said Ferrari.Yet Intercos’ pivotal moment in terms of innovation traces back to the very beginning  when Ferrari got inspired by the production process behind decaffeinated coffee he saw at a friend’s coffee plant. “Coffee is a powder. To extract the caffeine they used a solvent  and when I saw the technology I said: ‘Wow we can adapt it to powder and eye shadow’ ” he recalled  underscoring how eye shadows at the time used to be “very dry and not comfortable.”The discovery enabled Intercos to develop unprecedented creamy  shiny formulations  with the extra benefit of being “easy to produce  less expensive and definitely longer lasting.”“Nobody had a product like this. That was really breaking through the system ” said Ferrari. Shortly after  this innovation led to the first turning point of his career.“I think that in 50 years  the first important step for the company occurred in 1982 ” he said  stressing that the first decade was spent to “learn a little bit about [the industry] and put together our business model.”“We’ve been very creative and innovative in those years. And in fact  what happened in 1982? Somebody knocked at the door and it was Estée Lauder ” said Ferrari  explaining that the American company offered him a $30-million deal at the time at the condition he started producing in the U.S. Ferrari agreed and set up a plant Stateside  but after finding out that Intercos also worked with other clients overall  the deal was turned into a 50-50 joint venture  with Estée Lauder taking over the whole American company after three years. “We built the best factory for them and they still have it in Bristol… While we kept our position as a creative lab for them ” said Ferrari.“But suddenly everybody started to wonder ‘Who’s this company making a joint venture with Estée Lauder?’ That’s why in the 1990s we grew tremendously… And it created a big problem because at the end of that [decade] everybody would think Intercos was a fantastic company but that didn’t deliver. In reality  our capacity was 100 and we had orders for 200. So from the early 2000s  we started to build factories ” said Ferrari  citing operations in the U.S.  China  Italy  Brazil  South Korea and  most recently  India.The group’s global presence came in handy even years later  as during the pandemic the local facilities and research hubs handed the firm a competitive advantage both in speeding up production and anticipating trends.“We gained a lot of space ” admitted Ferrari. “First  our big customers  the multinational groups  had [slowed down] for a couple of years because nobody went to the office… Our competitors have been somehow struggling  too ” he said. Conversely  a small group of top managers and R&D staffers at Intercos managed to go to the HQ and “keep the innovation going.”As result  the company maintained a strong position on the market  despite lockdowns and the disruption of the supply chain. To wit  in the first quarter of 2022  revenues grew 21 percent to 174.6 million euros compared to the same period last year. In 2021  the group totaled 673.7 million euros in revenues  up 11.1 percent versus 2020.Before the pandemic  other key changes of paradigm included transitioning from a solely product company to incorporating branding skills  therefore “acquiring a completely different know-how compared to what we used to have ” such as extra knowledge of customers and distribution.The listing on Euronext Milan at the end of last year added another piece to the acceleration puzzle. It also enabled Ferrari to finally tick off from his personal list the IPO goal  after that several plans shelved due to sudden changes in the economic climate throughout the years. “Being public  we can now attract investors and people. It’s a different situation to be in… And we’re going to have a very aggressive plan for the next three years.”Looking ahead  trend forecasting will play an increasing role for the company. Ferrari said this aspect “is becoming the most difficult part” of the job  noting that if Intercos has been anticipating trends for many years based on its experience  now that is no longer enough. The rapid change in young consumers’ behavior forced the company to invest heavily in “a completely different system of forecasting” called Intercos Intelligence and based on data collected both off- and online.Overall  Ferrari believes that open innovation will be the main driver across all industries. “Either you believe that only bright people work for you or you have to rely on bright people outside  so why not doing that? Big corporations have already started and so have we.”Last year the company inked a five-year agreement with the University of Milano-Bicocca to jointly conduct scientific research on new raw materials  formulations and sustainable processes aimed at developing innovative beauty products.Ferrari revealed he has also tapped an American start-up specialized in AI to further help with formulations. “We are very close to starting this process. It takes a long time because AI works well only if it is full of data  so we’ve been focusing on this part for the last six months ” he said.,neutral,0.07,0.91,0.02,mixed,0.27,0.15,0.58,True,English,"['Intercos’ Innovation Plans', '50 Years', 'Business', 'unprecedented creamy, shiny formulations', 'Italian cosmetics manufacturer', 'half a century', 'past five decades', 'Estée Lauder', 'first turning point', 'first important step', 'supply chain disruptions', '50-50 joint venture', 'R&D staffers', 'Intercos’ pivotal moment', 'U.S. Ferrari', 'first decade', 'first quarter', 'visionary entrepreneur', 'lengthy conversation', 'Agrate Brianza', 'business model', 'different approaches', 'trend forecasting', 'business’ recipe', 'new elements', 'secret ingredient', '11 research centers', '16 sales offices', 'eye shadows', 'skin care', '700 international clients', 'global 5,200 employees', '1,300 new formulas', 'guiding force', 'many shifts', 'personal highlights', 'Prisma Shine', 'special effects', 'precise drawings', 'new technologies', 'lipstick category', 'silicon molds', 'other fields', 'active ingredients', 'extra benefit', 'plant Stateside', 'other clients', 'best factory', 'creative lab', 'big problem', 'early 2000s', 'South Korea', 'global presence', 'local facilities', 'research hubs', 'competitive advantage', 'big customers', 'multinational groups', 'top managers', '174.6 million euros', 'same period', '673.7 million euros', '16 production plants', 'production process', 'decaffeinated coffee', 'coffee plant', 'privileged position', 'air system', '$30-million deal', 'small group', 'strong position', 'pharmaceutical company', 'American company', 'fantastic company', 'beauty industry', 'Dario Ferrari', 'three years', 'Intercos Group', '50 years', 'MILAN', 'impression', 'words', 'beginning', 'way', '40-minute', 'life', 'firm', 'stronger', 'tweaks', 'IPOs', 'tentative', 'effective', 'plenty', 'founder', 'room', 'innovation', 'everything', 'lipsticks', 'pencils', 'launch', 'technology', 'powders', 'performance', 'texture', 'filling', 'assembly', 'ideas', 'terms', 'friend', 'caffeine', 'solvent', 'time', 'discovery', 'career', 'Somebody', 'door', 'condition', 'Bristol', 'everybody', '1990s', 'reality', 'capacity', 'orders', 'factories', 'operations', 'China', 'Italy', 'Brazil', 'India', 'pandemic', 'trends', 'lot', 'space', 'couple', 'competitors', 'HQ', 'result', 'market', 'lockdowns', 'revenues']",2022-07-29,2022-07-30,wwd.com

Activity across our ecosystem—cash  data and derivatives—was robust "" said Edward T. Tilly  Cboe Global Markets Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""Many of our newer initiatives  like the extension of trading hours for SPX and VIX Options to nearly 24 hours-a-day  five days-a-week and the addition of Tuesday and Thursday expirations for SPX Weekly options  have outperformed our early expectations in 2022  further accelerating the strong growth across our core businesses. With the closing of the ErisX and NEO acquisitions in the second quarter  the entire Cboe team remains focused on extracting even greater value from the ecosystem we have created. The digital asset market environment has changed dramatically since we closed the ErisX transaction on May 2nd  which resulted in an accounting adjustment.

These measures are not in accordance with  or a substitute for  GAAP  and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include net transaction and clearing fees  adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  adjusted operating margin  adjusted net (loss) income allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share  effective tax rate on adjusted earnings  adjusted cash  EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release  including adjusted operating income  organic net revenue and adjusted operating expenses  provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.Organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  organic non-transaction revenue and organic net revenue guidance: These are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for the impact of our acquisitions for the period or guidance  as applicable. Management believes the organic net revenue growth and guidance measures provide users with supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing and future potential revenue performances and trends by presenting revenue growth and guidance excluding the impact of the acquisitions. Revenues from acquisitions that have been owned for at least one year are considered organic and are no longer excluded from organic net revenue from either period for comparative purposes.Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such  if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures  it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses  the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore  we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.Acquisition-related expenses: From time to time  we have pursued acquisitions  which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs  as well as legal  due diligence  impairment charges  and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size  timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly  we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.The tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP.

(10) Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenue less cost of revenue.EBITDA ReconciliationsEBITDA (earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to EBITDA acquisition-related expenses  gain on investment  loan forgiveness  investment establishment costs  goodwill impairment  and impairment of investment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income  as an indicator of the company's operating performance  or for cash flow  as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition  because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.Table 5Three Months EndedSix Months Ended(in millions  except percentages)June 30 June 30 Reconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to EBITDA and AdjustedEBITDA (Per Table 1)2022202120222021Net (loss) income allocated to common stockholders$ (184.5)$ 105.2$ (74.9)$ 242.0Interest expense  net14.612.325.424.6Income tax (benefit) provision(72.3)73.743.0129.4Depreciation and amortization40.240.681.182.6EBITDA$ (202.0)$ 231.8$ 74.6$ 478.6EBITDA Margin(47.6) %66.1 %8.9 %66.8 %Non-GAAP adjustments not included in above line itemsAcquisition-related expenses14.31.816.35.2Gain on investment(7.5)—(7.5)—Loan forgiveness(1.3)—(1.3)—Investment establishment costs——3.0—Goodwill impairment460.1—460.1—Impairment of investment10.6—10.6—Adjusted EBITDA$ 274.2$ 233.6$ 555.8$ 483.8Adjusted EBITDA Margin64.7 %66.6 %66.0 %67.6 %Table 6(in millions)June 30 December 31 Reconciliation of Cash and Cash Equivalents to Adjusted Cash20222021Cash and cash equivalents$ 373.3$ 341.9Financial investments68.537.1Less deferred compensation plan assets(25.5)(28.0)Less cash collected for Section 31 Fees(67.2)(25.9)Adjusted Cash$ 349.1$ 325.1Table 7(in millions)Reconciliation of Net Transaction and Clearing Fees by Business Segment –Three Months Ended June 30  2022 and 2021ConsolidatedOptionsN.A.

My name is Courtney and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note this call is being recorded and for the duration your lines will be on listen-only. [Operator Instructions]And I will now hand you over to your host  Stephane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board joined by Giorgio Modica  CFO to begin today's conference. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahGood morning  everybody  and thank you for joining us this morning for the Euronext second quarter 2022 result conference call and webcast. I am Stephane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext.And I will start with the highlights of the second quarter  before handing over to Giorgio Modica  Euronext CFO  who will further develop the main business and financial highlights of the quarter.Euronext  as you have seen  reported a solid performance in the second quarter of 2022  with revenue reaching EUR374.7 million. This demonstrated once again the strength of our business model in a quarter marked by continuous volatility. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew double-digit  compared to what was already a very good second quarter of 2021. This growth is  of course  partly due to the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Group in the latest quarter compared with only two months of consolidation in Q2 2021. As you may remember  we completed the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group on the 29th of April 2021.But this strong performance is also the outcome of solid organic growth across all our activities  driven by several specific factors. First  both non-volume-related revenue and trading activities were up plus 2.5% pro forma  compared to the performance of the second quarter of 2021 underlying revenue. Second  we continued the deployment of our strategic plan  unlocking the first revenue synergies related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group  thanks to the migration of our Core Data Center to Bergamo. Non-volume-related revenue accounted that quarter for 59% of the total revenue and covered 144% of underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A.And on the cost side  the reported increase that you observe is -- in underlying expenses  excluding the D&A  primarily reflects the consolidation of costs from the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. But please note that we managed to partially offset this impact by continued cost control and delivery of additional synergies. Overall  these numbers translated into a plus 2.5% increase pro forma in adjusted EBITDA to EUR221.7 million  resulting in a net adjusted EBITDA margin of 59.2%  in the context of ongoing strategic project and integration costs. And this led to a solid plus 6.4% growth of our adjusted net income to EUR143.2 million. And adjusted EPS was up at EUR1.34  down by 6.1%.This second quarter  moving to Slide five  was a significant one for the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group. First  we successfully completed a key milestone Growth for Impact 2024 strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Center to new  fully green facilities in Bergamo near Milan. This success paves the way for the forthcoming migration of the Italian cash and derivatives markets to the Euronext state-of-the-art European proprietary trading platform optic by the end of H1 2023.Also  we moved one step closer to the European expansion of Euronext clearing with the adoption of the value at risk margin metallurgy for fixed income instruments in June and also the derisking of our investment portfolio that we have undertaken in July. This is a very significant set of steps because these two milestones are two important pillars for building the future of European operating -- or the European operating model of Euronext herein.I would like also to highlight that the contemplated acquisition of the underlying technology powering MTS and Euronext securities Milan from Nexi's capital markets activities that we announced in June is an important accelerator for the integration of your next leading fixed income trading platform and for Euronext securities Milan. In the second quarter 2022  we delivered EUR8.9 million of additional synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. These additional synergies are mainly related to the first phase of revenue synergies arising from the successful migration of Euronext Core Data Center.With regards to the targeted synergies related to the acquisitions of the Borsa Italiana Group and to the integration  we have now reached EUR24.1 million of cumulated run rate EBITDA synergies at the end of the second quarter. In other words  we have already achieved 25% of the targeted synergies four quarters after the closing of the acquisition. In total  we spent EUR36.7 million of cumulative implementation costs incurred at the end of the second quarter 2022. Out of which  EUR5.4 million were spent this quarter.Moving to Slide six. We are very proud to have completed this unprecedented migration of Euronext Core Data Center from Basildon in the U.K. near London to the Aruba Cloud data center in Bergamo near Milan in Italy  only 14-months after we first announced it in April 2021. Of course  beyond the strong rationale for relocating the Euronext Core European trading activities within the European Union following Brexit  this new best-in-class facility presents several very interesting business opportunities. It allows us to control and directly manage our core IT infrastructure  as well as to offer colocation services to our client  which were previously outsourced. The new revenue generated through colocation services are booked under the Euronext Technology Solutions business line. And the synergies-related to this Core Data Center achieved this quarter represent a first phase of synergies  with more services to come in 2023.The new core data center also represents a big advancement of our fit for 1.5 degree climate commitment. Because it is 100% powered by renewable energy  most -- much of which is self-produced through a large photovoltaic system and hydroelectric unit. It therefore allows Euronext to reduce the carbon footprint of the company  while also enabling colocation clients to lower their own environmental impact. This migration contributes materially to the achievement of our science-based climate target.Moving to Slide seven precisely on our climate commitments. As you may know it  in June  we disclosed our detailed greenhouse gas emission reduction targets  which are in line with the Paris Agreement and based on the principles of the Science-based Targets Institute. Concretely  we aim to reduce Euronext Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030  compared to the level of 2020  with further plans to reduce Euronext Scope 3 travel emissions by 46.2% by 2030  compared to the level of 2019.We recognize that the transition towards a more sustainable financial ecosystem is only possible if we do it collectively. Therefore  we will require Euronext suppliers  which represent 67% of Euronext greenhouse gas emission  to set their own Scope 1 and Scope 3 emission reduction target by 2027.These ambitious objectives will be achieved. And I want to stress that these ambitious objectives will be achieved without any purchase of offsetting credit in any way whatsoever. The ambition will be achieved to a performance transformation of our operations  mapped with tangible actions targeting Scope 1  Scope 2 and Scope 3 emission. And those include energy efficiency upgrades  the decommissioning of our vehicle fleet and the implementation of a sustainable travel program.Moving to Slide eight. Lastly  let me turn the spotlight on the successful launch of Euronext Tech Leaders initiative  which we launched last month  together with a network of 13 European and international key partners. The European-wide program consists of several complementary stand: first  the newly created market segment  with more than 100 tech leaders listed on Euronext market  representing more than EUR1 trillion of aggregated market capitalization; second  a full suite of services  providing visibility  communication and promotion of the tech leaders for international investors  and improved trading conditions  notably for retail investors; third  the creation of a community of European tech leaders within Euronext market; and finally  an enlarged pre-IPO services offerings for technology companies.Following the kickoff of the Tech Leaders Initiatives  two new companies have already joined the segment via their listing on Euronext market. DE NORA which listed in Milan in June  and Deezer which is in July on Euronext Paris. We have early July launched the Euronext Tech Leaders Index  tracking the performance of the 110 companies within this segment. Thanks to this initiative  we are now more than ever positioned to support today's and tomorrow's financing of the growth of Euronext -- the growth of European unicorns.I now hand over to Giorgio Modica for the review of our second quarter performance.Giorgio ModicaThank you very much  Stephane  and good morning  everyone.I'm now on Slide 10. In the second quarter of 2022  Euronext's consolidated revenue and income grew 2.3%  compared to the second quarter of 2021  underlying revenue pro forma for the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group. Please note that this excludes EUR6.5 million of non-underlying transitional income related to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group in April 2021  i.e.  prior to the closing of the acquisition.On a reported basis  income revenue grew 14% to EUR374.7 million  representing an increase of EUR45.9 million. On a like-for-like basis  which means excluding pretty much the Borsa Italiana consolidation  Euronext's consolidated revenue was up 2.4%  compared to the second quarter of 2021. These solid results were driven by the growth of our non-volume-related business and trading operation. Trading revenue increased to EUR129.2 million  up 3.7% pro forma and 14.6% on a reported basis  resulting from a dynamic activity in all asset classes  strong revenue capture and a good performance of the fixed income business.Post trade revenue increased 1.8% pro forma and 12.6% on a reported basis to EUR93.9 million  driven by the continued strong activity in clearing  exceptionally high level of net treasury income and a good performance of Euronext securities  despite the normalizing settlement environment. Advanced data service revenue increased to EUR52 million  up 2.4% pro forma and 11.9% on a reported basis due to a solid core data business performance.Listing revenue grew 7.8% pro forma and 15% on a reported basis to EUR55.4 million  demonstrating the resilience of the business and the attractivity of the offering. In terms of revenue mix  this quarter  non-volume-related revenue accounted for 59% of total group revenue versus 60% pro forma the same quarter last year  demonstrating the weight of our non-volume-related activity even during periods of high volatility in volumes. Lastly  non-volume-related revenue covered 144% of our underlying operating costs  excluding D&A  compared to 150% pro forma last year.Let's move now to the next slide for listing. Listing revenue was EUR55.4 million this quarter  an increase of 7.8% on a pro forma basis and 15% on a reported basis  compared to the second quarter of 2021. As I already mentioned during our last call  according to the principle of IFRS 15  admission revenues are recognized over a period of time  which for Euronext mostly ranges between three and five years. As a result  this quarter  we continue to benefit from the exceptional level of activity we recorded last year in 2021.In detail  during the second quarter of 2022  Euronext maintained its leading position in Europe for primary equity listing  counting 19 new listing in a challenging environment. This quarter  EUR1.1 billion was weighed on Euronext primary markets  which represented more than 50% of the total money raised on primary markets in Europe.As far as secondary issue are concerned  EUR11.1 billion was raised in the second quarter of 2022. Euronext also reinforced its position as the leading venue for bond listing worldwide  with over 52 000 bonds listed across all Euronext markets  and continuous growth of our ESG bond listing franchise. This quarter EUR241.7 billion in net was raised on Euronext markets. Overall  this brings us to a total of EUR253.8 billion raised in equity and debt on Euronext market in the second quarter of 2022.Now moving to the next slide. Before dipping dive into the financial performance of our trading business  I would like to spend a minute and walk you through the different metrics demonstrating the superior market quality of our cash market. This quality is even more emphasized during periods of high volatility. Throughout the COVID crisis  we observed a much more resilient liquidity environment on Euronext market  compared to competing MTFs  where liquidity faded as soon as volatility started to spike.During the last two quarter  Euronext maintain its position as the largest  deepest and most stable single liquidity pool in Europe  offering the highest quality of execution to its market participants. On average  during the second quarter of 2022  Euronext recorded that EBBO present on blue chip stocks that was 20% higher than the one of any competing MTF. The difference becomes even more visible when looking at the EBBO setting  which was 4 times to 5 times higher on average at Euronext versus the multilateral trading facilities.Another indicator of our market quality are the lower markouts  thanks to the heterogeneity of investors in our market  which provides a much healthier liquidity environment than competing MTFs. Lastly  I would also like to stress that even during periods of volatility  which generally lead to widening of spreads across European equity markets  Euronext maintain the lowest average spreads  compared to the other markets.Let's move now to the financial performance of our trading business next on Slide 13  and let's start with trading. On a pro forma basis  including Borsa Italiana  ADV increased by 3.3% to EUR11.6 billion  supported by a volatile trading environment. Average revenue capture over the quarter was at 0.51 basis point  resulting from an active management  and the market share averaged 67.1%  both including cash markets in Italy. Cash trading revenue increased 1.4% pro forma and 7.4% on a reported basis to EUR75.3 million.Moving on to derivatives. Derivatives trading revenue was up 8.3% pro forma and 14.3% on a reported basis to EUR14.9 million  due to lower volumes  but higher average fees mainly linked to a better mix of products. Pro forma average daily volumes on financial derivative was down 4.7% from the second quarter of 2021  reflecting a decrease in equity future and option trading. Commodities pro forma average daily volume decreased 4.4% this quarter  reflecting the high price environment for agriculture commodity derivatives. On the other side of the quarter  the average revenue capture for derivative reached EUR0.32 per lot  as I said  mainly thanks to a mix effect.Lastly  on to fixed income trading. Fixed income trading reported revenues at EUR24.9 million  primarily resulting from the consolidation of MTS. On a pro forma basis  fixed income revenue increased 2.4%. In the second quarter of 2022  MTS cash generated EUR16.6 million of revenues and MTS Repo generated EUR5.4 million of revenues  in a market dominated by increasing interest rates.MTS cash posted a solid performance  mainly thanks to the very high level of activity in the first two months of the second quarter. And ADV record at EUR22.7 billion  down 16.8% versus a very strong second quarter of 2021. MTS Repo trading saw a strong traction this quarter  with term adjusted ADV up 25% to EUR347.5 billion.Continuing with trading  let's move on Slide 14. The second quarter of 2022 saw a strong performance for Euronext FX in terms of both revenue and average daily volumes  thanks to the positive impact of volatility. Euronext reported average spot effect trading volumes of EUR23.6 billion  up 27% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Spot effects trading revenue increased 27.6%  compared to the second quarter of 2021 at EUR7.3 million. Our trading reported EUR6.9 million in revenue  a growth of 3.4%  compared to the same quarter last year as a result of a larger footprint of Central Europe and in the U.K. and a very strong position in the Nordics in the second quarter of 2022.Average daily day ahead power traded was 2.52 terawatt hour  with an increase of 15.9% versus the same quarter last year. And average daily intraday power traded was 0.09 terawatt hour  up 27.5% compared to the second quarter of 2021.Moving to Slide 15. Revenue from our post-trade activities  including net treasury income  increased 18%  EUR109.6 million. Clearing revenue was up 18% this quarter and 5.5% on a pro forma basis to EUR31.4 million  resulting from the volatile trading environment as well to the higher treasury income from LCH SA. On a like-for-like basis  clearing revenue was up 4.1% year-on-year. Net treasury income through the CCP business of Euronext Clearing reached an exceptionally high level of EUR15.7 million. This performance reflects a very high level of margin posted over the quarter and should not consider as a stable one.But let me further develop on the net treasury income. In line with the road map to make Euronext Clearing a leading European clearinghouse  we decided to take step to neutralize the expected impact of interest rate variation on our net trading treasury income going forward. Euronext Clearing held a portfolio of fixed income security of approximately EUR4 billion to EUR5 billion  with a 12-month average maturity. This portfolio represented approximately 25%  30% of the margin collected from clearing members  while the rest was deposit at variable rate  mainly at ECB.In the context of the increasing interest rate  we decided to progressively exit our investment portfolio. In particular  Euronext Clearing disposed the part of its portfolio maturing after the 1st May 2023  which represent approximately 50% of the overall portfolio  while it will hold until maturity the rest of the portfolio. This means that at beginning of the second quarter of 2023  Euronext Clearing will hold no outright portfolio investment portfolio.This decision will have the following implication. The surplus regulatory capital of Euronext is expected to increase. The decrease of regulatory capital requirement for Euronext Clearing linked to the divestment of the portfolio will more than compensate the negative impact on regulatory capital of the EUR35 million let loss resulting from the disposal. This loss will be booked in the third quarter of 2022 as a part of our non-underlying net treasury income. The net treasury income on the margin collected will stabilize then around 20 basis point  except in the fourth quarter of 2022 when we expect a margin of around 10 basis point and in the first quarter of 2023  when we expect a margin of around 15 basis point.Finally  as the sale of the portfolio will have no negative impact on the regulatory available capital of the Group  Euronext decided that the dividend for the fiscal year 2022 will be adjusted exceptionally to neutralize any negative impact of this operation.Now let's move back to the business performance of the quarter and move to the custody and settlement. Custody and settlement and other post-trade revenue encompassing the activity of the four CSD we operate under Euronext Securities brand was up 10.1% to EUR62.5 million on a reported basis. The performance illustrates a significant contribution of Euronext Security Milan and a diversified business model  enabling to capture value in the context of normalizing settlement activity. On a pro forma basis  revenue is up 0.1%.Moving to Slide 16. Advanced Data Service revenue was up 11.9% to EUR52 million  this represent a 2.4% increase on a pro forma basis  compared to the second quarter of 2021  driven by strong traction of our Core Data business. Investor Service revenue was at EUR2.3 million in the second quarter of 2022  up 4.9%  reflecting the continued expansion of the franchise. Lastly  on Technology Solution  revenue was up 5.6%  compared to the second quarter of ‘21 to EUR24.1 million as a result of the consolidation of the Borsa Italiana Technology business. On a pro forma basis  Technology Solution revenue decreased 8.4%.Moving to Slide 18 for the financial highlights of the quarter. I would like to start with the EBITDA bridge. Euronext adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 12.3% to EUR221.7 million. On a pro forma basis  adjusted EBITDA was up 2.5%  demonstrating our ability to capture value and maintain our trademark cost discipline. Please note that the increase of cost in the second quarter of 2022 is not linked to inflation  but to the post-pandemic context. The normalization of the context triggers higher costs linked to be back at the office  higher travel and marketing expenses.The adjusted EBITDA margin slightly decreased to 59.2% this quarter from 60% the same quarter last year. On a like-for-like basis  EBITDA margin was 58.3% this quarter and adjusted EBITDA increased 1.7%. Finally  the non-underlying costs  excluding D&A  are mainly linked to the integration of Borsa Italiana.Moving to Slide 19 for the bridge on net income. Net income increased this quarter 37.2% to EUR118.9 million. On a pro forma basis  the net income increased 25.6%  resulting from the following elements. Pro forma EBITDA grew EUR23.8 million  as we just discussed. D&A was broadly in line  with a slight increase of EUR0.5 million. The net financing income is down versus last year as it is not impacted by the cost of the bridge financing for the acquisition of Borsa Italiana  I would like also to highlight that we exited the swap we had on our EUR500 million inaugural bond. This means that now 100% of our debt benefit from fixed and very competitive terms.Results from equity investment decreased by EUR1.1 million. As exceptionally  in the second quarter of 2021  we received the dividend of Sicovam  not distributed in 2020  due to the pandemic situation. I would like to highlight as well that the non-underlying costs in the bridge are mainly represented by DNA  namely the PPA amortization of our acquisition.Lastly  income tax for the second quarter of 2022 was EUR45.2 million. This translated into an effective tax rate for the quarter of EUR27.1 million. Adjusted for non-underlying costs  adjusted net income was EUR143.2 million. And adjusted EPS is down 6.1% to EUR1.43 per share this quarter. If we look at the performance of the first six months  adjusted EPS is at EUR2.89 per share  up 0.6% versus the first six months of last year at EUR2.87 per share.Moving to the next slide  Slide 24  the cash flow generation and leverage. Net operating cash flow amounted to EUR76.8 million. Excluding the impact on net working capital from Nord Pool and Euronext Clearing  net operating cash flow accounted for 42.1% of EBITDA  impacted by the seasonal payment of taxes.I would like to remind that there are specifically high tax outflows in France and Italy in the second quarter of the year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.4 times in the second quarter of '21 at the end  slightly up compared to the previous quarter  reflecting the payment of the 2021 dividend  partially offset by the cash flow generation of the period.Moving on to Slide 21  for the evolution of our liquidity position over the quarter. I would like to highlight that our liquidity position remains strong  above EUR1.3 billion  including the undrawn RCF of EUR600 million  and excluding the cash currently in Transit and Nord Pool.That's it for me. And with this  I would like to give back the floor to Stephane.Stephane BoujnahThank you  Giorgio. I would like to -- before moving to the Q&A  I would like to emphasize that our 2022 dividend will not be impacted negatively by the change in our investment portfolio policy and will be adjusted accordingly  as Giorgio said  I'm now available for your questions  together with Giorgio Modica  Anthony Attia and Simon Gallagher.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes in from the line of Kyle Vytorin from KBW. Please go ahead.Matt MoonHi  good morning. This is actually Matt Moon on for Kyle Vyt. I just had one on the Euronext Clearing investment portfolio rundown by the first quarter '23 end. Just to be clear  can you just clarify the size of that contribution to NTI? Is that the entirety of that NTI line? Or will there still be a portion of the margin that will be invested in shorter duration  if not overnight rates?And could you provide a little bit more detail on how much capital this actually frees up for you on an ongoing basis as well? And maybe just expand upon the broader rationale for the decision. It sounds like it's related to reducing interest rate volatility. But just wanted to hear your thoughts -- expanded thoughts there. Thanks.Stephane BoujnahGiorgio?Giorgio ModicaYes  absolutely. So what was implicit in what I just described is the proceeds of the disposal are going to be invested at TCB at variable rate. So what we're going to see is that progressively  the 25%  30% that we were investing in fixing some security are going to gradually reduced to zero  which means that everything is going to be invested at variable rates.So what are the steps? The first step  as I said  is that we did cut the position by two. So we moved from 25% to around 10% invested in fixed income securities. And then in the next six  seven months  this position will gradually go to zero. And at that point in time  the result of our investment are going to be completely at variable rate. So the logic is simply as we are entering a phase of expected increase of interest rate  and the number of hikes between now and the next couple of years can be significant. We wanted to have a portfolio that better reflects the current environment. So as I said  I already commented on the level that this new strategy will provide around 20 basis point. And as well in terms of size  I believe that I covered that as well  the portfolio was in between EUR4 billion and EUR5 billion. Now it's divided by two. And again  by the beginning of next year  it's going to be zero.Matt MoonOkay  great. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Haley Tam calling from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.Haley TamGood morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Can I have three  please? Two on synergies and one on fixed income. Firstly  on the synergies from the data center migration  can you confirm whether all of those synergies are now affected in the EUR8.9 million annualized benefit you saw in Q2? Or is there still further opportunities to capture from the extra services you can offer to your users?Secondly  Nexi  Capital Markets Technology business. You said it'd be an accelerator of integration of MTS fixed income and Euronext Securities Milan. Are there any further comments on the likely timing and scale of the additional synergies from that acquisition?And then the third question  just on fixed income  I guess  both from a listing and a trading perspective. Can you give us any idea of what you might expect in terms of the impact on trading and listing of the current environment? So I guess I'm thinking about the political uncertainty in Italy  the rising ECB rates  the end of the pandemic emergency purchase program and also the new transmission protection instruments. I guess there's a lot going on. Your help to understand how this might impact you would be very much appreciated. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahMaybe  Anthony  you can answer on the outlook for the listing business considering the macro environment. And Giorgio will answer your question on synergies and on the Nexi capital markets position.Anthony AttiaThank you  Stephane. Good morning  Hal. Your question was about the bond listing business in Europe. So we have several observations we can share with you. The first one is the current environment has significantly slow down the CLOs program  the collateral loan obligation program  so that's the first impact. Now from a corporate bond point of view  we see a sustained demand so far. And so it's -- we don't see any negative impact. And obviously  from the point of view of the sovereign debt  there is a significant activity.Giorgio ModicaYes. First  I wanted to start because I now remember that I missed the part of the previous question. So when it comes to capital release  I cannot be super specific  but I can give you an order of magnitude. We are talking of high single-digit million euro in terms of capital release net loss. The second element on the synergies  the EUR8.9 million are for the vast majority linked to the transition of the data center  but are not 100% linked to that. We expect further synergies in the course of 2023 related to that activity. And overall  we're expecting a number of synergies coming from the data center  which is of around EUR10 million.And then when it comes to the next question  which is around the acquisition  the transaction is not yet closed. We confirm that we expect the transaction to close by the end of the year. It's too early to give more details. But we confirm that we expect this transaction to generate a positive return and in line with our cost of capital.Haley TamThank you.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Arnaud Giblat calling from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.Arnaud GiblatGood morning. I've got three questions  please. You helpfully gave guidance on the future net interest margin to be expected. I'm just wondering if you could talk about the drivers of cash balances and what the sensitivities are to different market inputs.Second  you're running quite a bit ahead of your cost guidance if I annualize H1. Are you expecting a significant step-up in investments for H2 to get you to your guidance? Or more -- or is the upside risk there? And finally  I hear that there might be some realignment of pricing in Italy. It's coming up soon. Is that something you can confirm? And could you maybe quantify the upside risk there? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahArnaud  could you -- this is Stephane. I believe I got it. Can you rephrase your first question  because it was not very clear to me? The second question on the cost guidance and the third one on pricing was very clear  but the first one was not clear to me.Arnaud GiblatYes. No. So the guidance you gave on net interest margin is pretty clear  20 basis points once you've disposed your portfolio. I'm just wondering how to think about cash balances. What are the drivers for that to think about? What are the macro inputs?Stephane BoujnahOkay. So Giorgio.Giorgio ModicaAbsolutely. So there are three elements to the question. One element is clearly the volatility of the market  because the more volatile  the more -- the risk model command for a higher level of collateral from clearing members. And it is under clearly -- is difficult to predict. But assuming a situation that stays as it is today  we should expect a relatively high level of collateral. If I look in the last 12  24 month  the range of collateral required is around -- in between EUR15 billion and EUR22 billion  this is what we have recorded.Then going forward  there are going to be a number of moving part. And clearly  I can comment on the situation  pre-expansion of services provided by Euronext Clearing to the Euronext market. So we have announced migration to a change to the VAR model. This will have a slight impact  which is single-digit  but it's difficult to be quantified the next year. So the more precise range that I can give to you is that in the past  we have had between EUR15 billion and EUR22 billion. The impact on VAR should not be disproportionate on those level. And if the level of volatility is going to remain high  we should expect to have high level of collateral.Then on your second question around the cost  we did reduce by EUR10 million last quarter. The target  we are holding up well to achieve that. And this quarter  we don't feel comfortable in changing that. We will clearly  as always  reassess. Then the final point on fee changes  I wouldn't call it fee changes. Clearly  as you know  next year  we're going to migrate to a new technology. And we will look at some form of harmonization between the fees across our markets. The impact of that  we will -- it's too early to comment.Arnaud GiblatThanks.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Mike Werner calling from UBS. Please go ahead.Mike WernerThank you very much for the presentation. Just one question. We've seen Europe developing or in the process of trying to develop a consolidated tape for the markets here. I just wanted to get your view on that and what the potential impact could be to Euronext? Thanks.Stephane BoujnahWe are in intense conversations with all the relevant constituencies involved in those debates. At this particular moment  the debate is on the table of the Council of the European Union and at the European Parliament. There is a proposal in the table from the European Commission. There is an initial view from the reporter in the Parliament. We do believe that there is still room for flexibility  because clearly  there is a misunderstanding at this stage about what is the core -- what are the core fragmentation issues. And the core fragmentation issues in Europe are with the OTC derivatives  ETFs and fixed income  not with equity markets. So these discussions are ongoing.Clearly  it's too early to tell what would be the implications for Euronext  because we don't even know whether it will be a post-trade consolidated tape  a pre-trade consolidated tape  a real-time consolidated tap. Beyond the phrase consolidated tape  you have plenty of solutions that will have fundamentally different implications  not only for Euronext  but for the full market. And also  these discussions are taking in parallel to other discussions about the market architecture and the future of systematic internalizers and the rules applying thereof. So it's really  really too early to give a final care to provide you something that you could put in your model because it was in progress.Mike WernerThank you.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Benjamin Goy calling from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Benjamin GoyYes  hi. Good morning. Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank. Just one major question left  and sorry to stand at one of these conference calls. Because your yield management was again very good  so I just was wondering  because there seems to be a recurring element  what is the outlook here? And are you more positive on a sustainably higher rate in cash equities going forward? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahSo I'll leave the floor to Simon Gallagher  the Head of Cash and Derivative Markets.Simon GallagherThank you for your questions. So as we said  the robust yield management at Euronext is a result of a highly segmented pricing strategy. And the outlook for the yield management is broadly stable over the next quarters. And as Giorgio said  there'll be opportunities with the onboarding of the Italian markets for further segmentation and yield management.Giorgio ModicaMaybe a follow-up comment on my side. You might remember in the past  we guided for a 0.50 basis point. That was Euronext standalone  the 0.51 we're posting today includes the durative impact from Borsa Italiana. Just to clarify that.Benjamin GoyYes. And should we then take the 0.51 as the run rate going forward? Or what was the stability we're referring to?Giorgio ModicaI mean  what I would say is that if we look at the previous quarter at 0.47  we were -- in Euronext term standalone  we were ahead of the target of 0.50 on a stand-alone basis. So I would look at the 0.51 as a high number. So I guess  standing slightly below 0.5 is something that is a sustainable longer term.Benjamin GoyUnderstood. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Johannes Thormann calling from HSBC. Please go ahead.Johannes ThormannGood morning  everybody. Two questions from my side left. First off  on the net interest margin in the Clearing business. Do you -- just because it was not clear to me  do you keep it flat at 20 bps? Or also  do you want to benefit from future ECB rate hikes?And secondly  on your agriculture trading activity  it looks a bit counterintuitive that the volumes continue to trend down. As normally with higher prices  trading activity goes up  also in other commodities like oil and gas. Okay  you can also hint to power probably where the effects are mixed. But normally  you would say historically high prices trigger higher activity. So what is your reason or your thinking why those volumes are so weak? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahGiorgio?Giorgio ModicaYes. So starting with your second question -- on your first question. So the idea  and what we're going to implement is pretty simple  a variable -- fully variable liability and fully variable assets. So the 20 bps are going to be independent of the level of interest rate as long as  at least  but it's too early to tell  and we don't see that coming in the short future  the situation will stabilize.Your second question on commodities. You need to consider several elements  including the seasonal effect  and the fact that the harvest season is happening in the third quarter. So you should not look directly at the second quarter as a good proxy of what could happen going forward.And final comment in this respect  that we remain mainly a physical market  which means that the significant portion of the trading is done by not by the financial player  but by farmers hedging the product. And this gives us to a certain extent a limitation to the volumes. But again  you should look at the evolution of volumes  considering that -- especially milling wheat is a seasonal activity and a seasonal business. And in the third quarter  we have a good sign that seems to point out that the third quarter  which is  again  the harvesting is going to be a good quarter.OperatorThank you. The next question comes in from the line of Ian White calling from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.Ian WhiteHi  good morning. Thanks for the presentation. Thanks for taking my questions. I also had three  please. First of all  on the previous call  I think you said with regard to the medium-term revenue guidance of 3% to 4% that you were kind of considering whether that was still the right range  and you might think about coming back to us with an update on that. Just wondered if you could provide latest thoughts around whether that 3% to 4% is still the correct range  please.Secondly  just in terms of the IPO market. I acknowledge the points you made about market share. But obviously  IPO market has been very weak across Europe in the first half of the year. Is there anything you can say in terms of the pipeline  for example  that you see in terms of appetite to issue on Euronext markets when conditions normalize?And just final one on regulation again. There seems to be some discussion at the sort of European level about regulation for dark pools  and in particular  scrapping the double volume cap mechanism to sort of stave off competition from the U.K. effectively. Just wondered if you could share any thoughts around that too  please  and the impact you might see on Euronext markets.Giorgio ModicaYes. Basically  the limits on dark pool trading were to be removed?Ian WhiteThank you.Stephane BoujnahI'll take the third question and second question and Giorgio will cover the question on the top line guidance. On the regulatory questions  as I told on the consolidated tape issues  the discussions are ongoing. The discussions you are referring to are part of a debate on the market architecture relating in part to the future of systematic internalizers. Whatever the solution will be will be a package deal consolidating the -- all the parameters of the debate  the future dark pool  the future of systematic internalizers  the future of consolidated tape  if any. So I think it would be totally speculative and artificial and unstable to make any comments about the likely consequences of that particular discussion at the moment.On the IPO markets  we are in a situation which is ambivalent. On the one hand  there is definitely a post in a number of listing. But the IPO market is not closed. Since the beginning of the year  we had 41 listing on Euronext market  which compares to 104 last year. This is not as dynamic for sure  but this is not a closed market. It's a market where -- which is more selective and where many issuers are postponing their project.What is really interesting is that Euronext remains the venue of choice for listing  in particular  for international listing. When you compare the numbers of listings on Euronext since the beginning of the year with the other European venues  you have 41 listing on Euronext since the beginning of the year. You have 19 on the London Stock Exchange and 3 on Deutsche Borse. And when it comes to international listings  i.e.  listings from companies that are not from issuers that have their legal headquarter within Euronext countries  we had 10 of those listings out of 41  whereas there were only four non-U.K. listing in the London Stock Exchange since the beginning of the year and two at Deutsche Borse.So my point is that the competitiveness of Euronext as the venue of choice for listing  in particular  for international listing in Europe is there  just because we now have 25% of the equity traded in Europe that are trading on Euronext market. And we have now the deepest liquidity pool and the deepest aggregate market capitalizations. It's between EUR6.4 trillion and EUR6.8 trillion of aggregate market capitalization that you find on Euronext market  compared to -- which is approximately twice the size of the aggregate market capitalization of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange and approximately 3 times the size of the Deutsche Borse aggregate market capitalization. So this is the venue of choice big time.And I just want to underline that 50% of the listings this year were tech companies. And with the initiatives we have launched  the Euronext tech leaders initiative  we are seeing a momentum and appetite for technology companies in Europe that consider that this segment  this European tech leader segment  is now the place to list when you are a technology company in Europe. That's why we had already just in the past few weeks two tech listings  one in Milan  one in Paris  in this segment. So we are confident that despite the current volatility  uncertainty on pricing and valuation  the fundamental pipeline is there. Companies are there. Appetite of investors is there. It's just that volatility makes standard IPO process more complicated than when the outlook is more predictable  so I'm confident.Giorgio  on the top line?Giorgio ModicaYes. And maybe last time around  there was a slight misunderstanding that I wanted to clarify. So it's clear that we are always looking to give to the market the most accurate targets. But I didn't mean that every quarter  we would have reopened the topic on long-term target. Again  it's not even 12 months since the beginning of -- when we launched the Investor Day. And the market situation is such that we believe that it is not the right moment to do that. And it might not be the right moment even next or the following one. So we will proactively communicate when we believe that the conditions are such to update this target. But again  I was not intending to give an update this quarter. Thank you.Ian WhiteThanks. Appreciate it.OperatorThe next question comes in from the line of Tobias Lukesch calling from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.Tobias LukeschYes. Good morning  also three questions from my side  please. First  again  on the disposal of the investment books. Just out of curiosity  were you in discussions with the regulators about that investment portfolio? And to understand the mechanics basically of the net interest income  so you're charging 20 bps as a base  if I understand you correctly  which at a EUR20 billion cash balance makes a kind of EUR40 million per year. So -- and if the ECB rates were to rise into a positive territory  i.e.  25%  would that imply kind of a 5 bps top-up basically on the whole amount?Secondly  on the squeeze of the sub-CSDs  can you quantify basically the positive impact on your business from that side?And thirdly  on the listing again  how should we think about the revenue line development in ‘23 given the lower share prices in general and the fact that it's -- the base is also for your fees? I mean  with IFRS  I know you kind of smoothed these revenue generation. So should we rather expect to continue to see solid growth in '23? Or might there be a little bad surprise on that side? Thank you.Stephane BoujnahTobias  can you repeat the second question  which was not very clear?Tobias LukeschOn the squeeze of the sub-CSDs? Yes  I mean  in that market  I mean we realize  especially also some of the countries where sub-CSDs providers go out of business  basically and where the business is then shared between primary clients  be it a big investment bank and you guys  to favor potentially of the client. But there  I think there's a chunk of business also that flows then in your P&L. And I was just wondering if this is something which moves the needle a bit on the revenue outlook and growth potential.Stephane BoujnahSo I'll take the questions on the listing and on the fees. And Anthony will take the question on CSDs and Giorgio will answer on the regulators on the NTI. So clearly  our listing fees are not massively driven by underlying valuations. So in general  the underlying valuation is not affecting our listing policy revenues. So that's clear. So I'll leave the floor to Anthony to complement that point or to provide additional nuances and to cover the CSDs point.Anthony AttiaThank you  Stephane. Just to complement the yearly fees on equity listing  the valuation that is taken into account is the one at the year-end. And so that gives you an idea of the impact of the evolution of the valuations. But so currently  the revenues that we declare are both impacted by IFRS 15  obviously  as you said  the virus. But also they are capturing the market situation at the end of last year. On your CSD question.Tobias LukeschSorry. And that I was just wondering  looking into next year  if this is a kind of a linear approach we should apply i.e.  market down 10%  listing down 10%? Is that something we can assume? Or would that be penalizing you too much?Anthony AttiaNo  no. First of all  we don't want to provide any kind of forward-looking view on this. But again  the level of reported leasing fees capture the IFRS 15 element. And also  we have a fee adjustment that are done in order to remain close to the market. So we -- your statement is not correct.And now on the Nordic CSD situation  as you pointed out  there are some changes in the ecosystem in the Nordic countries around the value chain. As we explained during the Investor Day last year  we are working with our clients to capture some of these changes and deliver some services as an outsourcing partner. So this is the development of post-trade services in the Nordics. Also  you might have seen that we have published a news about some significant U.K. custodian becoming a direct client of Euronext Securities Copenhagen. This is also part of these changes. So for our CSD business  the trend is positive on that particular topic.Giorgio ModicaYes. So on my side  just an additional element on listing. It is important to highlight that the equity annual fees represent 25%  30% of the total revenues. So it's a relatively small portion. And as Anthony said  a decrease in market capitalization is not equally reflected in a decrease on the revenue capture.So on the NTI  another element to clarify  our decision is a decision of value maximization. It has nothing to do with regulatory approval  et cetera. So we always operate within the boundaries of what we can do. We are only adjusting our investment strategy to an evolving market condition. And the result of that is that  as this part of the clearing business is  in fact  the spread business  we -- this is the margin that we will apply  having assets and liabilities at variable rate. So just -- I take the opportunity of your question to say that  again  this decision has nothing to do with funding workforce. It's a decision of maximization. We don't want to take any risk. Our clearing houses are more than sufficiently capitalized. And actually  as I said  this decision will further increase the level of regulatory capital available. So it's more of a business decision than anything else.Tobias LukeschUnderstood. Thank you  Giorgio. But sorry for asking again here. If the ECB rates go to 50 bps  do we then have a 50 bps on the cash balances? Or how would that move?Giorgio ModicaAs the asset and the liability will be linked to the same variable rate  is going to be indifferent. If the ECB will go up to whatever level  then we would pay and receive the same variable element on asset and liability. And therefore  the spread would remain the same. The only part for which this is not true is  on a temporary basis  between now and the moment where we will have completely run down the portfolio. And this is the reason why I gave specific guidance with respect to the level to expect in the fourth quarter this year and in the first quarter next year. But then from that moment on  again  the 20 basis point are going to be independent on of the ECB decisions.Tobias LukeschVery clear. Thank youOperatorThank you. That was the final question in the queue. So I shall hand the call back across to yourself  Stephane Boujnah  for any concluding remarks. Thank you.Stephane BoujnahThank you very much for your time.

8445,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4526076-klepierre-presents-strong-dividend-yield,Klepierre: Trading At 8.5 Times 2023 Earnings And A 8.7% Dividend Yield (KLPEF),Klepierre is one of the largest commercial REITs in Europe  with an asset base of in excess of 20B EUR. Read why Klepierre is a buy at these levels.,"Kwangmoozaa/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionJust when we thought the COVID crisis was over and REITs would benefit from 'the new normal "" the European political landscape changed completely when Russia invaded Ukraine. And although commercial REITs in Western Europe are not directly impacted (other than higher heating costs in the malls)  the consumer confidence levels and spiking inflation may reduce the footfall and that's why most REIT share prices have evolved sideways lately. Klepierre (OTCPK:KLPEF) owns in excess of 20B EUR of commercial real estate in Western Europe (with France (40%)  Italy (20%) and Scandinavia (13%) as main contributors to the net rental income) has seen its share price decrease by almost 20% since my previous article was published. And while it's OK to be conservative  I think Klepierre is now too cheap to ignore.Yahoo FinanceKlepierre has its primary listing on Euronext Paris where it's trading with LI as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume remained pretty stable at approximately 1 million shares per day  so the Paris listing clearly offers superior liquidity compared to the secondary listings. I will use the EUR as the base currency throughout this article.All relevant data and publications can be found here.A strong set of results in the first half of the year bodes well for the second semesterIt's always interesting to see the half-year results of Western European REITs as the quarterly updates are generally just trading updates. And Klepierre most definitely did not disappoint in the first semester of the current financial year.In the first half of the year  Klepierre's gross rental income increased by almost 30% while the rental expenses decreased by 39%. This is obviously entirely related to the tenants going back to paying the rent in full rather than Klepierre providing rent support (which both weighed on the revenue as well as on the expenses depending on whether a tenant was provided with definitive relief or reduced/suspended payments). The EBITDA of the REIT exploded by almost 64% to 467M EUR.Klepierre Investor RelationsWhat really matters here are the ""current cash flows "" sometimes also called the ""direct result per share."" This could be compared with the FFO used in North America. The net current cash flow in the first half of the year came in at 372M EUR (428M EUR on a consolidated basis  but there are minority interests that need to be taken into account as well). The EPRA earnings were pretty close to this result as those came in at 369.4M EUR or 1.30 EUR per share. A 2 cent per share straight-line amortization benefit further boosted this to 1.32 EUR per share on an adjusted basis. That's almost double the result from in the first half of last year.Keep in mind  there are a few non-recurring items that provided a nice boost to this per-share result. Included in the 1.32 EUR per share is a non-recurring benefit of 0.12 EUR per share caused by the reversal of provisions for COVID-related losses. So on an underlying basis  the direct result per share was approximately 1.20 EUR.Klepierre Investor RelationsThe full-year guidance was hiked  the LTV ratio was reduced  and I expect a dividend hikeThe strong result in the first half of the year allowed Klepierre to hike its full-year result to 2.45 EUR per share. This still includes the 0.12 EUR in non-recurring COVID-related provision reversals in the first half of the year  and I think this means Klepierre is still underpromising and will likely overdeliver. Excluding these reversals  the H1 direct result was approximately 1.20 EUR per share. So on an annualized basis this would already represent a full-year result of 2.40 EUR and adding that 0.12 EUR per share would result in a direct result per share of 2.52 EUR per share. Sure  the REIT sold some assets after the end of the first semester  but I am also anticipating some inflation-related rent hikes  so I think Klepierre's new guidance is still a bit conservative.The guidance hike comes about six months after I already thought the REIT's official guidance was too low. In my February article  I wrote:[…] while the FY 2022 guidance of 2.30-2.35 EUR per share is slightly lower than my expectations of 2.40-2.50 EUR per share.With the full-year guidance updated to 2.45 EUR per share  Klepierre's official guidance is now right in the middle of the range I was anticipating a while ago. This also means I'm now more confident in indeed seeing a dividend hike. While Klepierre hasn't provided an update on the expectations for the full-year dividend  I expect an increase from the 1.70 EUR per share that was paid out based on the FY 2021 result. The 1.70 EUR represented a payout ratio of 78% of the 2.18 EUR in direct result per share and applying an 80% payout ratio on the 2.45 EUR DRPS would result in a dividend of 1.96 EUR per share. Perhaps Klepierre will want to deduct the 0.12 EUR in non-recurring income from the starting point in which case the full-year dividend would come in at 1.86 EUR per share. Pretty close to my estimate of 1.85 EUR per share I posted in February  so for now I'm sticking with a dividend anticipation of 1.85 EUR per share.Subsequent to the end of the first semester  Klepierre sold a few more assets  and this reduced the pro forma LTV ratio to just 38.8%. That's the lowest it has been since year-end 2021  but keep in mind the REIT paid a 1.70 EUR cash dividend in the first half of this year which had a negative impact of about 220bp on the LTV ratio. Excluding this dividend  the LTV ratio would have come in at 36.6% and comfortably below the year-end 2021 ratio. As Klepierre pays an annual dividend  the in excess of 300M EUR in direct result expected to be generated in the current semester will likely push the LTV ratio to just above 37% (excluding changes in the valuation of the assets).Klepierre Investor RelationsInvestment thesisThis means Klepierre is now attractive again on pretty much every metric. The stock is trading at just 8.5 times the annualized H2 direct result per share while the dividend yield increases to 8.7% if my assumption of a dividend of 1.85 EUR per share turns out to be correct. Keeping the occupancy at a high level will now be Klepierre's main focus as that's what will ultimately drive the per-share results.As of the end of June  Klepierre's NTA came in at 30.60 EUR per share while the Net Disposal Value (including the deduction of capital gains taxes) was 29.2 EUR per share. The combination of a low earnings multiple  healthy dividend and decent discount to the tangible value and disposable value makes Klepierre very interesting at the current levels.",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.31,0.16,0.53,True,English,"['8.5 Times 2023 Earnings', '8.7% Dividend Yield', 'Klepierre', 'KLPEF', 'net current cash flow', 'share straight-line amortization benefit', 'recurring COVID-related provision reversals', 'most REIT share prices', 'current cash flows', 'European political landscape', 'higher heating costs', 'consumer confidence levels', 'average daily volume', 'The EPRA earnings', 'net rental income', 'commercial real estate', 'gross rental income', 'inflation-related rent hikes', 'current financial year', 'Western European REITs', 'Klepierre Investor Relations', 'H1 direct result', 'recurring benefit', 'recurring income', 'COVID-related losses', 'commercial REITs', 'recurring items', 'rental expenses', 'Getty Images', 'COVID crisis', 'new normal', 'main contributors', 'Yahoo Finance', 'primary listing', 'Euronext Paris', 'ticker symbol', '1 million shares', 'Paris listing', 'superior liquidity', 'secondary listings', 'base currency', 'relevant data', 'strong set', 'first half', 'second semester', 'quarterly updates', 'trading updates', 'first semester', 'rent support', 'definitive relief', 'suspended payments', 'North America', 'consolidated basis', 'minority interests', 'A 2 cent', 'adjusted basis', 'nice boost', 'underlying basis', 'full-year guidance', 'LTV ratio', 'annualized basis', 'new guidance', 'guidance hike', 'official guidance', 'FY 2022 guidance', 'payout ratio', 'starting point', 'strong result', 'full-year result', 'FY 2021 result', 'dividend hike', 'full-year dividend', 'previous article', 'February article', 'half-year results', 'last year', 'share result', '20B EUR', '2.45 EUR DRPS', '1.32 EUR', '0.12 EUR', '1.70 EUR', '2.18 EUR', '1.86 EUR', 'Kwangmoozaa', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'malls', 'footfall', 'OTCPK', 'KLPEF', 'excess', 'France', 'Italy', 'Scandinavia', 'day', 'publications', 'tenants', 'revenue', 'reduced', 'EBITDA', '467M', 'FFO', '372M', 'account', '369.4M', 'mind', 'non', 'provisions', 'assets', 'expectations', 'middle', 'range', 'increase', 'case', 'estimate', '1.20', '1.96']",2022-07-30,2022-07-30,seekingalpha.com

(TSXV.DMI / OTCQB-DMIFF / FRA-DC3A)  (the ""Company"") announces that due to ongoing delays in South Africa noted below  the Company will be unable to file its audited financial statements and corresponding management's discussion and analysis for the year ended March 31  2022 (collectively  the ""Financial Disclosure"") on or before the prescribed filing deadline of July 29  2022 as required by National Instrument 51-102 - Continuous Disclosure Obligations.The Company's mining operations are located in South Africa  which has been experiencing Stage 6 load-shedding (also known as rolling blackouts) this month by the state-owned electricity utility  Eskom. The reasons for the delay in filing include the inability to complete the South African portion of the Company's annual audit in normal time frames as a result of ongoing delays relating to the power load-shedding implemented by Eskom  and the Canadian auditors' inability to complete their audit due to reliance on the finalization of audit work in South Africa.The Company is working with its auditors on the remaining items to allow for the audit of the financial statements for the year ended March 31  2022 to be completed. The Company anticipates that it will be in a position to file its Financial Disclosure before August 31  2022. The Company confirms that it will comply with the alternative information guidelines included in National Policy 12-203 - Management Cease Trade Orders  for so long as it remains in default of a specified requirement.The Company has filed an application with the British Columbia Securities Commission and the Alberta Securities Commission requesting that they issue a management cease trade order against the Company's Directors  Officers and Insiders instead of a cease trade order against the Company and all of its securityholders.Story continuesAs has been widely reported  South Africa's state-owned power supplier Eskom was forced to implement significant load-shedding measures over a period of several weeks. The load-shedding measures were varied depending on power reduction requirements  but resulted in power blackouts several times per day over a period of weeks. The frequency of these power blackouts limited the ability of the majority of businesses in South Africa to operate as normal  and resulted in various operational and administrative delays for the Company.About Diamcor Mining Inc.Diamcor Mining Inc. is a fully reporting publicly traded junior diamond mining company which is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol V.DMI  and on the OTC QB International under the symbol DMIFF. The Company has a well-established operational and production history in South Africa and extensive prior experience supplying rough diamonds to the world market.About the Tiffany & Co. AllianceThe Company has established a long-term strategic alliance and first right of refusal with Tiffany & Co. Canada  a subsidiary of world famous New York based Tiffany & Co.  to purchase up to 100% of the future production of rough diamonds from the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project at then current prices to be determined by the parties on an ongoing basis. In conjunction with this first right of refusal  Tiffany & Co. Canada also provided the Company with financing to advance the Project. Tiffany & Co. is owned by Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH)  a publicly traded company which is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange (Euronext) under the symbol LVMH and on the OTC under the symbol LVMHF. For additional information on Tiffany & Co.  please visit their website at www.tiffany.com.About Krone-Endora at VenetiaIn February 2011  Diamcor acquired the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project from De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited  consisting of the prospecting rights over the farms Krone 104 and Endora 66  which represent a combined surface area of approximately 5 888 hectares directly adjacent to De Beers' flagship Venetia Diamond Mine in South Africa. On September 11  2014  the Company announced that the South African Department of Mineral Resources had granted a Mining Right for the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project encompassing 657.71 hectares of the Project's total area of 5 888 hectares. The Company has also submitted an application for a mining right over the remaining areas of the Project. The deposits which occur on the properties of Krone and Endora have been identified as a higher-grade ""Alluvial"" basal deposit which is covered by a lower-grade upper ""Eluvial"" deposit. The deposits are proposed to be the result of the direct-shift (in respect to the ""Eluvial"" deposit) and erosion (in respect to the ""Alluvial"" deposit) of material from the higher grounds of the adjacent Venetia Kimberlite areas. The deposits on Krone-Endora occur in two layers with a maximum total depth of approximately 15.0 metres from surface to bedrock  allowing for a very low-cost mining operation to be employed with the potential for near-term diamond production from a known high-quality source. Krone-Endora also benefits from the significant development of infrastructure and services already in place due to its location directly adjacent to the Venetia Mine.Qualified Person Statement:Mr. James P.

8447,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/ferrari-owner-exor-milan-amsterdam-bourse-1235265941/,Agnelli Family’s Exor Holding to List on Amsterdam Stock Exchange,The owner of Ferrari said it plans to delist from the Milan Bourse and transfer its ordinary shares to Amsterdam.,MILAN – The Agnelli family’s holding Exor is switching its public listing from the Milan Bourse to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.The company  which is currently listed on Euronext in Milan  plans to move to Amsterdam to align with it legal structure.Exor controls a wide range of firms ranging from carmaker Ferrari to fashion brand Shang Xia  which belongs to Hermès International. It also owns The Economist and Gedi Gruppo Editoriale  parent of the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.It has been a Dutch registered entity since 2016  although it maintains operations in Italy  including the Ferrari brand’s fashion division.The Amsterdam listing is currently waiting to be approved by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets. It should come into effect in mid-August when Exor’s ordinary shares will be transferred.In the interim period leading to the delisting from Milan  shares will be listed on both exchanges.Exor has grown into a giant holding company  reporting revenues of 136 billion euros in 2021 and posting a profit of 1.7 billion euros. Its net asset value stood at 31 billion euros as of Dec. 31  2021.On Friday the holding company also said it plans to continue its buyback program announced in March. A second instalment of up to 250 million euros will take place on Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Milan.Last year  the Exor-owned Fiat Chrysler Automobiles group and the French automotive group PSA completed their merger  combining into a company called Stellantis.Stellantis comprises brands ranging from Fiat and Alfa Romeo to Chrysler  Jeep  Peugeot  Citroen and Maserati. The merger was masterminded by chairman and chief executive officer John Elkann  who has been leading the family holding company for 16 years.Lately  the company has been investing more in luxury.
