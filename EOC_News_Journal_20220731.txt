8445,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4526076-klepierre-presents-strong-dividend-yield,Klepierre: Trading At 8.5 Times 2023 Earnings And A 8.7% Dividend Yield (KLPEF),Klepierre is one of the largest commercial REITs in Europe  with an asset base of in excess of 20B EUR. Read why Klepierre is a buy at these levels.,"Kwangmoozaa/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionJust when we thought the COVID crisis was over and REITs would benefit from 'the new normal "" the European political landscape changed completely when Russia invaded Ukraine. And although commercial REITs in Western Europe are not directly impacted (other than higher heating costs in the malls)  the consumer confidence levels and spiking inflation may reduce the footfall and that's why most REIT share prices have evolved sideways lately. Klepierre (OTCPK:KLPEF) owns in excess of 20B EUR of commercial real estate in Western Europe (with France (40%)  Italy (20%) and Scandinavia (13%) as main contributors to the net rental income) has seen its share price decrease by almost 20% since my previous article was published. And while it's OK to be conservative  I think Klepierre is now too cheap to ignore.Yahoo FinanceKlepierre has its primary listing on Euronext Paris where it's trading with LI as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume remained pretty stable at approximately 1 million shares per day  so the Paris listing clearly offers superior liquidity compared to the secondary listings. I will use the EUR as the base currency throughout this article.All relevant data and publications can be found here.A strong set of results in the first half of the year bodes well for the second semesterIt's always interesting to see the half-year results of Western European REITs as the quarterly updates are generally just trading updates. And Klepierre most definitely did not disappoint in the first semester of the current financial year.In the first half of the year  Klepierre's gross rental income increased by almost 30% while the rental expenses decreased by 39%. This is obviously entirely related to the tenants going back to paying the rent in full rather than Klepierre providing rent support (which both weighed on the revenue as well as on the expenses depending on whether a tenant was provided with definitive relief or reduced/suspended payments). The EBITDA of the REIT exploded by almost 64% to 467M EUR.Klepierre Investor RelationsWhat really matters here are the ""current cash flows "" sometimes also called the ""direct result per share."" This could be compared with the FFO used in North America. The net current cash flow in the first half of the year came in at 372M EUR (428M EUR on a consolidated basis  but there are minority interests that need to be taken into account as well). The EPRA earnings were pretty close to this result as those came in at 369.4M EUR or 1.30 EUR per share. A 2 cent per share straight-line amortization benefit further boosted this to 1.32 EUR per share on an adjusted basis. That's almost double the result from in the first half of last year.Keep in mind  there are a few non-recurring items that provided a nice boost to this per-share result. Included in the 1.32 EUR per share is a non-recurring benefit of 0.12 EUR per share caused by the reversal of provisions for COVID-related losses. So on an underlying basis  the direct result per share was approximately 1.20 EUR.Klepierre Investor RelationsThe full-year guidance was hiked  the LTV ratio was reduced  and I expect a dividend hikeThe strong result in the first half of the year allowed Klepierre to hike its full-year result to 2.45 EUR per share. This still includes the 0.12 EUR in non-recurring COVID-related provision reversals in the first half of the year  and I think this means Klepierre is still underpromising and will likely overdeliver. Excluding these reversals  the H1 direct result was approximately 1.20 EUR per share. So on an annualized basis this would already represent a full-year result of 2.40 EUR and adding that 0.12 EUR per share would result in a direct result per share of 2.52 EUR per share. Sure  the REIT sold some assets after the end of the first semester  but I am also anticipating some inflation-related rent hikes  so I think Klepierre's new guidance is still a bit conservative.The guidance hike comes about six months after I already thought the REIT's official guidance was too low. In my February article  I wrote:[‚Ä¶] while the FY 2022 guidance of 2.30-2.35 EUR per share is slightly lower than my expectations of 2.40-2.50 EUR per share.With the full-year guidance updated to 2.45 EUR per share  Klepierre's official guidance is now right in the middle of the range I was anticipating a while ago. This also means I'm now more confident in indeed seeing a dividend hike. While Klepierre hasn't provided an update on the expectations for the full-year dividend  I expect an increase from the 1.70 EUR per share that was paid out based on the FY 2021 result. The 1.70 EUR represented a payout ratio of 78% of the 2.18 EUR in direct result per share and applying an 80% payout ratio on the 2.45 EUR DRPS would result in a dividend of 1.96 EUR per share. Perhaps Klepierre will want to deduct the 0.12 EUR in non-recurring income from the starting point in which case the full-year dividend would come in at 1.86 EUR per share. Pretty close to my estimate of 1.85 EUR per share I posted in February  so for now I'm sticking with a dividend anticipation of 1.85 EUR per share.Subsequent to the end of the first semester  Klepierre sold a few more assets  and this reduced the pro forma LTV ratio to just 38.8%. That's the lowest it has been since year-end 2021  but keep in mind the REIT paid a 1.70 EUR cash dividend in the first half of this year which had a negative impact of about 220bp on the LTV ratio. Excluding this dividend  the LTV ratio would have come in at 36.6% and comfortably below the year-end 2021 ratio. As Klepierre pays an annual dividend  the in excess of 300M EUR in direct result expected to be generated in the current semester will likely push the LTV ratio to just above 37% (excluding changes in the valuation of the assets).Klepierre Investor RelationsInvestment thesisThis means Klepierre is now attractive again on pretty much every metric. The stock is trading at just 8.5 times the annualized H2 direct result per share while the dividend yield increases to 8.7% if my assumption of a dividend of 1.85 EUR per share turns out to be correct. Keeping the occupancy at a high level will now be Klepierre's main focus as that's what will ultimately drive the per-share results.As of the end of June  Klepierre's NTA came in at 30.60 EUR per share while the Net Disposal Value (including the deduction of capital gains taxes) was 29.2 EUR per share. The combination of a low earnings multiple  healthy dividend and decent discount to the tangible value and disposable value makes Klepierre very interesting at the current levels.",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.31,0.16,0.53,True,English,"['8.5 Times 2023 Earnings', '8.7% Dividend Yield', 'Klepierre', 'KLPEF', 'net current cash flow', 'share straight-line amortization benefit', 'recurring COVID-related provision reversals', 'most REIT share prices', 'current cash flows', 'European political landscape', 'higher heating costs', 'consumer confidence levels', 'average daily volume', 'The EPRA earnings', 'net rental income', 'commercial real estate', 'gross rental income', 'inflation-related rent hikes', 'current financial year', 'Western European REITs', 'Klepierre Investor Relations', 'H1 direct result', 'recurring benefit', 'recurring income', 'COVID-related losses', 'commercial REITs', 'recurring items', 'rental expenses', 'Getty Images', 'COVID crisis', 'new normal', 'main contributors', 'Yahoo Finance', 'primary listing', 'Euronext Paris', 'ticker symbol', '1 million shares', 'Paris listing', 'superior liquidity', 'secondary listings', 'base currency', 'relevant data', 'strong set', 'first half', 'second semester', 'quarterly updates', 'trading updates', 'first semester', 'rent support', 'definitive relief', 'suspended payments', 'North America', 'consolidated basis', 'minority interests', 'A 2 cent', 'adjusted basis', 'nice boost', 'underlying basis', 'full-year guidance', 'LTV ratio', 'annualized basis', 'new guidance', 'guidance hike', 'official guidance', 'FY 2022 guidance', 'payout ratio', 'starting point', 'strong result', 'full-year result', 'FY 2021 result', 'dividend hike', 'full-year dividend', 'previous article', 'February article', 'half-year results', 'last year', 'share result', '20B EUR', '2.45 EUR DRPS', '1.32 EUR', '0.12 EUR', '1.70 EUR', '2.18 EUR', '1.86 EUR', 'Kwangmoozaa', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'malls', 'footfall', 'OTCPK', 'KLPEF', 'excess', 'France', 'Italy', 'Scandinavia', 'day', 'publications', 'tenants', 'revenue', 'reduced', 'EBITDA', '467M', 'FFO', '372M', 'account', '369.4M', 'mind', 'non', 'provisions', 'assets', 'expectations', 'middle', 'range', 'increase', 'case', 'estimate', '1.20', '1.96']",2022-07-30,2022-07-31,seekingalpha.com
8447,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/ferrari-owner-exor-milan-amsterdam-bourse-1235265941/,Agnelli Family‚Äôs Exor Holding to List on Amsterdam Stock¬†Exchange,The owner of Ferrari said it plans to delist from the Milan Bourse and transfer its ordinary shares to Amsterdam.,MILAN ‚Äî The Agnelli family‚Äôs holding Exor is switching its public listing from the Milan Bourse to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.The company  which is currently listed on Euronext in Milan  plans to move to Amsterdam to align with it legal structure.Exor controls a wide range of firms ranging from carmaker Ferrari to fashion brand Shang Xia  which belongs to Herm√®s International. It also owns The Economist and Gedi Gruppo Editoriale  parent of the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.It has been a Dutch-registered entity since 2016  although it maintains operations in Italy  including the Ferrari brand‚Äôs fashion division.The Amsterdam listing is waiting to be approved by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets. It should come into effect in mid-August when Exor‚Äôs ordinary shares will be transferred.In the interim period leading to the delisting from Milan  shares will be listed on both exchanges.Exor has grown into a giant holding company  reporting revenues of 136 billion euros in 2021 and posting a profit of 1.7 billion euros. Its net asset value stood at 31 billion euros as of Dec. 31  2021.On Friday the holding company also said it plans to continue its buyback program announced in March. A second instalment of up to 250 million euros will take place on Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Milan.Last year  the Exor-owned Fiat Chrysler Automobiles group and the French automotive group PSA completed their merger  combining into a company called Stellantis.Stellantis comprises brands ranging from Fiat and Alfa Romeo to Chrysler  Jeep  Peugeot  Citroen and Maserati. The merger was masterminded by chairman and chief executive officer John Elkann  who has been leading the family holding company for 16 years.Lately  the company has been investing more in luxury. In 2020 it channeled around 80 million euros into Shang Xia  while last year it acquired a 24 percent interest in the Christian Louboutin brand.It also set up a partnership with The World-Wide Investment Company Ltd.  which belongs to the Hong Kong Pao family. They set up a new company called Nuo SpA to invest in consumer goods excellence by supporting the global development of medium-sized Italian companies.Although rumors have been swirling around Exor‚Äôs  or Ferrari‚Äôs  possible interest in the Giorgio Armani group  both parties waved away the speculation.Last year an Exor spokesman told WWD that the holding ‚Äúinvests in single companies  not in sectors  and in exceptional businesses and founders with shared values  and where it can add value and build great companies. It is the quality of the company  its team and culture and its attractive prospects that are the key drivers of the decision to invest.‚Äù,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.6,0.1,0.3,True,English,"['Amsterdam Stock\xa0Exchange', 'Agnelli Family', 'Exor Holding', 'The World-Wide Investment Company Ltd', 'Exor-owned Fiat Chrysler Automobiles group', 'Hong Kong Pao family', 'French automotive group', 'Giorgio Armani group', 'The Agnelli family', 'Herm√®s International', 'Gedi Gruppo Editoriale', 'chief executive officer', 'consumer goods excellence', 'Christian Louboutin brand', 'Amsterdam Stock Exchange', 'The Amsterdam listing', 'net asset value', 'medium-sized Italian companies', 'brand Shang Xia', 'family holding company', 'giant holding company', 'The Economist', 'public listing', 'Italian newspaper', 'single companies', 'great companies', 'new company', 'legal structure', 'wide range', 'La Repubblica', 'Dutch-registered entity', 'Ferrari brand', 'Dutch Authority', 'Financial Markets', 'interim period', '1.7 billion euros', '31 billion euros', 'buyback program', 'second instalment', '250 million euros', 'Alfa Romeo', 'John Elkann', '80 million euros', '24 percent interest', 'global development', 'possible interest', 'exceptional businesses', 'attractive prospects', 'key drivers', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'holding Exor', 'fashion division', 'ordinary shares', 'Milan Bourse', 'Exor spokesman', 'Euronext Milan', 'firms', 'carmaker', 'parent', 'operations', 'Italy', 'effect', 'mid-August', 'delisting', 'exchanges', 'revenues', 'profit', 'Dec.', 'Friday', 'March', 'place', 'PSA', 'merger', 'Stellantis', 'brands', 'Jeep', 'Peugeot', 'Citroen', 'Maserati', 'chairman', '16 years', 'luxury', 'partnership', 'rumors', 'parties', 'speculation', 'WWD', 'sectors', 'founders', 'values', 'quality', 'team', 'culture', 'decision']",2022-07-30,2022-07-31,wwd.com

Amongst other things  we'll want to see two things; firstly  a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly  an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine  able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although  when we looked at ClearStream Energy Services (TSE:CSM)  it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure  ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for ClearStream Energy Services:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) √∑ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.016 = CA$2.7m √∑ (CA$252m - CA$81m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So  ClearStream Energy Services has an ROCE of 1.6%. In absolute terms  that's a low return and it also under-performs the Energy Services industry average of 5.8%.See our latest analysis for ClearStream Energy ServicesroceHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for ClearStream Energy Services' ROCE against it's prior returns.

To be more specific  ROCE has fallen from 3.9% over the last five years. However  given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth  at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns  the business  and thus shareholders  will benefit in the long run.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term  we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for ClearStream Energy Services. However  despite the promising trends  the stock has fallen 67% over the last five years  so there might be an opportunity here for astute investors. So we think it'd be worthwhile to look further into this stock given the trends look encouraging.One more thing: We've identified 4 warning signs with ClearStream Energy Services (at least 3 which don't sit too well with us)   and understanding them would certainly be useful.While ClearStream Energy Services isn't earning the highest return  check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

8472,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4526079-vib-vermoegen-future-dividend-challenges,VIB Vermoegen Stock: Cancellation Of Dividend (OTCMKTS:VIBBF),VIB Vermoegen's cancellation of the dividend and uncertainty on potential capital gains make the stock an avoid. See why VIB Vermoegen stock is a Sell.,"1933bkk/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionThe volatility on the markets and the increasing interest rates create opportunities in the real estate sector. VIB Vermoegen (OTC:VIBBF) (OTCPK:VIBVY) is a developer and landlord in the industrial and logistic real estate segment and that was a well-sought after category. DIC Asset  a German competitor  recently acquired a majority stake in VIB after making a very aggressive offer. DIC ended up paying 51 EUR per share of VIB and not only is that almost twice the current share price  it also represented a premium of 57% to the Net Replacement Value of the assets as of the end of Q1. And now DIC calls the shots  I‚Äôm not sure we will see a (decent) dividend from VIB Vermoegen going forward as DIC could just decide to retain the legal maximum of VIB‚Äôs cash generation on the balance sheet. And after carefully reading the bidder‚Äôs statement  it has become clear DIC has no intention to declare dividends with the VIB vehicle.Yahoo FinanceVIB‚Äôs main listing is on the Deutsche Boerse where it's trading with VIH1 as ticker symbol. The average daily volume is just a few ten thousand shares per day as the free float has greatly diminished since DIC acquired a 60% stake in VIB.I‚Äôm not a buyer of VIB Vermoegen as the company‚Äôs policy is now directed by DIC AssetFrom a multiples and metrics point of view  VIB appears to be a ""must buy."" Yet I have no interest in buying the stock since there's a new sheriff in town. Earlier this year  German peer DIC Asset AG (OTCPK:DDCCF) acquired a majority stake in VIB which means DIC now calls the shots. Author Bjorn Zonneveld has done a good job in explaining what happened with DIV and VIB and I would strongly recommend you to read his March article.DIC now controls in excess of 60% of the shares of VIB Vermoegen and although DIC initially supported VIB‚Äôs dividend proposal (for the FY 2021 results  payable in calendar year 2022)  there's no guarantee DIC will allow VIB to continue to pay a dividend. As DIC can consolidate VIB‚Äôs financial results  there's no need for any cash to be upstreamed to DIC as that would have no impact on the consolidated results. And I‚Äôm not painting an ultra-bleak picture here. The image below shows an excerpt from the joint statement of VIB and DIC Asset. It literally states the buyer is pursuing a total return strategy which is corporate speak for ""it will very likely cut the dividend to the legal minimum"" (which could be zero).VIB Vermoegen Investor RelationsAnd if that wasn‚Äôt clear enough  this can be found two pages further (the highlight is mine). ""Endeavoring to ensure"" sounds pretty clear to me.VIB Vermoegen Investor RelationsSo the question no longer is whether or not DIC will allow VIB‚Äôs history of increasing dividends to continue. That ship has sailed and VIB investors can only hope for a few cents per year if there is a regulatory need to pay a dividend.VIB Vermoegen Investor RelationsThe total return policy may not be bad as VIB has an excellent track recordDespite losing the dividend  shareholders may still be interested in VIB‚Äôs new total return focus. The past few years  the FFO per share and the NAV per share have consistently increased and even in 2020 and 2021 the company was able to post an attractive earnings increase with an FFO of 2.11 EUR per share in FY 2021.VIB Vermoegen Investor RelationsAnd the near-term future looked bright as well. According to VIB‚Äôs 2022 guidance  it anticipated posting an FFO of 58-62M EUR. Using 61M EUR (on the higher end of the guidance range)  the FFO/share would come in at 2.20 EUR per share. Meanwhile  the LTV ratio would have remained stable in the mid-40s range.The acquisition of a majority stake by DIC does not mean an investment in VIB is dead money. It simply means the vast majority  if not every single cent  of the 2.20 EUR FFO/share will be reinvested in the company. This will likely help the FFO per share increase even faster as there will be more cash retained within the company to further expand the portfolio. But the lack of a (decent) dividend would for sure be a tough sell for investors as you're basically ""betting"" on the market rewarding VIB for a faster growth pace while knowing someone else is calling the shots. There simply is no catalyst that could propel the VIB share price higher unless you're expecting DIC to make another offer to acquire more shares beyond its current position of approximately 60% of the VIB stock.Investment thesisFrom a fundamental perspective  I like VIB‚Äôs valuation down here as the robust balance sheet and relatively low multiple to the anticipated FFO make the stock attractive. However  the past few years we have seen this push in Germany where third parties acquire a majority ownership in companies and subsequently cut the dividends to retain the cash for balance sheet and growth purposes. And as DIC Asset management has increased the LTV ratio on its own balance sheet I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if DIC doesn‚Äôt want to pay the minority shareholders of VIB a dividend  retaining the VIB-generated cash on the balance sheet to reduce the LTV ratio.That obviously also increases the value of both VIB and DIC but it‚Äôs less tangible than actually getting a dividend cheque every year. And as the bidding circular literally mentions the possibility the dividend will be cut as DIC is pursuing a total return strategy and has no intention to declare dividends with the VIB vehicle unless it's bound to do so by law.",neutral,0.01,0.91,0.08,mixed,0.24,0.18,0.58,True,English,"['VIB Vermoegen Stock', 'Cancellation', 'Dividend', 'OTCMKTS', 'VIBBF', 'logistic real estate segment', 'new total return focus', 'VIB Vermoegen Investor Relations', 'real estate sector', 'total return strategy', 'Net Replacement Value', 'average daily volume', 'Author Bjorn Zonneveld', 'excellent track record', 'attractive earnings increase', 'total return policy', 'faster growth pace', 'increasing interest rates', 'ten thousand shares', 'robust balance sheet', 'current share price', 'DIC Asset AG', 'DIC Asset management', 'VIB share price', 'new sheriff', 'current position', 'growth purposes', 'Getty Images', 'OTC:VIBBF', 'OTCPK:VIBVY', 'German competitor', 'legal maximum', 'Yahoo Finance', 'main listing', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'ticker symbol', 'free float', 'metrics point', 'German peer', 'OTCPK:DDCCF', 'good job', 'March article', 'financial results', 'consolidated results', 'ultra-bleak picture', 'legal minimum', 'near-term future', 'LTV ratio', 'mid-40s range', 'dead money', 'vast majority', 'single cent', 'tough sell', 'fundamental perspective', 'third parties', 'majority ownership', 'majority stake', 'VIB vehicle', 'rewarding VIB', 'aggressive offer', 'FY 2021 results', 'calendar year', 'joint statement', 'regulatory need', 'higher end', 'guidance range', 'Investment thesis', 'minority shareholders', 'cash generation', 'VIB-generated cash', 'decent) dividend', 'dividend proposal', 'VIB investors', 'VIB stock', '2.20 EUR FFO/share', '60% stake', 'VIB.', '2022 guidance', '51 EUR', '2.11 EUR', '1933bkk', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'volatility', 'markets', 'opportunities', 'developer', 'landlord', 'industrial', 'category', 'premium', 'assets', 'Q1.', 'shots', 'bidder', 'intention', 'dividends', 'VIH1', 'day', 'buyer', 'company', 'multiples', 'view', 'town', 'excess', 'guarantee', 'impact', 'excerpt', 'highlight', 'question', 'history', 'cents', 'past', 'years', 'NAV', '58-62M', '61M', 'acquisition', 'portfolio', 'lack', 'someone', 'catalyst', 'valuation', 'push', 'Germany', 'companies']",2022-07-31,2022-07-31,seekingalpha.com
