Amongst other things  we'll want to see two things; firstly  a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly  an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine  able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although  when we looked at ClearStream Energy Services (TSE:CSM)  it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure  ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for ClearStream Energy Services:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) √∑ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.016 = CA$2.7m √∑ (CA$252m - CA$81m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So  ClearStream Energy Services has an ROCE of 1.6%. In absolute terms  that's a low return and it also under-performs the Energy Services industry average of 5.8%.See our latest analysis for ClearStream Energy ServicesroceHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for ClearStream Energy Services' ROCE against it's prior returns. If you want to delve into the historical earnings  revenue and cash flow of ClearStream Energy Services  check out these free graphs here.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface  the trend of ROCE at ClearStream Energy Services doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific  ROCE has fallen from 3.9% over the last five years. However  given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth  at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns  the business  and thus shareholders  will benefit in the long run.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term  we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for ClearStream Energy Services. However  despite the promising trends  the stock has fallen 67% over the last five years  so there might be an opportunity here for astute investors. So we think it'd be worthwhile to look further into this stock given the trends look encouraging.One more thing: We've identified 4 warning signs with ClearStream Energy Services (at least 3 which don't sit too well with us)   and understanding them would certainly be useful.While ClearStream Energy Services isn't earning the highest return  check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Global law firm Hogan Lovells  legal advisers to Ecuador on U.S. law  declined to comment.A spokesperson at the London office for Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP‚Äòs  legal advisers to the dealer manager on Ecuador‚Äôs eurobonds  did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Perenco now has eight days to start court proceedings to validate the attachments  and Ecuador has 50 days to instruct a law firm to represent them in Luxembourg  said Fabio Trevisan  partner and head of BSP‚Äòs Dispute Resolution practice  the law firm representing Perenco.A document seen by Reuters shows a Luxembourg bailiff  Pierre Biel & Geoffrey Galle  on July 28 ordered 122 banking entities operating in Luxembourg to freeze assets in accounts used by Ecuador on behalf of Perenco.A spokesperson for European settlement house Clearstream confirmed that Clearstream Banking SA in Luxembourg had received the bailiff note  though declined to give further details.An employee at the bailiff declined to comment when contacted by Reuters because they are not authorized to speak to parties not involved in the case.Reuters could not immediately establish what assets Ecuador held in Luxembourg accounts. The banks named included Deutsche Bank  Credit Suisse and HSBC.Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment  while HSBC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.LUXEMBOURGBONDSThe Latin American country two years ago defaulted on $17.4 billion of foreign debt as the nation buckled under one of the region‚Äôs worst coronavirus outbreaks following years of economic stagnation.As part of the debt restructuring that followed  Ecuador sold new bonds maturing in 2030  2035 and 2040 which are listed on the Luxembourg stock exchange.Many of these bonds had interest payments falling due on July 31. Some holders of the bonds have received interest payments which had been due on the securities on July 31  sources familiar with the matter said.Holders of Ecuador‚Äôs international bonds include major asset managers such as BlackRock  PIMCO and JPMorgan  according to data available on EMAXX  which provides details of funds‚Äô holdings based on their public disclosures. PIMCO declined to comment  while BlackRock and JPMorgan were not immediately available for comment.The case that led to the ICSID award stemmed from a 2007 decree issued by then-President Rafael Correa that boosted the Ecuadorean state‚Äôs take from sales of oil produced by private companies exceeding a certain level.Perenco sued Ecuador in 2008 and was ultimately awarded $412 million in May last year. Perenco is entitled to $391 million after taking into account compensation it was ordered to pay Ecuador for environmental damage caused in the areas where it operated in Blocks 7 and 21.President Guillermo Lasso  a conservative former banker who took office in May 2021  has promised to revive Ecuador‚Äôs economy and attract investment ‚Äì especially in oil and mining.‚ÄúPerenco remains hopeful that Ecuador‚Äôs Government will finally honour its international obligations  demonstrate its commitment to the rule of law  and uphold its promises to foreign investors  by promptly satisfying the Award without further delay ‚Äù the company said in its statement.,negative,0.03,0.42,0.55,mixed,0.04,0.21,0.74,True,English,"['Exclusive-Luxembourg banks', 'Ecuador assets', 'Perenco dispute', 'documents', 'Cleary Gottlieb Steen', 'European settlement house', 'Latin American country', 'worst coronavirus outbreaks', 'major asset managers', 'President Rafael Correa', 'President Guillermo Lasso', 'conservative former banker', 'U.S. law', '$391 million settlement award', 'Dispute Resolution practice', 'Luxembourg stock exchange', 'Global law firm', 'Clearstream Banking SA', 'Anglo-French oil company', '122 banking entities', 'Rowena Edwards', 'Karin Strohecker', 'World Bank', 'International Centre', 'production-sharing agreement', 'solicitor general', 'tight finances', 'payment plan', 'single dollar', 'payments rights', 'other jurisdictions', 'Hogan Lovells', 'legal advisers', 'Hamilton LLP', 'dealer manager', 'court proceedings', 'Fabio Trevisan', 'Pierre Biel', 'Geoffrey Galle', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Credit Suisse', 'economic stagnation', 'interest payments', 'public disclosures', 'Ecuadorean state', 'private companies', 'environmental damage', 'international obligations', 'foreign investors', 'bailiff note', 'foreign debt', 'debt restructuring', 'Investment Disputes', 'energy ministry', 'eight days', 'new bonds', 'international bonds', 'ICSID award', 'Luxembourg bailiff', 'Luxembourg accounts', 'Reuters show', 'London office', '50 days', 'banks', 'assets', 'result', 'Perenco', 'document', 'government', 'June', 'date', 'statement', 'Monday', 'steps', 'economy', 'spokesperson', 'eurobonds', 'request', 'comment', 'attachments', 'partner', 'head', 'BSP', 'July', 'behalf', 'details', 'employee', 'parties', 'case', 'HSBC', 'LUXEMBOURGBONDS', 'region', 'years', 'holders', 'securities', 'sources', 'matter', 'BlackRock', 'PIMCO', 'JPMorgan', 'data', 'EMAXX', 'holdings', '2007 decree', 'take', 'sales', 'level', 'May', 'compensation', 'areas', 'Blocks', 'mining', 'commitment', 'rule', 'promises', 'delay']",2022-08-01,2022-08-01,euronews.com

8506,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4526079-vib-vermoegen-future-dividend-challenges,VIB Vermoegen Stock: Cancellation Of Dividend (OTCMKTS:VIBBF),VIB Vermoegen's cancellation of the dividend and uncertainty on potential capital gains make the stock an avoid. See why VIB Vermoegen stock is a Sell.,"1933bkk/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionThe volatility on the markets and the increasing interest rates create opportunities in the real estate sector. VIB Vermoegen (OTC:VIBBF) (OTCPK:VIBVY) is a developer and landlord in the industrial and logistic real estate segment and that was a well-sought after category. DIC Asset  a German competitor  recently acquired a majority stake in VIB after making a very aggressive offer. DIC ended up paying 51 EUR per share of VIB and not only is that almost twice the current share price  it also represented a premium of 57% to the Net Replacement Value of the assets as of the end of Q1. And now DIC calls the shots  I‚Äôm not sure we will see a (decent) dividend from VIB Vermoegen going forward as DIC could just decide to retain the legal maximum of VIB‚Äôs cash generation on the balance sheet. And after carefully reading the bidder‚Äôs statement  it has become clear DIC has no intention to declare dividends with the VIB vehicle.Yahoo FinanceVIB‚Äôs main listing is on the Deutsche Boerse where it's trading with VIH1 as ticker symbol. The average daily volume is just a few ten thousand shares per day as the free float has greatly diminished since DIC acquired a 60% stake in VIB.I‚Äôm not a buyer of VIB Vermoegen as the company‚Äôs policy is now directed by DIC AssetFrom a multiples and metrics point of view  VIB appears to be a ""must buy."" Yet I have no interest in buying the stock since there's a new sheriff in town. Earlier this year  German peer DIC Asset AG (OTCPK:DDCCF) acquired a majority stake in VIB which means DIC now calls the shots. Author Bjorn Zonneveld has done a good job in explaining what happened with DIV and VIB and I would strongly recommend you to read his March article.DIC now controls in excess of 60% of the shares of VIB Vermoegen and although DIC initially supported VIB‚Äôs dividend proposal (for the FY 2021 results  payable in calendar year 2022)  there's no guarantee DIC will allow VIB to continue to pay a dividend. As DIC can consolidate VIB‚Äôs financial results  there's no need for any cash to be upstreamed to DIC as that would have no impact on the consolidated results. And I‚Äôm not painting an ultra-bleak picture here. The image below shows an excerpt from the joint statement of VIB and DIC Asset. It literally states the buyer is pursuing a total return strategy which is corporate speak for ""it will very likely cut the dividend to the legal minimum"" (which could be zero).VIB Vermoegen Investor RelationsAnd if that wasn‚Äôt clear enough  this can be found two pages further (the highlight is mine). ""Endeavoring to ensure"" sounds pretty clear to me.VIB Vermoegen Investor RelationsSo the question no longer is whether or not DIC will allow VIB‚Äôs history of increasing dividends to continue. That ship has sailed and VIB investors can only hope for a few cents per year if there is a regulatory need to pay a dividend.VIB Vermoegen Investor RelationsThe total return policy may not be bad as VIB has an excellent track recordDespite losing the dividend  shareholders may still be interested in VIB‚Äôs new total return focus. The past few years  the FFO per share and the NAV per share have consistently increased and even in 2020 and 2021 the company was able to post an attractive earnings increase with an FFO of 2.11 EUR per share in FY 2021.VIB Vermoegen Investor RelationsAnd the near-term future looked bright as well. According to VIB‚Äôs 2022 guidance  it anticipated posting an FFO of 58-62M EUR. Using 61M EUR (on the higher end of the guidance range)  the FFO/share would come in at 2.20 EUR per share. Meanwhile  the LTV ratio would have remained stable in the mid-40s range.The acquisition of a majority stake by DIC does not mean an investment in VIB is dead money. It simply means the vast majority  if not every single cent  of the 2.20 EUR FFO/share will be reinvested in the company. This will likely help the FFO per share increase even faster as there will be more cash retained within the company to further expand the portfolio. But the lack of a (decent) dividend would for sure be a tough sell for investors as you're basically ""betting"" on the market rewarding VIB for a faster growth pace while knowing someone else is calling the shots. There simply is no catalyst that could propel the VIB share price higher unless you're expecting DIC to make another offer to acquire more shares beyond its current position of approximately 60% of the VIB stock.Investment thesisFrom a fundamental perspective  I like VIB‚Äôs valuation down here as the robust balance sheet and relatively low multiple to the anticipated FFO make the stock attractive. However  the past few years we have seen this push in Germany where third parties acquire a majority ownership in companies and subsequently cut the dividends to retain the cash for balance sheet and growth purposes. And as DIC Asset management has increased the LTV ratio on its own balance sheet I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if DIC doesn‚Äôt want to pay the minority shareholders of VIB a dividend  retaining the VIB-generated cash on the balance sheet to reduce the LTV ratio.That obviously also increases the value of both VIB and DIC but it‚Äôs less tangible than actually getting a dividend cheque every year. And as the bidding circular literally mentions the possibility the dividend will be cut as DIC is pursuing a total return strategy and has no intention to declare dividends with the VIB vehicle unless it's bound to do so by law.",neutral,0.01,0.91,0.08,mixed,0.24,0.18,0.58,True,English,"['VIB Vermoegen Stock', 'Cancellation', 'Dividend', 'OTCMKTS', 'VIBBF', 'logistic real estate segment', 'new total return focus', 'VIB Vermoegen Investor Relations', 'real estate sector', 'total return strategy', 'Net Replacement Value', 'average daily volume', 'Author Bjorn Zonneveld', 'excellent track record', 'attractive earnings increase', 'total return policy', 'faster growth pace', 'increasing interest rates', 'ten thousand shares', 'robust balance sheet', 'current share price', 'DIC Asset AG', 'DIC Asset management', 'VIB share price', 'new sheriff', 'current position', 'growth purposes', 'Getty Images', 'OTC:VIBBF', 'OTCPK:VIBVY', 'German competitor', 'legal maximum', 'Yahoo Finance', 'main listing', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'ticker symbol', 'free float', 'metrics point', 'German peer', 'OTCPK:DDCCF', 'good job', 'March article', 'financial results', 'consolidated results', 'ultra-bleak picture', 'legal minimum', 'near-term future', 'LTV ratio', 'mid-40s range', 'dead money', 'vast majority', 'single cent', 'tough sell', 'fundamental perspective', 'third parties', 'majority ownership', 'majority stake', 'VIB vehicle', 'rewarding VIB', 'aggressive offer', 'FY 2021 results', 'calendar year', 'joint statement', 'regulatory need', 'higher end', 'guidance range', 'Investment thesis', 'minority shareholders', 'cash generation', 'VIB-generated cash', 'decent) dividend', 'dividend proposal', 'VIB investors', 'VIB stock', '2.20 EUR FFO/share', '60% stake', 'VIB.', '2022 guidance', '51 EUR', '2.11 EUR', '1933bkk', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'volatility', 'markets', 'opportunities', 'developer', 'landlord', 'industrial', 'category', 'premium', 'assets', 'Q1.', 'shots', 'bidder', 'intention', 'dividends', 'VIH1', 'day', 'buyer', 'company', 'multiples', 'view', 'town', 'excess', 'guarantee', 'impact', 'excerpt', 'highlight', 'question', 'history', 'cents', 'past', 'years', 'NAV', '58-62M', '61M', 'acquisition', 'portfolio', 'lack', 'someone', 'catalyst', 'valuation', 'push', 'Germany', 'companies']",2022-07-31,2022-08-01,seekingalpha.com

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee...","EMA accelerated assessment allows a shorter review period for leniolisib from a standard 210 days to 150 daysPharming is on track to submit its Marketing Authorisation Application for leniolisib in H2 2022LEIDEN  the Netherlands  Aug. 1  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib. Leniolisib has been studied for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents age 12 or older in the European Economic Area (EEA). Pharming is on track and plans to submit its MAA for leniolisib to the EMA in October 2022.Pharming Group logoAccelerated assessment reduces the timeframe for the CHMP to review an MAA from 210 days to 150 days. The EMA will grant  upon request  accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation.The clinical development for leniolisib includes positive data from a Phase II/III study of the product  which met both its co-primary endpoints in the target patient population of evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The primary efficacy results demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from baseline in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) in the index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.0012) and normalization of immune dysfunction  as evidenced by increased proportion of na√Øve B cells from baseline (p<0.0001). The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of na√Øve B cells are important in patients as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers.In the study  leniolisib was generally well-tolerated  with the majority of reported adverse events in both treatment groups classified as mild. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Story continuesAnurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The acceptance of an accelerated regulatory review for leniolisib underlines the high unmet need for patients with APDS  with the product potentially being the first approved treatment for this rare disease. This is an important milestone for the APDS community and for Pharming and is built on the successful Phase II/III data  which we first reported in February 2022. We remain focused on progressing leniolisib through the regulatory review process  with our MAA on track for submission in October of this year  as we seek to make this important new product available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients in Europe.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) is a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients with rare  debilitating  and life-threatening diseases.

We benefitted from the recovery in Asia Pacific and the on-trade in Europe as consumers returned to the bars  with demand resilient until now despite mounting inflationary pressures on consumers' disposable income.Our business performed well in the first half of 2022. We grew ahead of the industry in more than half of our markets and the Heineken¬Æ brand again showed strong momentum  boosted by stepped up brand support. Our actions on pricing  revenue management and productivity offset significant inflationary pressures in our cost base. As a result  operating profit is now firmly ahead of 2019.We continue to face an uncertain outlook for consumers and businesses alike. Remaining vigilant  we are fully committed to drive our EverGreen transformation for sustained  long-term value creation. In terms of outlook  we reiterate our 2022 goals. For 2023  we move from an operating margin objective towards delivering operating profit (beia) organic growth.

We aim to achieve this by sharp consumer and customer orientation  leveraging our leading premium brands  developing winning consumer propositions in fast-growing segments and continuously shaping our geographic and portfolio footprint.Revenue for the first half of 2022 was 16 401 million (2021: 11 970 million). Net revenue (beia) increased 24.3% organically  driven by a 7.7% increase in total consolidated volume and a 15.6% increase in net revenue (beia) per hectolitre. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 15.3%  driven by pricing across all markets  covering input cost inflation on a euro-for-euro basis  a positive channel mix and premiumisation. Compared to 2019  total consolidated volume increased organically by 0.8% and net revenue (beia) is 14.4% ahead  excluding consolidation changes  driven by post-COVID volume recovery  growth of our premium brands and the impact of inflation-led pricing.Beer volume increased 7.6% organically versus last year and came 4.2% ahead of 2019 on an organic basis. The growth was faster in the second quarter as beer volume grew 9.7%  led by strong growth in the Americas  the continued recovery of Asia Pacific and the on-trade in Europe and modest growth in the Africa  Middle East and Eastern Europe (AMEE) region. We gained or held market share in more than half of our markets.Beer volume 2Q22 2Q21 Organicgrowth HY22 HY21 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Heineken N.V. 70.4 59.6 9.7% 126.9 109.9 7.6% Africa Middle East & Eastern Europe 9.8 9.7 1.4% 19.6 19.1 3.5% Americas 23.1 20.9 10.7% 42.8 40.3 6.2% Asia Pacific 13.1 5.9 35.7% 24.6 13.6 17.0% Europe 24.4 23.1 5.7% 39.9 36.9 7.9%Driving premiumisation at scale  led by Heineken¬ÆPremium beer volume grew by 10.2%  driving close to half of our organic growth in beer volume  led by Heineken¬Æ.Heineken¬Æ continued its strong performance and grew volume by 14.6% in the second quarter to close the first half with a 13.8% increase  up 32.9% versus 2019. The brand grew double-digits in more than 50 markets  notably in Brazil  China  Vietnam  South Africa  the Netherlands  Spain  Italy  Laos and the United Arab Emirates. Heineken¬Æ Silver  now present in 22 markets  has nearly doubled its volume  driven by strong growth in Vietnam and China and its rollout across Europe and Asia. As the next step of its global roll-out  we introduced Heineken¬Æ Silver in Mexico this month.As per the Kantar BrandZ 2022 global survey  Heineken¬Æ was the fastest growing in 'Brand Value' among top alcohol brands  driven by its strong growth momentum  innovations and creativity. The latter was further recognised at this year's Cannes Lions  the prestigious Festival of Creativity  as the most awarded alcohol brand. The brand's most recent campaign  ""The Closer""  aims to spark conversation on work-life imbalance  with a smile. Heineken¬Æ supports inclusion in the bar and on the football field and is a proud sponsor of the UEFA Women's EURO football tournament.Heineken¬Æ volume 2Q22 Organicgrowth HY22 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Total 14.0 14.6% 25.9 13.8% Africa Middle East & Eastern Europe 1.4 0.6% 3.2 6.6% Americas 5.4 23.1% 10.3 17.4% Asia Pacific 2.1 28.1% 4.1 20.6% Europe 5.1 6.4% 8.3 9.4%Amstel volume grew in the high-twenties  bringing a taste of Amsterdam to the world. More than 20 markets grew double-digits  with especially strong results in Brazil  South Africa  Spain  the UK  the Netherlands  Mexico  Argentina  India and China. Amstel Ultra continued its expansion in the Americas to reach 12 markets. Birra Moretti continued to share the true taste of Italy across Europe and grew volume in the mid-twenties. All European markets contributed to the growth with particularly strong momentum in the UK  Ireland  the Netherlands  Romania and Switzerland. Sol grew volume by a low-single-digit  led by strong growth in Brazil  Chile and South Africa  partially offset by declines in Mexico and Europe. In the year of the Tiger  we are uncaging the growth of our brand in Vietnam and beyond. The brand volume grew in the mid-teens  driven by the recovery in the second quarter of Vietnam  Cambodia  and Malaysia  a continued strong performance in Nigeria and the launch in Brazil last year. Tiger Crystal is now introduced in 19 markets. Edelweiss grew volume in the sixties  bringing a taste of the Alps to Asia  reaching 7 markets and we have started a local production hub in Vietnam. Lagunitas volume grew by a low-single-digit as double-digit growth in Europe was partially offset by a decline in the USA. The non-alcoholic line extensions of Lagunitas  IPNA and Hoppy Refresher  continue their momentum and grew volume in the high-teens.Pioneer choice in low & no-alcohol (LONO)Our LONO portfolio grew volume by a low-single-digit  with double-digit growth in more than 20 markets  most noticeably Brazil  Mexico  Spain  Germany  Panama and Ethiopia  partially offset by declines in Poland  Russia and Egypt.The non-alcoholic beer and cider portfolio grew volume by a high-single-digit  led by Heineken¬Æ 0.0. Despite stopping sales in Russia  Heineken¬Æ 0.0 grew in the low-teens  with a particularly strong performance in Brazil and Spain.We are in the process of extending our industry-leading LONO portfolio to serve the needs of consumers looking for adult refreshment with lower or no-alcohol content and a great taste.Intentionally expand beyond beerWe see plenty of opportunities to expand our product portfolio beyond beer to better meet the needs of more consumers. Overall  our portfolio of flavoured alcoholic beverages (FABs)  including ciders and hard seltzers  grew volume by a high-single-digit to 6.4 million hectolitres and is ahead of 2019 in the low-teens.Desperados continued its momentum  particularly in its core European markets and more than doubling its volume in Nigeria. For consumers looking for a trendy alternative to beer at a similar alcohol level  we launched Desperados Alcoholic Sparkling Water with Tequila in the Netherlands in May.Cider was back to growth in the UK and Ireland and saw double-digit growth in South Africa  Vietnam  Spain and Portugal. For consumers who desire a more balanced lifestyle  we launched Strongbow Ultra Dark Fruit in the UK  a low-calorie cider that does not compromise great taste.We are learning from our experiments across markets and continue to introduce new propositions. We are increasingly leveraging our strongest brands for these propositions  next to new brands like Pure Pira√±a. For example  we launched Dos Equis Classic Lime Margarita and Disorderly Tea House in the USA.Building a future-fit digital route-to-consumerOur ambition is to be the best-connected brewer  so we have been stepping up our investments behind our digital transformation to build a future-ready HEINEKEN  especially strengthening our digital route-to-consumer:Our business-to-business (B2B) digital platforms continued to develop at pace. We captured ‚Ç¨2.8 billion in digital sales value in the first half of this year  close to 3x the same period last year and to the entire value captured in 2021  with close to 430 thousand active customers in fragmented  traditional channels. The digitisation of customer relationships enables us to provide better services  leverage data insights  and capture meaningful increases in efficiency. For example  in Italy we have realised the equivalent of an extra day of sales visits per sales representative  whilst in Ethiopia we have seen an over threefold increase in weekly outlet engagements to optimise assortment and product availability. The remarkable growth in digital sales value was balanced across both our direct and indirect distribution markets  notably Nigeria  Vietnam  Mexico  Brazil and Europe. Vietnam observed the fastest growth  more than 6x last year  covering now close to 55% of the fragmented trade.The net revenue of Beerwulf   our digital direct-to-consumer (eD2C) platform in Europe  was more than 50% ahead of pre-pandemic levels  despite the shift in consumption from in-home to the on-trade as it reopened. Our active consumer base for our home draught systems is close to 40% ahead of pre-pandemic levels  and the transaction data we collect provides valuable insights.Our eD2C platform in Mexico GLUP is growing fast with very positive feedback from users on its value proposition of delivering orders in less than 60 minutes and its use of brand assets. The platform was launched in Monterrey last year  and we are expanding into other large cities in the country.Strengthen and optimise our footprintWe continuously review how we can further strengthen our portfolio and geographical footprint and enhance our long-term  sustained growth advantage.At the end of 2021  HEINEKEN announced its proposed transaction with Distell Group Holdings Limited (‚ÄòDistell‚Äô) and Namibia Breweries Limited (‚ÄòNBL‚Äô). We continue in the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to complete the transaction and expect to close it in the second half of 2022.On 28 March  HEINEKEN announced its decision to leave Russia. We are making good progress to secure an orderly transfer of our business to a new owner in full compliance with international and local laws and expect to reach an agreement during the second half of this year. For more details on the financial implications of this decision  please refer to page 12.FUNDING THE GROWTHGiven the current inflationary environment  we are taking significant pricing and revenue management actions to offset the input and other cost inflation on a euro-for-euro basis. In addition  we are structurally addressing our cost base and building a cost-conscious culture to mitigate cost pressures  to invest behind our growth and gear our business to deliver operating leverage over time.We continue to make significant progress in our productivity programme  targeting ‚Ç¨2 billion of structural gross savings by 2023  relative to our cost base of 2019. We have now collected more than 9 000 ideas through our systematic process  some going beyond 2023. We are working on embedding this process further so ideas can travel across the organisation to learn  share and reapply. Some of these ideas require significant change and are packaged into transformational programmes. By the end of 2022  we expect to have captured ‚Ç¨1.7 billion of these savings  well on track to deliver on our objective.The progress in the delivery of these savings has helped us to accelerate investments behind our growth agenda  digital transformation and sustainability initiatives. In addition  we are reversing the significant cost mitigation actions taken to partially offset the financial impact of lockdowns and other restrictions on operating during the pandemic. Last year the full cost mitigation actions represented a reduction of expenses (beia) of circa ‚Ç¨0.5 billion for the full year relative to 2019. For example  marketing and sales expenses (beia) in the first half of the year increased organically by ‚Ç¨264 million or 28.5%  bringing the absolute level close to pre-pandemic levels.Operating profit increased to ‚Ç¨2 070 million. Operating profit (beia) increased 24.6% organically  driven by the volume recovery  pricing and revenue management actions and continued strong delivery of gross savings from our productivity programme  more than offsetting significant inflationary pressures  the reversal of our cost mitigation actions and a step-up in investments. All in all  operating profit (beia) is 21.6% ahead of 2019  excluding consolidation effects. Operating profit margin (beia) declined to 16.0%  35 bps below the first half of 2021  driven by consolidation changes; excluding those  operating profit margin would have remained stable.Net profit increased to ‚Ç¨1 265 million. Net profit (beia) increased 40.2% organically  driven by the growth in operating profit  lower interest and net financing expenses  and the normalisation of the effective tax rate.RAISING THE BAR ON SUSTAINABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITYWe are making steady progress against our Brew a Better World strategy  focusing on three areas: raising the bar on climate action  accelerating our social sustainability agenda and driving our brands to advance the moderate consumption of alcohol.Environmental: Path to zero impactAlong our journey to become net zero in our entire value chain by 2040  roadmaps have been developed with our largest operating companies  which account for 75% of our total emissions. In South Africa  we launched the largest solar plant in the African beer industry  reducing the brewery‚Äôs carbon impact by 30%.Regarding healthy watersheds  two new wastewater treatment plants were installed at our breweries in Serbia and Haiti. Meoqui in Mexico is our most water efficient brewery  using less than 2 litres of water for one litre of beer.Social: Path to an inclusive  fair and equitable worldCurrently  26% of our senior managers are women and we aim to increase this to at least 30% by 2025 and 40% by 2030 on the path to gender balance.The Heineken¬Æ brand revealed a new direction for its sponsorship in football  making its entire football campaign across both the men's and women's games about tackling gender bias affecting both players and fans of the sport.Responsible: Path to moderate and no harmful useHeineken¬Æ 0.0 is being introduced on draught in hundreds of pubs across the country in the UK. Through a partnership with ITV  it is now part of the UK‚Äôs two largest television soap series helping to normalise the consumption of non-alcoholic beer.We also launched a new episode of our ‚ÄòWhen You Drive  Never Drink‚Äô campaign  addressing the issue of overconfidence when drinking alcohol  with the help of F1 drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Sergio Perez.GovernanceWe have aligned our long-term incentive (LTI) policy with our sustainability ambitions by including three Brew a Better World metrics representing 25% of the total LTI: carbon emissions reduction in production  water efficiency worldwide and the percentage of women at the senior manager level.Outlook StatementsOur multi-year EverGreen strategy aims to deliver superior  balanced growth for sustainable  long-term value creation. We are encouraged by the speed and progress made so far on our key strategic programmes  and by the strong post-COVID recovery of our business.At the same time  we continue to observe a challenging global environment and an uncertain economic outlook. Whilst consumer demand in aggregate has been resilient in the first half  there is increasing risk that mounting pressure on consumer purchasing power will affect beer consumption.We expect significant inflationary pressures on our cost base and ongoing investment in our business to continue and impact the second half of 2022 and into 2023. The recent softening in some commodities is being offset by the unprecedented price levels and availability risk of natural gas  most notably affecting Europe  our biggest region. Our pricing and revenue management actions have effectively offset these inflationary pressures so far in absolute terms  and we remain committed to continuing to do so. In addition  our productivity programme continues at pace  lifting the aggregate gross savings contribution to ‚Ç¨1.7 billion by end of 2022 compared to the cost base of 2019. This will continue to offset cost pressures and enable increased investments in brand support  our digital transformation and sustainability initiatives.For 2022  we keep our outlook unchanged and expect a stable to modest sequential improvement in operating profit margin (beia) versus last year. We are changing our previous guidance for 2023. We will move from an operating profit margin objective towards delivering operating profit (beia) organic growth  in the range of a mid- to high-single digit  excluding any major unforeseen macroeconomic and political developments. Over the medium term  we reconfirm our aspiration to deliver superior  balanced growth with operating leverage over time.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactBased on the impact to date  and applying spot rates of 28 July 2022 to the 2021 financial results as a baseline for the remainder of the year  the calculated positive currency translational impact would be approximately ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in net revenue (beia)  ‚Ç¨210 million at consolidated operating profit (beia)  and ‚Ç¨140 million at net profit (beia).Interim Dividend 2022HEINEKEN's dividends are paid in the form of an interim dividend and a final dividend. The interim dividend is fixed at 40% of the total dividend of the previous year. As a result  an interim dividend of ‚Ç¨0.50 per share (2021: ‚Ç¨0.28) will be paid on 11 August 2022. The shares will trade ex-dividend on 3 August 2022.EnquiriesMedia Investors Sarah Backhouse Jos√© Federico Castillo Martinez Director of Global Communication Investor Relations Director Michael Fuchs Mark Matthews / Robin Achten Global Corporate and Financial Communications Manager Investor Relations Manager / Senior Analyst E-mail: pressoffice@heineken.com E-mail: investors@heineken.com Tel: +31-20-5239355 Tel: +31-20-5239590Investor Calendar Heineken N.V.Trading Update for Q3 2022 26 October 2022 Capital Markets Event in Amsterdam 1-2 December 2022 Full Year 2022 Results 15 February 2023Conference Call DetailsHEINEKEN will host an analyst and investor conference call in relation to its 2022 Half Year results today at 14:00 CET/ 13:00 GMT.

HEINEKEN aims to achieve this by sharp consumer and customer orientation  leveraging its leading premium brands  developing winning consumer propositions in fast-growing segments and continuously shaping its geographic and portfolio footprint.Revenue for the first half of 2022 was 16 401 million (2021: 11 970 million). Net revenue (beia) increased 24.3% organically  driven by a 7.7% increase in total consolidated volume and a 15.6% increase in net revenue (beia) per hectolitre. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 15.3%  driven by pricing across all markets  covering input cost inflation on a euro-for-euro basis  a positive channel mix and premiumisation. Compared to 2019  total consolidated volume increased organically by 0.8% and net revenue (beia) is 14.4% ahead  excluding consolidation changes  driven by post-COVID volume recovery  growth of HEINEKEN's premium brands and the impact of inflation-led pricing.Beer volume increased 7.6% organically versus last year and came 4.2% ahead of 2019 on an organic basis. The growth was faster in the second quarter as beer volume grew 9.7%  led by strong growth in the Americas  the continued recovery of Asia Pacific and the on-trade in Europe and modest growth in the Africa  Middle East and Eastern Europe (AMEE) region. HEINEKEN gained or held market share in more than half of its markets.Beer volume 2Q22 2Q21 Organicgrowth HY22 HY21 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Heineken N.V. 70.4 59.6 9.7 % 126.9 109.9 7.6 %Premium beer volume grew by 10.2%  driving close to half of HEINEKEN's organic growth in beer volume  led by Heineken¬Æ.Heineken¬Æ continued its strong performance and grew volume by 14.6% in the second quarter to close the first half with a 13.8% increase  up 32.9% versus 2019. The brand grew double-digits in more than 50 markets  notably in Brazil  China  Vietnam  South Africa  the Netherlands  Spain  Italy  Laos and the United Arab Emirates. Heineken¬Æ Silver  now present in 22 markets  has nearly doubled its volume  driven by strong growth in Vietnam and China and its rollout across Europe and Asia. As the next step of its global roll-out  HEINEKEN introduced Heineken¬Æ Silver in Mexico this month.As per the Kantar BrandZ 2022 global survey  Heineken¬Æ was the fastest growing in 'Brand Value' among top alcohol brands  driven by its strong growth momentum  innovations and creativity. The latter was further recognised at this year's Cannes Lions  the prestigious Festival of Creativity  as the most awarded alcohol brand. The brand's most recent campaign  ""The Closer""  aims to spark conversation on work-life imbalance  with a smile. Heineken¬Æ supports inclusion in the bar and on the football field and is a proud sponsor of the UEFA Women's EURO football tournament.Heineken¬Æ volume 2Q22 Organicgrowth HY22 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Heineken N.V. 14.0 14.6% 25.9 13.8%Outlook StatementsHEINEKEN's multi-year EverGreen strategy aims to deliver superior  balanced growth for sustainable  long-term value creation. HEINEKEN is encouraged by the speed and progress made so far on its key strategic programmes  and by the strong post-COVID recovery of its business.At the same time  HEINEKEN continues to observe a challenging global environment and an uncertain economic outlook. Whilst consumer demand in aggregate has been resilient in the first half  there is increasing risk that mounting pressure on consumer purchasing power will affect beer consumption.HEINEKEN expects significant inflationary pressures on its cost base and ongoing investment in its business to continue and impact the second half of 2022 and into 2023. The recent softening in some commodities is being offset by the unprecedented price levels and availability risk of natural gas  most notably affecting Europe  our biggest region. HEINEKEN's pricing and revenue management actions have effectively offset these inflationary pressures so far in absolute terms  and HEINEKEN remains committed to continuing to do so. In addition  HEINEKEN's productivity programme continues at pace  lifting the aggregate gross savings contribution to ‚Ç¨1.7 billion by end of 2022 compared to the cost base of 2019. This will continue to offset cost pressures and enable increased investments in brand support  digital transformation and sustainability initiatives.For 2022  HEINEKEN keeps its outlook unchanged and expect a stable to modest sequential improvement in operating profit margin (beia) versus last year. HEINEKEN is changing its previous guidance for 2023. HEINEKEN will move from an operating profit margin objective towards delivering operating profit (beia) organic growth  in the range of a mid- to high-single digit  excluding any major unforeseen macroeconomic and political developments. Over the medium term  HEINEKEN reconfirms its aspiration to deliver superior  balanced growth with operating leverage over time.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactBased on the impact to date  and applying spot rates of 28 July 2022 to the 2021 financial results as a baseline for the remainder of the year  the calculated positive currency translational impact would be approximately ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in net revenue (beia)  ‚Ç¨210 million at consolidated operating profit (beia)  and ‚Ç¨140 million at net profit (beia).Interim Dividend 2022According to the Articles of Association of Heineken Holding N.V. both Heineken Holding N.V. and Heineken N.V. pay an identical dividend per share. HEINEKEN's dividends are paid in the form of an interim dividend and a final dividend. In accordance with its dividend policy  HEINEKEN fixes the interim dividend at 40% of the total dividend of the previous year. As a result  an interim dividend of ‚Ç¨0.50 per share (2021: ‚Ç¨0.28) will be paid on 11 August 2022. Both the Heineken Holding N.V. shares and the Heineken N.V. shares will trade ex-dividend on 3 August 2022.EnquiriesMedia Heineken Holding N.V.

While we are disappointed with the outcome of this study  the findings are certain to advance our understanding of the role of immunotherapy in this setting ‚Äù said Mondher Mahjoubi  Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma. ‚ÄúWe remain confident in the development program for monalizumab in lung cancer  where encouraging data has been previously reported from the randomized  Phase 2 COAST and Neo-COAST studies. Our focus for monalizumab remains on the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 study in the unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer setting  as well as the Phase 2 NeoCOAST-2 study in the neoadjuvant early-stage lung cancer setting.‚ÄùSusan Galbraith  Executive Vice President  Oncology R&D  AstraZeneca  said: ‚ÄúWe are disappointed by this outcome and what it means for patients. We would like to thank the patients  investigators and healthcare professionals who dedicated their time and expertise to this trial  which has advanced our understanding of metastatic head and neck cancer. We continue to explore the impact of monalizumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer across different trials  including the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 trial.‚ÄùMonalizumab  Innate‚Äôs lead partnered asset  is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells. It is being studied in a Phase 3 clinical study sponsored by AstraZeneca  PACIFIC-9  evaluating durvalumab (PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab or AstraZeneca‚Äôs oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy.About INTERLINK-1:INTERLINK-1 was a global  multi-center  randomized  double-blind Phase 3 study of monalizumab and cetuximab vs. placebo and cetuximab designed to enroll approximately 600 patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) who have been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitors (‚ÄúIO-pretreated‚Äù).The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) in HPV-unrelated participants  with secondary endpoints including OS in all randomized participants  progression-free survival (PFS)  overall response rate  duration of response  safety and quality of life. Additional details on the INTERLINK-1 clinical study can be found here.About monalizumab:Monalizumab is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.NKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E  cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Monalizumab may reestablish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells  and may enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies.The ongoing development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in various combination strategies in different malignancies  including  in early lung cancer  the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 study in adults with locally advanced (Stage III)  unresectable NSCLC  who have not progressed following platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy  and the Phase 2 NeoCOAST-2 study in the neoadjuvant early-stage setting of NSCLC.About the Innate-AstraZeneca monalizumab agreement:In October 2018  AstraZeneca obtained full oncology rights to monalizumab by exercising its option under the co-development and commercialization agreement initiated in 2015.The financial terms of the agreement include potential cash payments up to $1.275 billion to Innate Pharma. Including the $50 million payment triggered by dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 clinical study  Innate Pharma has received $450 million to date.For any commercialized oncology indication  AstraZeneca will book all sales revenue and will pay Innate low double-digit to mid-teen percentage royalties on net sales worldwide except in Europe where Innate Pharma will receive 50% share of the profits and losses in the territory. Innate co-fund 30% of the costs of the Phase 3 development program of monalizumab with a pre-agreed limitation of Innate‚Äôs financial commitment.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma‚Äôs broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of Natural Killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

In a context once again disrupted by the sanitary crisis  a difficult climate  coupled with geopolitical tensions and their consequences  the group once again demonstrated the resilience of its business.In accordance with IFRS 5  the income statement items relating to the North American canned and frozen activities  divested on June 30  2022  will be combined in the income statement of the published financial statements under the heading ""net profit from discontinued operations"".

Branded sales grew by circa +4.-% in the retail sector  resulting  in particular for Cassegrain  in market share gains in both volume and value  in line with the group's strategy. Food service business  mainly frozen and fresh  grew by more than 30%  exceeding the market's recovery rate  resulting in a return to a level of activity close to that of the pre-covid period.Non-Europe ZoneRevenue (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) for the non-Europe Zone in FY 2021-2022  including the canned and frozen activities in North America  represented 53.1% of total revenue  down -2.4% on a like for like* and up +1.8% on reported figures (excluding the effect of IFRS 5).In North America  the long life activities (canned and frozen)  divested on June 30  2022  posted solid growth over the financial year as a whole  driven  as in Europe  by the strong growth in the food service business in both Canada and the United States along with the resilience of the retail sector despite its normalization following the Covid 19 sanitary crisis.The ready-to-eat fresh activities of the Bonduelle Fresh Americas business unit declined significantly over the financial year. This decline is explained by significant price increases aimed at preserving margins in a particularly inflationary environment  a less dynamic market  and the cessation of sales of non-contributing ranges to certain clients  which was not offset by new clients acquisitions.In Eurasia  the brands (Bonduelle and Globus) posted growth over the financial year as a whole  despite a Q4 marked by geopolitical tensions and their impacts on consumption and inflation.HighlightsBonduelle sold 65% of Bonduelle Americas Long Life to the Fonds de solidarit√© FTQ and CDPQOn June 30  2022  the Bonduelle Group obtained the approval from U.S and Canadian regulatory authorities and the waiver of conditions precedent allowing it to finalize the agreement with the institutional investors Fonds de solidarit√© FTQ and CDPQ  for the acquisition  in equal shares between them  of 65% of Bonduelle Americas Long Life (BALL) and on the basis of an enterprise value at 100% of C$ 850 million (approximately ‚Ç¨ 625 million)  or an EBITDA multiple for 2020-2021 of 8.2x.With a revenue of C$ 989 million for financial year 2021-2022  this business activity is dedicated to the processing and marketing of canned and frozen vegetables in the United States and Canada  in the retail supermarket and food service sectors  with private labels  third party brands and own brands such as Arctic Gardens and Del Monte. This operation enables the group to continue to deploy its activities  particularly in brands  in line with its strategic priorities and its ambition of sustainable growth with positive impact. The sale  for which the net proceeds will be determined based on the financial statements as of the date of the transaction  which are currently being prepared  will be recorded in the Bonduelle Group's financial statements for the year ending June 30  2022.OutlooksBased on the development of the business in FY 2021-2022  on the one hand  and taking into account an unprecedented wave of inflation affecting all cost components  which became more pronounced towards the end of the financial year  on the other hand  and lastly  taking into account the recovery that has begun but is more difficult than expected in its North American fresh ready-to-eat business  the Bonduelle Group confirms that the expected growth in current operating margin (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) should fall short of the stated objective of 3.6% on a like for like basis* and at constant exchange rates for FY 2021-2022.The difficulties encountered by the Bonduelle Fresh Americas business unit have led the group to review its medium-term profitability prospects  which may result in the impairment of tangible and/or intangible assets and deferred tax assets of this business.* at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as follows:For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.In the specific case of the 2021-2022 financial year  the revenue from the North American canned and frozen activities divested on June 30  2022 is recorded for the full financial year.Alternative performance indicators : the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib. Leniolisib has been studied for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents age 12 or older in the European Economic Area (EEA). Pharming is on track and plans to submit its MAA for leniolisib to the EMA in October 2022.Accelerated assessment reduces the timeframe for the CHMP to review an MAA from 210 days to 150 days. The EMA will grant  upon request  accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation.The clinical development for leniolisib includes positive data from a Phase II/III study of the product  which met both its co-primary endpoints in the target patient population of evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The primary efficacy results demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from baseline in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) in the index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.0012) and normalization of immune dysfunction  as evidenced by increased proportion of na√Øve B cells from baseline (p<0.0001). The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of na√Øve B cells are important in patients as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers.In the study  leniolisib was generally well-tolerated  with the majority of reported adverse events in both treatment groups classified as mild. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The acceptance of an accelerated regulatory review for leniolisib underlines the high unmet need for patients with APDS  with the product potentially being the first approved treatment for this rare disease. This is an important milestone for the APDS community and for Pharming and is built on the successful Phase II/III data  which we first reported in February 2022. We remain focused on progressing leniolisib through the regulatory review process  with our MAA on track for submission in October of this year  as we seek to make this important new product available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients in Europe.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

We were able to perform very well in all our regions where local clients spending was above pre-pandemic levels  apart from Asia  where our stores were temporarily closed due to Covid restrictions. This enabled us to reach an all-time H1 sales record. This momentum  which could not have been possible without the strong commitment of our teams  confirms the relevance of our strategy focusing on brand desirability  with local marketing strategies which boost customer engagement. Over the first half  we also managed to strongly increase our profitability thanks to tireless efforts to increase full price sales. In addition  we accelerated on our CSR policy  by implementing a traceability program  and on our omnichannel ambition. Looking forward  while the current geopolitical and macro-economic environment creates some uncertainty  we confirm our 2022 full-year guidance if the situation does not further deteriorate.‚ÄùStory continues‚Ç¨m except % Q2 2021 Q2 2022 Organicchange Reportedchange H12021 H12022 Organicchange Reported change Sales by region France 63.2 101.0 +63.1% +59.8% 141.9 194.7 +40.8% +37.2% EMEA3F4 66.4 90.3 +34.3% +35.8% 114.0 173.4 +50.4% +52.1% Americas 34.2 44.5 +16.1% +30.1% 59.1 83.1 +28.1% +40.6% APAC4F5 65.5 46.6 -34.9% -28.8% 138.4 114.2 -23.8% -17.4% Sales by Brand Sandro 108.4 132.7 +17.7% +22.4% 212.0 266.8 +21.7% +25.8% Maje 93.5 111.7 +15.1% +19.4% 182.9 223.9 +18.5% +22.4% Other brands5F6 27.4 37.9 +39.2% +38.5% 58.4 74.7 +29.6% +27.9% TOTAL 229.4 282.4 +19.2% +23.1% 453.3 565.4 +21.4% +24.7%H1 2022 SALESIn H1 2022  consolidated sales reached ‚Ç¨565.4m  up +24.7% compared to H1 2021  including an organic increase of +21.4% (fully driven by like-for-like growth of +24.5%) and a positive currency impact of +4.2%. SMCP recorded a sharp performance in Europe throughout the semester  a strong momentum in the Americas  partially offset by the significant impact of the Covid restrictive measures in APAC.The Group generated stable digital sales compared to H1 2021  resulting in a digital penetration of 22%  well above the pre-pandemic level (15% in 2019).In line with our strategic plan  we continued to make strong progress on our full price strategy  notably through our deliberate reduction of the promotional sales share  and achieving a significant decrease in the discount rate  both in brick-and-mortar and digital  with -6.1 pp in H1 2022 vs. H1 2021.At the beginning of the year  SMCP finalized its brick-and-mortar network optimization plan  with 14 net closures in H1 (of which -17 in Q1 and +3 in Q2). Among these net closures  the discontinuing of the Suite 341 format in France represented eight closures. In EMEA  SMCP recorded six POS net closures  mainly from store consolidation (such as Sandro women and Sandro men becoming a unisex store)  partly compensated by key openings in Belgium  Estonia and Spain. In APAC  SMCP opened new stores in China and Korea.Sales breakdown by regionIn France  sales were up +40.8% on an organic basis vs. H1 2021  a sharp improvement over the semester  fully driven by like-for-like (+44.0%) and leading to a level exceeding 2019. Since the beginning of the year  SMCP outperformed the market  gained market shares thanks to the success of its spring-summer collections and recorded a strong sales growth in Q2 2022 vs Q2 2019 of + 8.2% on an organic basis. This performance includes a discount rate reduction (throughout the semester) of more than 10 pp vs H1 2021 (benefitting all brands and channels)  and the finalization of SMCP‚Äôs network optimization plan (-10 POS in H1  of which -8 Suite 341)  mostly in Q1.In EMEA  Group sales were up by +50.4% on an organic basis vs. H1 2021  including a like-for-like growth of +68.6%; a strong performance driven by both local demand and the progressive recovery of tourism. As in France  the second quarter was excellent  exceeding 2019 by +10.6% on an organic basis. In addition  we achieved a material decrease of discount rate by -6pp and a slight store network‚Äôs reduction as part of SMCP‚Äôs optimization strategy.In APAC  the intensifying Covid restrictions  first in Hong-Kong and then in Mainland China  had a sharp impact on sales  leading to a -24% decrease on an organic basis vs. H1 2021. These restrictive measures implemented in Mainland China led to (i) long store closures  peaking from March to May  of which a closure of an average of 25%6F7 of our physical stores during more than two months (mainly large stores  located in ‚ÄòTier 1‚Äô cities)  (ii) the complete shutdown of our brick-and-mortar and digital warehouses slowing the business: immobilizing inventory  affecting digital orders and the replenishment of the other stores  (iii) an important traffic drop. Hong-Kong SAR and Macau SAR also suffered from these restrictions leading to a drop in traffic and low tourism.The desirability of our brands remains intact in APAC  and especially in China  where we recorded an excellent Tmall ‚Äú6.18‚Äù event  with both Sandro and Maje ranking in the top 3 of Accessible Luxury.In the Americas  sales increased on an organic basis by +28.1% vs. H1 2021  a substantial growth  both vs. 2021 and vs. 2019 (+16.3% on an organic basis)  with: (i) a strong performance in all our distribution channels  fully driven by like-for-like growth (+29.8% vs.2021)  (ii) a sharp reduction of discount rate of 10 pp  coming from both digital and brick-and-mortar. Both the United States and Canada had an excellent semester  driven by high demand.Unless stated otherwise  all figures used in 2021 and 2022 to analyze the performance take into account the impact of the application of IFRS 16 and IAS 38 1KEY FIGURES (‚Ç¨m) H1 20218 H1 2022 Changeas reported Sales 453.3 565.4 +24.7% Adjusted EBITDA 98.5 121.8 +23.6% Adjusted EBIT 25.7 45.2 +75.8% Net Income Group Share 0.9 20.7 +19.7m EPS7F9 (‚Ç¨) 0.01 0.28 na Diluted EPS8F10 (‚Ç¨) 0.01 0.26 na FCF 20.2 4.9 -15.3mH1 2022 CONSOLIDATED RESULTSAdjusted EBITDA increased from ‚Ç¨98.5 million in H1 2021 to ‚Ç¨121.8 million in H1 2022. This resulted from the rise in sales combined with an increase of +2.8pp of the management gross margin (at 74.4%  thanks to SMCP‚Äôs efficient pricing policy and discipline on discount rate)  and the continuing strong cost management.Store costs9F11  as a percentage of sales  stood at 41.9%10F12  reflecting a slight increase mainly due to the channel mix (less digital)  and to a lesser extent  due to the sharp restrictions in China. SG&A3 decreased slightly to reach 21.6%4 of sales  reflecting continued strong cost management and better absorption of all main expensesAmortization  depreciation  and provisions amounted to -‚Ç¨76.7m in H1 2022 (vs. -‚Ç¨72.8m in H1 2021). Excluding IFRS 16  they represent 4.2% of sales (vs. 5.9% in H1 2021).As a result  adjusted EBIT jumped by 75.8% to ‚Ç¨45.2m in H1 2022 (from ‚Ç¨25.7m in H1 2021). An excellent performance compared to the sales growth of +24.7%. The adjusted EBIT margin gained +2.3pp at 8.0% (vs. 5.7% in H1 2021.Other non-recurring income and expenses totaled -‚Ç¨0.8m  decreasing vs. last year (-‚Ç¨4.7m in H1 2021).Financial expenses decreased to -‚Ç¨11.9m (vs. -‚Ç¨15.3m in H1 2021). This amount includes the cost of net debt of ‚Äúleases‚Äù (IFRS 16) of -‚Ç¨5.5m (vs -‚Ç¨6.6m in H1 2021). The average cost of debt stood at 1.5% in H1 2022.Income tax significantly increased to -‚Ç¨8.7m (from -‚Ç¨0.4m in H1 2021)  as a result of the strong increase in profit before tax.Resulting from all factors described above  Net income - Group share stood at a net profit of ‚Ç¨20.7m (vs. ‚Ç¨0.9m in H1 2021).H1 2022 FREE CASH FLOW AND NET FINANCIAL DEBTThe Group maintained a strict control of its investments throughout the semester  amounting to ‚Ç¨18.7m (vs. ‚Ç¨19.0m in H1 2021)  representing 3.3% of sales (vs. 4.2% in H1 2021)  a slightly lower level due to a phasing effect.Working capital increased to ‚Ç¨160.3m (from ‚Ç¨133.6m in H1 2021)  remaining stable at 14% as a percentage of sales13. This increase enabled to support the significant growth in the activity of our brands  within the framework of our demand planning policy and in the current external environment.As a result  the Group generated a Free-cash-flow of ‚Ç¨4.9m.Net financial debt stood at ‚Ç¨314.4m as of June 30  2022  a slight decrease vs. ‚Ç¨317.7m at year-end 2021. Significant reimbursements (c. ‚Ç¨70m) were performed during the semester  in line with contractual schedules. The Net financial debt/adjusted EBITDA11F14 ratio decreased to 2.1x (2.5x at year-end 2021).The Group benefits from a strong liquidity headroom including an undrawn RCF of ‚Ç¨200m.FINANCIAL OUTLOOKThe strong results in H1 2022  despite adverse external factors (war in Ukraine  continued inflation  Covid resurgences in Asia)  demonstrate once again the resilience of SMCP and the strength and desirability of its brands portfolio.Based on this performance  and provided the geopolitical situation  macro-economic context and sanitary conditions do not further deteriorate during the rest of the year  SMCP confirms its 2022 full-year guidance.MANAGEMENTJean-Baptiste Dacquin  former CEO of Claudie Pierlot  has chosen to pursue other professional projects outside SMCP.

The recruitment process of a new CEO for the brand is being finalized and should be announced by the autumn.A conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 6:00 p.m. (Paris time).Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.The Board of Directors met on 1st of August to approve the consolidated accounts for the first half of 2022. The limited review procedures have been completed and the related report is being issued.FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSThe Group uses certain key financial and non-financial measures to analyze the performance of its business. The principal performance indicators used include the number of its points of sale  like-for-like sales growth  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin.Number of points of sale (POS)The number of the Group‚Äôs points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly-operated stores (DOS)  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth is the total sales in a given period compared to the same period in the previous year. It is expressed as a percentage change between the two periods and is presented at constant rates (sales for period N and period N-1 in foreign currencies are converted at the average rate for year N-1) and excluding the effects of changes in the scope of consolidation.Like-for-like sales growthLike-for-like sales growth corresponds to retail sales from directly operated points of sale on a like-for-like basis in a given period compared with the same period in the previous year  expressed as a percentage change between the two periods. Like-for-like points of sale for a given period include all of the Group‚Äôs points of sale that were open at the beginning of the previous period and exclude points of sale closed during the period  including points of sale closed for renovation for more than one month  as well as points of sale that changed their activity (for example  Sandro points of sale changing from Sandro Femme to Sandro Homme or to a mixed Sandro Femme and Sandro Homme store).Like-for-like sales growth percentage is presented at constant exchange rates (sales for year N and year N-1 in foreign currencies are converted at the average N-1 rate  as presented in the annexes to the Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31 for the year N in question).Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA marginAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Group as operating income before depreciation  amortization  provisions  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBITDA is not a standardized accounting measure that meets a single generally accepted definition. It must not be considered as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flow from operating activities  or as a measure of liquidity.Adjusted EBITDA margin corresponds to adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT marginAdjusted EBIT is defined by the Group as earning before interests and taxes and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBIT corresponds to EBIT before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT divided by net sales.Management and accounting Gross marginManagement gross margin corresponds to the sales after deducting rebates and cost of sales only. The accounting gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) corresponds to the sales after deducting the rebates  the cost of sales and the commissions paid to the department stores and affiliates.Retail MarginRetail margin corresponds to the management gross margin after taking into account the points of sale‚Äôs direct expenses such as rent  personnel costs  commissions paid to the department stores and other operating costs.The table below summarizes the reconciliation of the management gross margin and the retail margin with the accounting gross margin as included in the Group‚Äôs financial statements for the following periods:(‚Ç¨m) ‚Äì excluding IFRS 16 H1 2021 H1 2022 Gross margin (as appearing in the account) 280.9 363.3 Readjustment of the commissions and other adjustments 43.7 57.6 Management Gross margin 324.6 420.9 Direct costs of point of sales -185.4 -243.0 Retail margin 139.2 177.9Net financial debtNet financial debt corresponds to current and non-current financial debt  net of cash and cash equivalents and net of current bank overdrafts.***METHODOLOGY NOTEUnless otherwise indicated  amounts are expressed in millions of euros and rounded to the first digit after the decimal point.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib. Leniolisib has been studied for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents age 12 or older in the European Economic Area (EEA). Pharming is on track and plans to submit its MAA for leniolisib to the EMA in October 2022.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.) (PRNewswire)Accelerated assessment reduces the timeframe for the CHMP to review an MAA from 210 days to 150 days. The EMA will grant  upon request  accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation.The clinical development for leniolisib includes positive data from a Phase II/III study of the product  which met both its co-primary endpoints in the target patient population of evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The primary efficacy results demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from baseline in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) in the index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.0012) and normalization of immune dysfunction  as evidenced by increased proportion of na√Øve B cells from baseline (p<0.0001). The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of na√Øve B cells are important in patients as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers.In the study  leniolisib was generally well-tolerated  with the majority of reported adverse events in both treatment groups classified as mild. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The acceptance of an accelerated regulatory review for leniolisib underlines the high unmet need for patients with APDS  with the product potentially being the first approved treatment for this rare disease. This is an important milestone for the APDS community and for Pharming and is built on the successful Phase II/III data  which we first reported in February 2022. We remain focused on progressing leniolisib through the regulatory review process  with our MAA on track for submission in October of this year  as we seek to make this important new product available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients in Europe.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

One of our top-selling.,Innate Pharma Provides Update on AstraZeneca-Sponsored INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 StudyDetails Category: Antibodies Published on Monday  01 August 2022 17:39 Hits: 181MARSEILLE  France I August 01  2022 I Innate Pharma SA (Euronext Paris: IPH; Nasdaq: IPHA) (‚ÄúInnate‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù)  today announced that a planned futility interim analysis of the INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 study sponsored by AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) did not meet a pre-defined threshold for efficacy. Based on this result and the recommendation of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee  AstraZeneca has informed Innate that the study will be discontinued. There were no new safety findings. AstraZeneca plan to share the data in due course.The INTERLINK-1 study  sponsored by AstraZeneca  evaluated monalizumab in combination with cetuximab vs. cetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) who have been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitors.‚ÄúThe INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 study was intended to further evaluate a novel immunotherapy regimen following the promising signals observed in a non-randomized Phase 1b/2 study of head and neck cancer. While we are disappointed with the outcome of this study  the findings are certain to advance our understanding of the role of immunotherapy in this setting ‚Äù said Mondher Mahjoubi  Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma. ‚ÄúWe remain confident in the development program for monalizumab in lung cancer  where encouraging data has been previously reported from the randomized  Phase 2 COAST and Neo-COAST studies. Our focus for monalizumab remains on the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 study in the unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer setting  as well as the Phase 2 NeoCOAST-2 study in the neoadjuvant early-stage lung cancer setting.‚ÄùSusan Galbraith  Executive Vice President  Oncology R&D  AstraZeneca  said: ‚ÄúWe are disappointed by this outcome and what it means for patients. We would like to thank the patients  investigators and healthcare professionals who dedicated their time and expertise to this trial  which has advanced our understanding of metastatic head and neck cancer. We continue to explore the impact of monalizumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer across different trials  including the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 trial.‚ÄùMonalizumab  Innate‚Äôs lead partnered asset  is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells. It is being studied in a Phase 3 clinical study sponsored by AstraZeneca  PACIFIC-9  evaluating durvalumab (PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab or AstraZeneca‚Äôs oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy.About INTERLINK-1:INTERLINK-1 was a global  multi-center  randomized  double-blind Phase 3 study of monalizumab and cetuximab vs. placebo and cetuximab designed to enroll approximately 600 patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) who have been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitors (‚ÄúIO-pretreated‚Äù).The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) in HPV-unrelated participants  with secondary endpoints including OS in all randomized participants  progression-free survival (PFS)  overall response rate  duration of response  safety and quality of life. Additional details on the INTERLINK-1 clinical study can be found here.About monalizumab:Monalizumab is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.NKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E  cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Monalizumab may reestablish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells  and may enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies.The ongoing development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in various combination strategies in different malignancies  including  in early lung cancer  the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 study in adults with locally advanced (Stage III)  unresectable NSCLC  who have not progressed following platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy  and the Phase 2 NeoCOAST-2 study in the neoadjuvant early-stage setting of NSCLC.About the Innate-AstraZeneca monalizumab agreement:In October 2018  AstraZeneca obtained full oncology rights to monalizumab by exercising its option under the co-development and commercialization agreement initiated in 2015.The financial terms of the agreement include potential cash payments up to $1.275 billion to Innate Pharma.

The EU last week agreed plans to voluntarily reduce gas usage by 15pc over winter in preparation for a possible shut down.Heineken chief executive Dolf van den Brink said the brewer would curtail its output in ""extreme scenarios"" but said he was ""moderately confident"" that production would continue as normal.""The recent softening in some commodities is being offset by the unprecedented price levels and availability risk of natural gas  most notably affecting Europe  our biggest region ‚Äù he said.Heineken has been raising its prices and encouraging drinkers towards more upmarket  and high margin  drinks  which has ""effectively offset these inflationary pressures "" Mr van den Brink said.The Dutch company has lifted prices on drinks by 8.9pc over the past six months in comparison to the same period last year and Heineken said the price of a pint was likely to rise further in the coming months  as it is forced to pass on escalating costs.Mr van den Brink added: ""Whilst consumer demand in aggregate has been resilient in the first half  there is increasing risk that mounting pressure on consumer purchasing power will affect beer consumption.""Despite the concerns  Heineken's performance beat analyst expectations with revenue up by more than a third to ‚Ç¨16.4bn (¬£14bn) over the six month period. Profits climbed by a fifth to ‚Ç¨1.3bn.Heineken said that it was eyeing ""plenty of opportunities"" to expand beyond beers in order to meet the changing wants of customers.The company is in the middle of a huge cost cutting drive that aims to strip ‚Ç¨2bn out of the business by next year  with ‚Ç¨1.7bn worth of savings expected by the end of 2022.Shares in the company were flat on Monday at ‚Ç¨96.02 on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange  valuing the business at about ‚Ç¨55bn.",negative,0.03,0.41,0.56,negative,0.03,0.21,0.77,True,English,"['beer shortage risk', 'gas supply', 'Heineken', 'Europe', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Dolf van den Brink', 'Mr van den Brink', 'huge cost cutting drive', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'European manufacturing plants', 'past six months', 'six month period', 'severe gas shortage', 'unprecedented price levels', 'growing ‚Äúavailability risk', 'Heineken chief executive', 'same period', 'coming months', 'increasing risk', 'brewery giant', 'natural gas', 'recent weeks', 'gas usage', 'possible shut', 'extreme scenarios', 'recent softening', 'high margin', 'inflationary pressures', 'escalating costs', 'first half', 'mounting pressure', 'purchasing power', 'beer consumption', 'analyst expectations', 'changing wants', 'next year', '‚Ç¨1.7bn worth', 'beer production', 'biggest region', 'consumer demand', 'Dutch company', 'winter', 'Amstel', 'Fosters', 'Russia', 'supplies', 'retaliation', 'sanctions', 'support', 'Ukraine', 'war', 'plans', '15pc', 'preparation', 'output', 'commodities', 'prices', 'drinkers', 'upmarket', 'drinks', 'comparison', 'pint', 'aggregate', 'concerns', 'performance', 'revenue', 'Profits', 'fifth', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'beers', 'order', 'customers', 'middle', 'business', 'savings', 'end', 'Shares', 'Monday']",2022-08-01,2022-08-01,telegraph.co.uk
