(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee...","EMA accelerated assessment allows a shorter review period for leniolisib from a standard 210 days to 150 daysPharming is on track to submit its Marketing Authorisation Application for leniolisib in H2 2022LEIDEN  the Netherlands  Aug. 1  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib. Leniolisib has been studied for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents age 12 or older in the European Economic Area (EEA). Pharming is on track and plans to submit its MAA for leniolisib to the EMA in October 2022.Pharming Group logoAccelerated assessment reduces the timeframe for the CHMP to review an MAA from 210 days to 150 days. The EMA will grant  upon request  accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation.The clinical development for leniolisib includes positive data from a Phase II/III study of the product  which met both its co-primary endpoints in the target patient population of evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The primary efficacy results demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from baseline in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) in the index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.0012) and normalization of immune dysfunction  as evidenced by increased proportion of na√Øve B cells from baseline (p<0.0001). The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of na√Øve B cells are important in patients as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers.In the study  leniolisib was generally well-tolerated  with the majority of reported adverse events in both treatment groups classified as mild. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Story continuesAnurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The acceptance of an accelerated regulatory review for leniolisib underlines the high unmet need for patients with APDS  with the product potentially being the first approved treatment for this rare disease. This is an important milestone for the APDS community and for Pharming and is built on the successful Phase II/III data  which we first reported in February 2022. We remain focused on progressing leniolisib through the regulatory review process  with our MAA on track for submission in October of this year  as we seek to make this important new product available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients in Europe.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

Pharming is on track and plans to submit its MAA for leniolisib to the EMA in October 2022.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.)Accelerated assessment reduces the timeframe for the CHMP to review an MAA from 210 days to 150 days. The EMA will grant  upon request  accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation.The clinical development for leniolisib includes positive data from a Phase II/III study of the product  which met both its co-primary endpoints in the target patient population of evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The primary efficacy results demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from baseline in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) in the index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.0012) and normalization of immune dysfunction  as evidenced by increased proportion of na√Øve B cells from baseline (p<0.0001). The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of na√Øve B cells are important in patients as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers.In the study  leniolisib was generally well-tolerated  with the majority of reported adverse events in both treatment groups classified as mild. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Story continuesAnurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The acceptance of an accelerated regulatory review for leniolisib underlines the high unmet need for patients with APDS  with the product potentially being the first approved treatment for this rare disease. This is an important milestone for the APDS community and for Pharming and is built on the successful Phase II/III data  which we first reported in February 2022. We remain focused on progressing leniolisib through the regulatory review process  with our MAA on track for submission in October of this year  as we seek to make this important new product available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients in Europe.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

We benefitted from the recovery in Asia Pacific and the on-trade in Europe as consumers returned to the bars  with demand resilient until now despite mounting inflationary pressures on consumers' disposable income.Our business performed well in the first half of 2022. We grew ahead of the industry in more than half of our markets and the Heineken¬Æ brand again showed strong momentum  boosted by stepped up brand support. Our actions on pricing  revenue management and productivity offset significant inflationary pressures in our cost base. As a result  operating profit is now firmly ahead of 2019.We continue to face an uncertain outlook for consumers and businesses alike. Remaining vigilant  we are fully committed to drive our EverGreen transformation for sustained  long-term value creation. In terms of outlook  we reiterate our 2022 goals. For 2023  we move from an operating margin objective towards delivering operating profit (beia) organic growth.

We aim to achieve this by sharp consumer and customer orientation  leveraging our leading premium brands  developing winning consumer propositions in fast-growing segments and continuously shaping our geographic and portfolio footprint.Revenue for the first half of 2022 was 16 401 million (2021: 11 970 million). Net revenue (beia) increased 24.3% organically  driven by a 7.7% increase in total consolidated volume and a 15.6% increase in net revenue (beia) per hectolitre. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 15.3%  driven by pricing across all markets  covering input cost inflation on a euro-for-euro basis  a positive channel mix and premiumisation. Compared to 2019  total consolidated volume increased organically by 0.8% and net revenue (beia) is 14.4% ahead  excluding consolidation changes  driven by post-COVID volume recovery  growth of our premium brands and the impact of inflation-led pricing.Beer volume increased 7.6% organically versus last year and came 4.2% ahead of 2019 on an organic basis. The growth was faster in the second quarter as beer volume grew 9.7%  led by strong growth in the Americas  the continued recovery of Asia Pacific and the on-trade in Europe and modest growth in the Africa  Middle East and Eastern Europe (AMEE) region. We gained or held market share in more than half of our markets.Beer volume 2Q22 2Q21 Organicgrowth HY22 HY21 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Heineken N.V. 70.4 59.6 9.7% 126.9 109.9 7.6% Africa Middle East & Eastern Europe 9.8 9.7 1.4% 19.6 19.1 3.5% Americas 23.1 20.9 10.7% 42.8 40.3 6.2% Asia Pacific 13.1 5.9 35.7% 24.6 13.6 17.0% Europe 24.4 23.1 5.7% 39.9 36.9 7.9%Driving premiumisation at scale  led by Heineken¬ÆPremium beer volume grew by 10.2%  driving close to half of our organic growth in beer volume  led by Heineken¬Æ.Heineken¬Æ continued its strong performance and grew volume by 14.6% in the second quarter to close the first half with a 13.8% increase  up 32.9% versus 2019. The brand grew double-digits in more than 50 markets  notably in Brazil  China  Vietnam  South Africa  the Netherlands  Spain  Italy  Laos and the United Arab Emirates. Heineken¬Æ Silver  now present in 22 markets  has nearly doubled its volume  driven by strong growth in Vietnam and China and its rollout across Europe and Asia. As the next step of its global roll-out  we introduced Heineken¬Æ Silver in Mexico this month.As per the Kantar BrandZ 2022 global survey  Heineken¬Æ was the fastest growing in 'Brand Value' among top alcohol brands  driven by its strong growth momentum  innovations and creativity. The latter was further recognised at this year's Cannes Lions  the prestigious Festival of Creativity  as the most awarded alcohol brand. The brand's most recent campaign  ""The Closer""  aims to spark conversation on work-life imbalance  with a smile.

More than 20 markets grew double-digits  with especially strong results in Brazil  South Africa  Spain  the UK  the Netherlands  Mexico  Argentina  India and China. Amstel Ultra continued its expansion in the Americas to reach 12 markets. Birra Moretti continued to share the true taste of Italy across Europe and grew volume in the mid-twenties. All European markets contributed to the growth with particularly strong momentum in the UK  Ireland  the Netherlands  Romania and Switzerland. Sol grew volume by a low-single-digit  led by strong growth in Brazil  Chile and South Africa  partially offset by declines in Mexico and Europe. In the year of the Tiger  we are uncaging the growth of our brand in Vietnam and beyond. The brand volume grew in the mid-teens  driven by the recovery in the second quarter of Vietnam  Cambodia  and Malaysia  a continued strong performance in Nigeria and the launch in Brazil last year. Tiger Crystal is now introduced in 19 markets. Edelweiss grew volume in the sixties  bringing a taste of the Alps to Asia  reaching 7 markets and we have started a local production hub in Vietnam. Lagunitas volume grew by a low-single-digit as double-digit growth in Europe was partially offset by a decline in the USA. The non-alcoholic line extensions of Lagunitas  IPNA and Hoppy Refresher  continue their momentum and grew volume in the high-teens.Pioneer choice in low & no-alcohol (LONO)Our LONO portfolio grew volume by a low-single-digit  with double-digit growth in more than 20 markets  most noticeably Brazil  Mexico  Spain  Germany  Panama and Ethiopia  partially offset by declines in Poland  Russia and Egypt.The non-alcoholic beer and cider portfolio grew volume by a high-single-digit  led by Heineken¬Æ 0.0. Despite stopping sales in Russia  Heineken¬Æ 0.0 grew in the low-teens  with a particularly strong performance in Brazil and Spain.We are in the process of extending our industry-leading LONO portfolio to serve the needs of consumers looking for adult refreshment with lower or no-alcohol content and a great taste.Intentionally expand beyond beerWe see plenty of opportunities to expand our product portfolio beyond beer to better meet the needs of more consumers. Overall  our portfolio of flavoured alcoholic beverages (FABs)  including ciders and hard seltzers  grew volume by a high-single-digit to 6.4 million hectolitres and is ahead of 2019 in the low-teens.Desperados continued its momentum  particularly in its core European markets and more than doubling its volume in Nigeria. For consumers looking for a trendy alternative to beer at a similar alcohol level  we launched Desperados Alcoholic Sparkling Water with Tequila in the Netherlands in May.Cider was back to growth in the UK and Ireland and saw double-digit growth in South Africa  Vietnam  Spain and Portugal. For consumers who desire a more balanced lifestyle  we launched Strongbow Ultra Dark Fruit in the UK  a low-calorie cider that does not compromise great taste.We are learning from our experiments across markets and continue to introduce new propositions. We are increasingly leveraging our strongest brands for these propositions  next to new brands like Pure Pira√±a. For example  we launched Dos Equis Classic Lime Margarita and Disorderly Tea House in the USA.Building a future-fit digital route-to-consumerOur ambition is to be the best-connected brewer  so we have been stepping up our investments behind our digital transformation to build a future-ready HEINEKEN  especially strengthening our digital route-to-consumer:Our business-to-business (B2B) digital platforms continued to develop at pace. We captured ‚Ç¨2.8 billion in digital sales value in the first half of this year  close to 3x the same period last year and to the entire value captured in 2021  with close to 430 thousand active customers in fragmented  traditional channels. The digitisation of customer relationships enables us to provide better services  leverage data insights  and capture meaningful increases in efficiency. For example  in Italy we have realised the equivalent of an extra day of sales visits per sales representative  whilst in Ethiopia we have seen an over threefold increase in weekly outlet engagements to optimise assortment and product availability. The remarkable growth in digital sales value was balanced across both our direct and indirect distribution markets  notably Nigeria  Vietnam  Mexico  Brazil and Europe. Vietnam observed the fastest growth  more than 6x last year  covering now close to 55% of the fragmented trade.The net revenue of Beerwulf   our digital direct-to-consumer (eD2C) platform in Europe  was more than 50% ahead of pre-pandemic levels  despite the shift in consumption from in-home to the on-trade as it reopened. Our active consumer base for our home draught systems is close to 40% ahead of pre-pandemic levels  and the transaction data we collect provides valuable insights.Our eD2C platform in Mexico GLUP is growing fast with very positive feedback from users on its value proposition of delivering orders in less than 60 minutes and its use of brand assets. The platform was launched in Monterrey last year  and we are expanding into other large cities in the country.Strengthen and optimise our footprintWe continuously review how we can further strengthen our portfolio and geographical footprint and enhance our long-term  sustained growth advantage.At the end of 2021  HEINEKEN announced its proposed transaction with Distell Group Holdings Limited (‚ÄòDistell‚Äô) and Namibia Breweries Limited (‚ÄòNBL‚Äô). We continue in the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to complete the transaction and expect to close it in the second half of 2022.On 28 March  HEINEKEN announced its decision to leave Russia. We are making good progress to secure an orderly transfer of our business to a new owner in full compliance with international and local laws and expect to reach an agreement during the second half of this year. For more details on the financial implications of this decision  please refer to page 12.FUNDING THE GROWTHGiven the current inflationary environment  we are taking significant pricing and revenue management actions to offset the input and other cost inflation on a euro-for-euro basis. In addition  we are structurally addressing our cost base and building a cost-conscious culture to mitigate cost pressures  to invest behind our growth and gear our business to deliver operating leverage over time.We continue to make significant progress in our productivity programme  targeting ‚Ç¨2 billion of structural gross savings by 2023  relative to our cost base of 2019. We have now collected more than 9 000 ideas through our systematic process  some going beyond 2023. We are working on embedding this process further so ideas can travel across the organisation to learn  share and reapply. Some of these ideas require significant change and are packaged into transformational programmes. By the end of 2022  we expect to have captured ‚Ç¨1.7 billion of these savings  well on track to deliver on our objective.The progress in the delivery of these savings has helped us to accelerate investments behind our growth agenda  digital transformation and sustainability initiatives. In addition  we are reversing the significant cost mitigation actions taken to partially offset the financial impact of lockdowns and other restrictions on operating during the pandemic. Last year the full cost mitigation actions represented a reduction of expenses (beia) of circa ‚Ç¨0.5 billion for the full year relative to 2019. For example  marketing and sales expenses (beia) in the first half of the year increased organically by ‚Ç¨264 million or 28.5%  bringing the absolute level close to pre-pandemic levels.Operating profit increased to ‚Ç¨2 070 million. Operating profit (beia) increased 24.6% organically  driven by the volume recovery  pricing and revenue management actions and continued strong delivery of gross savings from our productivity programme  more than offsetting significant inflationary pressures  the reversal of our cost mitigation actions and a step-up in investments. All in all  operating profit (beia) is 21.6% ahead of 2019  excluding consolidation effects. Operating profit margin (beia) declined to 16.0%  35 bps below the first half of 2021  driven by consolidation changes; excluding those  operating profit margin would have remained stable.Net profit increased to ‚Ç¨1 265 million. Net profit (beia) increased 40.2% organically  driven by the growth in operating profit  lower interest and net financing expenses  and the normalisation of the effective tax rate.RAISING THE BAR ON SUSTAINABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITYWe are making steady progress against our Brew a Better World strategy  focusing on three areas: raising the bar on climate action  accelerating our social sustainability agenda and driving our brands to advance the moderate consumption of alcohol.Environmental: Path to zero impactAlong our journey to become net zero in our entire value chain by 2040  roadmaps have been developed with our largest operating companies  which account for 75% of our total emissions. In South Africa  we launched the largest solar plant in the African beer industry  reducing the brewery‚Äôs carbon impact by 30%.Regarding healthy watersheds  two new wastewater treatment plants were installed at our breweries in Serbia and Haiti. Meoqui in Mexico is our most water efficient brewery  using less than 2 litres of water for one litre of beer.Social: Path to an inclusive  fair and equitable worldCurrently  26% of our senior managers are women and we aim to increase this to at least 30% by 2025 and 40% by 2030 on the path to gender balance.The Heineken¬Æ brand revealed a new direction for its sponsorship in football  making its entire football campaign across both the men's and women's games about tackling gender bias affecting both players and fans of the sport.Responsible: Path to moderate and no harmful useHeineken¬Æ 0.0 is being introduced on draught in hundreds of pubs across the country in the UK. Through a partnership with ITV  it is now part of the UK‚Äôs two largest television soap series helping to normalise the consumption of non-alcoholic beer.We also launched a new episode of our ‚ÄòWhen You Drive  Never Drink‚Äô campaign  addressing the issue of overconfidence when drinking alcohol  with the help of F1 drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Sergio Perez.GovernanceWe have aligned our long-term incentive (LTI) policy with our sustainability ambitions by including three Brew a Better World metrics representing 25% of the total LTI: carbon emissions reduction in production  water efficiency worldwide and the percentage of women at the senior manager level.Outlook StatementsOur multi-year EverGreen strategy aims to deliver superior  balanced growth for sustainable  long-term value creation. We are encouraged by the speed and progress made so far on our key strategic programmes  and by the strong post-COVID recovery of our business.At the same time  we continue to observe a challenging global environment and an uncertain economic outlook. Whilst consumer demand in aggregate has been resilient in the first half  there is increasing risk that mounting pressure on consumer purchasing power will affect beer consumption.We expect significant inflationary pressures on our cost base and ongoing investment in our business to continue and impact the second half of 2022 and into 2023. The recent softening in some commodities is being offset by the unprecedented price levels and availability risk of natural gas  most notably affecting Europe  our biggest region. Our pricing and revenue management actions have effectively offset these inflationary pressures so far in absolute terms  and we remain committed to continuing to do so. In addition  our productivity programme continues at pace  lifting the aggregate gross savings contribution to ‚Ç¨1.7 billion by end of 2022 compared to the cost base of 2019. This will continue to offset cost pressures and enable increased investments in brand support  our digital transformation and sustainability initiatives.For 2022  we keep our outlook unchanged and expect a stable to modest sequential improvement in operating profit margin (beia) versus last year. We are changing our previous guidance for 2023. We will move from an operating profit margin objective towards delivering operating profit (beia) organic growth  in the range of a mid- to high-single digit  excluding any major unforeseen macroeconomic and political developments. Over the medium term  we reconfirm our aspiration to deliver superior  balanced growth with operating leverage over time.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactBased on the impact to date  and applying spot rates of 28 July 2022 to the 2021 financial results as a baseline for the remainder of the year  the calculated positive currency translational impact would be approximately ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in net revenue (beia)  ‚Ç¨210 million at consolidated operating profit (beia)  and ‚Ç¨140 million at net profit (beia).Interim Dividend 2022HEINEKEN's dividends are paid in the form of an interim dividend and a final dividend. The interim dividend is fixed at 40% of the total dividend of the previous year. As a result  an interim dividend of ‚Ç¨0.50 per share (2021: ‚Ç¨0.28) will be paid on 11 August 2022. The shares will trade ex-dividend on 3 August 2022.EnquiriesMedia Investors Sarah Backhouse Jos√© Federico Castillo Martinez Director of Global Communication Investor Relations Director Michael Fuchs Mark Matthews / Robin Achten Global Corporate and Financial Communications Manager Investor Relations Manager / Senior Analyst E-mail: pressoffice@heineken.com E-mail: investors@heineken.com Tel: +31-20-5239355 Tel: +31-20-5239590Investor Calendar Heineken N.V.Trading Update for Q3 2022 26 October 2022 Capital Markets Event in Amsterdam 1-2 December 2022 Full Year 2022 Results 15 February 2023Conference Call DetailsHEINEKEN will host an analyst and investor conference call in relation to its 2022 Half Year results today at 14:00 CET/ 13:00 GMT.

Under this amendment  the Member States‚Äô purchases of VLA2001  Valneva‚Äôs inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine  consist of 1.25 million doses of VLA2001 in 2022  with the option to purchase an equivalent quantity later this year for delivery in 2022.The Company expects to deliver the first vaccine doses to participating EU Member States (Germany  Austria  Denmark  Finland  and Bulgaria) in the coming weeks.About VLA2001VLA2001 is the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine which has received marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva‚Äôs established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva‚Äôs licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO¬Æ. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B¬Æ vaccine. VLA2001‚Äôs manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

HEINEKEN aims to achieve this by sharp consumer and customer orientation  leveraging its leading premium brands  developing winning consumer propositions in fast-growing segments and continuously shaping its geographic and portfolio footprint.Revenue for the first half of 2022 was 16 401 million (2021: 11 970 million). Net revenue (beia) increased 24.3% organically  driven by a 7.7% increase in total consolidated volume and a 15.6% increase in net revenue (beia) per hectolitre. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 15.3%  driven by pricing across all markets  covering input cost inflation on a euro-for-euro basis  a positive channel mix and premiumisation. Compared to 2019  total consolidated volume increased organically by 0.8% and net revenue (beia) is 14.4% ahead  excluding consolidation changes  driven by post-COVID volume recovery  growth of HEINEKEN's premium brands and the impact of inflation-led pricing.Beer volume increased 7.6% organically versus last year and came 4.2% ahead of 2019 on an organic basis. The growth was faster in the second quarter as beer volume grew 9.7%  led by strong growth in the Americas  the continued recovery of Asia Pacific and the on-trade in Europe and modest growth in the Africa  Middle East and Eastern Europe (AMEE) region. HEINEKEN gained or held market share in more than half of its markets.Beer volume 2Q22 2Q21 Organicgrowth HY22 HY21 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Heineken N.V. 70.4 59.6 9.7 % 126.9 109.9 7.6 %Premium beer volume grew by 10.2%  driving close to half of HEINEKEN's organic growth in beer volume  led by Heineken¬Æ.Heineken¬Æ continued its strong performance and grew volume by 14.6% in the second quarter to close the first half with a 13.8% increase  up 32.9% versus 2019. The brand grew double-digits in more than 50 markets  notably in Brazil  China  Vietnam  South Africa  the Netherlands  Spain  Italy  Laos and the United Arab Emirates. Heineken¬Æ Silver  now present in 22 markets  has nearly doubled its volume  driven by strong growth in Vietnam and China and its rollout across Europe and Asia. As the next step of its global roll-out  HEINEKEN introduced Heineken¬Æ Silver in Mexico this month.As per the Kantar BrandZ 2022 global survey  Heineken¬Æ was the fastest growing in 'Brand Value' among top alcohol brands  driven by its strong growth momentum  innovations and creativity. The latter was further recognised at this year's Cannes Lions  the prestigious Festival of Creativity  as the most awarded alcohol brand. The brand's most recent campaign  ""The Closer""  aims to spark conversation on work-life imbalance  with a smile. Heineken¬Æ supports inclusion in the bar and on the football field and is a proud sponsor of the UEFA Women's EURO football tournament.Heineken¬Æ volume 2Q22 Organicgrowth HY22 Organicgrowth (in mhl) Heineken N.V. 14.0 14.6% 25.9 13.8%Outlook StatementsHEINEKEN's multi-year EverGreen strategy aims to deliver superior  balanced growth for sustainable  long-term value creation. HEINEKEN is encouraged by the speed and progress made so far on its key strategic programmes  and by the strong post-COVID recovery of its business.At the same time  HEINEKEN continues to observe a challenging global environment and an uncertain economic outlook. Whilst consumer demand in aggregate has been resilient in the first half  there is increasing risk that mounting pressure on consumer purchasing power will affect beer consumption.HEINEKEN expects significant inflationary pressures on its cost base and ongoing investment in its business to continue and impact the second half of 2022 and into 2023. The recent softening in some commodities is being offset by the unprecedented price levels and availability risk of natural gas  most notably affecting Europe  our biggest region. HEINEKEN's pricing and revenue management actions have effectively offset these inflationary pressures so far in absolute terms  and HEINEKEN remains committed to continuing to do so. In addition  HEINEKEN's productivity programme continues at pace  lifting the aggregate gross savings contribution to ‚Ç¨1.7 billion by end of 2022 compared to the cost base of 2019. This will continue to offset cost pressures and enable increased investments in brand support  digital transformation and sustainability initiatives.For 2022  HEINEKEN keeps its outlook unchanged and expect a stable to modest sequential improvement in operating profit margin (beia) versus last year. HEINEKEN is changing its previous guidance for 2023. HEINEKEN will move from an operating profit margin objective towards delivering operating profit (beia) organic growth  in the range of a mid- to high-single digit  excluding any major unforeseen macroeconomic and political developments. Over the medium term  HEINEKEN reconfirms its aspiration to deliver superior  balanced growth with operating leverage over time.Translational Calculated Currency ImpactBased on the impact to date  and applying spot rates of 28 July 2022 to the 2021 financial results as a baseline for the remainder of the year  the calculated positive currency translational impact would be approximately ‚Ç¨1.5 billion in net revenue (beia)  ‚Ç¨210 million at consolidated operating profit (beia)  and ‚Ç¨140 million at net profit (beia).Interim Dividend 2022According to the Articles of Association of Heineken Holding N.V. both Heineken Holding N.V. and Heineken N.V. pay an identical dividend per share. HEINEKEN's dividends are paid in the form of an interim dividend and a final dividend. In accordance with its dividend policy  HEINEKEN fixes the interim dividend at 40% of the total dividend of the previous year. As a result  an interim dividend of ‚Ç¨0.50 per share (2021: ‚Ç¨0.28) will be paid on 11 August 2022. Both the Heineken Holding N.V. shares and the Heineken N.V. shares will trade ex-dividend on 3 August 2022.EnquiriesMedia Heineken Holding N.V.

Based on this result and the recommendation of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee  AstraZeneca has informed Innate that the study will be discontinued. There were no new safety findings. AstraZeneca plan to share the data in due course.The INTERLINK-1 study  sponsored by AstraZeneca  evaluated monalizumab in combination with cetuximab vs. cetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) who have been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitors.‚ÄúThe INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 study was intended to further evaluate a novel immunotherapy regimen following the promising signals observed in a non-randomized Phase 1b/2 study of head and neck cancer. While we are disappointed with the outcome of this study  the findings are certain to advance our understanding of the role of immunotherapy in this setting ‚Äù said Mondher Mahjoubi  Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma. ‚ÄúWe remain confident in the development program for monalizumab in lung cancer  where encouraging data has been previously reported from the randomized  Phase 2 COAST and Neo-COAST studies. Our focus for monalizumab remains on the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 study in the unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer setting  as well as the Phase 2 NeoCOAST-2 study in the neoadjuvant early-stage lung cancer setting.‚ÄùSusan Galbraith  Executive Vice President  Oncology R&D  AstraZeneca  said: ‚ÄúWe are disappointed by this outcome and what it means for patients. We would like to thank the patients  investigators and healthcare professionals who dedicated their time and expertise to this trial  which has advanced our understanding of metastatic head and neck cancer. We continue to explore the impact of monalizumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer across different trials  including the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 trial.‚ÄùMonalizumab  Innate‚Äôs lead partnered asset  is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells. It is being studied in a Phase 3 clinical study sponsored by AstraZeneca  PACIFIC-9  evaluating durvalumab (PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab or AstraZeneca‚Äôs oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy.About INTERLINK-1:INTERLINK-1 was a global  multi-center  randomized  double-blind Phase 3 study of monalizumab and cetuximab vs. placebo and cetuximab designed to enroll approximately 600 patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) who have been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitors (‚ÄúIO-pretreated‚Äù).The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) in HPV-unrelated participants  with secondary endpoints including OS in all randomized participants  progression-free survival (PFS)  overall response rate  duration of response  safety and quality of life. Additional details on the INTERLINK-1 clinical study can be found here.About monalizumab:Monalizumab is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.NKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E  cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Monalizumab may reestablish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells  and may enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies.The ongoing development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in various combination strategies in different malignancies  including  in early lung cancer  the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 study in adults with locally advanced (Stage III)  unresectable NSCLC  who have not progressed following platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy  and the Phase 2 NeoCOAST-2 study in the neoadjuvant early-stage setting of NSCLC.About the Innate-AstraZeneca monalizumab agreement:In October 2018  AstraZeneca obtained full oncology rights to monalizumab by exercising its option under the co-development and commercialization agreement initiated in 2015.The financial terms of the agreement include potential cash payments up to $1.275 billion to Innate Pharma. Including the $50 million payment triggered by dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 clinical study  Innate Pharma has received $450 million to date.For any commercialized oncology indication  AstraZeneca will book all sales revenue and will pay Innate low double-digit to mid-teen percentage royalties on net sales worldwide except in Europe where Innate Pharma will receive 50% share of the profits and losses in the territory. Innate co-fund 30% of the costs of the Phase 3 development program of monalizumab with a pre-agreed limitation of Innate‚Äôs financial commitment.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma‚Äôs broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of Natural Killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance.

Branded sales grew by circa +4.-% in the retail sector  resulting  in particular for Cassegrain  in market share gains in both volume and value  in line with the group's strategy. Food service business  mainly frozen and fresh  grew by more than 30%  exceeding the market's recovery rate  resulting in a return to a level of activity close to that of the pre-covid period.Non-Europe ZoneRevenue (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) for the non-Europe Zone in FY 2021-2022  including the canned and frozen activities in North America  represented 53.1% of total revenue  down -2.4% on a like for like* and up +1.8% on reported figures (excluding the effect of IFRS 5).In North America  the long life activities (canned and frozen)  divested on June 30  2022  posted solid growth over the financial year as a whole  driven  as in Europe  by the strong growth in the food service business in both Canada and the United States along with the resilience of the retail sector despite its normalization following the Covid 19 sanitary crisis.The ready-to-eat fresh activities of the Bonduelle Fresh Americas business unit declined significantly over the financial year. This decline is explained by significant price increases aimed at preserving margins in a particularly inflationary environment  a less dynamic market  and the cessation of sales of non-contributing ranges to certain clients  which was not offset by new clients acquisitions.In Eurasia  the brands (Bonduelle and Globus) posted growth over the financial year as a whole  despite a Q4 marked by geopolitical tensions and their impacts on consumption and inflation.HighlightsBonduelle sold 65% of Bonduelle Americas Long Life to the Fonds de solidarit√© FTQ and CDPQOn June 30  2022  the Bonduelle Group obtained the approval from U.S and Canadian regulatory authorities and the waiver of conditions precedent allowing it to finalize the agreement with the institutional investors Fonds de solidarit√© FTQ and CDPQ  for the acquisition  in equal shares between them  of 65% of Bonduelle Americas Long Life (BALL) and on the basis of an enterprise value at 100% of C$ 850 million (approximately ‚Ç¨ 625 million)  or an EBITDA multiple for 2020-2021 of 8.2x.With a revenue of C$ 989 million for financial year 2021-2022  this business activity is dedicated to the processing and marketing of canned and frozen vegetables in the United States and Canada  in the retail supermarket and food service sectors  with private labels  third party brands and own brands such as Arctic Gardens and Del Monte. This operation enables the group to continue to deploy its activities  particularly in brands  in line with its strategic priorities and its ambition of sustainable growth with positive impact. The sale  for which the net proceeds will be determined based on the financial statements as of the date of the transaction  which are currently being prepared  will be recorded in the Bonduelle Group's financial statements for the year ending June 30  2022.OutlooksBased on the development of the business in FY 2021-2022  on the one hand  and taking into account an unprecedented wave of inflation affecting all cost components  which became more pronounced towards the end of the financial year  on the other hand  and lastly  taking into account the recovery that has begun but is more difficult than expected in its North American fresh ready-to-eat business  the Bonduelle Group confirms that the expected growth in current operating margin (excluding the effect of IFRS 5) should fall short of the stated objective of 3.6% on a like for like basis* and at constant exchange rates for FY 2021-2022.The difficulties encountered by the Bonduelle Fresh Americas business unit have led the group to review its medium-term profitability prospects  which may result in the impairment of tangible and/or intangible assets and deferred tax assets of this business.* at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib. Leniolisib has been studied for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents age 12 or older in the European Economic Area (EEA). Pharming is on track and plans to submit its MAA for leniolisib to the EMA in October 2022.Accelerated assessment reduces the timeframe for the CHMP to review an MAA from 210 days to 150 days. The EMA will grant  upon request  accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation.The clinical development for leniolisib includes positive data from a Phase II/III study of the product  which met both its co-primary endpoints in the target patient population of evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The primary efficacy results demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from baseline in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) in the index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.0012) and normalization of immune dysfunction  as evidenced by increased proportion of na√Øve B cells from baseline (p<0.0001). The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of na√Øve B cells are important in patients as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers.In the study  leniolisib was generally well-tolerated  with the majority of reported adverse events in both treatment groups classified as mild. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The acceptance of an accelerated regulatory review for leniolisib underlines the high unmet need for patients with APDS  with the product potentially being the first approved treatment for this rare disease. This is an important milestone for the APDS community and for Pharming and is built on the successful Phase II/III data  which we first reported in February 2022. We remain focused on progressing leniolisib through the regulatory review process  with our MAA on track for submission in October of this year  as we seek to make this important new product available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients in Europe.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

We were able to perform very well in all our regions where local clients spending was above pre-pandemic levels  apart from Asia  where our stores were temporarily closed due to Covid restrictions. This enabled us to reach an all-time H1 sales record. This momentum  which could not have been possible without the strong commitment of our teams  confirms the relevance of our strategy focusing on brand desirability  with local marketing strategies which boost customer engagement. Over the first half  we also managed to strongly increase our profitability thanks to tireless efforts to increase full price sales. In addition  we accelerated on our CSR policy  by implementing a traceability program  and on our omnichannel ambition.

SMCP recorded a sharp performance in Europe throughout the semester  a strong momentum in the Americas  partially offset by the significant impact of the Covid restrictive measures in APAC.The Group generated stable digital sales compared to H1 2021  resulting in a digital penetration of 22%  well above the pre-pandemic level (15% in 2019).In line with our strategic plan  we continued to make strong progress on our full price strategy  notably through our deliberate reduction of the promotional sales share  and achieving a significant decrease in the discount rate  both in brick-and-mortar and digital  with -6.1 pp in H1 2022 vs. H1 2021.At the beginning of the year  SMCP finalized its brick-and-mortar network optimization plan  with 14 net closures in H1 (of which -17 in Q1 and +3 in Q2). Among these net closures  the discontinuing of the Suite 341 format in France represented eight closures.

In addition  we achieved a material decrease of discount rate by -6pp and a slight store network‚Äôs reduction as part of SMCP‚Äôs optimization strategy.In APAC  the intensifying Covid restrictions  first in Hong-Kong and then in Mainland China  had a sharp impact on sales  leading to a -24% decrease on an organic basis vs. H1 2021. These restrictive measures implemented in Mainland China led to (i) long store closures  peaking from March to May  of which a closure of an average of 25%6F7 of our physical stores during more than two months (mainly large stores  located in ‚ÄòTier 1‚Äô cities)  (ii) the complete shutdown of our brick-and-mortar and digital warehouses slowing the business: immobilizing inventory  affecting digital orders and the replenishment of the other stores  (iii) an important traffic drop. Hong-Kong SAR and Macau SAR also suffered from these restrictions leading to a drop in traffic and low tourism.The desirability of our brands remains intact in APAC  and especially in China  where we recorded an excellent Tmall ‚Äú6.18‚Äù event  with both Sandro and Maje ranking in the top 3 of Accessible Luxury.In the Americas  sales increased on an organic basis by +28.1% vs. H1 2021  a substantial growth  both vs. 2021 and vs. 2019 (+16.3% on an organic basis)  with: (i) a strong performance in all our distribution channels  fully driven by like-for-like growth (+29.8% vs.2021)  (ii) a sharp reduction of discount rate of 10 pp  coming from both digital and brick-and-mortar. Both the United States and Canada had an excellent semester  driven by high demand.Unless stated otherwise  all figures used in 2021 and 2022 to analyze the performance take into account the impact of the application of IFRS 16 and IAS 38 1KEY FIGURES (‚Ç¨m) H1 20218 H1 2022 Changeas reported Sales 453.3 565.4 +24.7% Adjusted EBITDA 98.5 121.8 +23.6% Adjusted EBIT 25.7 45.2 +75.8% Net Income Group Share 0.9 20.7 +19.7m EPS7F9 (‚Ç¨) 0.01 0.28 na Diluted EPS8F10 (‚Ç¨) 0.01 0.26 na FCF 20.2 4.9 -15.3mH1 2022 CONSOLIDATED RESULTSAdjusted EBITDA increased from ‚Ç¨98.5 million in H1 2021 to ‚Ç¨121.8 million in H1 2022. This resulted from the rise in sales combined with an increase of +2.8pp of the management gross margin (at 74.4%  thanks to SMCP‚Äôs efficient pricing policy and discipline on discount rate)  and the continuing strong cost management.Store costs9F11  as a percentage of sales  stood at 41.9%10F12  reflecting a slight increase mainly due to the channel mix (less digital)  and to a lesser extent  due to the sharp restrictions in China. SG&A3 decreased slightly to reach 21.6%4 of sales  reflecting continued strong cost management and better absorption of all main expensesAmortization  depreciation  and provisions amounted to -‚Ç¨76.7m in H1 2022 (vs. -‚Ç¨72.8m in H1 2021). Excluding IFRS 16  they represent 4.2% of sales (vs. 5.9% in H1 2021).As a result  adjusted EBIT jumped by 75.8% to ‚Ç¨45.2m in H1 2022 (from ‚Ç¨25.7m in H1 2021). An excellent performance compared to the sales growth of +24.7%. The adjusted EBIT margin gained +2.3pp at 8.0% (vs. 5.7% in H1 2021.Other non-recurring income and expenses totaled -‚Ç¨0.8m  decreasing vs. last year (-‚Ç¨4.7m in H1 2021).Financial expenses decreased to -‚Ç¨11.9m (vs. -‚Ç¨15.3m in H1 2021). This amount includes the cost of net debt of ‚Äúleases‚Äù (IFRS 16) of -‚Ç¨5.5m (vs -‚Ç¨6.6m in H1 2021). The average cost of debt stood at 1.5% in H1 2022.Income tax significantly increased to -‚Ç¨8.7m (from -‚Ç¨0.4m in H1 2021)  as a result of the strong increase in profit before tax.Resulting from all factors described above  Net income - Group share stood at a net profit of ‚Ç¨20.7m (vs. ‚Ç¨0.9m in H1 2021).H1 2022 FREE CASH FLOW AND NET FINANCIAL DEBTThe Group maintained a strict control of its investments throughout the semester  amounting to ‚Ç¨18.7m (vs. ‚Ç¨19.0m in H1 2021)  representing 3.3% of sales (vs. 4.2% in H1 2021)  a slightly lower level due to a phasing effect.Working capital increased to ‚Ç¨160.3m (from ‚Ç¨133.6m in H1 2021)  remaining stable at 14% as a percentage of sales13. This increase enabled to support the significant growth in the activity of our brands  within the framework of our demand planning policy and in the current external environment.As a result  the Group generated a Free-cash-flow of ‚Ç¨4.9m.Net financial debt stood at ‚Ç¨314.4m as of June 30  2022  a slight decrease vs. ‚Ç¨317.7m at year-end 2021. Significant reimbursements (c. ‚Ç¨70m) were performed during the semester  in line with contractual schedules. The Net financial debt/adjusted EBITDA11F14 ratio decreased to 2.1x (2.5x at year-end 2021).The Group benefits from a strong liquidity headroom including an undrawn RCF of ‚Ç¨200m.FINANCIAL OUTLOOKThe strong results in H1 2022  despite adverse external factors (war in Ukraine  continued inflation  Covid resurgences in Asia)  demonstrate once again the resilience of SMCP and the strength and desirability of its brands portfolio.Based on this performance  and provided the geopolitical situation  macro-economic context and sanitary conditions do not further deteriorate during the rest of the year  SMCP confirms its 2022 full-year guidance.MANAGEMENTJean-Baptiste Dacquin  former CEO of Claudie Pierlot  has chosen to pursue other professional projects outside SMCP. Isabelle Guichot  CEO of the SMCP group  acts as interim CEO of the Claudie Pierlot brand. The recruitment process of a new CEO for the brand is being finalized and should be announced by the autumn.A conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 6:00 p.m. (Paris time).Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.The Board of Directors met on 1st of August to approve the consolidated accounts for the first half of 2022. The limited review procedures have been completed and the related report is being issued.FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSThe Group uses certain key financial and non-financial measures to analyze the performance of its business. The principal performance indicators used include the number of its points of sale  like-for-like sales growth  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin.Number of points of sale (POS)The number of the Group‚Äôs points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly-operated stores (DOS)  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth is the total sales in a given period compared to the same period in the previous year. It is expressed as a percentage change between the two periods and is presented at constant rates (sales for period N and period N-1 in foreign currencies are converted at the average rate for year N-1) and excluding the effects of changes in the scope of consolidation.Like-for-like sales growthLike-for-like sales growth corresponds to retail sales from directly operated points of sale on a like-for-like basis in a given period compared with the same period in the previous year  expressed as a percentage change between the two periods. Like-for-like points of sale for a given period include all of the Group‚Äôs points of sale that were open at the beginning of the previous period and exclude points of sale closed during the period  including points of sale closed for renovation for more than one month  as well as points of sale that changed their activity (for example  Sandro points of sale changing from Sandro Femme to Sandro Homme or to a mixed Sandro Femme and Sandro Homme store).Like-for-like sales growth percentage is presented at constant exchange rates (sales for year N and year N-1 in foreign currencies are converted at the average N-1 rate  as presented in the annexes to the Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31 for the year N in question).Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA marginAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Group as operating income before depreciation  amortization  provisions  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBITDA is not a standardized accounting measure that meets a single generally accepted definition. It must not be considered as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flow from operating activities  or as a measure of liquidity.Adjusted EBITDA margin corresponds to adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT marginAdjusted EBIT is defined by the Group as earning before interests and taxes and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBIT corresponds to EBIT before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT divided by net sales.Management and accounting Gross marginManagement gross margin corresponds to the sales after deducting rebates and cost of sales only. The accounting gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) corresponds to the sales after deducting the rebates  the cost of sales and the commissions paid to the department stores and affiliates.Retail MarginRetail margin corresponds to the management gross margin after taking into account the points of sale‚Äôs direct expenses such as rent  personnel costs  commissions paid to the department stores and other operating costs.The table below summarizes the reconciliation of the management gross margin and the retail margin with the accounting gross margin as included in the Group‚Äôs financial statements for the following periods:(‚Ç¨m) ‚Äì excluding IFRS 16 H1 2021 H1 2022 Gross margin (as appearing in the account) 280.9 363.3 Readjustment of the commissions and other adjustments 43.7 57.6 Management Gross margin 324.6 420.9 Direct costs of point of sales -185.4 -243.0 Retail margin 139.2 177.9Net financial debtNet financial debt corresponds to current and non-current financial debt  net of cash and cash equivalents and net of current bank overdrafts.***METHODOLOGY NOTEUnless otherwise indicated  amounts are expressed in millions of euros and rounded to the first digit after the decimal point.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib. Leniolisib has been studied for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  in adults and adolescents age 12 or older in the European Economic Area (EEA). Pharming is on track and plans to submit its MAA for leniolisib to the EMA in October 2022.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.) (PRNewswire)Accelerated assessment reduces the timeframe for the CHMP to review an MAA from 210 days to 150 days. The EMA will grant  upon request  accelerated assessment of an MAA if they decide the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation.The clinical development for leniolisib includes positive data from a Phase II/III study of the product  which met both its co-primary endpoints in the target patient population of evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The primary efficacy results demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib over placebo with a statistically significant reduction from baseline in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) in the index lymphadenopathy lesions (p=0.0012) and normalization of immune dysfunction  as evidenced by increased proportion of na√Øve B cells from baseline (p<0.0001). The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of na√Øve B cells are important in patients as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers.In the study  leniolisib was generally well-tolerated  with the majority of reported adverse events in both treatment groups classified as mild. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""The acceptance of an accelerated regulatory review for leniolisib underlines the high unmet need for patients with APDS  with the product potentially being the first approved treatment for this rare disease. This is an important milestone for the APDS community and for Pharming and is built on the successful Phase II/III data  which we first reported in February 2022. We remain focused on progressing leniolisib through the regulatory review process  with our MAA on track for submission in October of this year  as we seek to make this important new product available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients in Europe.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About LeniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases. To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

This development is attributable to high freight rates in air and ocean freight as well as volume growth in the Solutions business segment.In the first half of 2022  the Logwin Group was able to benefit from the global economic catch-up effects and increased its operating result (EBITA) significantly against the background of a market characterized by capacity bottlenecks and strongly rising Inflation rates.At EUR 71.8m  the Logwin Group's operating result (EBITA) in the first half of 2022 exceeded significantly the previous year's result of EUR 36.6m. The Air + Ocean business segment made a major contribution to this extraordinary increase with a EUR 31.6 rise in its half-year operating result (EBITA) to EUR 70.3m (2021: EUR 38.7m). In the Solutions business segment  a positive one-off effect led to an increase in earnings to EUR 7.5m (2021: EUR 3.8m). At EUR 41.0m  the net result for the period was also significantly higher than the previous year's figure of EUR 27.7m. This includes an interest rate-related goodwill impairment loss of EUR 11.7m.In the first two quarters of the current year  the Logwin Group achieved a very pleasing free cash flow of EUR 42.2m (2021: EUR 13.7m) on the basis of the good earnings development. Net liquidity amounted to EUR 200.3m as of June 30  2022 and was above the level at the end of the previous year (2021: EUR 168.4m).Compared with the information provided in the Annual Financial Report 2021  the Logwin Group raised its forecast for the development of sales and earnings in 2022 in its ad hoc announcement of June 10  2022. Accordingly  the Logwin Group now expects sales and earnings development for both business segments to be at least on a par with the previous year. The extent of the increase in sales will depend to a large extent on the further development of freight rates and volumes. Based on the expected development of the operating result (EBITA)  the net result for the period is also expected to be at the level of the previous year  taking into account the impairment of goodwill.The Logwin Group's forecast remains subject to a very high degree of uncertainty due to the particular development of the market environment  in particular as a result of the global Covid 19 pandemic and developments in Ukraine.The aforementioned key performance indicators (KPIs) are an integral part of Logwin Groups system of key figures and are described and defined in the section Financial Performance Management of the management report of the Annual Financial Report 2021 (page 1 et seq.) in line with the European Securities and Markets Authoritys (ESMA) Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM) dated 5 October 2015.The Interim Financial Report as of 30 June 2022 of Logwin Group is available on the internet at:www.logwin-logistics.comAbout Logwin AGLogwin AG (Grevenmacher  Luxembourg) provides efficient logistics and transport solutions for its customers from industry and trade.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that a new diagnosis code for reporting cases of...","Implemented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the diagnosis code will accurately identify US patients with APDS  supporting care and research effortsLEIDEN  Netherlands  Aug. 2  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that a new diagnosis code for reporting cases of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  will be added to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The diagnosis code  D81.82 ‚Äí Activated Phosphoinositide 3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS)  will be effective starting October 1  2022.Pharming Group N.V. logoAnurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""By assigning this ICD-10-CM code  the CDC is formally recognizing APDS as a discrete immunological disease  and that will make a life-altering difference for people affected by the condition. By using the unique diagnostic code to identify both established and new patients with APDS  physicians will increase care options for affected individuals while helping to boost the world's understanding of the prevalence  mechanisms  and outcomes of this progressively debilitating disease. For healthcare practitioners  this milestone marks an opportunity to make a big difference by taking a simple action.""The assignment of the ICD-10-CM code will  for the first time  enable physicians and payors in the US to add a diagnosis of APDS to patients' health records  which will help connect these individuals with researchers studying the prevalence and course of the disease. In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through US health insurance plans.Caused by genetic variants affecting approximately one to two people per million  APDS causes significant lymphoproliferation and immune dysfunction  as well as an increased risk of lymphoma. There is no approved therapy for the disease and treatment is generally limited to supportive care  such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Physician and patient advocacy groups specializing in immunodeficiency disorders  along with Pharming  expect the decision to raise awareness about this rare disease.Story continuesVicki and Fred Modell  co-founders of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  commented:""We are excited that US regulatory authorities have assigned APDS an ICD-10-CM code. As a foundation dedicated to early diagnosis  meaningful treatments  and cures for primary immunodeficiency  we are aware of the physical and emotional challenges people with APDS face due to misdiagnosis of their disease. By increasing recognition of the condition  we expect the new diagnostic code to help ensure that every patient is included when it comes to the delivery of appropriate and meaningful treatments for APDS.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

8571,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4528095-vopak-dividend-yield-infrastructure-company,Vopak: A 5.5% Dividend Yield From An Infrastructure Company (OTCMKTS:VOPKF),Vopak stock is now trading at levels I never imagined. Click here for a full investment analysis and strategy.,Andr√© Muller/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionBack in April I turned positive on Vopak (OTCPK:VOPKF) as the company was trading at multi-year lows. Apparently that wasn't low enough for Mr. Market as the share price has fallen an additional 20% since. I have been writing put options and after rolling some of them to later expiry dates  I am now considering to take delivery of the shares at the next few expiry dates. The current share price of 22-23 EUR appears to be very appealing for what essentially is an infrastructure company.Yahoo FinanceAs mentioned in my previous article  Vopak is a Dutch company and its listing on Euronext Amsterdam is a better option than its OTC listing. The ticker symbol in Amsterdam is VPK  and with an average daily volume of in excess of 330 000 shares  the Amsterdam listing clearly offers the most liquid listing and on top of that  there are options available. As Vopak trades and reports in EUR  I will use the Euro as base currency throughout this article.For an overview of the company's business model and assets  I'd strongly recommend you to read my previous article.While the income statement looks bleak  the cash flows remain strongIn the first half of the current financial year  Vopak's revenue increased by approximately 10% while the other operating income increased as well  for a total revenue of 687.3M EUR. Whereas the company was able to report an operating profit of 89.4M EUR in H1 2021  it now had to record an operating loss of 265.8M EUR. The EBITDA came in at 433M EUR.Vopak Investor RelationsDid the operating performance of the company take a turn for the worse? Not really. The company recorded a 432M EUR impairment expense (up from almost 70M EUR in H1 2021) and excluding these two impairment expenses  the adjusted operating income would have been approximately 160M EUR in H1 2021 and about 166M EUR in the first half of this year. I will discuss the impairment charges into more detail later in this article.Vopak Investor RelationsThese impairment charges obviously set the tone for the entire first semester performance as the EBIT was a negative 208M EUR and the net loss came in at 321M EUR. This includes the net income attributable to minority interests at some assets and the net loss attributable to the shareholders of Vopak was 336M EUR or 2.68 EUR per share.Ouch. But keep in mind these impairment expenses are non-cash expenses. And on top of that  the total sustaining capex and lease payments tend to be lower than the depreciation and amortization expenses. That's why we should always keep an eye on the cash flow statement as well.The reported operating cash flow was 319M EUR which includes a 23M EUR tax payment. Considering the pre-tax income turned negative I will not be using the official taxes of almost 57M EUR recorded in the first half of the year. Although some impairment charges may not have been (fully) deductible  I'm sticking with the company's official version and will use the 319.1M EUR in operating cash flow as base scenario.Vopak Investor RelationsWe should however deduct the 30M EUR in lease expenses (leases + interest on leases) as well as the 40M EUR in other finance expenses and cash dividends paid to minority interests. This subsequently reduces the adjusted operating cash flow to approximately 250M EUR.Vopak still splits up the sustaining capex and growth capex and the total sustaining capex was 115M EUR (I am including the capex related to intangible assets here  but I am excluding the 50M EUR in growth capex and additional investments in joint ventures and associates). This means the H1 sustaining free cash flow was 135M EUR or approximately 1.08 EUR per share. On an annualized basis  this means the full-year sustaining free cash flow will exceed 2 EUR per share which makes the current share price of just around 11 times the sustaining FCF quite attractive.That would be too easy. Unfortunately we cannot just double the H1 free cash as Vopak's second half of the year is traditionally more capex-intense. So we should definitely expect the sustaining free cash flow to decrease in the second half of the year  and that's just normal.Explaining the impairment charges  and why I'm not too worried about the earnings profile of the companyBefore getting too excited  it's never great to see an impairment charge to the tune of half a billion Euro so I wanted to dig a bit deeper into this to make sure this is a 'realistic' impairment. Just to give another example of a 'strange' impairment: one of Europe's largest oil and gas groups recorded an impairment charge on the refinery division  which reported a record result in the second quarter. So I wanted to make sure I understood what the Vopak impairment charges were related to.There were three important elements. The smallest was a 36M EUR impairment charge in Colombia where a Vopak associate operates an FSRU. Due to the increased availability of hydropower in the country and the increasing domestic gas production  the prospects for a floating regasification platform has decreased.The two main impairment charges are related to the Europoort and Botlek assets. The company's explanation was a bit superficial in its press release  half-year report and presentation  but the management did provide a bit more clarification on the issue on the conference call.The assets were previously valued based on a 15 year useful life and discounted with an undisclosed discount rate. According to the company they didn't want to be caught off-guard if the energy transition goes faster than anticipated and the term of the remaining useful life has been reduced. This means the anticipated returns have been reduced and that caused the impairment charge so it sounds like Vopak wanted to be 'safe rather than sorry' and is already reducing the carrying value of these assets. Hard to argue with that  but keep in mind these are non-cash expenses so it is basically a 'sunk cost' that is being written off.Investment thesisIt's difficult to make full-year projections now as the sustaining capex will accelerate in the second half of the year. But as the company has been guiding for a slightly higher EBITDA  that should be trickling down to the free cash flow result as well. Last year's sustaining FCF was approximately 1.86 EUR per share for the year and I think the company can do slightly better this year and 1.92-1.96 EUR appears to be feasible based on the updated EBITDA guidance of 830-850M EUR.At the current share price of 22.63 EUR  the stock is trading at a sustaining free cash flow yield of 8.6% which is relatively high for what essentially is an infrastructure company. The market seems to be uncertain about the oil exposure but keep in mind 75% of Vopak's growth capex will go to other sectors with the industrial and gas divisions as main beneficiary.I currently have no position in Vopak other than the put options which are now in the money. But as the stock is now trading at levels I never imagined  I will likely go long in the next few weeks.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.15,0.15,0.7,True,English,"['5.5% Dividend Yield', 'Infrastructure Company', 'Vopak', 'OTCMKTS', 'VOPKF', 'full-year sustaining free cash flow', 'increasing domestic gas production', '23M EUR tax payment', 'entire first semester performance', 'half a billion Euro', '432M EUR impairment expense', '36M EUR impairment charge', 'average daily volume', 'three important elements', 'floating regasification platform', 'cash flow statement', 'operating cash flow', 'H1 free cash', 'total sustaining capex', 'other finance expenses', 'Vopak Investor Relations', 'two impairment expenses', 'other operating income', 'current share price', 'current financial year', 'Vopak impairment charges', 'operating performance', 'cash expenses', 'sustaining FCF', 'cash flows', 'cash dividends', 'gas groups', 'first half', 'income statement', 'Yahoo Finance', 'operating profit', 'operating loss', ""realistic' impairment"", ""strange' impairment"", 'amortization expenses', 'lease expenses', 'second half', '57M EUR', '319.1M EUR', '30M EUR', '40M EUR', '50M EUR', 'net income', 'pre-tax income', 'total revenue', 'growth capex', 'Andr√© Muller', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:VOPKF', 'multi-year lows', 'Mr. Market', 'expiry dates', 'ticker symbol', 'base currency', 'business model', 'negative 208M', 'net loss', 'minority interests', 'lease payments', 'official taxes', 'official version', 'base scenario', 'additional investments', 'joint ventures', 'annualized basis', 'earnings profile', 'largest oil', 'refinery division', 'record result', 'second quarter', 'increased availability', 'Vopak trades', 'Vopak associate', 'OTC listing', 'liquid listing', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'previous article', 'Amsterdam listing', 'intangible assets', 'infrastructure company', 'Dutch company', '23 EUR', '2 EUR', 'Introduction', 'April', 'put', 'options', 'delivery', 'shares', 'VPK', 'excess', 'top', 'reports', 'overview', '687.3M', '265.8M', 'EBITDA', '433M', 'turn', '70M', '160M', '166M', 'detail', 'tone', '321M', 'shareholders', 'Ouch', 'mind', 'depreciation', 'eye', '319M', 'leases', '250M', '115M', 'associates', '135M', '11 times', 'tune', 'example', 'Europe', 'Colombia', 'FSRU', 'hydropower', 'country', 'prospects', '1.08']",2022-08-02,2022-08-02,seekingalpha.com

(""Pharming"" or ""the Co‚Ä¶","Implemented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the diagnosis code will accurately identify US patients with APDS  supporting care and research effortsLEIDEN  Netherlands  Aug. 2  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that a new diagnosis code for reporting cases of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  will be added to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The diagnosis code  D81.82 ‚Äí Activated Phosphoinositide 3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS)  will be effective starting October 1  2022.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""By assigning this ICD-10-CM code  the CDC is formally recognizing APDS as a discrete immunological disease  and that will make a life-altering difference for people affected by the condition. By using the unique diagnostic code to identify both established and new patients with APDS  physicians will increase care options for affected individuals while helping to boost the world's understanding of the prevalence  mechanisms  and outcomes of this progressively debilitating disease. For healthcare practitioners  this milestone marks an opportunity to make a big difference by taking a simple action.""The assignment of the ICD-10-CM code will  for the first time  enable physicians and payors in the US to add a diagnosis of APDS to patients' health records  which will help connect these individuals with researchers studying the prevalence and course of the disease. In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through US health insurance plans.Caused by genetic variants affecting approximately one to two people per million  APDS causes significant lymphoproliferation and immune dysfunction  as well as an increased risk of lymphoma. There is no approved therapy for the disease and treatment is generally limited to supportive care  such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Physician and patient advocacy groups specializing in immunodeficiency disorders  along with Pharming  expect the decision to raise awareness about this rare disease.Vicki and Fred Modell  co-founders of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  commented:""We are excited that US regulatory authorities have assigned APDS an ICD-10-CM code. As a foundation dedicated to early diagnosis  meaningful treatments  and cures for primary immunodeficiency  we are aware of the physical and emotional challenges people with APDS face due to misdiagnosis of their disease. By increasing recognition of the condition  we expect the new diagnostic code to help ensure that every patient is included when it comes to the delivery of appropriate and meaningful treatments for APDS.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

We grew Net Sales double-digit across all three divisions and reached record-high market share in the majority of our regions.‚Äù said CEO  Gonzalve Bich. ‚ÄúWith our Horizon Plan guiding our growth strategies  we are fueling our consumer obsession and commercial excellence  bringing to market trusted brands and ingeniously simple product solutions. Equally  we continue to invest in the design and manufacturing of innovations that meet the rising demand for products that are better for the consumer  and better for our planet. With our strong in-market momentum  we will respond with agility and determination to whatever challenge comes next  continuing our progress against strategic priorities that drive accelerated profitable growth and create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.‚ÄùStory continues2022 Outlook Update (based on current market assumptions1F1)We are updating our guidance and expect to grow Full-Year Net Sales between 10% and 12% at constant currencies (previously 7%-9%)  driven by volume increase and favorable pricing. All divisions will contribute to organic growth in H2.Input cost inflation is expected to have an impact of approximately 100 million euros. Despite these inflation headwinds and higher Brand Support & OPEX aimed at fueling growth  we expect to grow FY 2022 adjusted EBIT in absolute terms  driven by higher volumes  positive pricing  and additional savings. We maintain our target of over 200 million euros in Free Cash Flow.Strong Growth Momentum in all divisionsH1 2022 Group Net Sales increased 13.7% on a comparative basis  15.5% at Constant Currencies  and 10.7% on a 12-month rolling basis2. Growth was driven by volume increase  favorable mix  and the successful implementation of price increases in all regions. All divisions and regions contributed to H1 performance. We gained or maintained market share in 80% of the countries we operate in  including in all three divisions in Europe and the US.In Human Expression  H1 Organic growth was driven by our Core Writing Instruments and Coloring segments following robust Back-to-School shipments  and efficient in-store execution. In the Northern Hemisphere (Europe  North America  and Mexico)  Back-to-School sell-in increased by almost 20% in volume and 23% in value compared to the same period last year. Countries hardest hit by the pandemic  such as Brazil  South Africa  Nigeria  and India  continued to recover in Q2  with high-double digit growth on a comparative basis  all now having recovered 2019 levels.Our added-value products (decorated and Utility Lighters  EZ Reach  and Djeep) grew 17% in value and accounted for 38% of the Flame For Life H1 Net Sales. US Lighters contributed to 51% of the division‚Äôs organic growth  boosted by distribution gains  innovation  positive price and mix (all accounting for approximately 4.5 pts of the US Lighters growth in H1)  and catch-up of orders in Q1. BIC EZ Reach reached a 5.5% market share in value  driven by increased distribution  primarily in Convenience Stores.In Blade Excellence  value-added products continued to fuel the performance of our One-Piece and Hybrid segments and grew 13% in H1. This was notably driven by the success of the BIC Soleil Escape four-blade shaver in the US  which reached a 2% share of the US women's One-Piece segment in less than six months. BIC Blade-Tech B2B business continued to gather momentum and contributed to 31% of the total Blade Excellence Year-to-Date Net Sales growth.Resilience to Input Cost Inflation Headwinds driven by favorable pricing and Net Sales operating leverageH1 2022 Gross Profit margin decreased by 2.0 points to 49.7%. The impact of input cost inflation (-5.3 pts compared to H1 2021 including Raw Materials  Air and Sea Freight and Electricity) and unfavorable FX  mostly EUR/USD hedging rate (-0.7 pts) were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption (+2.0 pts)  favorable pricing (+1.4 pts)  and the positive contribution of Inkbox (+0.3 pts). H1 2022 Adjusted EBIT increased by 22.2%  and the adjusted EBIT margin was 18.0%  almost flat compared to H1 2021. Net Sales operating leverage (+4.6 pts) more than offset the increase in Brand Support (-1.1 pts)  OPEX (-0.6 pts) and Inkbox impact (-0.9 pts).Total input cost inflation weighed 48 million euros on H1 adjusted EBIT. For the Full-Year  we expect approximately 100 million euros negative impact  which should be more than offset by volume increase  price adjustments  and additional savings  and allow us to grow adjusted Full-Year EBIT in absolute terms.Operating Cash Flow reached 275.6 million euros  fueled by strong business performance. The -175.3 million euros change in Net Current Working Capital was driven by Trade and other Receivables (-138.8M‚Ç¨)  as a result of strong Net Sales growth  and by an increase in Inventory levels (-102.1M‚Ç¨  of which 40 million euros input cost inflation from Raw Material  Freight and Electricity).H1 2022 Free Cash Flow before acquisitions and disposals was +22.4 million euros. The end of June Net Cash position was 229.9 million euros and included (58.2) million euros paid for the acquisition of Inkbox.horizon strategic plan in actionThe relentless execution of BIC's Horizon strategic plan drove our robust performance in H1  as we pursue our journey towards accelerated profitable growth.Consumer-centricity and InnovationBuilding on a rejuvenated R&D and innovation pipeline  we continue to accelerate product launches supported by effective Brand Support in all divisions. In Human Expression  Intensity Color Change  our new writing Felt Pen transforming everyday writing into a creative opportunity  was launched in most geographies. Our BIC EZ Reach Utility Pocket Lighter continued to gain distribution in all channels  a proof point of relevant innovation driving growth and creating value. In July  we launched our BIC Ecolutions Lighter in the US and France. This unique lighter was designed with 16% lower environmental impact compared to the classic BIC Maxi. It will be gradually deployed in the rest of Europe starting in September. BIC Soleil Escape  our new female razor offering a sensorial experience  was among the key drivers of year-to-date Blade Excellence's performance in the US. The BIC Bamboo shaver  with a Bamboo handle  reached 2.6% volume market share in Sweden in less than 10 months  demonstrating the consumer relevance of products with clear sustainability benefits.E-commerceE-commerce sales grew 14% in H1. Core e-commerce sales continued to be driven by the Omniretailers channel and performance in Developing Markets  with high double-digit growth in India and Brazil. Our Shaver and Lighter businesses grew double-digit  driven by North America and Brazil. In Stationery  we expect a solid Back-to-School season driven by targeted Brand Support investment.Revenue Growth ManagementWe increased our Net Sales per SKU by 25% in H1 2022  driven by Human Expression and Flame For Life momentum  coupled with a net SKU reduction of 9%  as we continue to drive complexity reduction across our portfolio.New Businesses and External GrowthExpanded Customer Base for BIC Blade-TechAdding growth and profitability to the Blade Excellence division and  more generally  to the Group  our B2B business  BIC Blade-Tech  is ramping up quickly  driven by additional orders from existing customers. We recently signed a third contract with an Asian Brand. Shipments are expected to start before the end of this year.New capabilities in Skin CreativeIn line with our Horizon strategy to pivot our Stationery business towards Human Expression and expand our Total Addressable Markets to the fast-growing Creative Expression segment  we acquired Tattly  a small  high-quality 2-4 days US based Decal company. Tattly will help diversify BIC's offer in Skin Creative  adding a recognized Decal Brand to BIC's BodyMark temporary Marker and Inkbox semi-permanent Tattoo. The Decal segment is the largest segment of the Non-permanent Skin Creative market  which is expected to reach 1.5 billion USD in 2030  growing 13% annually.Path to SustainabilityIn May 2022  we announced our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction targets for 20303  accelerating our longstanding commitment to sustainability while making GHG emissions reduction a key component of BIC's long-term strategy. In line with the Paris Agreement target requirements  we pledged to reduce 50% of our GHG emissions for Scope 1 and 100% for Scope 2 by 2030. For Scope 3  our goal is to reduce by 5% our GHG emissions by 2030  of which -30% for the Flame for Life division.At the end of June 2022  we reached more than 70% of reusable  compostable or recyclable plastic in our Consumer packaging  on track to achieve our 100% goal in 2025.In June 2022  our headquarters in Clichy (France) were relocated to a certified BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) building  thus meeting the highest requirements for environmental performance and energy consumption efficiency.Key Operational FiguresGroupin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Group Net Sales 505.7 611.4 916.7 1 127.2 Change as reported +20.7% +20.9% +18.2% +23.0% Change on a comparative basis +23.9% +9.6% +22.5% +13.7% Change on a constant currency basis +26.8% +11.6% +26.2% +15.5% EBIT Margin 20.8% 16.3% 36.3% 17.5% Adjusted EBIT Margin 20.9% 16.5% 18.1% 18.0% EPS (in euros) 1.53 1.62 5.12 3.15 Adjusted EPS (in euros) 1.55 1.78 2.51 3.39 Free Cash Flow before acquisitions and disposals 67.7 24.3 103.7 22.4 Net Cash Position 366.7 229.9 366.7 229.9Human Expressionin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Volumes in million units - - 2 742.7 3 519.5 % Change - - +11.6% +28.3% Net Sales 202.2 269.7 333.3 438.0 Change as reported +21.2% +33.4% +13.4% +31.4% Change on a comparative basis +20.1% +21.9% +12.1% +21.7% Change at constant currency +25.1% +25.4% +19.1% +25.4% Adjusted EBIT 24.2 24.1 27.6 35.6 Adjusted EBIT Margin 12.0% 9.0% 8.3% 8.1%Flame For Lifein million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Volumes in million units - - 799.3 850.1 % Change - - +35.0% +6.4% Net Sales 192.9 209.7 367.4 436.0 Change as reported +31.0% +8.7% +37.0% +18.7% Change on a comparative basis +36.9% (2.5)% +44.7% +9.3% Change at constant currency +39.4% (1.4)% +47.7% +10.1% Adjusted EBIT 80.5 79.8 145.7 166.9 Adjusted EBIT Margin 41.7% 38.0% 39.6% 38.3%Blade Excellencein million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Volumes in million units - - 1 193.0 1 212.4 % Change - - 0.7% +1.6% Net Sales 104.0 126.8 200.4 240.3 Change as reported +5.4% +22.0% (0.1)% +19.9% Change on a comparative basis +11.6% +10.0% +8.0% +11.0% Change at constant currency +11.9% +11.1% +8.4% +11.8% Adjusted EBIT 20.2 17.9 32.4 43.3 Adjusted EBIT Margin 19.4% 14.1% 16.2% 18.0%NET SALES  EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES (EBIT)  AND ADJUSTED EBITin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Net Sales 505.7 611.4 916.7 1 127.2 Gross Profit 261.8 292.6 473.9 559.8 Gross Profit margin 51.8% 47.9% 51.7% 49.7% EBITDA 131.6 124.0 382.1 247.5 EBIT 105.2 99.8 332.6 197.7 EBIT margin 20.8% 16.3% 36.3% 17.5% Non-recurring items (see details page 11) 0.3 1.3 (166.5) 5.3 Adjusted EBIT 105.6 101.1 166.1 202.9 Adjusted EBIT margin 20.9% 16.5% 18.1% 18.0%H1 2022 Gross Profit margin decreased by 2.0 points to 49.7%.

The Inkbox acquisition also impacted Net Cash.SHAREHOLDERS' REMUNERATIONIn line with our disciplined capital allocation framework  we continued our commitment to attractive shareholder returns with a balance of dividend and buybacks with:2.15 euros per share of o rdinary dividend paid in June 2022 28.8 million euros in share buybacks were completed by SOCI√âT√â BIC at the end of June 2022. 573 501 shares were purchased at an average price of 50.28 euros.OPERATIONAL TRENDS BY DIVISIONHUMAN EXPRESSIONThe Human Expression Division‚Äôs Net Sales grew 25.4% at constant currency and 21.7% on a comparative basis in H1 2022. This strong performance was driven by solid commercial execution in all geographies  with double-digit growth in Europe  Latin America  the Middle East  Africa  and India  supported by the successful implementation of price increases. In line with our Horizon goals to strengthen our presence in Creative Expression  we outperformed the strategic segment of Coloring in 5 key countries (US  UK  South Africa  Brazil and Mexico).In Europe  H1 performance was driven by both Western Europe (UK  France  Italy) and Eastern Europe (Poland  Turkey). Back-to-School sell-in was boosted by mid-single growth from both core products like the BIC Cristal and our iconic BIC 4 Color and added-value products like Coloring felt pen and pencils. We expect Back-to-School sell-out to grow mid-single digit fueled by strong commercial execution. In France  promotional activities more than doubled compared to the previous Back-to School-season  setting up to drive growth  and to outperform the market for the 16th consecutive year in one of our key Stationery markets.In the US  the Stationery market grew 3% in value8  driven by premium-priced products such as Gel. BIC gained +0.7 pts in value share fueled by core stationery products (including Mechanical Pencil and Correction). We outperformed the market successfully in key strategic segments like Coloring and Gel. The 2022 Back-to-School season is expected to be strong  with 70% of US consumers planning to shop in-store  and increasingly looking for quality and value products in the face of rising inflation.In Brazil  the market continued to rebound  growing double-digit  and we consolidated our leadership position  gaining +1.9pts versus 2020 (pre-pandemic) achieving 55.5% market share in value  thanks to efficient in-store execution. Net sales more than doubled  fueled by robust Back-to-School performance for both sell-in and sell-out and positive pricing. In Mexico  the market grew more than 40% in value9  driven by the return to schools and offices. Net Sales performance was fueled by Back-to-School sell-in with double-digit growth in both classic and added-value segments like Coloring. Cello Net Sales in India increased double-digit  boosted by a continued rebound of the market and solid double-digit growth in e-commerce.FLAME FOR LIFEThe Flame for Life Division's Net Sales grew 10.1% at constant currency and 9.3% on a comparative basis in H1 2022  driven by high-single to double-digit growth in all major regions we operate in. Sell-out performance was also robust as BIC outperformed markets in all key countries including US  France  Germany and Brazil.In the US  the Pocket lighter market declined -11.6% in volume and -4.7% in value10  however BIC continued to successfully outperform  gaining share in both volume (+ 2.4 pts) and value (+ 1.1 pts). Our added-value utility pocket lighter BIC EZ Reach continued to be successful and reached 5.5% of the total pocket lighter market in value  up 1.5 points since the start of 2022. EZ Reach growth has been driven by accelerated distribution (over 50% distribution within the first 8 months after launch) and efficient Brand Support (more than 10 billion impressions for our groundbreaking social media campaign)  contributing to the overall Lighter market expansion by bringing awareness to the Utility segment. H1 Net sales were boosted by further distribution gains  and price adjustments. In Q2  performance was softer following a strong start to the year. Added-value lighters now represent 49% of total sales in the US  up 4.5 pts versus last year.In Europe  the recovery in traditional channels  price increases  and the success of added-value products such as Djeep and Decorated lighters drove Net Sales' double-digit growth. Our Invest-to-grow countries including Germany and Turkey achieved double to triple-digit growth driven by efficient pricing and promotional actions.In Latin America  the lighter market in Brazil grew +0.8% in value  and we continue to gain market share. BIC's double-digit Net Sales growth was fueled by the continued demand for more flame usage  high barriers for imported lighters  and price increases.BLADE EXCELLENCEThe Blade Excellence Division‚Äôs Net Sales grew 11.8% at constant currency and 11.0% on a comparative basis in H1 2022. Sell-in performance was powered by added-value and new products in Europe  Latin America  and North America  in addition to the contribution of BIC Blade-Tech. We reached record high market shares in five of our key markets (Mexico  Brazil  Poland  Portugal and UK).In Europe  BIC gained market share in both France (+1.8 pts in value) and the UK (+1.3 pts in value)11 fueled by the success of 3-blade products in both female and male segments. Net Sales were notably driven by good performance and promotional activities in the UK  Poland  and Turkey. Added-value products  such as the Flex and Soleil ranges  contributed successfully to growth.In the US  the market grew 0.8% in value  and BIC kept pace. The performance of our Soleil range was fueled by the success of our new BIC Soleil Escape shaver launched earlier this year  which already reached 2.0% of market share12. In line with our Horizon goals to grow through innovative launches  Soleil Escape is one of our most successful Soleil product launches. Escape 4 and 3-blade shavers were the #1 and #2 new items in the One-Piece category year-to-date June  bringing in new buyers and contributing to the overall category expansion.In Brazil and Mexico  we pursued our successful trade-up strategy toward three blades with solid double-digit growth in both countries. In Brazil  after four years of successful share gain  we continued to outperform the market (+1.0 pts in value)13  reaching a historical record of 24% share in value  boosted by premium male and female products (Comfort 3 and Simply Soleil). In Mexico  the market was up mid-single digit in value  and we kept pace thanks to the solid performance of both Flex and Soleil ranges in the traditional channel.APPENDIX2022 MARKET ASSUMPTIONSOur 2022 outlook is based on the following market assumptions26F6F14:Market trends (in value):Europe : Low to mid-single-digit decrease in Stationery  flat to low single-digit decrease in Lighters  flat to low-single-digit decrease in ShaversNorth America: Low to mid-single-digit decrease in U.S. Stationery market Low to mid-single-digit decrease for total U.S. pocket Lighter market Slight decrease in the total U.S. one-piece Shaver marketLatin America: double-digit increase in Stationery; Low to mid-single-digit decrease in Lighters and low to mid-single-digit increase in ShaversIndia: double-digit increase in StationeryEBIT drivers:Gross Profit: Increase in volumes and prices Higher Raw Materials and Sea and Air Freight costs Slightly unfavorable FX impact (Negative USD-Euro hedging / Positive USD-MXN) Positive contribution from InkboxAdjusted EBIT: Increase in Brand Support to support Net Sales growth ‚Äì increase in R&D and OPEX to support long-term growth and innovation Additional savings Negative impact on 2022 EBIT from InkboxFree Cash Flow before Acquisitions and Disposals drivers:Approximately 100 million euros in CAPEXCurrency: 2022 USD-EUR hedging rate: 1.1750Q2 NET SALES BY GEOGRAPHYin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 % As reported % at constant currencies % On a comparative basis Group 505.7 611.4 +20.9 % +11.6 % +9.6 % Europe 166.8 190.4 +14.2 % +13.3 % +13.3 % North America 222.3 265.5 +19.4 % +5.7 % +3.2 % Latin America 67.7 95.5 +41.1 % +24.6 % +18.2 % Middle East and Africa 29.1 28.7 (1.5) % (8.0) % (8.0) % Asia and Oceania (including India) 19.8 31.3 +58.2 % +48.9 % +48.9 %H1 NET SALES BY GEOGRAPHYin million euros H1 2021 H1 2022 % As reported % at constant currencies % On a comparative basis Group 916.7 1 127.2 +23.0 % +15.5 % +13.7 % Europe 292.0 336.9 +15.4 % +15.7 % +15.7 % North America 406.4 499.0 +22.8 % +11.3 % +9.2 % Latin America 125.9 179.7 +42.8 % +29.6 % +24.0 % Middle East and Africa 51.1 57.1 +11.7 % +5.4 % +5.4 % Asia and Oceania (including India) 41.3 54.4 +31.8 % +26.0 % +26.0 %Q2 NET SALES BY DIVISIONin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 Change as reported FX impact15(in points) Change in Perimeter16(in points) Argentina impact17(in points) Change on a Comparativebasis Group 505.7 611.4 +20.9 % +9.5 +1.2 +0.6 +9.6 % Stationery- Human Expression 202.2 269.7 +33.4 % +8.2 +2.7 +0.6 +21.9 % Lighters- Flame for Life 192.9 209.7 +8.7 % +10.3 - +0.9 (2.5) % Shavers- Blade Excellence 104.0 126.8 +22.0 % +11.3 - +0.7 +10.0 % Other Products 6.6 5.2 (21.1) % - - - (21.1) %H1 NET SALES BY DIVISIONin million euros H1 2021 H12022 Change as reported FX impact(in points) Change in Perimeter(in points) Argentina impact(in points) Change on a Comparativebasis Group 916.7 1 127.2 +23.0 % +7.8 +0.9 +0.6 +13.7 % Stationery- Human Expression 333.3 438.0 +31.4 % +6.3 +2.5 +0.9 +21.7 % Lighters- Flame for Life 367.4 436.0 +18.7 % +8.8 - +0.6 +9.3 % Shavers- Blade Excellence 200.4 240.3 +19.9 % +8.4 - +0.5 +11.0 % Other Products 15.7 12.8 (18.4) % - - - (18.4) %IMPACT OF CHANGE IN PERIMETER AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON NET SALES (EXCLUDES ARS) (in %) Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Perimeter +2.2 +1.2 +3.0 +0.9 Currencies (5.5) +9.5 (7.2) +7.8 Of which USD (5.2) +6.1 (4.8) +5.2 Of which BRL (0.4) +1.3 (1.4) +1.2 Of which MXN +0.4 +0.8 (0.1) +0.6 Of which AUD +0.2 +0.1 +0.2 +0.1 Of which ZAR +0.2 +0.0 +0.0 +0.1 Of which INR (0.1) +0.2 (0.2) +0.2 Of which RUB and UAH (0.3) +0.7 (0.4) +0.3sensitivity to net sales and income before tax (ibt) of usd-euro fluctuation H1 2021 H1 2022 +/- 5% change in USD impact on Net Sales 2.2% 2.2% +/- 5% change in USD impact on IBT 0.8% 1.3%EBIT BY DIVISIONin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Group 105.2 99.8 332.6 197.7 Margin 20.8% 16.3 % 36.3% 17.5 % Stationery- Human Expression 23.9 23.3 29.1 33.5 Margin 11.8% 8.6 % 8.7% 7.7 % Lighters- Flame for Life 80.5 79.3 143.8 165.9 Margin 41.7% 37.8 % 39.2% 38.0 % Shavers- Blade Excellence 20.1 17.9 32.3 41.1 Margin 19.3% 14.1 % 16.1% 17.1 % Other Products (2.8) (1.9) (3.0) (3.8) Unallocated costs (16.5) (18.8) 130.3 (39.1)ADJUSTED EBIT BY DIVISIONin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Group 105.6 101.1 166.1 202.9 Margin 20.9% 16.5 % 18.1% 18.0 % Stationery- Human Expression 24.2 24.1 27.6 35.6 Margin 12.0% 9.0 % 8.3% 8.1 % Lighters- Flame for Life 80.5 79.8 145.7 166.9 Margin 41.7% 38.0 % 39.6% 38.3 % Shavers- Blade Excellence 20.2 17.9 32.4 43.3 Margin 19.4% 14.1 % 16.2% 18.0 % Other Products (2.8) (1.9) (3.0) (3.8) Unallocated costs (16.5) (18.8) (36.5) (39.1)Non-recurring Itemsin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Clichy Headquarters Sale Gain - - 167.7 - Pimaco divestiture gain - - 3.0 - Restructuring costs related to BIC's transformation plan.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that a new diagnosis code for reporting cases of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  will be added to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The diagnosis code  D81.82 ‚Äí Activated Phosphoinositide 3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS)  will be effective starting October 1  2022.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.) (PRNewswire)Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""By assigning this ICD-10-CM code  the CDC is formally recognizing APDS as a discrete immunological disease  and that will make a life-altering difference for people affected by the condition. By using the unique diagnostic code to identify both established and new patients with APDS  physicians will increase care options for affected individuals while helping to boost the world's understanding of the prevalence  mechanisms  and outcomes of this progressively debilitating disease. For healthcare practitioners  this milestone marks an opportunity to make a big difference by taking a simple action.""The assignment of the ICD-10-CM code will  for the first time  enable physicians and payors in the US to add a diagnosis of APDS to patients' health records  which will help connect these individuals with researchers studying the prevalence and course of the disease. In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through US health insurance plans.Caused by genetic variants affecting approximately one to two people per million  APDS causes significant lymphoproliferation and immune dysfunction  as well as an increased risk of lymphoma. There is no approved therapy for the disease and treatment is generally limited to supportive care  such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Physician and patient advocacy groups specializing in immunodeficiency disorders  along with Pharming  expect the decision to raise awareness about this rare disease.Vicki and Fred Modell  co-founders of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  commented:""We are excited that US regulatory authorities have assigned APDS an ICD-10-CM code. As a foundation dedicated to early diagnosis  meaningful treatments  and cures for primary immunodeficiency  we are aware of the physical and emotional challenges people with APDS face due to misdiagnosis of their disease. By increasing recognition of the condition  we expect the new diagnostic code to help ensure that every patient is included when it comes to the delivery of appropriate and meaningful treatments for APDS.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

PARIS  Aug 2 (Reuters) - Euronext wheat turned higher on Tuesday after slipping to a one-week low as a drop in the euro and an import tender held by Algeria put attention back on strong export prospects for EU wheat.,PARIS  Aug 2 (Reuters) - Euronext wheat turned higher on Tuesday after slipping to a one-week low as a drop in the euro and an import tender held by Algeria put attention back on strong export prospects for EU wheat.Wheat futures had come under pressure after the first grain ship left Ukraine's Odesa port on Monday under a safe-passage agreement  tempering global supply concerns.However  a sharp fall in the euro against the dollar EUR= and expectations that Algeria's tender will yield more sales for European Union wheat helped Euronext recover in afternoon trading  diverging from a weaker trend in Chicago. GRA/December milling wheat BL2Z2 on Paris-based Euronext settled up 0.3% at 326.50 euros ($332.83) a tonne  after earlier falling to a one-week low at 321.25 euros.Algeria was thought to have started buying wheat in its tender at around $384 a tonne  cost and freight (c&f) included  although the initial volume was unclear  traders said.The bounce on Euronext suggested exporters had hedged initial sales in the tender and were planning to source the wheat from France or elsewhere in the European Union  traders added.A reported purchase of 60 000 tonnes by Jordan and a tender called by Tunisia for Wednesday also contributed to the renewed focus on export demand. GRA/TENDWeekly EU data showed the bloc exported 1.77 million tonnes of soft wheat in July  the first month of the 2022/23 season  up from 1.57 million a year earlier.However  traders saw the official data as lagging the actual pace of ship loadings  particularly after a brisk July export programme in France. FRWHEAT/PORTSWorsening conditions for EU maize  with French crops facing another heatwave this week  was also fuelling concern that cereal supply in Europe may be stretched.Traders were also watching to see to whether the initial grain shipment from Odesa would herald a significant upturn in flows from war-torn Ukraine.In Germany  the 2022 winter wheat harvest is expected to increase about 1% on the year to 21.38 million tonnes  with harvesting approaching completion in many regions  the association of German farmers said.‚ÄúIt appears that this summer‚Äôs heatwave did not cause the stress to German wheat as seen in some other EU countries and we are on course for a decent-sized harvest ‚Äù a German trader said.($1 = 0.9810 euros)(Reporting by Gus Trompiz in Paris and Michael Hogan in Hamburg; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)((gus.trompiz@thomsonreuters.com; +33 1 49 49 52 18; Reuters Messaging: gus.trompiz.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq  Inc.,neutral,0.05,0.89,0.06,mixed,0.07,0.26,0.67,True,English,"['EU wheat steadies', 'Algeria tender', 'focus', 'exports', 'December milling wheat BL2Z2', 'GRA/TEND Weekly EU data', 'brisk July export programme', 'strong export prospects', 'other EU countries', 'global supply concerns', 'initial grain shipment', 'first grain ship', '2022 winter wheat harvest', 'European Union wheat', 'export demand', 'official data', 'EU wheat', 'EU maize', 'first month', 'ship loadings', 'cereal supply', 'decent-sized harvest', 'initial volume', 'Wheat futures', 'soft wheat', 'German wheat', 'safe-passage agreement', 'sharp fall', 'afternoon trading', 'weaker trend', '2022/23 season', 'actual pace', 'Worsening conditions', 'French crops', 'significant upturn', 'many regions', 'German farmers', 'German trader', 'Michael Hogan', 'Lisa Shumaker', 'initial sales', 'Euronext wheat', '1.77 million tonnes', '21.38 million tonnes', 'Odesa port', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'war-torn Ukraine', 'Gus Trompiz', 'Reuters Messaging', 'import tender', '60,000 tonnes', 'Aug', 'Tuesday', 'drop', 'Algeria', 'attention', 'pressure', 'Monday', 'dollar', 'expectations', 'Chicago', '326.50 euros', 'one-week', '321.25 euros', 'cost', 'freight', 'traders', 'bounce', 'exporters', 'France', 'purchase', 'Jordan', 'Tunisia', 'Wednesday', 'focus', 'bloc', 'FRWHEAT/PORTS', 'heatwave', 'flows', 'Germany', 'year', 'harvesting', 'completion', 'association', 'stress', 'course', '0.9810 euros', 'Hamburg', 'Editing', 'thomsonreuters', 'views', 'opinions', 'author', 'Nasdaq', 'Inc']",2022-08-02,2022-08-02,nasdaq.com

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and the University of Washington (UW)  Seattle  announced a multi-year research collaboration today on ConformalFLASH¬Æ1 Proton Therapy.,IBA SALouvain-la-Neuve  Belgium  August 2  2022  IBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.  EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology  Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and the University of Washington (UW)  Seattle  announced a multi-year research collaboration today on ConformalFLASH¬Æ1 Proton Therapy. Under this collaboration  IBA will equip the proton therapy system and the proton gantry treatment room at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center with ConformalFLASH¬Æ research functionality  which will enable preclinical research on FLASH therapy. In the future this could lead to a new clinical functionality for patients.Radiation therapy has advanced drastically in the last few decades because of continued technological innovation  allowing for safer and more accurate methods to treat a comprehensive range of solid tumors. FLASH radiation  defined as the delivery of radiation at ultra-high dose rates (40-60Gy/s)  has been shown to spare to normal tissue toxicity while maintaining an equivalent anti-tumor efficacy2 3. FLASH is expected to dramatically change the landscape of radiotherapy and patient cancer care by enhancing the therapeutic window with less toxicity  allowing shorter treatment times and potential for dose escalation on radioresistant tumors for improved tumor control. IBA's ConformalFLASH¬Æ approach combines the biological sparing effects of FLASH with the use of the spatial selectivity of the Proton Bragg peak.As part of this collaboration  UW School of Medicine scientists will lead a comprehensive bench-to-bedside program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center to analyze FLASH‚ÄêRadiotherapy (FLASH-RT) in pre‚Äêclinical models to optimally deployed FLASH-RT for cancer patients. The focus would be to evaluate the optimal physical parameters for proton FLASH irradiation  including Pencil Beam Scanning (PBS) FLASH dose rates and FLASH effects in the Spread-Out Bragg Peak (SOBP).Swati Girdhani  Director  Research Collaborations at IBA  said: ‚ÄúIn the last few years  IBA has been working closely with customers to support innovation  leading to breakthrough technologies like ConformalFLASH¬Æ. In this era of value-centered medicine  ConformalFLASH¬Æ has the potential to advance radiotherapy towards increased use of ultra-hypofractionation while significantly improving the therapeutic index. We are delighted to be working with the University of Washington  one of the leading centers for research in the United States to bring ConformalFLASH¬Æ technology to patients.‚ÄùStory continues*** Ends ***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.
