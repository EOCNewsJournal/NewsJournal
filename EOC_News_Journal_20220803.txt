In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through US health insurance plans.Caused by genetic variants affecting approximately one to two people per million  APDS causes significant lymphoproliferation and immune dysfunction  as well as an increased risk of lymphoma. There is no approved therapy for the disease and treatment is generally limited to supportive care  such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Physician and patient advocacy groups specializing in immunodeficiency disorders  along with Pharming  expect the decision to raise awareness about this rare disease.Story continuesVicki and Fred Modell  co-founders of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  commented:""We are excited that US regulatory authorities have assigned APDS an ICD-10-CM code. As a foundation dedicated to early diagnosis  meaningful treatments  and cures for primary immunodeficiency  we are aware of the physical and emotional challenges people with APDS face due to misdiagnosis of their disease. By increasing recognition of the condition  we expect the new diagnostic code to help ensure that every patient is included when it comes to the delivery of appropriate and meaningful treatments for APDS.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

8571,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4528095-vopak-dividend-yield-infrastructure-company,Vopak: A 5.5% Dividend Yield From An Infrastructure Company (OTCMKTS:VOPKF),Vopak stock is now trading at levels I never imagined. Click here for a full investment analysis and strategy.,André Muller/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionBack in April I turned positive on Vopak (OTCPK:VOPKF) as the company was trading at multi-year lows. Apparently that wasn't low enough for Mr. Market as the share price has fallen an additional 20% since. I have been writing put options and after rolling some of them to later expiry dates  I am now considering to take delivery of the shares at the next few expiry dates. The current share price of 22-23 EUR appears to be very appealing for what essentially is an infrastructure company.Yahoo FinanceAs mentioned in my previous article  Vopak is a Dutch company and its listing on Euronext Amsterdam is a better option than its OTC listing. The ticker symbol in Amsterdam is VPK  and with an average daily volume of in excess of 330 000 shares  the Amsterdam listing clearly offers the most liquid listing and on top of that  there are options available. As Vopak trades and reports in EUR  I will use the Euro as base currency throughout this article.For an overview of the company's business model and assets  I'd strongly recommend you to read my previous article.While the income statement looks bleak  the cash flows remain strongIn the first half of the current financial year  Vopak's revenue increased by approximately 10% while the other operating income increased as well  for a total revenue of 687.3M EUR. Whereas the company was able to report an operating profit of 89.4M EUR in H1 2021  it now had to record an operating loss of 265.8M EUR. The EBITDA came in at 433M EUR.Vopak Investor RelationsDid the operating performance of the company take a turn for the worse? Not really. The company recorded a 432M EUR impairment expense (up from almost 70M EUR in H1 2021) and excluding these two impairment expenses  the adjusted operating income would have been approximately 160M EUR in H1 2021 and about 166M EUR in the first half of this year. I will discuss the impairment charges into more detail later in this article.Vopak Investor RelationsThese impairment charges obviously set the tone for the entire first semester performance as the EBIT was a negative 208M EUR and the net loss came in at 321M EUR. This includes the net income attributable to minority interests at some assets and the net loss attributable to the shareholders of Vopak was 336M EUR or 2.68 EUR per share.Ouch. But keep in mind these impairment expenses are non-cash expenses. And on top of that  the total sustaining capex and lease payments tend to be lower than the depreciation and amortization expenses. That's why we should always keep an eye on the cash flow statement as well.The reported operating cash flow was 319M EUR which includes a 23M EUR tax payment. Considering the pre-tax income turned negative I will not be using the official taxes of almost 57M EUR recorded in the first half of the year. Although some impairment charges may not have been (fully) deductible  I'm sticking with the company's official version and will use the 319.1M EUR in operating cash flow as base scenario.Vopak Investor RelationsWe should however deduct the 30M EUR in lease expenses (leases + interest on leases) as well as the 40M EUR in other finance expenses and cash dividends paid to minority interests. This subsequently reduces the adjusted operating cash flow to approximately 250M EUR.Vopak still splits up the sustaining capex and growth capex and the total sustaining capex was 115M EUR (I am including the capex related to intangible assets here  but I am excluding the 50M EUR in growth capex and additional investments in joint ventures and associates). This means the H1 sustaining free cash flow was 135M EUR or approximately 1.08 EUR per share. On an annualized basis  this means the full-year sustaining free cash flow will exceed 2 EUR per share which makes the current share price of just around 11 times the sustaining FCF quite attractive.That would be too easy. Unfortunately we cannot just double the H1 free cash as Vopak's second half of the year is traditionally more capex-intense. So we should definitely expect the sustaining free cash flow to decrease in the second half of the year  and that's just normal.Explaining the impairment charges  and why I'm not too worried about the earnings profile of the companyBefore getting too excited  it's never great to see an impairment charge to the tune of half a billion Euro so I wanted to dig a bit deeper into this to make sure this is a 'realistic' impairment. Just to give another example of a 'strange' impairment: one of Europe's largest oil and gas groups recorded an impairment charge on the refinery division  which reported a record result in the second quarter. So I wanted to make sure I understood what the Vopak impairment charges were related to.There were three important elements. The smallest was a 36M EUR impairment charge in Colombia where a Vopak associate operates an FSRU. Due to the increased availability of hydropower in the country and the increasing domestic gas production  the prospects for a floating regasification platform has decreased.The two main impairment charges are related to the Europoort and Botlek assets. The company's explanation was a bit superficial in its press release  half-year report and presentation  but the management did provide a bit more clarification on the issue on the conference call.The assets were previously valued based on a 15 year useful life and discounted with an undisclosed discount rate. According to the company they didn't want to be caught off-guard if the energy transition goes faster than anticipated and the term of the remaining useful life has been reduced. This means the anticipated returns have been reduced and that caused the impairment charge so it sounds like Vopak wanted to be 'safe rather than sorry' and is already reducing the carrying value of these assets. Hard to argue with that  but keep in mind these are non-cash expenses so it is basically a 'sunk cost' that is being written off.Investment thesisIt's difficult to make full-year projections now as the sustaining capex will accelerate in the second half of the year. But as the company has been guiding for a slightly higher EBITDA  that should be trickling down to the free cash flow result as well. Last year's sustaining FCF was approximately 1.86 EUR per share for the year and I think the company can do slightly better this year and 1.92-1.96 EUR appears to be feasible based on the updated EBITDA guidance of 830-850M EUR.At the current share price of 22.63 EUR  the stock is trading at a sustaining free cash flow yield of 8.6% which is relatively high for what essentially is an infrastructure company.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Co…","Implemented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the diagnosis code will accurately identify US patients with APDS  supporting care and research effortsLEIDEN  Netherlands  Aug. 2  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that a new diagnosis code for reporting cases of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  will be added to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The diagnosis code  D81.82 ‒ Activated Phosphoinositide 3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS)  will be effective starting October 1  2022.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""By assigning this ICD-10-CM code  the CDC is formally recognizing APDS as a discrete immunological disease  and that will make a life-altering difference for people affected by the condition. By using the unique diagnostic code to identify both established and new patients with APDS  physicians will increase care options for affected individuals while helping to boost the world's understanding of the prevalence  mechanisms  and outcomes of this progressively debilitating disease. For healthcare practitioners  this milestone marks an opportunity to make a big difference by taking a simple action.""The assignment of the ICD-10-CM code will  for the first time  enable physicians and payors in the US to add a diagnosis of APDS to patients' health records  which will help connect these individuals with researchers studying the prevalence and course of the disease. In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through US health insurance plans.Caused by genetic variants affecting approximately one to two people per million  APDS causes significant lymphoproliferation and immune dysfunction  as well as an increased risk of lymphoma. There is no approved therapy for the disease and treatment is generally limited to supportive care  such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Physician and patient advocacy groups specializing in immunodeficiency disorders  along with Pharming  expect the decision to raise awareness about this rare disease.Vicki and Fred Modell  co-founders of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  commented:""We are excited that US regulatory authorities have assigned APDS an ICD-10-CM code. As a foundation dedicated to early diagnosis  meaningful treatments  and cures for primary immunodeficiency  we are aware of the physical and emotional challenges people with APDS face due to misdiagnosis of their disease. By increasing recognition of the condition  we expect the new diagnostic code to help ensure that every patient is included when it comes to the delivery of appropriate and meaningful treatments for APDS.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) is a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients with rare  debilitating  and life-threatening diseases.

Equally  we continue to invest in the design and manufacturing of innovations that meet the rising demand for products that are better for the consumer  and better for our planet. With our strong in-market momentum  we will respond with agility and determination to whatever challenge comes next  continuing our progress against strategic priorities that drive accelerated profitable growth and create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.”Story continues2022 Outlook Update (based on current market assumptions1F1)We are updating our guidance and expect to grow Full-Year Net Sales between 10% and 12% at constant currencies (previously 7%-9%)  driven by volume increase and favorable pricing. All divisions will contribute to organic growth in H2.Input cost inflation is expected to have an impact of approximately 100 million euros. Despite these inflation headwinds and higher Brand Support & OPEX aimed at fueling growth  we expect to grow FY 2022 adjusted EBIT in absolute terms  driven by higher volumes  positive pricing  and additional savings. We maintain our target of over 200 million euros in Free Cash Flow.Strong Growth Momentum in all divisionsH1 2022 Group Net Sales increased 13.7% on a comparative basis  15.5% at Constant Currencies  and 10.7% on a 12-month rolling basis2. Growth was driven by volume increase  favorable mix  and the successful implementation of price increases in all regions. All divisions and regions contributed to H1 performance. We gained or maintained market share in 80% of the countries we operate in  including in all three divisions in Europe and the US.In Human Expression  H1 Organic growth was driven by our Core Writing Instruments and Coloring segments following robust Back-to-School shipments  and efficient in-store execution. In the Northern Hemisphere (Europe  North America  and Mexico)  Back-to-School sell-in increased by almost 20% in volume and 23% in value compared to the same period last year. Countries hardest hit by the pandemic  such as Brazil  South Africa  Nigeria  and India  continued to recover in Q2  with high-double digit growth on a comparative basis  all now having recovered 2019 levels.Our added-value products (decorated and Utility Lighters  EZ Reach  and Djeep) grew 17% in value and accounted for 38% of the Flame For Life H1 Net Sales. US Lighters contributed to 51% of the division’s organic growth  boosted by distribution gains  innovation  positive price and mix (all accounting for approximately 4.5 pts of the US Lighters growth in H1)  and catch-up of orders in Q1. BIC EZ Reach reached a 5.5% market share in value  driven by increased distribution  primarily in Convenience Stores.In Blade Excellence  value-added products continued to fuel the performance of our One-Piece and Hybrid segments and grew 13% in H1. This was notably driven by the success of the BIC Soleil Escape four-blade shaver in the US  which reached a 2% share of the US women's One-Piece segment in less than six months. BIC Blade-Tech B2B business continued to gather momentum and contributed to 31% of the total Blade Excellence Year-to-Date Net Sales growth.Resilience to Input Cost Inflation Headwinds driven by favorable pricing and Net Sales operating leverageH1 2022 Gross Profit margin decreased by 2.0 points to 49.7%. The impact of input cost inflation (-5.3 pts compared to H1 2021 including Raw Materials  Air and Sea Freight and Electricity) and unfavorable FX  mostly EUR/USD hedging rate (-0.7 pts) were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption (+2.0 pts)  favorable pricing (+1.4 pts)  and the positive contribution of Inkbox (+0.3 pts). H1 2022 Adjusted EBIT increased by 22.2%  and the adjusted EBIT margin was 18.0%  almost flat compared to H1 2021. Net Sales operating leverage (+4.6 pts) more than offset the increase in Brand Support (-1.1 pts)  OPEX (-0.6 pts) and Inkbox impact (-0.9 pts).Total input cost inflation weighed 48 million euros on H1 adjusted EBIT. For the Full-Year  we expect approximately 100 million euros negative impact  which should be more than offset by volume increase  price adjustments  and additional savings  and allow us to grow adjusted Full-Year EBIT in absolute terms.Operating Cash Flow reached 275.6 million euros  fueled by strong business performance. The -175.3 million euros change in Net Current Working Capital was driven by Trade and other Receivables (-138.8M€)  as a result of strong Net Sales growth  and by an increase in Inventory levels (-102.1M€  of which 40 million euros input cost inflation from Raw Material  Freight and Electricity).H1 2022 Free Cash Flow before acquisitions and disposals was +22.4 million euros. The end of June Net Cash position was 229.9 million euros and included (58.2) million euros paid for the acquisition of Inkbox.horizon strategic plan in actionThe relentless execution of BIC's Horizon strategic plan drove our robust performance in H1  as we pursue our journey towards accelerated profitable growth.Consumer-centricity and InnovationBuilding on a rejuvenated R&D and innovation pipeline  we continue to accelerate product launches supported by effective Brand Support in all divisions. In Human Expression  Intensity Color Change  our new writing Felt Pen transforming everyday writing into a creative opportunity  was launched in most geographies. Our BIC EZ Reach Utility Pocket Lighter continued to gain distribution in all channels  a proof point of relevant innovation driving growth and creating value. In July  we launched our BIC Ecolutions Lighter in the US and France. This unique lighter was designed with 16% lower environmental impact compared to the classic BIC Maxi. It will be gradually deployed in the rest of Europe starting in September. BIC Soleil Escape  our new female razor offering a sensorial experience  was among the key drivers of year-to-date Blade Excellence's performance in the US. The BIC Bamboo shaver  with a Bamboo handle  reached 2.6% volume market share in Sweden in less than 10 months  demonstrating the consumer relevance of products with clear sustainability benefits.E-commerceE-commerce sales grew 14% in H1. Core e-commerce sales continued to be driven by the Omniretailers channel and performance in Developing Markets  with high double-digit growth in India and Brazil. Our Shaver and Lighter businesses grew double-digit  driven by North America and Brazil. In Stationery  we expect a solid Back-to-School season driven by targeted Brand Support investment.Revenue Growth ManagementWe increased our Net Sales per SKU by 25% in H1 2022  driven by Human Expression and Flame For Life momentum  coupled with a net SKU reduction of 9%  as we continue to drive complexity reduction across our portfolio.New Businesses and External GrowthExpanded Customer Base for BIC Blade-TechAdding growth and profitability to the Blade Excellence division and  more generally  to the Group  our B2B business  BIC Blade-Tech  is ramping up quickly  driven by additional orders from existing customers. We recently signed a third contract with an Asian Brand. Shipments are expected to start before the end of this year.New capabilities in Skin CreativeIn line with our Horizon strategy to pivot our Stationery business towards Human Expression and expand our Total Addressable Markets to the fast-growing Creative Expression segment  we acquired Tattly  a small  high-quality 2-4 days US based Decal company. Tattly will help diversify BIC's offer in Skin Creative  adding a recognized Decal Brand to BIC's BodyMark temporary Marker and Inkbox semi-permanent Tattoo. The Decal segment is the largest segment of the Non-permanent Skin Creative market  which is expected to reach 1.5 billion USD in 2030  growing 13% annually.Path to SustainabilityIn May 2022  we announced our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction targets for 20303  accelerating our longstanding commitment to sustainability while making GHG emissions reduction a key component of BIC's long-term strategy. In line with the Paris Agreement target requirements  we pledged to reduce 50% of our GHG emissions for Scope 1 and 100% for Scope 2 by 2030. For Scope 3  our goal is to reduce by 5% our GHG emissions by 2030  of which -30% for the Flame for Life division.At the end of June 2022  we reached more than 70% of reusable  compostable or recyclable plastic in our Consumer packaging  on track to achieve our 100% goal in 2025.In June 2022  our headquarters in Clichy (France) were relocated to a certified BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) building  thus meeting the highest requirements for environmental performance and energy consumption efficiency.Key Operational FiguresGroupin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Group Net Sales 505.7 611.4 916.7 1 127.2 Change as reported +20.7% +20.9% +18.2% +23.0% Change on a comparative basis +23.9% +9.6% +22.5% +13.7% Change on a constant currency basis +26.8% +11.6% +26.2% +15.5% EBIT Margin 20.8% 16.3% 36.3% 17.5% Adjusted EBIT Margin 20.9% 16.5% 18.1% 18.0% EPS (in euros) 1.53 1.62 5.12 3.15 Adjusted EPS (in euros) 1.55 1.78 2.51 3.39 Free Cash Flow before acquisitions and disposals 67.7 24.3 103.7 22.4 Net Cash Position 366.7 229.9 366.7 229.9Human Expressionin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Volumes in million units - - 2 742.7 3 519.5 % Change - - +11.6% +28.3% Net Sales 202.2 269.7 333.3 438.0 Change as reported +21.2% +33.4% +13.4% +31.4% Change on a comparative basis +20.1% +21.9% +12.1% +21.7% Change at constant currency +25.1% +25.4% +19.1% +25.4% Adjusted EBIT 24.2 24.1 27.6 35.6 Adjusted EBIT Margin 12.0% 9.0% 8.3% 8.1%Flame For Lifein million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Volumes in million units - - 799.3 850.1 % Change - - +35.0% +6.4% Net Sales 192.9 209.7 367.4 436.0 Change as reported +31.0% +8.7% +37.0% +18.7% Change on a comparative basis +36.9% (2.5)% +44.7% +9.3% Change at constant currency +39.4% (1.4)% +47.7% +10.1% Adjusted EBIT 80.5 79.8 145.7 166.9 Adjusted EBIT Margin 41.7% 38.0% 39.6% 38.3%Blade Excellencein million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Volumes in million units - - 1 193.0 1 212.4 % Change - - 0.7% +1.6% Net Sales 104.0 126.8 200.4 240.3 Change as reported +5.4% +22.0% (0.1)% +19.9% Change on a comparative basis +11.6% +10.0% +8.0% +11.0% Change at constant currency +11.9% +11.1% +8.4% +11.8% Adjusted EBIT 20.2 17.9 32.4 43.3 Adjusted EBIT Margin 19.4% 14.1% 16.2% 18.0%NET SALES  EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES (EBIT)  AND ADJUSTED EBITin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Net Sales 505.7 611.4 916.7 1 127.2 Gross Profit 261.8 292.6 473.9 559.8 Gross Profit margin 51.8% 47.9% 51.7% 49.7% EBITDA 131.6 124.0 382.1 247.5 EBIT 105.2 99.8 332.6 197.7 EBIT margin 20.8% 16.3% 36.3% 17.5% Non-recurring items (see details page 11) 0.3 1.3 (166.5) 5.3 Adjusted EBIT 105.6 101.1 166.1 202.9 Adjusted EBIT margin 20.9% 16.5% 18.1% 18.0%H1 2022 Gross Profit margin decreased by 2.0 points to 49.7%.

The Inkbox acquisition also impacted Net Cash.SHAREHOLDERS' REMUNERATIONIn line with our disciplined capital allocation framework  we continued our commitment to attractive shareholder returns with a balance of dividend and buybacks with:2.15 euros per share of o rdinary dividend paid in June 2022 28.8 million euros in share buybacks were completed by SOCIÉTÉ BIC at the end of June 2022. 573 501 shares were purchased at an average price of 50.28 euros.OPERATIONAL TRENDS BY DIVISIONHUMAN EXPRESSIONThe Human Expression Division’s Net Sales grew 25.4% at constant currency and 21.7% on a comparative basis in H1 2022. This strong performance was driven by solid commercial execution in all geographies  with double-digit growth in Europe  Latin America  the Middle East  Africa  and India  supported by the successful implementation of price increases. In line with our Horizon goals to strengthen our presence in Creative Expression  we outperformed the strategic segment of Coloring in 5 key countries (US  UK  South Africa  Brazil and Mexico).In Europe  H1 performance was driven by both Western Europe (UK  France  Italy) and Eastern Europe (Poland  Turkey). Back-to-School sell-in was boosted by mid-single growth from both core products like the BIC Cristal and our iconic BIC 4 Color and added-value products like Coloring felt pen and pencils. We expect Back-to-School sell-out to grow mid-single digit fueled by strong commercial execution. In France  promotional activities more than doubled compared to the previous Back-to School-season  setting up to drive growth  and to outperform the market for the 16th consecutive year in one of our key Stationery markets.In the US  the Stationery market grew 3% in value8  driven by premium-priced products such as Gel. BIC gained +0.7 pts in value share fueled by core stationery products (including Mechanical Pencil and Correction). We outperformed the market successfully in key strategic segments like Coloring and Gel. The 2022 Back-to-School season is expected to be strong  with 70% of US consumers planning to shop in-store  and increasingly looking for quality and value products in the face of rising inflation.In Brazil  the market continued to rebound  growing double-digit  and we consolidated our leadership position  gaining +1.9pts versus 2020 (pre-pandemic) achieving 55.5% market share in value  thanks to efficient in-store execution. Net sales more than doubled  fueled by robust Back-to-School performance for both sell-in and sell-out and positive pricing. In Mexico  the market grew more than 40% in value9  driven by the return to schools and offices. Net Sales performance was fueled by Back-to-School sell-in with double-digit growth in both classic and added-value segments like Coloring. Cello Net Sales in India increased double-digit  boosted by a continued rebound of the market and solid double-digit growth in e-commerce.FLAME FOR LIFEThe Flame for Life Division's Net Sales grew 10.1% at constant currency and 9.3% on a comparative basis in H1 2022  driven by high-single to double-digit growth in all major regions we operate in. Sell-out performance was also robust as BIC outperformed markets in all key countries including US  France  Germany and Brazil.In the US  the Pocket lighter market declined -11.6% in volume and -4.7% in value10  however BIC continued to successfully outperform  gaining share in both volume (+ 2.4 pts) and value (+ 1.1 pts). Our added-value utility pocket lighter BIC EZ Reach continued to be successful and reached 5.5% of the total pocket lighter market in value  up 1.5 points since the start of 2022. EZ Reach growth has been driven by accelerated distribution (over 50% distribution within the first 8 months after launch) and efficient Brand Support (more than 10 billion impressions for our groundbreaking social media campaign)  contributing to the overall Lighter market expansion by bringing awareness to the Utility segment. H1 Net sales were boosted by further distribution gains  and price adjustments. In Q2  performance was softer following a strong start to the year. Added-value lighters now represent 49% of total sales in the US  up 4.5 pts versus last year.In Europe  the recovery in traditional channels  price increases  and the success of added-value products such as Djeep and Decorated lighters drove Net Sales' double-digit growth. Our Invest-to-grow countries including Germany and Turkey achieved double to triple-digit growth driven by efficient pricing and promotional actions.In Latin America  the lighter market in Brazil grew +0.8% in value  and we continue to gain market share. BIC's double-digit Net Sales growth was fueled by the continued demand for more flame usage  high barriers for imported lighters  and price increases.BLADE EXCELLENCEThe Blade Excellence Division’s Net Sales grew 11.8% at constant currency and 11.0% on a comparative basis in H1 2022. Sell-in performance was powered by added-value and new products in Europe  Latin America  and North America  in addition to the contribution of BIC Blade-Tech. We reached record high market shares in five of our key markets (Mexico  Brazil  Poland  Portugal and UK).In Europe  BIC gained market share in both France (+1.8 pts in value) and the UK (+1.3 pts in value)11 fueled by the success of 3-blade products in both female and male segments. Net Sales were notably driven by good performance and promotional activities in the UK  Poland  and Turkey. Added-value products  such as the Flex and Soleil ranges  contributed successfully to growth.In the US  the market grew 0.8% in value  and BIC kept pace. The performance of our Soleil range was fueled by the success of our new BIC Soleil Escape shaver launched earlier this year  which already reached 2.0% of market share12. In line with our Horizon goals to grow through innovative launches  Soleil Escape is one of our most successful Soleil product launches. Escape 4 and 3-blade shavers were the #1 and #2 new items in the One-Piece category year-to-date June  bringing in new buyers and contributing to the overall category expansion.In Brazil and Mexico  we pursued our successful trade-up strategy toward three blades with solid double-digit growth in both countries. In Brazil  after four years of successful share gain  we continued to outperform the market (+1.0 pts in value)13  reaching a historical record of 24% share in value  boosted by premium male and female products (Comfort 3 and Simply Soleil). In Mexico  the market was up mid-single digit in value  and we kept pace thanks to the solid performance of both Flex and Soleil ranges in the traditional channel.APPENDIX2022 MARKET ASSUMPTIONSOur 2022 outlook is based on the following market assumptions26F6F14:Market trends (in value):Europe : Low to mid-single-digit decrease in Stationery  flat to low single-digit decrease in Lighters  flat to low-single-digit decrease in ShaversNorth America: Low to mid-single-digit decrease in U.S. Stationery market Low to mid-single-digit decrease for total U.S. pocket Lighter market Slight decrease in the total U.S. one-piece Shaver marketLatin America: double-digit increase in Stationery; Low to mid-single-digit decrease in Lighters and low to mid-single-digit increase in ShaversIndia: double-digit increase in StationeryEBIT drivers:Gross Profit: Increase in volumes and prices Higher Raw Materials and Sea and Air Freight costs Slightly unfavorable FX impact (Negative USD-Euro hedging / Positive USD-MXN) Positive contribution from InkboxAdjusted EBIT: Increase in Brand Support to support Net Sales growth – increase in R&D and OPEX to support long-term growth and innovation Additional savings Negative impact on 2022 EBIT from InkboxFree Cash Flow before Acquisitions and Disposals drivers:Approximately 100 million euros in CAPEXCurrency: 2022 USD-EUR hedging rate: 1.1750Q2 NET SALES BY GEOGRAPHYin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 % As reported % at constant currencies % On a comparative basis Group 505.7 611.4 +20.9 % +11.6 % +9.6 % Europe 166.8 190.4 +14.2 % +13.3 % +13.3 % North America 222.3 265.5 +19.4 % +5.7 % +3.2 % Latin America 67.7 95.5 +41.1 % +24.6 % +18.2 % Middle East and Africa 29.1 28.7 (1.5) % (8.0) % (8.0) % Asia and Oceania (including India) 19.8 31.3 +58.2 % +48.9 % +48.9 %H1 NET SALES BY GEOGRAPHYin million euros H1 2021 H1 2022 % As reported % at constant currencies % On a comparative basis Group 916.7 1 127.2 +23.0 % +15.5 % +13.7 % Europe 292.0 336.9 +15.4 % +15.7 % +15.7 % North America 406.4 499.0 +22.8 % +11.3 % +9.2 % Latin America 125.9 179.7 +42.8 % +29.6 % +24.0 % Middle East and Africa 51.1 57.1 +11.7 % +5.4 % +5.4 % Asia and Oceania (including India) 41.3 54.4 +31.8 % +26.0 % +26.0 %Q2 NET SALES BY DIVISIONin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 Change as reported FX impact15(in points) Change in Perimeter16(in points) Argentina impact17(in points) Change on a Comparativebasis Group 505.7 611.4 +20.9 % +9.5 +1.2 +0.6 +9.6 % Stationery- Human Expression 202.2 269.7 +33.4 % +8.2 +2.7 +0.6 +21.9 % Lighters- Flame for Life 192.9 209.7 +8.7 % +10.3 - +0.9 (2.5) % Shavers- Blade Excellence 104.0 126.8 +22.0 % +11.3 - +0.7 +10.0 % Other Products 6.6 5.2 (21.1) % - - - (21.1) %H1 NET SALES BY DIVISIONin million euros H1 2021 H12022 Change as reported FX impact(in points) Change in Perimeter(in points) Argentina impact(in points) Change on a Comparativebasis Group 916.7 1 127.2 +23.0 % +7.8 +0.9 +0.6 +13.7 % Stationery- Human Expression 333.3 438.0 +31.4 % +6.3 +2.5 +0.9 +21.7 % Lighters- Flame for Life 367.4 436.0 +18.7 % +8.8 - +0.6 +9.3 % Shavers- Blade Excellence 200.4 240.3 +19.9 % +8.4 - +0.5 +11.0 % Other Products 15.7 12.8 (18.4) % - - - (18.4) %IMPACT OF CHANGE IN PERIMETER AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON NET SALES (EXCLUDES ARS) (in %) Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Perimeter +2.2 +1.2 +3.0 +0.9 Currencies (5.5) +9.5 (7.2) +7.8 Of which USD (5.2) +6.1 (4.8) +5.2 Of which BRL (0.4) +1.3 (1.4) +1.2 Of which MXN +0.4 +0.8 (0.1) +0.6 Of which AUD +0.2 +0.1 +0.2 +0.1 Of which ZAR +0.2 +0.0 +0.0 +0.1 Of which INR (0.1) +0.2 (0.2) +0.2 Of which RUB and UAH (0.3) +0.7 (0.4) +0.3sensitivity to net sales and income before tax (ibt) of usd-euro fluctuation H1 2021 H1 2022 +/- 5% change in USD impact on Net Sales 2.2% 2.2% +/- 5% change in USD impact on IBT 0.8% 1.3%EBIT BY DIVISIONin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Group 105.2 99.8 332.6 197.7 Margin 20.8% 16.3 % 36.3% 17.5 % Stationery- Human Expression 23.9 23.3 29.1 33.5 Margin 11.8% 8.6 % 8.7% 7.7 % Lighters- Flame for Life 80.5 79.3 143.8 165.9 Margin 41.7% 37.8 % 39.2% 38.0 % Shavers- Blade Excellence 20.1 17.9 32.3 41.1 Margin 19.3% 14.1 % 16.1% 17.1 % Other Products (2.8) (1.9) (3.0) (3.8) Unallocated costs (16.5) (18.8) 130.3 (39.1)ADJUSTED EBIT BY DIVISIONin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Group 105.6 101.1 166.1 202.9 Margin 20.9% 16.5 % 18.1% 18.0 % Stationery- Human Expression 24.2 24.1 27.6 35.6 Margin 12.0% 9.0 % 8.3% 8.1 % Lighters- Flame for Life 80.5 79.8 145.7 166.9 Margin 41.7% 38.0 % 39.6% 38.3 % Shavers- Blade Excellence 20.2 17.9 32.4 43.3 Margin 19.4% 14.1 % 16.2% 18.0 % Other Products (2.8) (1.9) (3.0) (3.8) Unallocated costs (16.5) (18.8) (36.5) (39.1)Non-recurring Itemsin million euros Q2 2021 Q2 2022 H1 2021 H1 2022 Clichy Headquarters Sale Gain - - 167.7 - Pimaco divestiture gain - - 3.0 - Restructuring costs related to BIC's transformation plan.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that a new diagnosis code for reporting cases of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency  will be added to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The diagnosis code  D81.82 ‒ Activated Phosphoinositide 3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS)  will be effective starting October 1  2022.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.) (PRNewswire)Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""By assigning this ICD-10-CM code  the CDC is formally recognizing APDS as a discrete immunological disease  and that will make a life-altering difference for people affected by the condition. By using the unique diagnostic code to identify both established and new patients with APDS  physicians will increase care options for affected individuals while helping to boost the world's understanding of the prevalence  mechanisms  and outcomes of this progressively debilitating disease. For healthcare practitioners  this milestone marks an opportunity to make a big difference by taking a simple action.""The assignment of the ICD-10-CM code will  for the first time  enable physicians and payors in the US to add a diagnosis of APDS to patients' health records  which will help connect these individuals with researchers studying the prevalence and course of the disease. In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through US health insurance plans.Caused by genetic variants affecting approximately one to two people per million  APDS causes significant lymphoproliferation and immune dysfunction  as well as an increased risk of lymphoma. There is no approved therapy for the disease and treatment is generally limited to supportive care  such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Physician and patient advocacy groups specializing in immunodeficiency disorders  along with Pharming  expect the decision to raise awareness about this rare disease.Vicki and Fred Modell  co-founders of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  commented:""We are excited that US regulatory authorities have assigned APDS an ICD-10-CM code. As a foundation dedicated to early diagnosis  meaningful treatments  and cures for primary immunodeficiency  we are aware of the physical and emotional challenges people with APDS face due to misdiagnosis of their disease. By increasing recognition of the condition  we expect the new diagnostic code to help ensure that every patient is included when it comes to the delivery of appropriate and meaningful treatments for APDS.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

One of the potential options comprises issuing Swedish Depositary Receipts („SDR“) representing Units on the Swedish market which was announced on 30 June 2022 („SDR Solution)” ( https://view.news.eu.nasdaq.com/view?id=b796aff831a581e4db5302b41d755b2f3&lang=en ).Considering that it is not feasible to implement the SDR Solution by 31 August 2022 (the date announced by Euroclear Sweden to de-register the Units in its book entry system as a consequent of Nordea ceasing to offer its services in relation to the Swedish traded Units)  Northern Horizon has requested from Euroclear Sweden for an extension of the agreement concerning Euroclear Sweden’s services. As of the date of this announcement  Northern Horizon has not received a response from Euroclear Sweden on the possibility of such extension.Regardless of the outcome to extend the registration with Euroclear Sweden  the holders of Swedish traded Units could have a possibility to trade with the Units in Estonian market on Nasdaq Baltic ( https://nasdaqbaltic.com/ ) through their financial intermediaries. For this purpose  each investor will need to notify their financial intermediaries of such investor’s preference. For more detailed information on possibilities to trade with the Units in Estonian market and bringing the Units to Nasdaq CSD (Estonia) please contact your financial intermediaries.Story continuesNorthern Horizon Capital AS will continue working on the alternative solution and will update the investors on the progress next week.For additional information  please contact:Tarmo KarotamBaltic Horizon Fund managerE-mail tarmo.karotam@nh-cap.comwww.baltichorizon.comBaltic Horizon Fund is a registered contractual public closed-end real estate fund that is managed by Alternative Investment Fund Manager license holder Northern Horizon Capital AS.Distribution: GlobeNewswire  Nasdaq Tallinn  Nasdaq Stockholm  www.baltichorizon.com,neutral,0.03,0.91,0.05,mixed,0.15,0.32,0.53,True,English,"['Baltic Horizon Fund', 'Swedish traded units', 'alternative solution', 'update', 'contractual public closed-end real estate fund', 'Alternative Investment Fund Manager license holder', 'Tarmo Karotam Baltic Horizon Fund manager', 'Northern Horizon Capital AS', 'Baltic Horizon Fund units', 'book entry system', 'Nordic sub-custody business', 'Swedish Depositary Receipts', 'new infrastructure solution', 'Swedish traded Units', 'Nordea Bank Abp', 'Euroclear Sweden AB', 'mail tarmo', 'Nasdaq Baltic', 'alternative solution', 'Swedish market', 'strategic decision', 'potential options', 'Estonian market', 'financial intermediaries', 'detailed information', 'additional information', 'SDR Solution', 'Nasdaq CSD', 'Nasdaq Tallinn', 'Nasdaq Stockholm', 'affiliation agreement', 'view.news', '29 September', 'termination', '30 June', '31 August', 'date', 'consequent', 'services', 'relation', 'extension', 'announcement', 'response', 'possibility', 'outcome', 'registration', 'holders', 'nasdaqbaltic', 'purpose', 'investor', 'preference', 'possibilities', 'Story', 'progress', 'baltichorizon', 'registered', 'Distribution', 'GlobeNewswire']",2022-08-02,2022-08-03,finance.yahoo.com

8602,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/best-outdoor-tv-antennas/,The best outdoor TV antennas for 2022,If you've been thinking about cutting the cord with your cable provider  an outdoor TV antenna is a great way to pick up local and regional stations.,Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us?Thinking of cutting the cord? Tired of paying for cable channels that you never watch? If your household is all about network news  local sports  and the shows broadcast on your local affiliate stations  a TV antenna is an excellent way to supplement the lack of broadcast TV stations that streaming services don't provide  giving you access to free  over-the-air broadcasts.Combined with a streaming device (for things like Netflix and Disney+)  a TV antenna can totally satiate the TV-watching needs of most households for a complete cable-free package.But why not an indoor TV antenna  you might ask? If your house is situated in a location with obstructions like mountains  tall buildings  or lots of trees  or if the building's materials contain things like brick or stucco (some appliances can affect signal  too)  there may be too much interference for a clean digital signal. While putting your antenna near a window or even in the attic can help  it might not do the trick. That's where mounting an outdoor TV antenna on your roof or other high-up location comes in to give you the best signal possible. In fact  many outdoor TVs are designed to pick up stations hundreds of miles away.Whether you're tired of that monthly cable bill or you're simply looking for an alternative way to grab stations from distant zip codes  we've assembled this roundup of the best outdoor TV antennas to help you decide which unit is best for your rooftop or attic.Winegard Elite Outdoor Antenna The best outdoor TV antenna for most people Jump to details More Antennas Direct Clearstream 4V The best multidirectional outdoor TV antenna Jump to details More RCA Amplified Outdoor TV Antenna The best outdoor TV antenna for design Jump to details PBD ‎WA-2608 The best motorized outdoor TV antenna Jump to details More Antop AT-800SBS The best outdoor TV antenna for features Jump to details Show 2 more itemsWinegard Elite Outdoor AntennaThe best outdoor TV antenna for most peoplePros Receives signals up to 70 miles awayPicks up both VHF and UHF broadcastsOptimized for 4K broadcastsIncludes mounting hardware Cons Directional onlyA little expensiveWhy you should buy this: You want a great outdoor antenna from a trusted name and plan on splitting the signal to multiple TVs in your home.Who it's for: Homes that are a good distance away from any broadcast towers.Why we chose the Winegard Elite Outdoor Antenna:When it comes to maximum strength and performance  the Winegard Elite WE7550A is our top pick for an outdoor antenna. Rated to pick up stations at over 70 miles away and featuring Winegard's ultra-low noise filter  you'll be able to pick up broadcasts with little to no degradation in picture and sound quality.This model is also capable of receiving both VHF and UHF antenna signals  and with Winegard's TwinAmp Technology  both broadcast types receive a signal boost  ensuring your TV is receiving a crystal-clear picture no matter the type of incoming content.Designed for attic or roof installation  the Winegard Elite comes with everything you need to mount and assemble the antenna. In fact  many customers have claimed that the Elite is great for picking up broadcasts from all directions  even though it's only a directional antenna.With its reliable performance and durable design  it's easy for us to call the Winegard Elite our favorite antenna overall. Just keep in mind that if you're interested in getting signal to multiple TVs at once  you'll need to purchase a splitter separately.Winegard Elite Outdoor Antenna The best outdoor TV antenna for most people MoreAntennas Direct Clearstream 4VThe best multidirectional outdoor TV antennaPros Receives both VHF and UHF signalsOptimized to receive broadcasts up to 70 miles awayDesigned for multidirectional useIncludes mounting hardware Cons A little expensiveLackluster instructionsMay require an amplifier for some homesWhy you should buy this: You're limited to where you can mount an outdoor TV antenna and require one that has excellent range.Who it's for: Homes that have various obstructions between the house and the direction of a broadcast tower.Why we chose the Antennas Direct Clearstream 4V:Sometimes it's next to impossible for certain households to operate a directional outdoor TV antenna. This may be because there are various obstructions between your home and a broadcast tower  like dense trees and tall buildings  or perhaps the tower is geographically north but the only place you can mount an antenna is facing south.Whatever the holdup  that's why there are antennas like the Antennas Direct Clearstream 4V. Built from the ground-up as an omnidirectional outdoor TV antenna that can receive broadcasts up to 70 miles away  the Clearstream 4V is designed to be mounted to your roof or installed in an attic. In terms of onboard tech  the VHF and UHF elements are optimized for multidirectional receiving  ensuring that you'll get the strongest possible reception no matter where you're living and where the nearest broadcast towers are.The Clearstream 4V also comes with a 20-inch mast and pivoting base  so you'll be able to mount it to any type of roofing  regardless of shingling or slant. While some customers have had trouble with installation and others have had to use amplifiers to boost incoming signal  Antennas Direct is one of the top names in the outdoor TV antenna market  and the Clearstream 4V is one of the most powerful  multidirectional outdoor TV antennas you can buy.Antennas Direct Clearstream 4V The best multidirectional outdoor TV antenna MoreRCA Amplified Outdoor TV AntennaThe best outdoor TV antenna for designPros Receives signals up to 80 miles awaySpiral design ensures optimized performanceIncludes mounting hardware and coaxial cableReceives both VHF and UHF signals Cons Can perform differently based on type of coax usedWhy you should buy this: You need an antenna that can grab far-off broadcasts and aren't willing to invest in a large model.Who it's for: Those looking for an antenna that can receive plenty of stations  regardless of signal type or where it's mounted.Why we chose the RCA Amplified Outdoor Antenna:A first glance at this RCA outdoor antenna may have you wondering why the company decided to opt for a spiral design. It's for a good reason  actually  and it's why we're awarding this RCA antenna for its design.Where traditional outdoor TV antennas are designed for a directly vertical or horizontal plane  RCA says its spiral design with wedged notches actually boosts weak signals  allowing it to receive broadcasts that are more than 80 miles away.We also appreciate that the RCA antenna comes with all the mounting hardware you'll need for roof-mounting or attic installation in addition to a 16-foot spool of coaxial cable. If you're not sure where to mount the antenna  there's even a handy RCA Signal Finder app (for iOS and Android devices) you can download to help you pinpoint the location of the nearest broadcast towers.RCA Amplified Outdoor TV Antenna The best outdoor TV antenna for designPBD ‎WA-2608The best motorized outdoor TV antennaPros Can be rotated 360 degreesReceives signals up to 150 miles awayCapable of picking up VHF and UHF signalsIncludes mounting hardware and coaxial cableGreat price Cons No way of telling which way the antenna rotatesWhy you should buy this: You've had TV antennas before and have noticed signal going in and out depending on the time of day.Who it's for: Homes located along busy flight paths and wedged between other broadcast tower obstructions.Why we chose the PBD WA-2608:Depending on the type of weather or other types of sky-based obstructions near your home (maybe your house is situated along a busy airport flight path)  installing an outdoor TV antenna may only be slightly better than the performance you'll receive with an indoor model. But when you opt for a unit like the PBD WA-2608  your antenna experience becomes much more customizable.This is because the WA-2608 is a motorized outdoor TV antenna. Once installed on your roof  a remote control allows you to rotate the antenna 360 degrees  allowing you to adjust the antenna if there's something impeding the signal between the broadcast tower and the PBD.The WA-2608 is also designed to pick up both VHF and UHF signals and features a built-in splitter  so you'll be able to send signals to two different TVs at once. In terms of range  this is also one of the most far-reaching outdoor TV antennas of our roundup  capable of grabbing stations over 150 miles away.While some customers claim that they've only received stations up to 80 or so miles away from their home  that's still an impressive metric that many households would be more than happy with.PBD ‎WA-2608 The best motorized outdoor TV antenna MoreAntop AT-800SBSThe best outdoor TV antenna for featuresPros Multi-directionalReceives signals up to 85 miles awayIncludes FM receptor for receiving radio signalsIncludes mounting hardware and 40 feet of coaxial cable Cons A bit expensiveNot as popular as other outdoor antennasWhy you should buy this: You want a versatile outdoor TV antenna that can be used indoors  too.Who it's for: Homeowners that may not have the ability to mount a TV on their roof or in an attic.Why we chose the Antop AT-800SBS:Who says that an outdoor TV antenna can only be mounted to your roof?

The trial is evaluating Onivyde® (irinotecan liposo…,"PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) announced today that the Phase III RESILIENT trial did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) compared to topotecan. The trial is evaluating Onivyde® (irinotecan liposomal injection) versus topotecan in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC)  who have progressed on or after platinum-based first-line therapy treatment. RESILIENT is a Phase III trial conducted in two parts; the first part read out in 2020 confirming the safety  dosing and efficacy of Onivyde; part two is evaluating the efficacy of Onivyde versus topotecan. Detailed results from the RESILIENT trial will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.The analysis concluded that the primary endpoint OS was not met in patients treated with Onivyde versus topotecan. However  a doubling of the secondary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) in favor of Onivyde was observed. The safety and tolerability of Onivyde was consistent with its already-known safety profile  and no new safety concerns emerged. The clinical study results will be communicated with the regulatory agency.Howard Mayer  M.D.  Executive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Ipsen  said: "" While the results from the analysis of the RESILIENT trial have not demonstrated an overall survival benefit with Onivyde in patients in second-line small cell lung cancer  we will now work with our teams to analyze the data further before decisions regarding next steps are made. These data confirm the complexities associated with treating small cell lung cancer. We wish to thank the patients  their families and healthcare teams for their participation in this clinical trial.”Onivyde is currently approved in most major markets including the U.S.  Europe and Asia in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. Onivyde is not indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Ipsen will continue to explore the potential of Onivyde in other areas  and the final data readout of the NAPOLI-3 Phase III trial in first-line pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is expected in H2 2022.ENDSAbout RESILIENTRESILIENT is a randomized  open-label Phase III trial of Onivyde (irinotecan liposome injection) versus topotecan in patients with small cell lung cancer who have progressed on or after platinum-based first-line therapy. The trial is being conducted in two parts:Part 1: Open-label dose-finding trial of Onivyde. 30 patients were enrolled.Part 1 Primary endpoints: Describe the safety and tolerability of Onivyde monotherapy administered every 2 weeks Determine the optimal Onivyde monotherapy dose for Part 2 of this trialPart 2: A randomized  efficacy study of Onviyde versus intravenous (IV) topotecan. Approximately 450 patients were enrolled in part 2.Part 2 objectives: To compare overall survival (OS) following treatment with Onivyde with OS following treatment with IV topotecanThe primary outcome measure is OS. Secondary outcome measures include progression-free survival  objective response rate  quality of life assessment using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 (EORTC QLQ-C30/LC13) dyspnea scale  quality of life assessment using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 (EORTC QLQ-LC13) cough scale  incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events  serious adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.

For more information  visit ipsen.comIpsen’s Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

The patient attaches the reusable AcuPebble sensor to the base of the neck to record sounds generated by the respiratory and cardiac functions. These recorded signals are uploaded to a secure cloud platform through a smartphone application where patented algorithms extract OSA parameters providing an automated diagnostic report within minutes. AcuPebble has demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and specificity for both the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the oxygen-desaturation index (ODI) compared with the gold-standard polygraphy test  and is clinically validated through a randomized study published in the BMJ Open . The system is CE marked and has FDA clearance.“With AcuPebble and Genio  Nyxoah can now offer patients and clinicians the most cutting edge OSA home sleep diagnosis and treatment solutions ” commented Olivier Taelman  Nyxoah’s Chief Executive Officer. “The Acurable partnership aligns perfectly with our patient-first mission statement  as AcuPebble’s comfort  ease-of-use and accuracy will break down barriers to OSA diagnosis and allow for more patients to receive treatment for their condition. We look forward to launching AcuPebble in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2022.”Story continues“We are delighted to enter into this highly-synergistic collaboration with an OSA technology leader like Nyxoah  whose mission is aligned with ours of providing access to treatment to as many OSA patients as possible ” commented Emilio Sanz-Pereiras  Acurable’s Co-Chief Executive Officer. “AcuPebble is designed to be significantly more patient- and practitioner-friendly than polygraphy and polysomnography tests  enabling not only ease of diagnosis  but also the ability for patients to routinely monitor their condition. By empowering patients to take greater control over their OSA  AcuPebble is an important new tool to improve the lives of those suffering from this debilitating condition.”About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Nyxoah’s lead solution is the Genio® system  a patient-centered  leadless and battery-free hypoglossal neurostimulation therapy for OSA  the world’s most common sleep disordered breathing condition that is associated with increased mortality risk and cardiovascular comorbidities.

Like-for-like (excluding the acquisition of PROKOV EDITIONS)  Group revenue grew 7.68% to €101.11m.It should be noted that the new organisation  effective from 1 January 2022  henceforth includes 5 Divisions:PHARMAGEST (formerly the Europe Pharmacy Solutions Division);AXIGATE LINK (formerly the Health and Social Care Facilities Solutions Division);E-CONNECT  responsible for designing e-health solutions for healthcare professionals and the well-being of dependent patients;MEDICAL SOFT  the new medical software Division  which now includes the activities of PROKOV EDITIONS;FINTECH.This new organisation results in a marginal change in the respective contributions of each Division to total Group revenue.H1 2022 business highlightsThe PHARMAGEST Division reported sales of €75.81m  up 6.77% from H1 2021.This Division accounts for 73.19% of total Equasens Group revenue.France: +5.74% to €67.81m.This Division continues to perform well  bolstered by investment capacities of pharmacists which continued to improve in 2021. The combined contributions of the OFFITAG and ASCAETIQ offerings and the restructuring of the latter's electronic labelling business also contribute to this growth momentum.Story continuesItaly: +17.91% to €5.30m.The investment plan (recruitment campaigns  opening of new branches) is beginning to produce results  both for pharmacies and wholesaler-distributors. This Business Unit is continuing to grow at a sustained pace  mainly in response to increased synergies with France  the launch of the latest generation of id. software and the deployment of new European products (id.TAG  id.LOCKER  id.EASYQ  etc.).Belgium: +13.40% to €1.37m.The situation is improving  though remains fragile as pharmacists and pharmacy groups are continuing to experience financial pressures impacting their capacity to invest.Digital Communications Business Unit: +13.38% to €1.32m.The increased offering of services for pharmacies  industry and pharmacy groups (for example  the SAILFI loyalty programme) contributed to the growth in revenue.The AXIGATE LINK Division had sales of €15.14m  up 8.40% from H1 2021.This Division accounts for 14.62% of total Equasens Group revenue.After a more subdued first quarter  all business sectors were up as commercial momentum strengthened.Nursing home sector: +7.80% to €7.68m.In Belgium  MALTA BELGIUM's nursing home business is steadily expanding  as it prepares for the launch of the new multilingual cloud-based version of the flagship software suite  TITANLINK.Hospital-at-Home sector: +2.48% to €2.67m.Although marginally impacted by the lead time for implementing the Ségur programme (-12.44% in Q1)  this Business Unit is now benefiting from the qualification of its DOMILINK HAD software for this programme to strengthen the deployment of its offerings (+17.34% in Q2).Hospital sector: +7.74% to €2.14m.The business development process for hospital groups is long and complex. This being said  the HOSPILINK solution’s very recent qualification for the Ségur programme on 25 July 2022 is expected to have a significant impact on open calls for tender as well as prospecting activities addressing regional hospital networks.The Healthcare Establishment and Private Practice sector: +13.29% to €2.34m.PANDALAB is continuing to roll out pandaLAB Pro with more than 17 000 healthcare professionals connected to this secure instant messaging system.Telemedicine sector: +68.16% to €0.31m.While marginal (0.30% of total revenue)  the Group has made significant commitments to support this Business Unit: signature of a remote monitoring agreement for bariatric surgery patients with the Nancy Regional and University Hospital Centre (CHRU)  finalisation of a technical partnership with MWS to equip the large majority of nursing homes and manage CARELIB EHPAD notifications (fall detection and medical alerts) ""to the right people  on the right platform (in particular the DECT mobile devices of nursing staff  but also within the pandaLAB Pro and TITANLINK solutions) at the right time"".The E-CONNECT Division had sales of €9.08m  up 19.52% from H1 2021 and accounting for 8.77% of Equasens Group revenue. For the Frail Management activity  the business development plan (test boxes in Germany  Belgium  France and the Netherlands) combined with reinforced Communication/Marketing efforts is starting to resonate with its market though without making up for the Q1 lag. Growth momentum for the Compliance and e-Connect businesses have remained on track. The prime concern of the e-Connect Business Unit continues to be anticipating sourcing needs and ensuring the quality of electronic components in a market expecting continuing tensions over the next few months.The MEDICAL SOFT Division   which includes the PROKOV EDITIONS business  reported sales of €2.46m  thereby confirming the justification for this acquisition in Q4 2021.This new Division accounts for 2.37% of total Equasens Group revenue.MédiStory 4  the latest generation of the software developed for private practitioners  was recently awarded Ségur certification from the French Digital Health Agency based on meeting 155 functional requirements. As a result  users of the different versions of MédiStory (with 9 500 GPs and specialists equipped to date) are eligible to subscribe to Ségur functions (complete migration of the solution or functional extensions).The FINTECH Division had sales of €1.09m  down 18.59% from H1 2021  and accounting for 1.05% of Equasens Group revenue.Reflecting unfavourable banking and financial sector trends  this business has been impacted by rising interest rates and a corresponding increase in lead times.Significant events occurring after 30 June 2022Equasens Group completes the majority acquisitions of three companies(excerpt from press release of 28 July 2022)Therapeutic compliance is a key issue at the European level in the management of elderly and chronically ill patients. In 2022  continuing to implement a strategy focused on patients and effective medication compliance  the Group has increased its shareholdings in three of its European subsidiaries:MULTIMEDS  an Irish company which produces and distributes manual pill dispensers;CAREMEDS  a British company  the developer of the eMAR traceability solution for prescription drugs prepared in pill dispensers for use in pharmacies and nursing homes;I-MEDS  a German wholesaler and distributor of equipment and accessories for supplying drugs to patients and pharmacies.These different operations will help Equasens Group accelerate its expansion and reinforce its presence in several European countries. In particular:in the United Kingdom  by combining CAREMEDS' eMAR medication traceability solution with MALTA INFORMATIQUE's TITANLINK facility management solution (MALTA intends to replicate its Business Model  based on the successful example of MALTA BELGIUM in Belgium);in Germany  by enhancing MULTIMEDS’ manual dispensing range with the Group's pharmacy automation solutions  and in particular the addition of AUTOMEDS' semi-automatic dispensing systems  which are perfectly suited to the German market in terms of design and capacity.The Ségur qualified HOSPILINK solutionFollowing the success of MédiStory 4 (a software suite for physicians from the MEDICAL SOFT Division) and DOMILINK HAD (a Hospital at Home solution from the AXIGATE LINK Division)  on 25 July 2022 Equasens Group announced HOSPILINK’s qualification in the Hospital category for the Ségur investment programme. Developed by AXIGATE teams  this application addresses the needs of hospitals  regional hospital groups  specialised  post-acute and rehabilitation facilities (AXIGATE LINK Division).In line with the validation procedures (DSR or Dossier de Spécifications de Référencement or Software Specification Requirements)  French Digital Health Agency (Agence du Numérique en Santé or ANS) teams ensured that the software complied with the technical  functional and ergonomic specifications.

The approval was granted by the Ethics Commitee and the Regulatory Authorities.This first feature of Pixium Vision’s new remote patient engagement platform will allow patients to conduct rehabilitation sessions from home  with or without the help of a family member or a caregiver. The platform requires only a tablet  provided by Pixium  and an internet connection to be fully functional. Over the coming months  more innovative features are expected to be added to the platform to help dry AMD patients live a more independent life.The PRIMAvera study aims to confirm the safety as well as the benefits provided by the Prima System and is the last clinical step before seeking market approval in Europe. The study was initiated in Q4 2020 in France  and the first patient was implanted in March 2021. Pixium Vision has since established clinical sites and implanted its first patients in Germany  the UK and the Netherlands. The opening of additional clinical sites is planned in Spain  and Italy during 2022. Pixium Vision expects to complete recruitment by the end of 2022  leading to a read-out of the PRIMAvera study around the end of 2023 and a regulatory submission in Europe in H1 2024.Story continues""The approval of the remote rehabilitation allows patients enrolled in our PRIMAvera pivotal study and French Feasibility Study to complete the majority of their training in the comfort of their own homes with a simple technical set up and without the need for repeated trips to hospital "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""We are using apps specifically designed for our patients as well as employing gamification principles to make the rehabilitation process as engaging and effective as possible. We also expect the remote patient engagement platform  thanks to upcoming additional functionality  to encourage better communication between patients and their physicians and among patients themselves. Over the last few months  we have successfully continued to move the Prima System closer to the market and this remote rehabilitation process will be a critical element of the real-life process once this revolutionary system is commercialized in a couple of years.""Remote rehabilitation has been approved in France  Germany  Italy  Spain and the Netherlands for patients who have succesfuly completed their initial in-clinic rehabilitation sessions. The remote rehabilitation sessions will take place between the patient and the rehabilitation specialists and will be of the same nature as the in-clinic rehabilitation sessions. The platform will also allow clinicians to track the progress of patients at any time and to adjust the frequency of the remote rehabilitation sessions based on the progress of each patient. Given the age and lack of vision of the patients enrolled in the clinical studies  remote rehabilitation will make it simpler for patients to comply. Pixium Vision’s unique remote patient engagement platform is a tailor-made solution to ensure appropriate rehabilitation.“In order to achieve the best visual function following implantation  it is paramount for patients to adhere to a comprehensive rehabilitation process. Getting patients fully engaged in this rehabilitation process will secure the best results. The new remote rehabilitation module of the PRIMAvera trial allows patients to train daily at home  thus decreasing the burden of frequent in-office sessions. This would be a hybrid rehabilitation scheme mixing in-person rehabilitation sessions with supervised remote home training. Recent developments are making the remote training system increasingly easier to use and patient-friendlier ” said Dr. Villani  Director of the Low Vision and Microperimetry Center of Verona “C.R.I.M.” (Centro Riabilitazione Ipovedenti e Microperimetria – Verona  Italy). “Also  the gaming nature of some training exercises – as well as the ability to communicate easily with physicians  nurses  family members and other patients – will further motivate patients to engage in the training and allow physicians to better track progress and adapt the rehabilitation as needed. The platform will also help us researchers gather precious information to further improve the training over time.”A total of 38 patients will be enrolled in the PRIMAvera study  an open-label  baseline-controlled  non-randomized  multi-center  prospective  single-arm pivotal trial. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline to 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

Benchmark figures are performance measures used by management. ROIC is based on twelve-months rolling figures. See Note 4 for a reconciliation from IFRS to benchmark figures.Full-Year 2022 OutlookWe are increasing our guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC in reporting currency and for adjusted EPS growth in constant currencies. We reaffirm our outlook for adjusted free cash flow in constant currencies. While first half organic growth was better than expected  we expect organic momentum to slow in the remainder of the year  largely due to challenging comparables. We expect second half margins to reflect increased hiring and investments. Growth in diluted adjusted EPS will be dampened by a return to our historical tax rate. Revenues from Russia  Belarus  and Ukraine (mainly in Governance  Risk & Compliance) represented less than 0.5% of group revenues in 2021 and HY 2022.Story continuesFull-Year 2022 Outlook Performance indicators 2022 Guidance Previous 2022 Guidance 2021 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.0%-26.5% 25.5%-26.0% 25.3% Adjusted free cash flow €1 025-€1 075 million €1 025-€1 075 million €1 010 million ROIC* 14%-15% Around 14% 13.7% Diluted adjusted EPS growth Mid- to high-single-digit Mid-single-digit €3.38 *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2022 of €/$1.07. Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.18). Guidance reflects share repurchases of €1 billion in 2022.If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a positive effect on 2022 results reported in euros. In 2021  Wolters Kluwer generated more than 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2021 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 2 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS1. Also  if current rates persist  we expect to incur a (non-cash) foreign exchange loss on intercompany balances at year-end.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We currently expect that restructuring costs will increase to within our normal range of €10-€15 million (FY 2021: €6 million). Due to higher interest rates on cash balances  we now expect adjusted net financing costs2 in constant currencies to be approximately €55 million. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be in the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2021: 21.5%). Capital expenditure is expected to increase but to remain within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). We continue to expect the full-year cash conversion ratio to be in the range of 100%-105% (FY 2021: 112%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.2022 Outlook by DivisionHealth: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels (mainly due to the absence of a contract win of the size of the 2021 ASCO deal) and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Tax & Accounting: we expect organic growth to accelerate from 2021 levels and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  mainly due to an expected decline in transactional revenues in the second half. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to improve for the full year.Legal & Regulatory: we now expect organic growth to improve on 2021 levels. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to decline modestly for the full year due to the absence of a one-off pension amendment recorded in 2021.Our Mission  Business Model and StrategyOur mission is to empower our professional customers with the information  software solutions  and services they need to make critical decisions  achieve successful outcomes  and save time. We support professionals across four main customer segments: health; tax & accounting; governance  risk & compliance; and legal & regulatory. Every day  our customers face the challenge of increasing proliferation and complexity of information and the pressure to deliver better outcomes at a lower cost. Many of our customers are looking for mobility  flexibility  intuitive interfaces  and integrated open architecture technology to support their decision-making. We aim to solve their problems and add value to their workflow with our range of digital solutions and services  which we continuously evolve to meet their changing needs.Our expert solutions combine deep domain knowledge with technology to deliver both content and workflow automation to drive improved outcomes and productivity for our customers. Expert solutions  which include our software products and certain advanced information solutions  accounted for 56% of total revenues in the first half of 2022 (FY 2021: 55%) and grew 9% organically. Software revenues accounted for 44% of total revenues (FY 2021: 42%) and grew 9% organically  with cloud software revenues up 20% organically.Based on revenues  our largest expert solutions by division are:Health : global clinical decision support tool UpToDate; clinical drug databases Medi-Span and Lexicomp; and Lippincott nursing solutions for practice and learning.Tax & Accounting : global corporate performance solution CCH Tagetik; global corporate internal audit platform TeamMate; professional tax and accounting software  including CCH Axcess and CCH ProSystem fx in North America and similar software for professionals across Europe.Governance  Risk & Compliance : finance  risk  and regulatory reporting suite OneSumX; banking compliance solutions ComplianceOne  Expere  eOriginal  and Gainskeeper; and enterprise legal management software Passport and TyMetrix.Legal & Regulatory: global EHS/ORM3 suite Enablon; legal workflow solutions Kleos and Legisway; and other software tools for European legal professionals.Our business model is primarily based on subscriptions  software maintenance  and other recurring revenues (80% of total revenues in FY 2021 and 81% in HY 2021)  augmented by implementation services and license fees as well as volume-based transactional or other non-recurring revenues. Renewal rates for our recurring digital information  software  and service revenues are high and are one of the key indicators by which we measure our success. Product innovation is a key driver of growth.More than half of our operating costs relate to our employees  who create  develop  maintain  sell  implement  and support our solutions on behalf of our customers. Our technology architecture is increasingly based on globally scalable platforms that use standardized components. An increasing proportion of our solutions is built cloud-first. Many of our solutions incorporate advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence  natural language processing  robotic process automation  and predictive analytics. Our development teams use customer-centric  contextual design and develop solutions based on the scaled agile framework. Our solutions are sold by our own sales teams or through selected distribution partners.Strategic priorities 2022-2024At the start of this year  we rolled out our new three-year strategic plan  which has three strategic priorities:Accelerate Expert Solutions : we intend to focus our investments on cloud-based expert solutions while continuing to transform selected digital information products into expert solutions. We will invest to enrich the customer experience of our products by leveraging advanced data analytics.Expand Our Reach : we will seek to extend organically into high-growth adjacencies along our customer workflows and adapt our existing products for new customer segments. We plan to further develop partnerships and ecosystems for our key software platforms.Evolve Core Capabilities: we intend to enhance our central functions to drive excellence and scale economies  mainly in sales and marketing (go-to-market) and in technology. We plan to advance our environmental  social  and governance (ESG) performance and capabilities and to continue investing in diverse and engaged talent to support innovation and growth.We expect this strategy to support good organic growth and improved margins and returns over the coming three years. While the strategy remains centered on organic growth  we may make selected acquisitions and non-core disposals to enhance our value and market positions. Acquisitions must fit our strategy  strengthen or extend our existing business  be accretive to diluted adjusted EPS in their first full year and  when integrated  deliver a return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital (8%) within three to five years. We expect that group-wide product development spend will remain at approximately 10% of total revenues in the next three years.Our strategy aims to achieve high levels of customer satisfaction and an engaged  talented  and diverse workforce  to maintain strong corporate governance and secure systems  and to drive efficient operations that meet environmentally-sound practices. Two key strategic ESG goals for the coming three years are to drive an improvement in our belonging score4 and to start aligning our reporting with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).Financial Policy  Capital Allocation  Net Debt  and LiquidityWolters Kluwer uses its free cash flow to invest in the business organically and through acquisitions  to maintain optimal leverage  and to provide returns to shareholders. We regularly assess our financial position and evaluate the appropriate level of debt in view of our expectations for cash flow  investment plans  interest rates  and capital market conditions. While we may temporarily deviate from our leverage target  we continue to believe that  in the longer run  a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 2.5x remains appropriate for our business given the high proportion of recurring revenues and resilient cash flows.Dividend Policy and Interim Dividend 2022Wolters Kluwer remains committed to a progressive dividend policy  under which we aim to increase the dividend per share in euros each year  independent of currency fluctuations. The payout ratio5 can vary from year to year. Proposed annual increases in the dividend per share take into account our ﬁnancial performance  market conditions  and our need for ﬁnancial ﬂexibility. The policy takes into consideration the characteristics of our business  our expectations for future cash ﬂows  and our plans for organic investment in innovation and productivity  or for acquisitions. We balance these factors with the objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet.As announced on February 23  2022  the interim dividend for 2022 was set at 40% of the prior year total dividend. This results in an interim dividend of €0.63 per share  to be distributed on September 22  2022  to holders of ordinary shares  or September 29  2022  to holders of Wolters Kluwer ADRs.Shareholders can choose to reinvest both interim and ﬁnal dividends by purchasing additional Wolters Kluwer shares through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) administered by ABN AMRO Bank N.V.Share Buyback 2022 ExpandedAs a matter of policy since 2012  Wolters Kluwer will offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases (Anti-Dilution Policy). In addition  from time to time when appropriate  we return capital to shareholders through share buyback programs. Shares repurchased by the company are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or utilized to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.On February 23  2022  we announced our intention to repurchase shares for up to €600 million during 2022. Today  we are announcing an increase in this program to €1 billion. Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially  we believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchases may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time.In the year to date  through August 2  2022  we have repurchased €356 million in shares (3.8 million shares at an average price of €92.89). Included in these amounts was a block trade of 522 954 shares purchased for €46.1 million on February 24  2022  to offset the issuance of incentive shares. See Note 10 for further information on issued share capital.For the period starting August 4  2022  up to and including October 31  2022  we have mandated third parties to execute €400 million in share buybacks on our behalf while for the period starting November 3  2022  up to and including December 28  2022  we have mandated another third party to execute €244 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and the company’s Articles of Association. The maximum number of shares which may be acquired will not exceed the authorization granted by the General Meeting of Shareholders. Repurchased shares are added to and held as treasury shares and will be used for capital reduction purposes or to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.Share Cancellation 2022At the 2022 Annual General Meeting of April 21  2022  shareholders approved a resolution to cancel for capital reduction purposes any or all ordinary shares held in treasury or to be acquired by the company  up to a maximum of 10% of issued share capital. As of August 2  2022  Wolters Kluwer held 7.5 million shares in treasury. As authorized by shareholders  the Executive Board has determined the number of ordinary shares to be cancelled this year is 5.0 million. Wolters Kluwer intends to cancel these shares in the second half of 2022. The remaining treasury shares will be retained in order to meet future obligations under share-based incentive plans.Net Debt  Leverage  Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility  and Liquidity PositionNet debt on June 30  2022  was €2 203 million  compared to €2 131 million on December 31  2021. The net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x (FY 2021: 1.4x; HY 2021: 1.7x).Our multi-currency credit facility remains fully undrawn. Effective July 2022  we agreed to the final one-year extension of this €600 million multi-currency credit facility  such that the facility will now mature in 2025. The facility is sustainability-linked  with pricing tied to four ESG key performance indicators.Our liquidity position remains strong with  as of June 30  2022  net cash available of €1 019 million6  partly offset by outstanding Euro Commercial Paper (ECP) of €100 million.Half-Year 2022 ResultsBenchmark FiguresGroup revenues were €2 600 million  up 14% overall benefitting from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. Excluding the effect of exchange rate movements  revenues increased 7% in constant currencies. Excluding also the net effect of acquisitions and divestments  organic revenue growth was 7% (HY 2021: 5%).Revenues from North America accounted for 64% of total group revenues and grew 7% organically (HY 2021: 5%). Revenues from Europe  29% of total revenues  grew 6% organically (HY 2021: 5%). Revenues from Asia Pacific and Rest of World  7% of total revenues  grew 11% organically (HY 2021: 3%).Adjusted operating profit was €734 million (HY 2021: €613 million)  an increase of 10% in constant currencies. The adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 28.2% (HY 2021: 26.9%). The increase in adjusted operating profit margin mainly reflects strong operational gearing and favorable currency mix. Margins were higher than expected due to a slower than expected post-COVID ramp-up in spending (such as travel) and hiring. Product development (including CAPEX) increased to 10% of revenues (HY 2021: 9%).Included in adjusted operating profit were restructuring expenses of €3 million (HY 2021: €2 million).Adjusted net financing costs were stable at €42 million (HY 2021: €42 million). Included in adjusted net financing costs was a €13 million net foreign exchange loss (HY 2021: €11 million net foreign exchange loss) due to the translation of intercompany balances. Interest income on cash balances increased.Adjusted profit before tax was €692 million (HY 2021: €571 million)  up 21% overall and up 11% in constant currencies.The benchmark tax rate on adjusted profit before tax increased to 23.8% (HY 2021: 23.5%)  due to a change in our deferred tax position. Adjusted net profit was €527 million (HY 2021: €437 million)  an increase of 21% overall and 10% in constant currencies.Diluted adjusted EPS was €2.04 (HY 2021: €1.66)  up 23% overall and up 11% in constant currencies  reflecting the increase in adjusted net profit and a 1.7% reduction in the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding to 258.2 million (HY 2021: 262.7 million).IFRS Reported FiguresReported operating profit increased 23% to €640 million (HY 2021: €519 million). The increase reflects the increase in adjusted operating profit and lower divestment-related losses  partly offset by an impairment of certain Health assets.Reported financing results amounted to a net cost of €43 million (HY 2021: €43 million cost).The reported effective tax rate decreased to 23.7% (HY 2021: 24.4%); the prior period reflected a divestment-related loss that was not tax-deductible.Net profit for the first half increased 26% overall to €455 million (HY 2021: €360 million) and diluted earnings per share increased 29% to €1.76 (HY 2021: €1.37).Cash FlowAdjusted operating cash flow was €703 million (HY 2021: €659 million)  down 1% in constant currencies. The cash conversion ratio decreased to 96% (HY 2021: 108%) due to lower working capital inflows and higher capital expenditure compared to the prior period  as expected. Capital expenditures were €139 million (HY 2021: €107 million)  representing 5.4% of revenues (HY 2021: 4.7%).Cash payments related to leases  including lease interest paid  were €39 million (HY 2021: €38 million). Depreciation of physical assets  amortization and impairment of internally developed software  and depreciation of right-of-use assets totaled €143 million (HY 2021: €137 million)  broadly in line with the prior period.Net interest paid  excluding lease interest paid  was €42 million  broadly in line with the prior period (HY 2021: €44 million).Income tax paid increased to €175 million (HY 2021: €127 million)  as expected. The net cash outflow related to restructuring was lower than a year ago at €4 million (HY 2021: outflow of €20 million). Consequently  adjusted free cash flow was €497 million (HY 2021: €476 million)  up 4% overall but down 4% in constant currencies.Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was €71 million (HY 2021: €99 million)  primarily relating to the acquisition of IDS in Governance  Risk & Compliance on April 8  2022. Dividends paid to shareholders amounted to €264 million (HY 2021: €233 million)  representing the final dividend of financial year 2021. Through June 30  2022  cash deployed towards the 2022 share repurchase program totaled €302 million (HY 2021: €201 million).ESG7 DevelopmentsAdvancing our ESG performance and capabilities is core to our strategy. We are focused on delivering high levels of customer satisfaction and innovative  impactful solutions and services; we are nurturing an engaged  talented  and diverse workforce; we are supporting strong ethics  compliance and governance  investing in highly secure systems  and striving to reduce our carbon footprint.In the first half of 2022  we made progress in several areas. We further expanded initiatives designed to attract and retain talent amid tightened global markets for technology and other skilled professionals. To drive recruitment  we expanded talent acquisition capabilities and invested in partnerships and tools to enlarge candidate sourcing  be more visible  and increase our diversity outreach. To support both recruitment and retention  we expanded our career development work and other initiatives designed to support continued high levels of employee engagement and improve belonging.In February 2022  we committed to aligning our practices and reporting to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD) and to setting science-based targets. With regard to this commitment  we have this year made improvements to our existing procedures for scope 1 and scope 2 data collection in order to expand coverage and establish a more accurate baseline. With external advisors  we have developed a roadmap to implement the TCFD recommendations and have made progress on identifying and assessing material scope 3 emissions categories.In the meantime  we continue to drive forward existing programs that reduce our emissions: in the first half  our real estate rationalization program delivered a further 3% organic reduction in office footprint (m2) around the world  following a 7% organic reduction in 2021. Our cloud migration and on-premise server decommissioning program is making steady progress: as of June 30  2022  the number of on-premise servers decommissioned this year exceeds 450 as we migrate customers and applications to more energy-efficient cloud infrastructure.Divisional ReviewOrganic growth and margin performance was strong across all four divisions.Divisional Summary – Six months ended June 30 € million (unless otherwise stated) 2022 2021 ∆ ∆ CC ∆ OG Revenues Health 674 579 +16% +6% +6% Tax & Accounting 843 732 +15% +9% +9% Governance  Risk & Compliance 638 544 +17% +7% +6% Legal & Regulatory 445 425 +5% +3% +6% Total revenues 2 600 2 280 +14% +7% +7% Adjusted operating profit Health 216 181 +19% +8% +8% Tax & Accounting 270 229 +18% +10% +10% Governance  Risk & Compliance 206 175 +18% +7% +6% Legal & Regulatory 69 53 +31% +27% +36% Corporate (27) (25) +11% +8% +8% Total adjusted operating profit 734 613 +20% +10% +11% Adjusted operating profit margin Health 32.0% 31.2% Tax & Accounting 32.0% 31.3% Governance  Risk & Compliance 32.2% 32.1% Legal & Regulatory 15.6%12.5% Total adjusted operating profit margin 28.2% 26.9% ∆: % Change; ∆ CC: % Change in constant currencies (€/$ 1.18); ∆ OG: % Organic growth.Total recurring revenues  which include subscriptions and other renewing revenue streams  accounted for 81% of total revenues in HY 2022 (HY 2021: 81%) and grew 7% organically (HY 2021: 5%).

Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial StatementsNote 1 Reporting entityWolters Kluwer N.V. (the company) with its subsidiaries (together referred to as 'the group'  and individually as ‘group entities’) is a global provider of professional information  software solutions  and services for clinicians  nurses  accountants  lawyers  and tax  finance  audit  risk  compliance  and regulatory sectors. Our expert solutions combine deep domain knowledge with technology to deliver both content and workflow automation to drive improved outcomes and productivity for our customers.These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (interim financial statements) for the six months ended June 30  2022  comprise the group and the group’s interests in associates.Note 2 Basis of preparationStatement of complianceThese interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting  as adopted by the European Union. As such  the financial statements do not include all the information required for a complete set of IFRS financial statements. However  selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to get an understanding of the changes in the group’s financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2021.The interim financial statements for the six months period ended June 30  2022  have been abridged from Wolters Kluwer’s 2021 Financial Statements as part of the 2021 Annual Report. These interim financial statements have not been audited or reviewed by the external auditor. The interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board on August 2  2022.Accounting policiesThe accounting policies applied in these interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the 2021 Financial Statements  apart from the effect of the following new accounting standards and amendments which became effective as of January 1  2022:References to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3);Property  Plant  and Equipment – Proceeds before intended use (Amendments to IAS 16); andOnerous contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37).These amendments did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in the current or prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect future periods.Effect of forthcoming accounting standardsA number of new standards and amendments are not yet effective for the year ending December 31  2022  and have not been early adopted in these interim financial statements. The group expects no significant changes as a result of these new standards and amendments.Functional and presentation currencyThe interim financial statements are presented in euros  which is the company’s functional and presentation currency. Unless otherwise indicated  the financial information in these interim financial statements is in euros and has been rounded to the nearest million.Exchange rates to the euro 2022 2021 U.S. dollar (at June 30) 1.05 1.20 U.S. dollar (average six months) 1.10 1.21 U.S. dollar (at December 31) 1.13Judgments and estimatesThe preparation of the interim financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets  liabilities  income  and expense.In preparing these interim financial statements  the significant judgments made by management in applying the group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation and uncertainty were the same as those applied to the 2021 Financial Statements (reference is made to Note 3 – Accounting Estimates and Judgments of the 2021 Financial Statements).The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not clear from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates and may result in material adjustments in the next financial period(s).Reference is also made to Note 30 - Financial Risk Management of the 2021 Financial Statements  which outlines Wolters Kluwer’s exposure to a variety of risks  including market risk  currency risk  interest rate risk  liquidity risk  and credit risk. These risks have not substantially changed since the issuance of our 2021 Annual Report.Impact of Russian-Ukrainian warIn February 2022  global geopolitical tension began to worsen following the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war. The repercussions on the global macroeconomic scenario  already characterized by difficulties in global supply chains and high inflation rates  are currently highly uncertain. It is likely that the war between Russia and Ukraine could have consequences on global economic activities and spending patterns in current and future periods.Some suppliers of Wolters Kluwer have operations in Ukraine  predominantly in technology support services. Wolters Kluwer has been working closely together with these suppliers to ensure a minimal impact on our products and services.Wolters Kluwer has been carefully considering the future of our customer relationships in Russia and Belarus  where we have a limited footprint  and  above all  what our actions would mean for people in the region. We have discontinued doing business in Russia and Belarus except for certain health products where there are compelling humanitarian reasons.Revenues generated in Russia  Belarus  and Ukraine represented less than 0.5% of group revenues in the first half of 2022 and in full year 2021. At June 30  2022  trade receivables regarding customers based in Russia  Belarus  and Ukraine were neglectable. The Russian-Ukrainian war did not result in an impairment trigger on the group’s non-current assets.Note 3 SeasonalityThe overall impact of seasonality on group revenues and costs is limited. Revenue recognition does not always follow the pattern of cash flows as the revenues for certain license contracts are deferred.Note 4 Benchmark FiguresWherever used in these interim financial statements  the term ‘adjusted’ refers to figures adjusted for non-benchmark items and  where applicable  amortization and impairment of goodwill and acquired identifiable intangible assets.Adjusted figures are non-IFRS compliant financial figures  but are internally regarded as key performance indicators to measure the underlying performance of the business. These figures are presented as additional information and do not replace the information in the consolidated interim statement of profit or loss and in the consolidated interim statement of cash flows. The term ‘adjusted’ is not a defined term under IFRS.Reconciliation of benchmark figuresRevenue Bridge(in millions of euros) € % Revenues HY 2021 2 280 Organic change 160 7 Acquisitions 9 0 Divestments (15) 0 Currency impact 166 7 Revenues HY 2022 2 600 14U.S. dollar 2022: HY average €/$=1.10 versus 2021: HY average €/$=1.21Reconciliation between operating profit and adjusted operating profit(in millions of euros) Six months ended June 30 2022 2021 Operating profit 640 519 Amortization and impairment of acquired identifiable intangible assets 88 60 Non-benchmark items in operating profit 6 34 Adjusted operating profit (A) 734 613For our continuing medical education solutions for physicians (Learner’s Digest)  we identified a triggering event in the first half of 2022 as expectations of market growth deteriorated.

This disposal results in the accounting of a loss in income statement of EUR 3.3 billion before tax  largely absorbed this semester with Group net income share at EUR -640 million. Despite a residual capital impact of -7 basis points over the quarter  the phased in CET 1 ratio remained stable at 12.9% at the end-June 2022.Net banking incomeNet banking income was substantially higher in Q2 22  up +12.8% (+13.4%*) vs. Q2 21  driven by an excellent performance by all the businesses.The healthy momentum continued in French Retail Banking  with an increase in net banking income of +8.5% vs. Q2 21 reflecting notably a good commercial momentum  a high level of service fees and a record performance in Private Banking.International Retail Banking & Financial Services enjoyed strong revenue growth (+21.4%* vs.Q2 21)  driven by a record quarter for ALD and International Retail Banking. As a result  International Retail Banking saw its activities grow +12.7%* vs. Q2 21. Financial Services’ net banking income was substantially higher (+45.1%* vs. Q2 21) while Insurance net banking income rose +7.9%* vs. Q2 21.Global Banking & Investor Solutions once again delivered an excellent performance  with revenues up +18.3% (+16.1%*) vs. Q2 21. Global Markets & Investor Services was substantially higher (+25.3%  +19.8%*) than in Q2 21 while Financing & Advisory activities were at a record level  up +14.0% (+9.1%*) vs. Q2 21.In H1 22  the Group posted strong revenue growth of +14.7% (+14.8%*) vs. H1 21  with growth in all the businesses.Operating expensesIn Q2 22  operating expenses totalled EUR 4 458 million on a reported basis and EUR 4 590 million on an underlying basis (restated for transformation costs and the linearisation of IFRIC 21)  an increase of +8.6% vs. Q2 21.In H1 22  underlying operating expenses were up +7.1% vs. H1 21 at EUR 8 915 million on an underlying basis (EUR 9 787 million on a reported basis). This rise can be explained primarily by the higher contribution to the Single Resolution Fund (EUR +138 million)  the increase in variable remuneration linked to the growth in revenues and the Global Employee Share Ownership Plan (EUR +152 million). The increase in other expenses therefore amounts to EUR +303 million  representing a rise of +3.5% vs. H1 21.Driven by a very positive jaws effect  underlying gross operating income grew substantially in Q2 2022 (+21.6%) to EUR 2 475 million and the underlying cost to income ratio  excluding the Single Resolution Fund  improved by more than 3 points (61.8% vs. 65.1% in Q2 21).In H1 2022  underlying gross operating income enjoyed a strong growth momentum  up +29.8% vs. H1 21 at EUR 5 431 million.The Group now expects an underlying cost to income ratio excluding the Single Resolution Fund of between 64% and 66% in 2022.Cost of riskThe cost of risk stood at a low level of 15 basis points in Q2 22  or EUR 217 million  lower than inQ1 22 which included the cost of risk of the Russian activities sold (39 basis points). It breaks down into a limited provision on non-performing loans of EUR 156 million and an additional provision on performing loans of EUR 61 million.In H1 2022  the cost of risk amounted to 27 basis points.Offshore exposure to Russia was reduced to EUR 2.6 billion of EAD (Exposure At Default) at June 30th  2022.

Furthermore  the Group is aiming to reduce its CO2 emissions by around 50% between 2019 and 2030.Acceleration of digital and technological transformationThe Group wants to accelerate on the digital and technological aspect throughout the value chain. It already has a secure  resilient  and modern IT infrastructure. Our IT strategy aims to better serve our customers in terms of digital offering and customer experience and to continue to increase our efficiency and reactivity. In this respect  the Group is aiming for an IT intensity ratio of between 14% and 15% in 2025.The Group also wants to build the bank of the future by innovating  through partnerships with start-ups and the development of new  differentiating and value-creating business models. It has already demonstrated its ability to develop and create new business models such as Boursorama.Execution of strategic initiativesThe Group’s roadmap is essentially based on the strategic initiatives presented to the market over the last few quarters by different businesses and is structured around three pillars: Retail Banking and Insurance  Global Banking & Investor Solutions and Mobility.In French Retail Banking & Private Banking  the merger of the Societe Generale and Crédit du Nord networks aims to create a new reference bank  rooted in the regions  and fully adapted to the new economic and societal paradigms. This new bank  larger and more coherent  will benefit from an upgrade to increase the customer value proposition  accelerate digitalisation  and improve efficiency. Based on the quality and know-how of the franchises  French Retail Banking intends to accelerate the bancassurance model  extend Private Banking’s expertise to high-net-worth clients and develop the mobility and ESG offering. This strategy aims to position the bank among the top 3 banks in terms of customer satisfaction  with a cost to income ratio of between 67% and 69% and profitability (RONE) of 10%.In recent years  Boursorama has demonstrated the quality of its business model  capable of generating strong growth by benefiting from substantial economies of scale. The number of products per customer has also grown signficantly over the period. The Group wants to take Boursorama to maturity and establish it as the definitive leader in online banking in France. Boursorama is aiming for net income of around EUR 200 million and profitability (RONE) above 25% under the IRBA in 2025.The Group is pursuing its ambition of profitable growth in International Retail Banking by strengthening its leadership positions in its core geographical regions and capitalising on its strong franchises particularly in the corporate market. The Group is aiming for a cost to income ratio of between 50% and 52% in 2025 and profitability (RONE) above 16% in 2025.In Insurance  the Group wants to strengthen its bancassurance model by capitalising on its leadership positions in life insurance and enhancing its offering in protection insurance with a strong ESG focus. The strengthening of retirement savings and partnerships are also strategic and differentiating areas of development between now and 2025. Insurance intends to achieve a cost to income ratio of around 40% and profitability (RONE) above 25% under IFRS4.Mobility becomes the Group’s third pillar with the creation of a major global player resulting from ALD’s acquisition of LeasePlan. It represents a key development area for the Group  with estimated annual growth in the fleet of more than 6% following the integration of LeasePlan  a cost to income ratio of around 45%(1) and a RONE above 20% in 2025.In line with the strategic plan presented in May 2021  Global Banking & Investor Solutions maintains its ambition to be a major European player with the support of a diversified and resilient business model. It is aiming for a cost to income ratio of between 65% and 68% and profitability (RONE) of between 12% and 14% in 2025.Global Markets & Investor Services is pursuing the strategy initiated in 2021 regarding diversifying  rebalancing activities  and innovation  particularly in ESG and digital technology  in order to consolidate its positions and seize market opportunities. Risk appetite is set to remain stable over the period in accordance with the objective of ensuring greater resilience and predictability of performance. Global Markets’ revenues are expected to be within a range of between EUR 4.7 and 5.3 billion.Financing & Advisory is a key development area for the Group  with a target of average annual revenue growth of around 3% over the period 2021-2025. The strengthening of the franchises and the diversification of capital allocation towards the most dynamic sectors  customer segments or geographical regions remains a priority (Technology  Media and Telecoms  healthcare  and renewable energies) in the same way as accelerating the dissemination of ESG throughout the business. The Group is also continuing with its investment towards a more integrated  modular  and open platform in the Global Transaction and Payment businesses.2025 financial targetsThrough the execution of strategic initiatives  the selective allocation of capital to the most profitable and fast-growing businesses  and a focus on advisory and fee-generating activities  the Group is aiming for average annual revenue growth above or equal to 3% over the 2021-2025 period based on the lower end of the expected revenue range in Global Markets.Thanks to the completion of the cost-cutting plans undertaken  the end of the Single Resolution Fund constitution phase and continued strict discipline  the increase in costs is expected to be lower than expected average inflation over the period. On these bases and on the back of revenue growth  the Group is aiming for a cost to income ratio below or equal to 62% in 2025.Moreover  the cost of risk is expected to be at a normalised level of around 30 basis points in 2025.In the case of the CET1 ratio  the Group is aiming for a level of 12% in 2025  after taking into account in particular a capital impact from the finalisation of Basel III estimated at around 120 basis points on a fully loaded basis  excluding output floor (or 100 basis points in 2025  taking into account the phase-in)  and an attractive shareholder distribution policy.As a result  the Group’s profitability (ROTE) is expected to be 10% in 2025.8. 2022 FINANCIAL CALENDAR2022 and 2023 Financial communication calendarNovember 4th  2022 Third quarter and nine-month 2022 resultsFebruary 8th  2023 Fourth quarter and FY 2022 results May 12th  2023 First quarter 2023 resultsThe Alternative Performance Measures  notably the notions of net banking income for the pillars  operating expenses  IFRIC 21 adjustment  cost of risk in basis points  ROE  ROTE  RONE  net assets  tangible net assets  and the amounts serving as a basis for the different restatements carried out (in particular  the transition from published data to underlying data) are presented in the methodology notes  as are the principles for the presentation of prudential ratios.This document contains forward-looking statements relating to the targets and strategies of the Societe Generale Group.These forward-looking statements are based on a series of assumptions  both general and specific  in particular the application of accounting principles and methods in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) as adopted in the European Union  as well as the application of existing prudential regulations.These forward-looking statements have also been developed from scenarios based on a number of economic assumptions in the context of a given competitive and regulatory environment.

It has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at this date. The limited review procedures on the condensed interim financial statements at June 30th  2022 carried by the Statutory Auditors are currently underway.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars’ net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms “Revenues” or “Net Banking Income” are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar’s net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses are defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document. The term “costs” is also used to refer to Operating Expenses.The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e.  a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (« SRF ») are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 – Exceptional items – Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar’s activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:in EUR m H1 22 H1 21 Q2 22 Q2 21 Exceptional operating expenses (-) 872 533 (132) (118) IFRIC linearisation 570 398 (291) (203) Transformation costs(1) 302 135 159 85 Of which related to French Retail Banking 201 60 97 38 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 39 43 25 26 Of which related to Corporate Centre 62 32 37 21 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) (3 303) 0 (3 303) 0 Net losses from the disposal of Russian activities(1) (3 300) (3 300) Net losses from the disposal of Lyxor(1) (3) (3) Total exceptional items (pre-tax) 4 175 533 3 171 (118) Reported Net income - Group Share (640) 2 253 (1 482) 1 439 Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) 3 719 394 2 987 (90) Underlying Net income - Group Share 3 079 2 647 1 505 1 349(1) Allocated to Corporate Centre(2)6 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 43 and 663 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document.

This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (“doubtful”).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notion of ROE (Return On Equity) and ROTE (Return On Tangible Equity)  as well as the methodology for calculating it  are specified on pages 43 and 44 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess return on equity and Societe Generale’s return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group’s businesses  according to the principles presented on page 44 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document.The net result by the group retained for the numerator of the ratio is the net profit attributable to the accounting group adjusted by the interest to be paid on TSS & TSDI  interest paid to the holders of TSS & TSDI amortization of premiums issues and the impairment of goodwill.Details of the corrections made to book equity in order to calculate ROE and ROTE for the period are given in the table below:ROTE calculation: calculation methodologyEnd of period (in EURm) Q2 22 Q2 21 H1 22 H1 21 Shareholders' equity Group share 64 583 63 136 64 583 63 136 Deeply subordinated notes (8 683) (8 905) (8 683) (8 905) Undated subordinated notes - (62) - (62) Interest of deeply & undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations(1) (8) (1) (8) (1) OCI excluding conversion reserves 854 (699) 854 (699) Distribution provision(2) (1 193) (1 021) (1 193) (1 021) Distribution for N-1 (914) - (914) - ROE equity end-of-period 54 638 52 448 54 638 52 448 Average ROE equity* 54 833 52 161 54 751 51 856 Average Goodwill (3 646) (3 927) (3 636) (3 928) Average Intangible Assets (2 723) (2 542) (2 738) (2 524) Average ROTE equity* 48 464 45 692 48 377 45 404 Group net Income (1 482) 1 439 (640) 2 253 Interest on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes (159) (165) (278) (309) Cancellation of goodwill impairment - - 2 - Adjusted Group net Income (1 641) 1 274 (916) 1 944 Average ROTE equity* 48 464 45 692 48 377 45 404 ROTE -13.5% 11.2% -3.8% 8.6% Underlying Group net income 1 505 1 349 3 079 2 647 Interest on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes (159) (165) (278) (309) Cancellation of goodwill impairment - - 2 - Adjusted Underlying Group net Income 1 346 1 184 2 803 2 338 Average ROTE equity (underlying)* 51 451 45 602 52 096 45 797 Underlying ROTE 10.5% 10.4% 10.8% 10.2%(1) Interest net of tax  payable or paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes & undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations(2) The dividend to be paid is calculated based on a pay-out ratio of 50% of the underlying Group net income  after deduction of deeply subordinated notes and on undated subordinated notes(*) Amounts restated compared with the financial statements published in 2020 (See Note1.7 of the financial statements)RONE calculation: Average capital allocated to Core Businesses (in EURm)In EURm Q2 22 Q2 21 Change H1 22 H1 21 Change French Retail Banking 12 295 12 116 +1.5% 12 058 12 162 -0.9% International Retail Banking and Financial Services 10 570 10 158 +4.1% 10 794 10 058 +7.3% Global Banking and Investor Solutions 14 642 13 581 +7.8% 14 386 13 492 +6.6% Core Businesses 37 507 35 857 +4.6% 37 238 35 713 +4.3% Corporate Center 17 326 16 306 +6.3% 17 513 16 144 +8.5% Group 54 833 52 161 +5.1% 54 751 51 856 +5.6%NB: Amounts restated in Q1 22 to take into account the transfer of Private Banking activities (French and international) to the French Retail Banking.

Second Quarter 2022 Results Call. Thank you for your patience.My name is Daisy  and I'll be your coordinator today. You will have the opportunity to ask a question at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the call over to Hans Zayed  the Group Investor Relations Director to begin. So Hans  please go ahead.Hans ZayedThank you  and good afternoon and good morning to our audience in the US. Thank you for joining the OCI N.V. Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call.With me today are Ahmed El-Hoshy  our Chief Executive Officer; and Hassan Badrawi  our Chief Financial Officer. On this call  we will review OCI's key operational events and financial highlights for the quarter  followed by a discussion of OCI's outlook. And as usual  at the end of the call  we will host a question-and-answer session. The quarterly reports and the presentation are available on our IR website that we posted this morning  and I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made on this call involve risks and the actual results will differ materially from these statements.With that  let me hand over to Ahmed.Ahmed El-HoshyThank you  Hans  and thank you all for joining us today. Hassan and I will provide some more perspective on the results we published this morning throughout this call. We're pleased that we continued our strong performance with an adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion for the quarter and $3.8 billion for the LTM trailing 12-month period and a reduction in net debt to a very low leverage level. This enables us to return almost $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders this calendar year and pursue value-creative decarbonization and growth opportunities. However  we have to put these results in a global perspective as the global and especially European macro environment faces many challenges. The uncertainty is particularly true for gas markets in Europe as widely discussed. Many European producers in our industry cannot recover their cash costs due to the high prices of gas  especially those that cannot import ammonia as an alternative. Yet we were able to deliver excellent results as we benefit from our flexibility and diversified platform across Middle East and North Africa  US and Europe and our leading position in the global ammonia market.This enables us to reduce gas consumption in Europe when necessary by replacing that with the ammonia from our global operations as well as third parties. Currently  we're running our ammonia lines at approximately 40% of our capacity in the Netherlands. All this is reflected in our results. We recorded strong results in the US and in Fertiglobe  and we were able to operate our downstream production in Europe profitably while we continue to provide essential nitrogen fertilizers to our European agricultural customers and nitrogen products to our industrial customers. The latter is even more important in the current environment. At OCI  we aim to address potential green shortfalls and be part of the solution to help alleviate overall food security concerns by providing as much product as possible and fill in the play gaps that may arise. Our methanol operations  however  stopped production at the end of June last year when gas prices were already high  making it difficult to run the plant economically.You can also see this in our group's own produced sales volumes of 3.1 million metric tons  which were down 5% during the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021. But this can largely be explained by the continued shutdown of BioMCN in Europe. Our overall European business also benefits from the sale of excess EUAs or CO2 credits  including $88 million reported during the second quarter. As we discussed in our past conference calls  we are excited about our strategic growth opportunities that can both decarbonize and grow our asset base in a value accretive way in the emerging hydrogen economy. We are pleased with our progress on the various projects under development. But as always  and before I hand it over to Hassan  I'd like to cover our top priority  which is safety  as we want all our employees and contractors to go home safe every day. We also see safety as crucial for our business as ESG performance as we improve occupational safety and process safety  reliability and even energy of site will increase all part of our operational excellence program.Our 12-month rolling and reportable incident rate at the end of March was 0.37 incidents per 200 000 man out  slightly higher than at the end of Q1. Despite being below industry averages  we continue to stress our relentless focus on operational and process safety across all our facilities. The whole OCI team is working hard to make this happen. I'd like to thank all our employees for their strong commitment to safety as well as operational excellence and growing our business at the same time via commercial excellence and growth projects. I'll now hand it over to Hassan for further commentary on the company's results. Hassan?Hassan BadrawiThank you  Ahmed. I'll begin with summarizing some positive developments for both OCA and Fertiglobe that occurred in the last few months. Following the earlier upgrade of OCI to investment-grade status is a stable outlook by S&P  resonate credit rating agencies have now also issued first-time investment-grade ratings on our ADX subsidiary  Fertiglobe in June  recognizing its strong free cash flow generation  financial policy and robust outlook. We're also pleased that in the month of June  OCI was included in the MSCI World Index and the Stock 600 Index  making a return to some of the world's leading global equity indices for which we dropped at the beginning of a prolonged downturn for our end markets in 2016. Benefit conclusions coincided with a noticeable step-up in the liquidity of our shares to a consistent $40 million to $50 million per day on average this year compared to previous levels of $10 million to $15 million per day  partially reflecting some share price appreciation and changes in our shareholding structure. In addition  Fertiglobe was also included in the FTSE EM emerging market index in June following its March inclusion in the FTSE ADX15 index  which represents that we see largest and most liquid companies of the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange. We hope that such developments combined with the prospect of a consistent offering of the dividend yield and the exciting growth prospects that lie ahead for OCI in the energy transition should continue to broaden our appeal to the investor community.Turning to the quarter's results. Focusing on the quarter results  OCI's consolidated revenues increased by 95% to $2.9 billion. And as Ahmed mentioned earlier  our adjusted EBITDA rose by 141% to almost $1.3 billion during the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year as we continue to benefit from higher prices for all of our products. And all segments of the business contributed to this growth. In line with our guidance  our adjusted EBITDA is also 33% higher than the first quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year  consolidated adjusted net income saw a marked improvement of 322% and reached $528 million for the quarter  and our reported net income increased by 226% to $478 million. The primary difference between adjusted and reported net income is related to balance sheet FX translations and treatment of one-off refinancing costs. We also generated $928 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. Of note is that this free cash flow figure is after deducting $250 million of dividends paid to non controlling interest. This includes $170 million of semiannual dividends to Fertiglobe's minority shareholders other than OCI. Excuse the interuption. As I was saying  this is after deducting $250 million paid in uncertain interest  which includes $170 million of semiannual dividends to Fertiglobe's minority shareholders other than OCI  minorities in EBIC  which is Fertiglobe's subsidiary and some minorities and some dividends who they met the group minorities.Also after tax payments of 800 -- sorry  this is also after tax payments of $82 million  mostly on [indiscernible] which are up from a year ago due to the improvement in performance. And this is also after interest payments of $51 million  which were down substantially $91 million in the second quarter of 2021 as a result of our continued deleveraging. For the full year  we expect cash interest on gross debt to be below $120 million  which is a substantial reduction from 2021 interest level of over $180 million. Below the free cash flow line  we had cost to the tune of $65 million related to our successful refinancing of IFCo in April  which we covered in the previous quarter results and conference call. We have successfully returned to cash to shareholders of €1.45 per share or the equivalent of $320 million. The first cash payments to our shareholders is our listing in Euronext Amsterdam in 2013. Fertiglobe also paid an interim dividend to shareholders during the second quarter of $340 million  of which 50% was received by OCI and 50%  of course  to ADNOC  our strategic partner and the minority investors in Fertiglobe.After all these cash distributions and one-offs  net debt still declined by $553 million during the second quarter to $708 million as of 30th of June 2022  or the net leverage of 0.2x based on the last 12 months EBITDA of $3.8 million. This is compared to a consolidated leverage of 0.9x as of 31st December 2021. Looking at proportionate leverage as of 30th of June 2022 and based on OCI's ownership  so adjusted for all minorities and including off-balance sheet debt at Natgasoline  the proportionate leverage at 30th of June was 0.5x compared to 0.8x as of March 31st of March and compared to 1.3x as of 31st December 2021.With regards to future returns of capital to shareholders. In early July  we announced the proposal for a cash distribution with respect to the performance of our performance in H1 2022 of €3.55 per share or just over $750 million based on the FX risk day. We have scheduled an extraordinary general meeting for this on the schedule on the 19th of August. And this distribution will bring total return to shareholders during the calendar year 2022 to €5 per share or just shy of a total of $1.1 billion returns to shareholders applying a dividend yield of 15% on yesterday's evening closing price  but that we saw some positive share price movement today  so that number would have changed.Separately  Fertiglobe announced today in line with the dividend policy of distributing excess free cash flow to the shareholders a cash distribution of $750 million for the first half of 2022 payable in October 2022. OCI's share of this dividend will be $375 million accordingly. The 2 dividends  combined with the declared dividends and noncontrolling interest in Algeria  of $342 million  which were related to the last year will result in cash outflows of almost $1.5 billion in the second half of 2022. Even with these cash outflows  we are still poised to maintain a healthy balance sheet  which enables us to continue to return capital to shareholders  balanced while with investing in strategic growth opportunities  both within an investment-grade framework  as we have consistently laid out.On a pro forma consolidated net leverage basis as of 30th of June  after taking into consideration all these proposed cash distributions and without giving any regard to cash generation during the second half  our leverage effectively would be at 0.6x on a consolidated basis and below 1x on a proportionate basis. With regards to growth opportunities and CapEx  there is no change to our CapEx guidance for 2022. We continue to expect around $300 million of maintenance CapEx. In addition  we continue to guide for between 75.50 of growth CapEx depending on the various progress on projects and potential FIDs in 2022. We also maintained our estimate of up to $350 million to $450 million in growth CapEx for 2023  which includes previously announced projects. However  ultimately  all projects depend on factors such as legislation incentives and market developments.Moving to natural gas. Our natural gas procurement -- regarding our natural gas operant and hedging activities. As you will have seen in the press release  we covered that the topic expensively with the prospect. As we saw the prospect of increasing LNG exports in the US  Europe in the coming years  we have locked in a large part of our long-term gas requirements in the United States. As Natgasoline already had hedges in place  this applies mostly to new hedges related to IFCo and our OCI Beaumont operation and marked change in OCI's policy with respect to long-term hedging.In the first half of 2020  Fertiglobe accounted for 60% of our global natural gas consumption. The US accounted for 31%  including our proportionate share of Natgasoline and Europe were on 9% given that our BioMCN operations remains shut. And we are also running our ammonia capacity in Europe at reduced rates around between 40% to 60%. Therefore  the hedging alongside Fertoglobe's favorable gas up life contracts gives good visibility on more than 90% of our long-term gas requirements that further enhances our cost resiliency. For the period between 2023 and 2029  we have hedged circa 50% of our gas requirements in the US and locked in natural gas prices at a weighted average price of $4.3 per MMBtu. For the period between August and December 2022  so the balance of the year  we have hedged circa 60% at a weighted average price of $5.3 per MMBtu  which compares to the Henry Hub price of $8.3 per MMBtu for the September  December 2022 forward curve.Note that OCI does not apply hedge accounting and commodity hedges. Therefore  mark-to-market gains and losses are recognized in the P&L statement  except for the physical purchase contracts  which is treated under their own use exemption methodology  and we're happy to provide anybody who requests some additional narrative on that. However  market-to-market gains or losses on excludes from adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted net income when we reported. Current mark-to-market as of the close of 1st of August 2022 indicates a gain of $184 million in these hedges. With that  I would like invite Ahmed to provide further commentary on results  commodity market conditions and the strategic initiatives of the company. Ahmed?Ahmed El-HoshySure. Thanks  Hassan. Our outlook for our end markets has not changed directionally since we last spoke in May despite volatility that we've seen over the last few months. If I start with the outlook for nitrogen market  we had expected we saw some declines in pricing over the summer in line with usual seasonality but remained at much higher levels than we have seen in the off-season period during 2016 to 2020 downturn given the demand-driven environment we currently see ourselves in today. Going forward  we continue to see an environment with support for pricing for the medium term driven by a few key items. Firstly  the prospect is structurally higher gas pricing environment in Europe for a prolonged period of time. On today's gas price in Europe of $60 per MMBtu  the ammonia support level would be $2 100 a ton for marginal costs  excluding CO2  which people are increasingly viewing as a variable cost.In our presentation  you can see that based on gas price futures  long-term support levels for ammonia  urea and nitric pricing for this year and 2023 are 6 to 9x higher higher than the support level we saw for marginal cost producers during the downturn period of 2016 to 2020. Pricing today is actually materially lower than the support levels  but it is not uncommon to see prices drop below such floor levels during off-season period with low liquidity. Economics have historically prevailed when margins for producers remain negative for a longer period  triggering shutdowns as we have already seen happening in Europe over the last 12 months. In Europe  we estimate that around 7 million tons of ammonia capacity out of the total of 19 is currently shut due to high gas prices. And given elevated futures and risks associated with Russian gas supply  more capacity may be shut down should selling prices remain below gas-based production costs. In total  up to 19 million tons of European ammonia capacity is at risk of being shut if pricing remains materially below cost versus same period of time.Secondly  nitrogen supply is expected to be structurally tighter over the next several years between 2022 and 2026 compared to the previous 5 years with limited new capacity additions. This is exacerbated by a less supply promotion on the ammonia side in the black seed  which impacts circa 2 million tonnes of ammonia or 10% of the global sales. The Chinese government continues to curb exports and prioritize domestic supply at least until H2 2023  which tightens the markets further. Exports are expected to be below the 3 million ton level per year over the medium term and even lower than that level in 2022. To put this into context  in January  the expectation was that China would export over 4 million tons in 2022. As we moved on to May  this number had reduced to $3 million and now has dropped further to $1.5 million for calendar year 2022. This $2.5 million drop in expectations since the beginning of the year represents approximately 2 world-scale facilities running the whole year out.Thirdly  Propundamentals remain supportive for nitrogen demand to help alleviate critical grain shortages. The global grain stocks such ratio remains a decade low and will take at least until 2024 to replenish stocks assuming strong nitrogen applications. Grain futures with US corn futures that are around $6 and weak futures at $8 a bushel from the second half of this year until the end of 2024 remain at levels that incentivize farmers globally to maximize yields by using more nitrogen in grain exporting regions such as the US  Brazil  Europe and Australia  where demand is expected to be robust in 2022 and 2023. Furthermore  dry weather in the US  Europe and Argentina is expected to lower corn and wheat yields  which combined with lower corn production in Ukraine tightens the agricultural cycle even further into 2022.In India  we also expect strong import demand for urea in 2022  with a series of tenders expected to be issued over the coming months to replenish low stock levels and support for [beer] demand. 2022 and 2023 is expected to be higher than last year  given its high wheat prices man for Indian wheat on the back of the Russian Ukraine conflict  good monsoons and nitrogen subsidies in place. In addition  there have now been news reports in the last day that India is rationing gas supplies to fertilizer customers after imports were limited given global LNG shortages into the crush.Now moving on to methanol. The volatility in the macro environment had some effect on prices in Q2  but we've seen some improvements in the stock prices in the last few weeks. Last week  US contract price for [August] settled at $592 per ton  almost the same level as in July. Of course  we are monitoring the macroeconomic environment closely as part of the methanol linked to GDP  but we are currently seeing stable methanol markets into Q3 and continued downstream demand from a diversified customer base. Our operating rates for major derivative segments  including formaldehyde acidic acid MMA are reported to be at healthy rates in the United States and Europe. In China  in particular  economic development is expected to improve as a result of financial stimulus measures.Fuel consumption in China is picking up post-covid lockdowns and higher oil prices are supportive of methanol substitution for other fuels and supported for MTO or methanol olefin economics as a result of higher energy and olefins pricing in China and are supporting operating rates to continue to exceed 80%. Methanol is currently also significantly cheaper than LNG and gasoline and other oil substitutes and can be used as a lower cost and as a cleaner alternative to multiple fuel applications worldwide  including heating and transportation. Looking at the medium term  we continue to expect tighter methanol market fundamentals over the period of 2022 to 2026 with incremental demand expected to exceed supply by approximately 8 million tons and no new major supply expected to come on stream during this year. This does not consider obviously the meaningful upside and additional sense from hydrogen fuel demand  notably for road and in particular  marine fuel applications that  as you all know  is developing.This leads to some comments on our growth strategy and outlook. We continue to make good progress with our pipeline of projects to capture value-accretive opportunities from emerging demand for clean hydrogen as we aim to become one of the largest producers of clean fuels and feedstock. We see large upside from additional demand emerging in a range of new applications and sectors as a result of the hydro hydrogen transition  notably for road and marine fuels applications where ammonia and methanol are ideally positioned. In June  we announced the expansion of our Rotterdam ammonia import terminal  which is the only ammonia import terminal in Rotterdam  and we're tripling the throughput capacity to 1.2 million tonnes per year during 2023. This infrastructure has been crucial in our flexible operating model and the current high gas price environment as discussed earlier. For the second phase  OCI has completed the basic engineering package for the construction of a new ammonia tank at the terminal  which along with the scale up in the jetty infrastructure will allow a potential increase in throughputs above 3 million tonnes per add. The terminal is strategically located to facilitate emerging ammonia demand for bunkering to ocean-going vessels and the unique supply chain is the one we can also leverage in the future by importing low and no carbon hydrogen in the form of ammonia methanol  which can help decarbonize the EU as well as reduce reliance on imported natural gas during [indiscernible].We're also pleased that period a waste and biomass gasification project developed by RWE was selected for funding by the EU Innovation Fund. This project will produce hydrogen at the industrial site in Camila using household waste from Limburg in the Netherlands to replace natural gas. OCI is expected to be the offtaker for the circular of hydrogen to use in our ammonia synthesis  replacing part of our steam methane reformer and to produce hydrogen. Which would result in a reduction in our carbon footprint and lower the carbon intensity of our ultimate products. Throughout the value chain  the project will reduce emission about 500 000 tonnes of CO2 per year  corresponding to the annual consumption of about 26 000 households or 250 000 conventional passenger cars. First  the project is still under development with FID expected in 2023  subject to definitive documentation in commercial briefs.To conclude  we are excited about the prospects for the company. In 2021 and year-to-date 2022  we saw the start of a strong and we believe sustained general improvement in nitrogen pricing. Shorter-term recent nitrogen price movements and the outlook for natural gas provides good visibility and set us up well for Q3 and Q4 of this year. OCI's nitrogen and methanol assets are favorably positioned on the global cost curve given stock spread between the regions. The hedging in place at attractive pricing levels now in the US gives us visibility on more than 90% of our long-term national gas requirements. We are ideally positioned as we leverage our competitive global platform  growth scale young assets and strong logistics platform and harmonize our hydrogen strategy with our continued focus on shareholder and stakeholder value. With that  we'll open the line up for questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. If anyone would like to register a question on the telephone line  please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you would love to withdraw your question please press start followed by two. And when preparing to ask your question  please ensure you are unmuted locally. Our first question is from Christian Faitz from Kepler. Christian  your line is open. Please go ahead.Christian FaitzYes. Thank you. Good afternoon Ahmed  Hassan and Hans. Two questions  if I may. First of all  how do you see ammonia demand for the upcoming fall application in the US? Do you have any early signs from your salespeople on the ground? And then second  can you give us an update on the gas cost situation for both your used and methanol operations as well as for IFCo? Thank you very much.Ahmed El-HoshySure  Chris. Good. Thanks for the question. So obviously  we know that we had a pretty weak ammonia demand for the spring  just given weather conditions that we saw in the US. For this coming fall  we've seen quite a lot of demand for fall prepay  which has helped soak up some of the excess inventory that was in the system following kind of the weak spring that we just ended. And we also see  obviously  exports to Europe that make a lot of sense in this type of pricing environment. So Trinidad and US  Gulf  alone you have to make way the Euro proband grows in the Midwest. So with kind of the reduction in those supplies over time  some of the fall prepay  if the weather cooperates  we should have a record season. And I think the industry will start to work through a lot of the stocks that have been in place from the end of June. Thank you. Could you repeat the second question?Christian FaitzYes. Just update us on your gas costs setup in the use methanol operations and IFCo  please?Ahmed El-HoshySo Hassan walked through  we've done quite a bit of hedging of the underlying gas exposure in the US to the levels that we discussed. I think it was 60% through December and then from the beginning of 2023 until 2028  approximately 50%. And the way we buy our gas in Iowa is actually off of South in our Southwest basis  which is on average usually for the year  quite an attractive basis level  and we would have hedged the basis across most of the hedging. And with regards to OCI Beaumont  we're on the Houston Ship Channel  sub Texas basis. And we've been able to also hedge basis as well as the underlying 99. Are you asking about what you're seeing today in the market? The best price?Christian FaitzYes. Yes  indeed. Indeed.Ahmed El-HoshySo I think I don't have them right in front of me  but basically  you look at the Henry Hub price and to get the basis for A&R Southwest because it's been relatively volatile. That will give you a sense of kind of the underlying gas that we're using to supply our IFCo plant in our Southwest hub  and we have some transport long-term trends we have taken out with TransCanada  our pipeline there. So I think generally  we're about flat to Henry Hub when it comes to Iowa. With regards to Beaumont  Texas  we end up being a little bit of a discount to Henry Hub based on where the fusion ship channel in South Texas bases levels of trading. But you would look at SPX South Texas basis and you look at Houston ship channel when it comes to OCI.Christian FaitzOkay. Great. And then if I may  one last question on IFCo and then I'll shut up. If I'm not mistaken your last bigger turnaround in Iowa and it more or less exactly 3 years ago. So when do you believe the next bigger turnarounds or maintenance is scheduled?Ahmed El-HoshySo I mean  as you know  we don't give kind of guidance with regards to turnaround  but typically  they happen every 4 years  depending on which plants you're at. We had a long outage  which we did a lot of turnaround activities on  as you know  last year. It's actually still reflected in our LTM numbers. So despite the strong LTM performance  Iowa  which is obviously a very important plant in Q3 of 2021 had a very low EBITDA and free cash flow generation because the outage we had there at that plant. So I think in future years  we'll see if we provide more guidance around turnoffs  but they're typically every 4 years. So I'll leave it at that for now.Christian FaitzOkay. That is very helpful. Thank you  Ahmed.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from Lisa De Neve from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open  please go ahead.Lisa De NeveHi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have 2 and the bit related too. First and foremost  can you following on from the last question  you discussed a little bit of demand trends on the ammonia side. But can you also share what you're seeing on the demand side for the other nitrogen products you're selling? And where you're seeing still some levels of potential down-trading or some levels of price elasticity or liquidity concerns  and maybe where you actually see a pickup in demand? And my second question is  in your presentation  you sort of detailed that nitrate stock levels are at pretty low levels. Can you share a little bit about how  for example  urea inventories are at a global level where they are high low? Any sort of indication on that because there's no real data on these things would be helpful. Thank you.Ahmed El-HoshySorry  I was speaking to myself on mute. So back to your question  Lisa  with regards to the the questions on how demand is looking. European farmers are seeing still very strong economics to continue to apply nitrogen for for example  wheat production. And this is despite the drop we saw in pricing on the grain side for both wheat down to $8 a bushel now and corn down to $6 a bushel on the futures for the next few years. You run those numbers and the math around that  they're still making a good margin  and that's why we're seeing increased hedging forward and some buying of fertilizer forward even in this off-season period. So still seeing good demand there  and we've built kind of a healthy order book on nitrates here in the third quarter as we've seen some increased prices.I think I talked previously as well about India  where we still see very low stocks. That's one where we see stocks of about 11% lower than prior period. Still needs several million tons by the end of this year to support the [beer] demand and replenish stock levels as well. So we see imports close to the 9-plus million tons versus the 7 or so last year. On the Latin America side  we've seen demand picking up. Brazil needs another 4 million tons of urea yet  and farmer economics still look quite strong there. And Argentina will need a little over 0.5 million tons  probably close to 600 000 tonnes at that side. Across the system  we're still seeing very low inventories globally historically low levels for almost all nitrogen products. Some of what you talked about with regards to demand destruction  we think was not just  for example  commentary on Europe was not a function affiliate  demand destructure for price  but actual availability.Russia is a big provider of ammonium nitrate and there were just difficulties getting ammonia nitrate and enough stock and levels to get into the market. And when it comes to other areas for kind of ""demand destruction concerns""  areas where it's difficulty in accessing credit  sub-Sahara Africa  some areas in South Asia  outside of India have been a concern. So we've seen multilaterals and government transactions helping support the purchase of nitrogen fertilizer with replenish use levels. So I think that covers most of there other particular geographies you'd like to talk about or specific products?Lisa De NeveNo  sorry  that was actually very helpful. I just wanted to get your thoughts on inventory. And I think the conclusion is that overall inventories have reached quite low levels across those nutrients. I think that's a fair assumption  is that? I mean  to the extent we can see that.Ahmed El-HoshyYes  I'd say that qualitatively  Lisa  I'd say that we think it's historically  the fact that China is not exporting is a big deal. The fact that there's a lot of shutdowns in Europe is a big deal. There was some overhang in the US as you know with some UAN that didn't get put down in June and now you look into Q3  they're getting into that turnaround season and others have announced some turnarounds in Q3. So we're seeing that combined with a decent fill program producing UAN levels. And on the ammonia side  as I stated in the past question  we've seen exports from the US as well as all prepaid sales  really work through some of the stocks there for UAN in athemoment. So those are kind of the 2 levels. And I think now the next step is to see how harvesting looks and where yields are at in terms of the outlook for demand.Lisa De NeveOkay. Great. And I was going to take the following question offline because I think it's a really stupid one  but I'm going to ask it anyway. So in your presentation and your statement  you say that you have now visibility of more than 90% of the company's long-term [debt] requirements. How do we get to the 90%? Is this just US  Fertiglobe  your hedges in place? I mean  how do I get to that 90%?Ahmed El-HoshyYes  that's exactly right. When you think about our overall exposure  it's the combination of where we're at in terms of gas exposure. We do not have long-term hedges or medium-term hedges on in Europe  but we're also not consuming much gas in Europe right now. And with the outlook  it doesn't look like we're going to be running methanol anytime soon  given how stored methanol has been  and that's been the case for over a year now. And with regards to ammonia  we're running at 40% right now. And with the disconnect between product pricing for ammonia and gas cost of producing ammonia  we're assuming that kind of we made a [surge] on that level  put that in the numbers as well as Fertiglobe with the long-term contracts and the US hedging that Hassan talked through.Lisa De NeveOkay. Yeah. That makes sense. Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from Mubasher Chaudhry from Citi. Mubasher  your line is open. Please go ahead.Mubasher ChaudhryHi guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a couple  please. Are you able to provide any guidance range for the second half  given that you had quite a strong first half as well and then we're looking forward to what looks to be a relatively strong second half at all. And any comments around the cadence between the third quarter and the fourth quarter would be helpful. And just on the kind of on the macro level  can you provide any thoughts on the quantity of the harvest being reported on in the recent weeks out of the US? And just trying to gauge around your commentary on stock-to-use ratios not normalizing until at least 2024. Yes  I just wanted to kind of go those 2 comments  please. Thank you.Hassan BadrawiI can take the first question regarding guidance. I mean  we have provided a time certain level of guidance looking at quarter ahead. However  like most of our peers  we usually don't give any existing guidance exept for directional comments on the market outlook  which we hope the ones we provided this quarter were health in that regard  focusing really on sort of pricing environment  the macro variables that underpin our business performance  the predictability of our increased feasibility of our cost base  the most important cost base. So I think the combination of all these is sort of our attempt to give some directional guidance to our investors in the market. But as we get closer  as in November as part of our Q2 results  we will be giving some more guidance on sort of the next dividend cycle as we have a bit more visibility on our order book that's relevant for the performance of that period. And as we continue to sort of see how the markets unfold given the past changing environment. What do you want to add?Ahmed El-HoshyYes. I mean in terms of your other question with regards to harvesting and everything that’s obviously a few months away in the US But in terms of kind of crop conditions today  they’re a bit behind the 5-year average and behind last year in terms of the corn ratings from what we can see at this point. There are concerns on yield in terms of a little bit less nitrogen application that happened in the course of Q2  as you know. And lease planting combined with quite dry weather. So there are concerns about what yield we’ll see come kind of September  October time frame and what that means for grain stocks overall? And this is similar to what we’re seeing in Europe on the very dry summer so far here in Europe. And so those 2 are areas of concern in terms of yields  but I think we’ll see more and no more over the coming months. And I think I did mention earlier  LatAm dry conditions  particularly if we look at the wheat in Argentina. Those are some of the areas where there are concerns about the production there of crops  and then when you look forward and what that means  that means potentially a more difficult time replenishing stocks of grains and driving some of the commentary you were saying about  I think  your last question there  which is the need for replenishing grain stocks to get to more normalized levels because we are at decade lows where we stand today and have risks around the output and the yield that we anticipate seeing later this year.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from Chetan Udeshi from JPMorgan. Chetan  your line is open. Please go ahead.Chetan UdeshiYes  hi. I had two questions. I'm just wondering on your comment that you are running your European ammonia capacity at I heard 40% utilization. I'm curious why are you even running it at this point  even though it's really not going to be profitable. And the second question was  you've talked about  at least we've seen the press filings on some Greenfield projects in the US  are you able to give us some color on how should we think about the CapEx road map for OCI over the next two  three years? Are we talking about a big step up or are we talking about maybe a few $50 million increase per year until you get to a point where there is a peak CapEx on some of these Greenfield blue  green ammonia  or methanol plants globally? And do you worry that maybe some of these new green and blue plants are coming way too soon compared to when the real demand will start to kick in?Hassan BadrawiSure. No  good question. I mean your 40% question makes a lot of sense when you think about our capacity. You talked about 1 million tons per year of ammonia capacity we have in the Southern Netherlands. We announced that we're at around $400 000. To your question  could it be 0 given where we're at right now  it could be 0  and I wouldn't move that out. But when we look at the products that we produce  some of the products we produce  as you know  like urea for the production of melamine or urea for the production of UAN  you need the CO2 from that ammonia line to run some of that. And that's some of the concerns people have and why it's not just an ammonia effect  but it's a UAN effect  is really affected by gas bit.The importance of imports is very important for us to be able to continue to buy ammonia from third parties at $1 000 a ton when the cash cost of making it is still north of $2 000 a ton. So that generates the margin of itself. But we have the ability to potentially shut down both lines and continue to potentially produce CAN because that doesn't need CO2 to produce. So you just import ammonia  you run your nitric acid plant and you produce calcium ammonium nitrate into that market. So yes  it's a good question  and that's one of the areas you can find us in depending on how pricing trajectory moves and how gas prices move. Is that clear on the first question?Chetan UdeshiYes.Hassan BadrawiOkay. With regards to your other question  so we have given CapEx guidance growth CapEx guidance  I think in the prior conference call of $350 million to $450 million a year next year. And that's informed by obviously being within our financial policy and subject to the FID of projects. And so if we FID a project  we'll obviously come to the market with that to announce that we've actually FID'd a project subject to our economic return focus  our focus on decarbonization  and then staying within our investment-grade financial profile target. So that guidance assumes that there's some forward movement in FIDs on potential projects in terms of informing it. So to kind of give you a sense of the bookends of if growth CapEx were to get to that level.Chetan UdeshiUnderstood. Thank you.Hassan BadrawiThank you.OperatorThank you. Before we take our next question  I would just like to remind everyone if they would like to ask a question on their telephone line  please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. Or if you have joined us on the webcast  please write in the question box. The slide presentation can also be found on the webcast under the meeting materials. Our next question is from Faisal Al Azmeh from Goldman Sachs. Faisal  your line is open. Please go ahead.Faisal Al AzmehHi and congratulations on the strong set of numbers. Just a quick or two quick questions on my end. The first one is on your stake in Fertiglobe. I mean  at some point  are you or not thinking about reducing your stake to allow the company to be included in MSCI increased liquidity. Is that something that is being considered or at no stage would you be reducing your stake in the business? That's my first question. And my second question relates to the methanol market. I've been reading that effectively  they're changing the contracts from quarterly to monthly contracts  how do you look at this development? I mean does it change anything at all? Or is this something that is better or worse from your perspective? Thank you.Ahmed El-HoshyYes. So Faisal with regards to your first question  obviously  Fertiglobe is a strategic asset for OCI as well as for ADNOC. So we have the ability of both ADNOC and OCI in the future to reduce the stake. And yes  there's MSCI inclusion  but we would come back to the market and announce plans to do so if we were intending to do so in the near term. So there's a responsibility to do it continues to remain strategic to both the sponsors. We both enjoy the asset significantly and as you know  it's doing very well. But yes  I wouldn't rule that out in the long term. But for now  we're comfortable with the stake that we have in place and obviously has a lot of synergies with OCI's place in business.Hassan BadrawiIt's also a very important growth platform given the positioning of the business as an export platform at a time where exports are very important and the balance sheet is really under leverage  allowing us to look at both growth opportunities and continue to return a really good dividend shareholders going forward. So we're very happy with this partnership and this investment is intense.Faisal Al AzmehThank you.Ahmed El-HoshyAnd then the second question. Your second question  it's in regards to the European contract price  which has been an interesting one that is set quarterly. We haven't been a huge fan of that because as a European producer  we haven't been producing in 13 months out of our BioMCN the European producer. We thought that they're always just going to be this lumpiness and lag and it's not good for the suppliers  and it's really not good for the customers  but we've seen that the suppliers have gotten the short end of the stick often  right? You'll have a 3-month period where global price in methanol change  where gas price in Europe changes you see daily now  and you're set for an entire quarter. So usually  one side's relatively happy as a buyer seller on the other side  conversely unhappy. And so we would likely see how that develops over time. We'd be in support of that and be in line with how monthly contract pricing is set in the US  and you wouldn't just have this disconnected price  for example  where there could be a demand shock or a supply shock in either direction and you're stuck in a quarterly pricing low.Faisal Al AzmehGreat. Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from [Stinch Demeister] from ING. [Stinch]  please go ahead your line is open.Unidentified AnalystYes. Good afternoon. [Stan Demeisters] ING. My question is on the sale of EUAs. Is the entirety of the €88 million recorded in methanol? And should we expect you to continue this policy of selling credits as long as these operations are idle? And then maybe also a follow-up on the question of Mubasher on the cadence of Q3 versus Q4  which I think you haven't really answered. So maybe here some color on this. Thank you.Ahmed El-HoshyYes. So with regards to the $88 million EUA sales that is lost fully in the European methanol business  a portion of that is. I think the number is $68 million has gone into the European results  and there's some cost  obviously  of BioMCN in the business itself  that's a negative. And then the Clean Fuels business has done over a little over $20 million of EBITDA all factored into that. That leaves approximately $20 million that was not reported at the segment level. It was done at the whole co level in Europe. And then to your question of whether we would continue to do so going forward? Kind of just depends on what we're doing operationally at the time. But yes  we think that there is an excess surplus of units that we have. We are able to sell that to offset the cost. But obviously  as you know  kind of as you have less production  we get [indiscernible] over tax. So that's something we take into account. And we're having  I think  quite constructive discussions about the green future of our methanol business in Europe with the Dutch government. You see as this is one of the largest companies in the Netherlands  I think we're number 1 or 2 hydrogen producer consumer who are fully running in the Netherlands. And as a partner in [Norwich] too with some of these projects in the Northern Netherlands where our classes that they'll sell with the electrolyzer hydrogen offtakers in need. BioMCN buying can is a private candidate for that. So we're working through what we can do on that to get to that great future and bridging some of the costs that we have associated with keeping the flat their EUAs. And I think it seems like a good job we're doing purposing some of our personnel to other parts of the business that have been very busy  like the Rotterdam import terminal or our OCI nitrogen plant. So good work across the board kind of collaborating during this difficult time. Your second question  I didn't fully understand. You said something about Q3 and Q4?Unidentified AnalystYes  there was a previous question on sort of how should we look at the cadence or the strength of Q3 versus Q4? Not really guidance  but yes  we're in sort of abnormal situation  should we expect a typical seasonal restarting in Q3 or should that be sort of dampened this year? Your view here.Hassan BadrawiWell  so like we mentioned before  we're reluctant to give any specific guidance for the remaining quarters of the year. I think what we have shared is our view on the price  sort of the support level for nitrogen pricing and the recovery in methanol stock prices. And we  of course -- what is within our control is our continued focus on our manufacturing excellence program and to make sure that our plants are running better CAN not only for the financial results  but because we feel it's our responsibility to do so in such a volatile time where there is inventory levels are low and there's clear shortages across the system as Ahmed described earlier. So the combination of those factors are big motivators for us. But as you can see  the pricing environment continues to be tight and hopefully without any disruption in our operations of note that we should continue to perform well and continue to leverage our position in the global cost curve to generate free cash flow that allows us to move on with our forward with our plans. of being able to look at the growth opportunities that we already guided to in terms of the growth CapEx number for next year using government calls and hopefully continuing to meet expectations and generate excess cash flow that we can give back to shareholders as well. I hope that answers your question to some agree to some degree.Unidentified AnalystTo some degree  yes. Thank you.OperatorThank you. We will now move on to the webcast questions. So over to Hans to read them.Hans ZayedYes. Thank you. There are a few questions from Richford [Backenhouse]. And I'll read the first question  which is in the press release  you mentioned that in a low seasonal period  prices can drop below cost of marginal producers  do you expect a quick ramp-up in prices when demand picks up in Q3? That's the first question.Ahmed El-HoshyYes. As we covered in the call  we've seen good recovery in the nitrogen prices as Hassan has mentioned  kind of the start towards the recovery given the higher cash costs and still operating at a biggest the cash cost right now in Europe with the production curtailments as well as the demand that we talked about the system. Australia  Brazil  India  southern hemisphere type demand that really needs to come up as well as some positive grain-producing hedging going forward to buy some products in the field period and a reasonably strong fall prepay already on ammonia. We think that's supportive  it's hard to give kind of month-to-month guidance  but definitely it has a bit of a bull trajectory from what we're seeing in the market and how we see transactions taking place. I think we talked about methanol spot prices also recovering a bit. That's obviously less affected by European gas. But there's been a recovery there  and I think a lot of outages globally on the methanol side as part of the support into that stock market. Also  we tend to obviously see later in the year  as you recall  some more methanol switching  for example  for industrial boilers  we expect to see that later this year. And I think now methanol's the cheapest  as I mentioned on the last call  it's been relative to other products. So we should see more of that and that could give some support for demand in the East Asian markets and potentially the transport market over time.Hans ZayedThanks. And then the next question is  do you see any signs in recession by lower demands for industrial application of ammonia and methanol?Ahmed El-HoshyYes. So with regards to the reduction in demand  it's also an important question. We have seen some of these kind of higher ammonia price levels. We've seen some demand destruction in some of our products but overall  people are still consuming a reasonable amount of ammonia. And obviously  there's more than enough demand to go around given the shutdowns that we're seeing on the macro side. Given the energy crisis and reductions in supply of kind of energy in the form of methanol and ammonia  we're seeing a lot of supply related reductions offsetting the demand for [indiscernible] . But it's something you have to watch  right? Because the SMB is if you have some demand destruction because they can't get access energy  for example  in Europe or because of the recession  how does that affect overall SMBs? So far from what we've seen  it hasn't been something kind of that gives us a material concern  but it's something we'll continue to monitor  particularly for methanol and ammonia.I think I'll also mention that other industrial products  we're still seeing strong demand for spot diesel exhaust fluid for truck movements. But that's something if there's a recession  if you see some reduction  that's something that we're monitoring closely. But there's a natural increase year-over-year with just increased conversions to SCR engines and global ES demand and less supply for TDS globally that helps support that market. We've seen also melamine pricing continue to be relatively strong with potentially some demand destruction in certain areas  but at the same time  offset by how the business in the United States as well as curtailments in Europe  which are obviously gasoline as well as in China so in offsetting some of the Chinese import Europe. Yes. I mean I think we've covered the main areas.Hans ZayedYes. Thanks  Ahmed. Next question is several US producers note that they have large planned turnarounds in Q3. Are you going to respond to this in the US?Ahmed El-HoshyI mean  as we've stated before  our goal is to maximize production  particularly at these margin levels outside of Europe. So we'll continue to maximize production where we can. I mean we obviously have a time scheduled turnaround  as you know. But we have seen that there have been more turnarounds that have been kind of postponed from last year into the Q3 period  which is typically a bit slow. So that's supportive for that first question that came in with regards to the trajectory of potential nitrogen and ammonia price.Hans ZayedThanks. And then the next question is  what is the current status of ammonia and methanol application as a shipping fuel? When can we expect real demand picking up for this?Ahmed El-HoshyYes. I mean we have seen quite a number of vessels ordered by various players with methanol  the shipping fuel. We expect demand for nontraditional kind of methanol consumers going into  for example  container vessels  et cetera  to come on in 2024  2025. But we already have  for example  Methanex  which is the largest ethanol producer in the world  half of its fleet is running on methanol. Others in the market are running on methanol as well so we're starting to see that fast. Absolutely  the retrofit engine possibilities are there. We have them on the water already. We're very bullish on seeing a lot more methanol demand even as soon as 2024  2025. And as I stated earlier  I think we have demand outstripping supply by 8 million tonnes between 2022 and 2026. That doesn't take into account the marine fuels  which can be quite substantial changes  and we think we're just still to provide per given the movements with the IMO  you focus on decarbonization and people making big CapEx decisions on [indiscernible] saying  ""You know what  I need to have an alter fuel that I can be carbonized and methanol is a good one."" So that's what we see on the methanol side.Ammonia  we see it coming later. Ammonia has a few things kind of potentially going forward on the demand side. Ammonia blending into coal-fired power plants to reduce emissions in Korea and Japan  which is moving along quite swiftly  and we're going to see a few million tons of demand of that probably by the middle of the decade and potentially launch more by the end of the decade. We see increasingly more and more chatter in Europe of using ammonia as a feedstock for a power class for gas-fired power class. And I think we mentioned this in other investor interactions but when you think about taking a ton of blue ammonia out of the Middle East  for example  the US  not even green and it's GHG footprint where you requested the CO2  we take that ammonia  you move it with minus 30 degrees refrigerated on a tanker into Europe and then you combust it in Germany in a power plant or in France in a power plant.The only CO2 emissions were very upstream right in the beginning with the production of that ammonia and you've reduced the carbon footprint of it already  but you're not producing CO2 to move it. You're not producing CO2 when you combust it ultimately in Europe as NH3 so there's no carbon. That compares very favorably to LNG  you have to produce quite a lot of CO2 to liquefy it  you have to have boil-off and produce CO2 on the way to Europe. And then in Europe  you're going to have to produce CO2 again when you combust it for energy. So increasingly  more and more discussion of that where ammonia can be a win-win  particularly with the advent of carbon bordering mechanism to reduce CO2 as well as diversify away from natural gas  imported natural gas  in particular  but potentially even LNG having that as an alternative. Lastly  marine fuels I put at kind of 2025 is where that starts to your question and increasing potentially quite swiftly from there  but there are a few elements that need to come in place. One  primarily and most importantly  the engine  which we think will be ready in  call it  12 to 18 months and then start seeing ship orders for 2025 and into 2026. So following methanol.Hans ZayedThanks. And the next question is why such large dividends and not share buybacks? Do you think your valuation is too high  with not opportunistic buybacks on share weakness and retiring stock not improve long-term per share value will be significantly more valuable?Ahmed El-HoshyYes. I mean  this is the first year of -- we returned capital to shareholders  we mentioned earlier since since we listed on the Euronext Amsterdam in 2013. So we're very pleased that we're out of the gate with such an attractive return and such a meaningful dividend yield. I think we're just shy  as I mentioned earlier of $1.1 billion of cash distributions in a very tax-efficient manner for all our shareholders holders. We wouldn't rule out any other mode of returning capital shareholders. Everything is on the table. We'll be evaluating all available avenues going forward. Normally  I would not and actually I'm not going to comment on valuation per se on this call  but I would point you to a new slide that we added in our results presentation  which we find interesting. And it's looking at just some back on Page 9 of our results presentation  which shows that our market cap growth has been largely a reflection of our net debt reduction despite the underlying performance of the business  the derisked balance sheet and the improved outlook. And I think it's a very interesting choice that we decided to include. So hopefully  that gives some geate content for discussion in terms of the outlook of the company.In terms of forward guidance. And I mean we're reluctant to give any specific guidance per se  but I think the underlying drivers in the market  if we come throughout the call  looking at pricing  looking at our focus on volume reduction and looking at our continued focus on value creation. I think we believe we're in a good position  and we're relatively comfortable with the outlook for the year. And also  we have reduced our gross debt by $1 billion since the beginning of the year and leverage almost consolidated leverage at 0.2x  I think we're in a really good place and poised to really to deal with any conditions that may come our way in the future while maintaining our condition to grow and continue to return capital to shareholders. Thanks.Hans ZayedYes. Thank you. The next question is  can you give an indication on third quarter EBITDA relative to the second quarter given current spreads imply a big drop?Ahmed El-HoshyUnfortunately  we're reluctant to give this kind of guidance. As I mentioned earlier  the underlying drivers of our business continue to be relatively healthy for the remainder of the year.Hans ZayedThank you. And the next question is about how you can promote the company as a clean fuel producer at the upcoming COP 27 and COP 28 conferences? Is there an opportunity to achieve a re-rating for the shares if ESC investors start to understand the story?Ahmed El-HoshySo it's a good question. With COP 27 and COP 28  the stars have aligned quite well with our Fertiglobe business  right? COP 27 is in Egypt  COP 28 is in Abu Dhabi. So obviously  we'll have a presence  a heavy presence in both of those markets. I think increasingly OCI and Fertiglobe's profile has increased over the last year  and we are seeing increasingly more ESG investors looking at the value they can derive by getting into a cash flowing business trading that we believe to be quite low multiples and have the growth trajectory associated with sitting in the markets in which we sit in with the assets that we have that are advantaged to decarbonize and through the hydrogen economy. So we think over time  as ESG investors are looking at where to allocate capital  having an asset or an investment in a company like OCI  companies like Fertiglobe that are cash flow and providing these stable baseline dividends and have solid growth opportunities while below replacement cost with good target IRRs are ones where we're going to showcase in both COPs in both of those locations  working closely with government. I mean the government is a partner as an equity investor in Egypt and our EBIT side at a big partner as a result of wealth Egypt in our EBIT green plant. And we work closely with all the various ministries and stakeholders there in Abu Dhabi. I mean it goes without saying the Abu Dhabi government is a shareholder of Fertiglobe. It is a gas provider at Fertiglobe  and we're doing blue and green ammonia projects together with [Postel] as well as ADQ and ADNOC there. So quite a lot of opportunity over the next 2 COPs to showcase OCI and increase the already growing interest from ESG investors.Hans ZayedThank you. I think that was the last question that came from one of our investors in 91. I don't see any other questions on the web either.Ahmed El-HoshyAll right. Thanks  Hans. Thanks  everyone for your patience on the call today. So to get back to your summer  and we look forward to catching up for Q3 results.Hassan BadrawiThank you.OperatorThank you  everyone  for joining today's call.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and services  today announces that its subsidiary Banglalink has reached an agreement with Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL) for a tower sharing initiative.Kaan Terzioglu  CEO of VEON Group: “VEON’s future centers around an asset-light business model that enables us to focus on providing our customers high-quality connectivity and world-class digital services. By reducing our direct ownership of capex-intensive tower infrastructure  we can focus on these high-growth digital services  delivering greater value to our shareholders and our customers. The tower sharing agreement reached with BTCL represents another step towards implementing this strategy and follows similar deals in other operating countries.Under the agreement  BTCL will share its tower infrastructures with Banglalink. The initiative will enhance Banglalink’s quality of services further by supporting its 4G expansion drive  ensuring energy-efficient operations and optimizing the use of Bangladesh’s national resources.“We always welcome network sharing opportunities to serve our customers better and ensure proper utilization of resources and infrastructures.” Erik Aas  Chief Executive Officer  Banglalink said  “In the last year  we have added more than 3300 4G base stations to our network; many of these are based on shared infrastructure. We will continue to expand the network  and our partnership with BTCL will give a fresh impetus to this endeavor. We are looking forward to further sharing opportunities of passive and active telecom infrastructure in the future.”“We are happy to enter into this partnership with Banglalink. Since last year  we have been sharing our fibers with Banglalink  achieving positive results for us both.” Stated Dr. Md. Rafiqul Matin  Managing Director  BTCL. “As a country  we have reached an impasse where infrastructure sharing can be an effective way to tackle national and global challenges. This initiative is an example of how two organizations can benefit from partnering.”Story continuesAbout VEONVEON is a digital operator that provides converged connectivity and digital services to over 200 million customers.
