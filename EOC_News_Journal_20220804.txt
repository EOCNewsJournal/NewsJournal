8602,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/best-outdoor-tv-antennas/,The best outdoor TV antennas for 2022,If you've been thinking about cutting the cord with your cable provider  an outdoor TV antenna is a great way to pick up local and regional stations.,Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us?Thinking of cutting the cord? Tired of paying for cable channels that you never watch? If your household is all about network news  local sports  and the shows broadcast on your local affiliate stations  a TV antenna is an excellent way to supplement the lack of broadcast TV stations that streaming services don't provide  giving you access to free  over-the-air broadcasts.Combined with a streaming device (for things like Netflix and Disney+)  a TV antenna can totally satiate the TV-watching needs of most households for a complete cable-free package.But why not an indoor TV antenna  you might ask? If your house is situated in a location with obstructions like mountains  tall buildings  or lots of trees  or if the building's materials contain things like brick or stucco (some appliances can affect signal  too)  there may be too much interference for a clean digital signal. While putting your antenna near a window or even in the attic can help  it might not do the trick. That's where mounting an outdoor TV antenna on your roof or other high-up location comes in to give you the best signal possible. In fact  many outdoor TVs are designed to pick up stations hundreds of miles away.Whether you're tired of that monthly cable bill or you're simply looking for an alternative way to grab stations from distant zip codes  we've assembled this roundup of the best outdoor TV antennas to help you decide which unit is best for your rooftop or attic.Winegard Elite Outdoor Antenna The best outdoor TV antenna for most people Jump to details More Antennas Direct Clearstream 4V The best multidirectional outdoor TV antenna Jump to details More RCA Amplified Outdoor TV Antenna The best outdoor TV antenna for design Jump to details More PBD ‎WA-2608 The best motorized outdoor TV antenna Jump to details More Antop AT-800SBS The best outdoor TV antenna for features Jump to details More Show 2 more itemsWinegard Elite Outdoor AntennaThe best outdoor TV antenna for most peoplePros Receives signals up to 70 miles awayPicks up both VHF and UHF broadcastsOptimized for 4K broadcastsIncludes mounting hardware Cons Directional onlyA little expensiveWhy you should buy this: You want a great outdoor antenna from a trusted name and plan on splitting the signal to multiple TVs in your home.Who it's for: Homes that are a good distance away from any broadcast towers.Why we chose the Winegard Elite Outdoor Antenna:When it comes to maximum strength and performance  the Winegard Elite WE7550A is our top pick for an outdoor antenna. Rated to pick up stations at over 70 miles away and featuring Winegard's ultra-low noise filter  you'll be able to pick up broadcasts with little to no degradation in picture and sound quality.This model is also capable of receiving both VHF and UHF antenna signals  and with Winegard's TwinAmp Technology  both broadcast types receive a signal boost  ensuring your TV is receiving a crystal-clear picture no matter the type of incoming content.Designed for attic or roof installation  the Winegard Elite comes with everything you need to mount and assemble the antenna. In fact  many customers have claimed that the Elite is great for picking up broadcasts from all directions  even though it's only a directional antenna.With its reliable performance and durable design  it's easy for us to call the Winegard Elite our favorite antenna overall. Just keep in mind that if you're interested in getting signal to multiple TVs at once  you'll need to purchase a splitter separately.Winegard Elite Outdoor Antenna The best outdoor TV antenna for most people MoreAntennas Direct Clearstream 4VThe best multidirectional outdoor TV antennaPros Receives both VHF and UHF signalsOptimized to receive broadcasts up to 70 miles awayDesigned for multidirectional useIncludes mounting hardware Cons A little expensiveLackluster instructionsMay require an amplifier for some homesWhy you should buy this: You're limited to where you can mount an outdoor TV antenna and require one that has excellent range.Who it's for: Homes that have various obstructions between the house and the direction of a broadcast tower.Why we chose the Antennas Direct Clearstream 4V:Sometimes it's next to impossible for certain households to operate a directional outdoor TV antenna. This may be because there are various obstructions between your home and a broadcast tower  like dense trees and tall buildings  or perhaps the tower is geographically north but the only place you can mount an antenna is facing south.Whatever the holdup  that's why there are antennas like the Antennas Direct Clearstream 4V. Built from the ground-up as an omnidirectional outdoor TV antenna that can receive broadcasts up to 70 miles away  the Clearstream 4V is designed to be mounted to your roof or installed in an attic. In terms of onboard tech  the VHF and UHF elements are optimized for multidirectional receiving  ensuring that you'll get the strongest possible reception no matter where you're living and where the nearest broadcast towers are.The Clearstream 4V also comes with a 20-inch mast and pivoting base  so you'll be able to mount it to any type of roofing  regardless of shingling or slant. While some customers have had trouble with installation and others have had to use amplifiers to boost incoming signal  Antennas Direct is one of the top names in the outdoor TV antenna market  and the Clearstream 4V is one of the most powerful  multidirectional outdoor TV antennas you can buy.Antennas Direct Clearstream 4V The best multidirectional outdoor TV antenna MoreRCA Amplified Outdoor TV AntennaThe best outdoor TV antenna for designPros Receives signals up to 80 miles awaySpiral design ensures optimized performanceIncludes mounting hardware and coaxial cableReceives both VHF and UHF signals Cons Can perform differently based on type of coax usedWhy you should buy this: You need an antenna that can grab far-off broadcasts and aren't willing to invest in a large model.Who it's for: Those looking for an antenna that can receive plenty of stations  regardless of signal type or where it's mounted.Why we chose the RCA Amplified Outdoor Antenna:A first glance at this RCA outdoor antenna may have you wondering why the company decided to opt for a spiral design. It's for a good reason  actually  and it's why we're awarding this RCA antenna for its design.Where traditional outdoor TV antennas are designed for a directly vertical or horizontal plane  RCA says its spiral design with wedged notches actually boosts weak signals  allowing it to receive broadcasts that are more than 80 miles away.We also appreciate that the RCA antenna comes with all the mounting hardware you'll need for roof-mounting or attic installation in addition to a 16-foot spool of coaxial cable. If you're not sure where to mount the antenna  there's even a handy RCA Signal Finder app (for iOS and Android devices) you can download to help you pinpoint the location of the nearest broadcast towers.RCA Amplified Outdoor TV Antenna The best outdoor TV antenna for design MorePBD ‎WA-2608The best motorized outdoor TV antennaPros Can be rotated 360 degreesReceives signals up to 150 miles awayCapable of picking up VHF and UHF signalsIncludes mounting hardware and coaxial cableGreat price Cons No way of telling which way the antenna rotatesWhy you should buy this: You've had TV antennas before and have noticed signal going in and out depending on the time of day.Who it's for: Homes located along busy flight paths and wedged between other broadcast tower obstructions.Why we chose the PBD WA-2608:Depending on the type of weather or other types of sky-based obstructions near your home (maybe your house is situated along a busy airport flight path)  installing an outdoor TV antenna may only be slightly better than the performance you'll receive with an indoor model. But when you opt for a unit like the PBD WA-2608  your antenna experience becomes much more customizable.This is because the WA-2608 is a motorized outdoor TV antenna. Once installed on your roof  a remote control allows you to rotate the antenna 360 degrees  allowing you to adjust the antenna if there's something impeding the signal between the broadcast tower and the PBD.The WA-2608 is also designed to pick up both VHF and UHF signals and features a built-in splitter  so you'll be able to send signals to two different TVs at once. In terms of range  this is also one of the most far-reaching outdoor TV antennas of our roundup  capable of grabbing stations over 150 miles away.While some customers claim that they've only received stations up to 80 or so miles away from their home  that's still an impressive metric that many households would be more than happy with.PBD ‎WA-2608 The best motorized outdoor TV antenna MoreAntop AT-800SBSThe best outdoor TV antenna for featuresPros Multi-directionalReceives signals up to 85 miles awayIncludes FM receptor for receiving radio signalsIncludes mounting hardware and 40 feet of coaxial cable Cons A bit expensiveNot as popular as other outdoor antennasWhy you should buy this: You want a versatile outdoor TV antenna that can be used indoors  too.Who it's for: Homeowners that may not have the ability to mount a TV on their roof or in an attic.Why we chose the Antop AT-800SBS:Who says that an outdoor TV antenna can only be mounted to your roof? For homeowners looking for a powerful antenna that can be placed both outdoors and indoors  the Antop AT-800SBS is our go-to pick.Not only is the AT-800SBS a multi-directional model  but it's designed to receive broadcasts up to 85 miles away.

The trial is evaluating Onivyde® (irinotecan liposomal injection) versus topotecan in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC)  who have progressed on or after platinum-based first-line therapy treatment. RESILIENT is a Phase III trial conducted in two parts; the first part read out in 2020 confirming the safety  dosing and efficacy of Onivyde; part two is evaluating the efficacy of Onivyde versus topotecan. Detailed results from the RESILIENT trial will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.The analysis concluded that the primary endpoint OS was not met in patients treated with Onivyde versus topotecan. However  a doubling of the secondary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) in favor of Onivyde was observed. The safety and tolerability of Onivyde was consistent with its already-known safety profile  and no new safety concerns emerged. The clinical study results will be communicated with the regulatory agency.Howard Mayer  M.D.  Executive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Ipsen  said: "" While the results from the analysis of the RESILIENT trial have not demonstrated an overall survival benefit with Onivyde in patients in second-line small cell lung cancer  we will now work with our teams to analyze the data further before decisions regarding next steps are made. These data confirm the complexities associated with treating small cell lung cancer. We wish to thank the patients  their families and healthcare teams for their participation in this clinical trial.”Onivyde is currently approved in most major markets including the U.S.  Europe and Asia in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. Onivyde is not indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Ipsen will continue to explore the potential of Onivyde in other areas  and the final data readout of the NAPOLI-3 Phase III trial in first-line pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is expected in H2 2022.ENDSAbout RESILIENTRESILIENT is a randomized  open-label Phase III trial of Onivyde (irinotecan liposome injection) versus topotecan in patients with small cell lung cancer who have progressed on or after platinum-based first-line therapy. The trial is being conducted in two parts:Part 1: Open-label dose-finding trial of Onivyde. 30 patients were enrolled.Part 1 Primary endpoints: Describe the safety and tolerability of Onivyde monotherapy administered every 2 weeks Determine the optimal Onivyde monotherapy dose for Part 2 of this trialPart 2: A randomized  efficacy study of Onviyde versus intravenous (IV) topotecan. Approximately 450 patients were enrolled in part 2.Part 2 objectives: To compare overall survival (OS) following treatment with Onivyde with OS following treatment with IV topotecanThe primary outcome measure is OS.

For more information  visit ipsen.comIpsen’s Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

The combined contributions of the OFFITAG and ASCAETIQ offerings and the restructuring of the latter's electronic labelling business also contribute to this growth momentum.Story continuesItaly: +17.91% to €5.30m.The investment plan (recruitment campaigns  opening of new branches) is beginning to produce results  both for pharmacies and wholesaler-distributors. This Business Unit is continuing to grow at a sustained pace  mainly in response to increased synergies with France  the launch of the latest generation of id. software and the deployment of new European products (id.TAG  id.LOCKER  id.EASYQ  etc.).Belgium: +13.40% to €1.37m.The situation is improving  though remains fragile as pharmacists and pharmacy groups are continuing to experience financial pressures impacting their capacity to invest.Digital Communications Business Unit: +13.38% to €1.32m.The increased offering of services for pharmacies  industry and pharmacy groups (for example  the SAILFI loyalty programme) contributed to the growth in revenue.The AXIGATE LINK Division had sales of €15.14m  up 8.40% from H1 2021.This Division accounts for 14.62% of total Equasens Group revenue.After a more subdued first quarter  all business sectors were up as commercial momentum strengthened.Nursing home sector: +7.80% to €7.68m.In Belgium  MALTA BELGIUM's nursing home business is steadily expanding  as it prepares for the launch of the new multilingual cloud-based version of the flagship software suite  TITANLINK.Hospital-at-Home sector: +2.48% to €2.67m.Although marginally impacted by the lead time for implementing the Ségur programme (-12.44% in Q1)  this Business Unit is now benefiting from the qualification of its DOMILINK HAD software for this programme to strengthen the deployment of its offerings (+17.34% in Q2).Hospital sector: +7.74% to €2.14m.The business development process for hospital groups is long and complex. This being said  the HOSPILINK solution’s very recent qualification for the Ségur programme on 25 July 2022 is expected to have a significant impact on open calls for tender as well as prospecting activities addressing regional hospital networks.The Healthcare Establishment and Private Practice sector: +13.29% to €2.34m.PANDALAB is continuing to roll out pandaLAB Pro with more than 17 000 healthcare professionals connected to this secure instant messaging system.Telemedicine sector: +68.16% to €0.31m.While marginal (0.30% of total revenue)  the Group has made significant commitments to support this Business Unit: signature of a remote monitoring agreement for bariatric surgery patients with the Nancy Regional and University Hospital Centre (CHRU)  finalisation of a technical partnership with MWS to equip the large majority of nursing homes and manage CARELIB EHPAD notifications (fall detection and medical alerts) ""to the right people  on the right platform (in particular the DECT mobile devices of nursing staff  but also within the pandaLAB Pro and TITANLINK solutions) at the right time"".The E-CONNECT Division had sales of €9.08m  up 19.52% from H1 2021 and accounting for 8.77% of Equasens Group revenue.

In particular:in the United Kingdom  by combining CAREMEDS' eMAR medication traceability solution with MALTA INFORMATIQUE's TITANLINK facility management solution (MALTA intends to replicate its Business Model  based on the successful example of MALTA BELGIUM in Belgium);in Germany  by enhancing MULTIMEDS’ manual dispensing range with the Group's pharmacy automation solutions  and in particular the addition of AUTOMEDS' semi-automatic dispensing systems  which are perfectly suited to the German market in terms of design and capacity.The Ségur qualified HOSPILINK solutionFollowing the success of MédiStory 4 (a software suite for physicians from the MEDICAL SOFT Division) and DOMILINK HAD (a Hospital at Home solution from the AXIGATE LINK Division)  on 25 July 2022 Equasens Group announced HOSPILINK’s qualification in the Hospital category for the Ségur investment programme. Developed by AXIGATE teams  this application addresses the needs of hospitals  regional hospital groups  specialised  post-acute and rehabilitation facilities (AXIGATE LINK Division).In line with the validation procedures (DSR or Dossier de Spécifications de Référencement or Software Specification Requirements)  French Digital Health Agency (Agence du Numérique en Santé or ANS) teams ensured that the software complied with the technical  functional and ergonomic specifications. During its review of the HOSPILINK application  the ANS certification board noted that ""the management of data and compliance with the procedures of the core services (were) carried out within an application framework provided reasonable guarantees with respect to compliance with the specifications and compliance scenarios as issued"".This qualification - the 3rd in 2 months for Equasens Group - was awarded within the framework of the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) category for the profiles:Hospital - EMR: GeneralHospital - EMR: Patient Health ID integrationHospital - EMR: Web client EMR.2022 outlookAfter a slower first quarter  the pace of growth picked up in Q2 and Equasens Group confirms its goal of maintaining this momentum for the full year.In this context  funding provided by the public authorities through the French Digital Healthcare programme (Ségur du Numérique en Santé) should facilitate and even accelerate sales of the Group’s software extensions. The Group in consequence intends to manage Ségur projects while continuing to develop its other specialised activities (the Digital Health Gateway  the NOVIAcare programme  e-health technological solutions  etc.)  which have made Equasens Group a key player in the healthcare ecosystem.Financial calendar:New dates for the communication of half-year results:Publication of H1 results: Thursday 22 September 2022 (after the close of trading).Presentation of H1 results: Friday 23 September 2022 at 11:30 am in Paris.Publication of Q3 2022 revenue: 9 November 2022 (after the close of trading).About Equasens Group:With more than 1 200 employees fulfilling a vital role as “Citizens in the Service of Health and Well-Being”  Equasens Group is today a key player in the European healthcare sector  providing software solutions to all healthcare professionals (pharmacists  primary care practitioners  hospitals  Hospital-at-Home structures  retirement homes  health centres) in both primary and secondary care sectors.With operations in France  Italy  Belgium  Luxembourg  the United Kingdom and Germany  Equasens Group is currently developing the leading healthcare platform and a unique ecosystem in France and Europe benefiting people by making available the very best of technology.Listed on Euronext Paris™ - Compartment AIncluded in the Euronext Tech Leaders segment and the European Rising Tech labelIndexes: MSCI GLOBAL SMALL CAP - GAÏA Index 2020 - CAC® SMALL and CAC® All-TradableEligible for the Deferred Settlement Service (“Service à Réglement Différé” - SRD) and equity savings accounts invested in small and mid caps (PEA-PME).ISIN: FR0012882389 - Ticker Code: EQSFor all the latest news on Equasens Group go to www.equasens.comCONTACTSAnalyst and Investor Relations:Chief Administrative and Financial Officer : Jean-Yves SAMSONTel. +33 (0) 83 15 90 67 - jean-yves.samson@equasens.comMedia Relations:FIN’EXTENSO - Isabelle APRILETel. +33 (0)1 39 97 61 22 - i.aprile@finextenso.frAttachment",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.31,0.26,0.43,True,English,"['Pharmagest Interactive', 'H1\xa02022 Revenue', 'EQUASENS', 'Ségur du Numérique', 'Social Care Facilities Solutions Division', 'French Digital Healthcare investment programme', 'secure instant messaging system', 'new multilingual cloud-based version', 'Digital Communications Business Unit', 'Europe Pharmacy Solutions Division', 'PRESS RELEASE H1 2022 Revenue', 'The AXIGATE LINK Division', 'new medical software Division', 'total Equasens Group revenue', 'Ségur programme', 'The Healthcare Establishment', 'supplier certification applications', 'Ségur” offerings', 'flagship software suite', 'DOMILINK HAD software', 'remote monitoring agreement', 'CARELIB EHPAD notifications', 'DECT mobile devices', 'new European products', 'SAILFI loyalty programme', 'electronic labelling business', 'business development process', 'bariatric surgery patients', 'University Hospital Centre', 'Private Practice sector', 'total Group revenue', 'Full-year growth targets', 'regional hospital networks', 'The PHARMAGEST Division', 'The E-CONNECT Division', 'nursing home business', 'H1 2022 business highlights', 'Nursing home sector', 'PROKOV EDITIONS acquisition', 'total revenue', 'e-health solutions', 'Total H1', 'healthcare professionals', 'investment capacities', 'investment plan', 'id. software', 'Hospital sector', 'government programme', 'new organisation', 'new branches', 'TITANLINK solutions', 'pharmacy groups', 'business sectors', 'medical alerts', 'consolidated revenue', 'dependent patients', 'hospital groups', 'Nancy Regional', 'nursing homes', 'nursing staff', 'Telemedicine sector', 'Q2 revenue', 'Villers-lès-Nancy', 'economic context', 'H1 2022 Change', 'six-month period', 'marginal change', 'respective contributions', 'combined contributions', 'ASCAETIQ offerings', 'growth momentum', 'recruitment campaigns', 'sustained pace', 'latest generation', 'financial pressures', 'first quarter', 'commercial momentum', 'lead time', 'HOSPILINK solution', 'significant impact', 'open calls', 'significant commitments', 'technical partnership', 'large majority', 'fall detection', 'right people', 'right platform', 'right time', 'pandaLAB Pro', 'recent qualification', 'prospecting activities', 'MALTA BELGIUM', '9.03 % Q2', 'August', 'CET', 'Gains', 'Divisions', 'exception', 'FINTECH', 'Effects', 'Santé', 'Teams', 'timeline', 'rollout', 'Q1', '30 June', '1 January', 'well-being', 'sales', 'France', 'pharmacists', 'OFFITAG', 'restructuring', 'Story', 'Italy', 'opening', 'results', 'pharmacies', 'wholesaler-distributors', 'response', 'synergies', 'launch', 'deployment', 'LOCKER', 'EASYQ', 'situation', 'capacity', 'services', 'industry', 'example', '25 July', 'tender', 'signature', 'CHRU', 'finalisation', 'MWS', '6:00', '11.', '10.30', '7']",2022-08-03,2022-08-04,finance.yahoo.com

The approval was granted by the Ethics Commitee and the Regulatory Authorities.This first feature of Pixium Vision’s new remote patient engagement platform will allow patients to conduct rehabilitation sessions from home  with or without the help of a family member or a caregiver. The platform requires only a tablet  provided by Pixium  and an internet connection to be fully functional. Over the coming months  more innovative features are expected to be added to the platform to help dry AMD patients live a more independent life.The PRIMAvera study aims to confirm the safety as well as the benefits provided by the Prima System and is the last clinical step before seeking market approval in Europe. The study was initiated in Q4 2020 in France  and the first patient was implanted in March 2021. Pixium Vision has since established clinical sites and implanted its first patients in Germany  the UK and the Netherlands. The opening of additional clinical sites is planned in Spain  and Italy during 2022. Pixium Vision expects to complete recruitment by the end of 2022  leading to a read-out of the PRIMAvera study around the end of 2023 and a regulatory submission in Europe in H1 2024.Story continues""The approval of the remote rehabilitation allows patients enrolled in our PRIMAvera pivotal study and French Feasibility Study to complete the majority of their training in the comfort of their own homes with a simple technical set up and without the need for repeated trips to hospital "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""We are using apps specifically designed for our patients as well as employing gamification principles to make the rehabilitation process as engaging and effective as possible. We also expect the remote patient engagement platform  thanks to upcoming additional functionality  to encourage better communication between patients and their physicians and among patients themselves. Over the last few months  we have successfully continued to move the Prima System closer to the market and this remote rehabilitation process will be a critical element of the real-life process once this revolutionary system is commercialized in a couple of years.""Remote rehabilitation has been approved in France  Germany  Italy  Spain and the Netherlands for patients who have succesfuly completed their initial in-clinic rehabilitation sessions. The remote rehabilitation sessions will take place between the patient and the rehabilitation specialists and will be of the same nature as the in-clinic rehabilitation sessions. The platform will also allow clinicians to track the progress of patients at any time and to adjust the frequency of the remote rehabilitation sessions based on the progress of each patient. Given the age and lack of vision of the patients enrolled in the clinical studies  remote rehabilitation will make it simpler for patients to comply. Pixium Vision’s unique remote patient engagement platform is a tailor-made solution to ensure appropriate rehabilitation.“In order to achieve the best visual function following implantation  it is paramount for patients to adhere to a comprehensive rehabilitation process. Getting patients fully engaged in this rehabilitation process will secure the best results. The new remote rehabilitation module of the PRIMAvera trial allows patients to train daily at home  thus decreasing the burden of frequent in-office sessions. This would be a hybrid rehabilitation scheme mixing in-person rehabilitation sessions with supervised remote home training. Recent developments are making the remote training system increasingly easier to use and patient-friendlier ” said Dr. Villani  Director of the Low Vision and Microperimetry Center of Verona “C.R.I.M.” (Centro Riabilitazione Ipovedenti e Microperimetria – Verona  Italy). “Also  the gaming nature of some training exercises – as well as the ability to communicate easily with physicians  nurses  family members and other patients – will further motivate patients to engage in the training and allow physicians to better track progress and adapt the rehabilitation as needed. The platform will also help us researchers gather precious information to further improve the training over time.”A total of 38 patients will be enrolled in the PRIMAvera study  an open-label  baseline-controlled  non-randomized  multi-center  prospective  single-arm pivotal trial. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline to 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

Benchmark figures are performance measures used by management. ROIC is based on twelve-months rolling figures. See Note 4 for a reconciliation from IFRS to benchmark figures.Full-Year 2022 OutlookWe are increasing our guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC in reporting currency and for adjusted EPS growth in constant currencies. We reaffirm our outlook for adjusted free cash flow in constant currencies. While first half organic growth was better than expected  we expect organic momentum to slow in the remainder of the year  largely due to challenging comparables. We expect second half margins to reflect increased hiring and investments. Growth in diluted adjusted EPS will be dampened by a return to our historical tax rate. Revenues from Russia  Belarus  and Ukraine (mainly in Governance  Risk & Compliance) represented less than 0.5% of group revenues in 2021 and HY 2022.Story continuesFull-Year 2022 Outlook Performance indicators 2022 Guidance Previous 2022 Guidance 2021 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.0%-26.5% 25.5%-26.0% 25.3% Adjusted free cash flow €1 025-€1 075 million €1 025-€1 075 million €1 010 million ROIC* 14%-15% Around 14% 13.7% Diluted adjusted EPS growth Mid- to high-single-digit Mid-single-digit €3.38 *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2022 of €/$1.07. Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.18). Guidance reflects share repurchases of €1 billion in 2022.If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a positive effect on 2022 results reported in euros. In 2021  Wolters Kluwer generated more than 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2021 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 2 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS1. Also  if current rates persist  we expect to incur a (non-cash) foreign exchange loss on intercompany balances at year-end.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We currently expect that restructuring costs will increase to within our normal range of €10-€15 million (FY 2021: €6 million). Due to higher interest rates on cash balances  we now expect adjusted net financing costs2 in constant currencies to be approximately €55 million. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be in the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2021: 21.5%). Capital expenditure is expected to increase but to remain within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). We continue to expect the full-year cash conversion ratio to be in the range of 100%-105% (FY 2021: 112%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.2022 Outlook by DivisionHealth: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels (mainly due to the absence of a contract win of the size of the 2021 ASCO deal) and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Tax & Accounting: we expect organic growth to accelerate from 2021 levels and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we continue to expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  mainly due to an expected decline in transactional revenues in the second half. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to improve for the full year.Legal & Regulatory: we now expect organic growth to improve on 2021 levels. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to decline modestly for the full year due to the absence of a one-off pension amendment recorded in 2021.Our Mission  Business Model and StrategyOur mission is to empower our professional customers with the information  software solutions  and services they need to make critical decisions  achieve successful outcomes  and save time. We support professionals across four main customer segments: health; tax & accounting; governance  risk & compliance; and legal & regulatory. Every day  our customers face the challenge of increasing proliferation and complexity of information and the pressure to deliver better outcomes at a lower cost. Many of our customers are looking for mobility  flexibility  intuitive interfaces  and integrated open architecture technology to support their decision-making. We aim to solve their problems and add value to their workflow with our range of digital solutions and services  which we continuously evolve to meet their changing needs.Our expert solutions combine deep domain knowledge with technology to deliver both content and workflow automation to drive improved outcomes and productivity for our customers. Expert solutions  which include our software products and certain advanced information solutions  accounted for 56% of total revenues in the first half of 2022 (FY 2021: 55%) and grew 9% organically. Software revenues accounted for 44% of total revenues (FY 2021: 42%) and grew 9% organically  with cloud software revenues up 20% organically.Based on revenues  our largest expert solutions by division are:Health : global clinical decision support tool UpToDate; clinical drug databases Medi-Span and Lexicomp; and Lippincott nursing solutions for practice and learning.Tax & Accounting : global corporate performance solution CCH Tagetik; global corporate internal audit platform TeamMate; professional tax and accounting software  including CCH Axcess and CCH ProSystem fx in North America and similar software for professionals across Europe.Governance  Risk & Compliance : finance  risk  and regulatory reporting suite OneSumX; banking compliance solutions ComplianceOne  Expere  eOriginal  and Gainskeeper; and enterprise legal management software Passport and TyMetrix.Legal & Regulatory: global EHS/ORM3 suite Enablon; legal workflow solutions Kleos and Legisway; and other software tools for European legal professionals.Our business model is primarily based on subscriptions  software maintenance  and other recurring revenues (80% of total revenues in FY 2021 and 81% in HY 2021)  augmented by implementation services and license fees as well as volume-based transactional or other non-recurring revenues. Renewal rates for our recurring digital information  software  and service revenues are high and are one of the key indicators by which we measure our success. Product innovation is a key driver of growth.More than half of our operating costs relate to our employees  who create  develop  maintain  sell  implement  and support our solutions on behalf of our customers. Our technology architecture is increasingly based on globally scalable platforms that use standardized components. An increasing proportion of our solutions is built cloud-first. Many of our solutions incorporate advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence  natural language processing  robotic process automation  and predictive analytics. Our development teams use customer-centric  contextual design and develop solutions based on the scaled agile framework. Our solutions are sold by our own sales teams or through selected distribution partners.Strategic priorities 2022-2024At the start of this year  we rolled out our new three-year strategic plan  which has three strategic priorities:Accelerate Expert Solutions : we intend to focus our investments on cloud-based expert solutions while continuing to transform selected digital information products into expert solutions. We will invest to enrich the customer experience of our products by leveraging advanced data analytics.Expand Our Reach : we will seek to extend organically into high-growth adjacencies along our customer workflows and adapt our existing products for new customer segments. We plan to further develop partnerships and ecosystems for our key software platforms.Evolve Core Capabilities: we intend to enhance our central functions to drive excellence and scale economies  mainly in sales and marketing (go-to-market) and in technology. We plan to advance our environmental  social  and governance (ESG) performance and capabilities and to continue investing in diverse and engaged talent to support innovation and growth.We expect this strategy to support good organic growth and improved margins and returns over the coming three years. While the strategy remains centered on organic growth  we may make selected acquisitions and non-core disposals to enhance our value and market positions. Acquisitions must fit our strategy  strengthen or extend our existing business  be accretive to diluted adjusted EPS in their first full year and  when integrated  deliver a return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital (8%) within three to five years. We expect that group-wide product development spend will remain at approximately 10% of total revenues in the next three years.Our strategy aims to achieve high levels of customer satisfaction and an engaged  talented  and diverse workforce  to maintain strong corporate governance and secure systems  and to drive efficient operations that meet environmentally-sound practices. Two key strategic ESG goals for the coming three years are to drive an improvement in our belonging score4 and to start aligning our reporting with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).Financial Policy  Capital Allocation  Net Debt  and LiquidityWolters Kluwer uses its free cash flow to invest in the business organically and through acquisitions  to maintain optimal leverage  and to provide returns to shareholders. We regularly assess our financial position and evaluate the appropriate level of debt in view of our expectations for cash flow  investment plans  interest rates  and capital market conditions. While we may temporarily deviate from our leverage target  we continue to believe that  in the longer run  a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 2.5x remains appropriate for our business given the high proportion of recurring revenues and resilient cash flows.Dividend Policy and Interim Dividend 2022Wolters Kluwer remains committed to a progressive dividend policy  under which we aim to increase the dividend per share in euros each year  independent of currency fluctuations. The payout ratio5 can vary from year to year. Proposed annual increases in the dividend per share take into account our ﬁnancial performance  market conditions  and our need for ﬁnancial ﬂexibility. The policy takes into consideration the characteristics of our business  our expectations for future cash ﬂows  and our plans for organic investment in innovation and productivity  or for acquisitions. We balance these factors with the objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet.As announced on February 23  2022  the interim dividend for 2022 was set at 40% of the prior year total dividend. This results in an interim dividend of €0.63 per share  to be distributed on September 22  2022  to holders of ordinary shares  or September 29  2022  to holders of Wolters Kluwer ADRs.Shareholders can choose to reinvest both interim and ﬁnal dividends by purchasing additional Wolters Kluwer shares through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) administered by ABN AMRO Bank N.V.Share Buyback 2022 ExpandedAs a matter of policy since 2012  Wolters Kluwer will offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases (Anti-Dilution Policy). In addition  from time to time when appropriate  we return capital to shareholders through share buyback programs. Shares repurchased by the company are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or utilized to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.On February 23  2022  we announced our intention to repurchase shares for up to €600 million during 2022. Today  we are announcing an increase in this program to €1 billion. Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially  we believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchases may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time.In the year to date  through August 2  2022  we have repurchased €356 million in shares (3.8 million shares at an average price of €92.89). Included in these amounts was a block trade of 522 954 shares purchased for €46.1 million on February 24  2022  to offset the issuance of incentive shares. See Note 10 for further information on issued share capital.For the period starting August 4  2022  up to and including October 31  2022  we have mandated third parties to execute €400 million in share buybacks on our behalf while for the period starting November 3  2022  up to and including December 28  2022  we have mandated another third party to execute €244 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and the company’s Articles of Association. The maximum number of shares which may be acquired will not exceed the authorization granted by the General Meeting of Shareholders. Repurchased shares are added to and held as treasury shares and will be used for capital reduction purposes or to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.Share Cancellation 2022At the 2022 Annual General Meeting of April 21  2022  shareholders approved a resolution to cancel for capital reduction purposes any or all ordinary shares held in treasury or to be acquired by the company  up to a maximum of 10% of issued share capital. As of August 2  2022  Wolters Kluwer held 7.5 million shares in treasury. As authorized by shareholders  the Executive Board has determined the number of ordinary shares to be cancelled this year is 5.0 million. Wolters Kluwer intends to cancel these shares in the second half of 2022. The remaining treasury shares will be retained in order to meet future obligations under share-based incentive plans.Net Debt  Leverage  Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility  and Liquidity PositionNet debt on June 30  2022  was €2 203 million  compared to €2 131 million on December 31  2021. The net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x (FY 2021: 1.4x; HY 2021: 1.7x).Our multi-currency credit facility remains fully undrawn. Effective July 2022  we agreed to the final one-year extension of this €600 million multi-currency credit facility  such that the facility will now mature in 2025. The facility is sustainability-linked  with pricing tied to four ESG key performance indicators.Our liquidity position remains strong with  as of June 30  2022  net cash available of €1 019 million6  partly offset by outstanding Euro Commercial Paper (ECP) of €100 million.Half-Year 2022 ResultsBenchmark FiguresGroup revenues were €2 600 million  up 14% overall benefitting from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. Excluding the effect of exchange rate movements  revenues increased 7% in constant currencies. Excluding also the net effect of acquisitions and divestments  organic revenue growth was 7% (HY 2021: 5%).Revenues from North America accounted for 64% of total group revenues and grew 7% organically (HY 2021: 5%). Revenues from Europe  29% of total revenues  grew 6% organically (HY 2021: 5%). Revenues from Asia Pacific and Rest of World  7% of total revenues  grew 11% organically (HY 2021: 3%).Adjusted operating profit was €734 million (HY 2021: €613 million)  an increase of 10% in constant currencies. The adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 28.2% (HY 2021: 26.9%). The increase in adjusted operating profit margin mainly reflects strong operational gearing and favorable currency mix. Margins were higher than expected due to a slower than expected post-COVID ramp-up in spending (such as travel) and hiring. Product development (including CAPEX) increased to 10% of revenues (HY 2021: 9%).Included in adjusted operating profit were restructuring expenses of €3 million (HY 2021: €2 million).Adjusted net financing costs were stable at €42 million (HY 2021: €42 million). Included in adjusted net financing costs was a €13 million net foreign exchange loss (HY 2021: €11 million net foreign exchange loss) due to the translation of intercompany balances. Interest income on cash balances increased.Adjusted profit before tax was €692 million (HY 2021: €571 million)  up 21% overall and up 11% in constant currencies.The benchmark tax rate on adjusted profit before tax increased to 23.8% (HY 2021: 23.5%)  due to a change in our deferred tax position. Adjusted net profit was €527 million (HY 2021: €437 million)  an increase of 21% overall and 10% in constant currencies.Diluted adjusted EPS was €2.04 (HY 2021: €1.66)  up 23% overall and up 11% in constant currencies  reflecting the increase in adjusted net profit and a 1.7% reduction in the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding to 258.2 million (HY 2021: 262.7 million).IFRS Reported FiguresReported operating profit increased 23% to €640 million (HY 2021: €519 million). The increase reflects the increase in adjusted operating profit and lower divestment-related losses  partly offset by an impairment of certain Health assets.Reported financing results amounted to a net cost of €43 million (HY 2021: €43 million cost).The reported effective tax rate decreased to 23.7% (HY 2021: 24.4%); the prior period reflected a divestment-related loss that was not tax-deductible.Net profit for the first half increased 26% overall to €455 million (HY 2021: €360 million) and diluted earnings per share increased 29% to €1.76 (HY 2021: €1.37).Cash FlowAdjusted operating cash flow was €703 million (HY 2021: €659 million)  down 1% in constant currencies. The cash conversion ratio decreased to 96% (HY 2021: 108%) due to lower working capital inflows and higher capital expenditure compared to the prior period  as expected. Capital expenditures were €139 million (HY 2021: €107 million)  representing 5.4% of revenues (HY 2021: 4.7%).Cash payments related to leases  including lease interest paid  were €39 million (HY 2021: €38 million). Depreciation of physical assets  amortization and impairment of internally developed software  and depreciation of right-of-use assets totaled €143 million (HY 2021: €137 million)  broadly in line with the prior period.Net interest paid  excluding lease interest paid  was €42 million  broadly in line with the prior period (HY 2021: €44 million).Income tax paid increased to €175 million (HY 2021: €127 million)  as expected. The net cash outflow related to restructuring was lower than a year ago at €4 million (HY 2021: outflow of €20 million). Consequently  adjusted free cash flow was €497 million (HY 2021: €476 million)  up 4% overall but down 4% in constant currencies.Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was €71 million (HY 2021: €99 million)  primarily relating to the acquisition of IDS in Governance  Risk & Compliance on April 8  2022. Dividends paid to shareholders amounted to €264 million (HY 2021: €233 million)  representing the final dividend of financial year 2021. Through June 30  2022  cash deployed towards the 2022 share repurchase program totaled €302 million (HY 2021: €201 million).ESG7 DevelopmentsAdvancing our ESG performance and capabilities is core to our strategy. We are focused on delivering high levels of customer satisfaction and innovative  impactful solutions and services; we are nurturing an engaged  talented  and diverse workforce; we are supporting strong ethics  compliance and governance  investing in highly secure systems  and striving to reduce our carbon footprint.In the first half of 2022  we made progress in several areas. We further expanded initiatives designed to attract and retain talent amid tightened global markets for technology and other skilled professionals. To drive recruitment  we expanded talent acquisition capabilities and invested in partnerships and tools to enlarge candidate sourcing  be more visible  and increase our diversity outreach. To support both recruitment and retention  we expanded our career development work and other initiatives designed to support continued high levels of employee engagement and improve belonging.In February 2022  we committed to aligning our practices and reporting to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD) and to setting science-based targets. With regard to this commitment  we have this year made improvements to our existing procedures for scope 1 and scope 2 data collection in order to expand coverage and establish a more accurate baseline. With external advisors  we have developed a roadmap to implement the TCFD recommendations and have made progress on identifying and assessing material scope 3 emissions categories.In the meantime  we continue to drive forward existing programs that reduce our emissions: in the first half  our real estate rationalization program delivered a further 3% organic reduction in office footprint (m2) around the world  following a 7% organic reduction in 2021. Our cloud migration and on-premise server decommissioning program is making steady progress: as of June 30  2022  the number of on-premise servers decommissioned this year exceeds 450 as we migrate customers and applications to more energy-efficient cloud infrastructure.Divisional ReviewOrganic growth and margin performance was strong across all four divisions.Divisional Summary – Six months ended June 30 € million (unless otherwise stated) 2022 2021 ∆ ∆ CC ∆ OG Revenues Health 674 579 +16% +6% +6% Tax & Accounting 843 732 +15% +9% +9% Governance  Risk & Compliance 638 544 +17% +7% +6% Legal & Regulatory 445 425 +5% +3% +6% Total revenues 2 600 2 280 +14% +7% +7% Adjusted operating profit Health 216 181 +19% +8% +8% Tax & Accounting 270 229 +18% +10% +10% Governance  Risk & Compliance 206 175 +18% +7% +6% Legal & Regulatory 69 53 +31% +27% +36% Corporate (27) (25) +11% +8% +8% Total adjusted operating profit 734 613 +20% +10% +11% Adjusted operating profit margin Health 32.0% 31.2% Tax & Accounting 32.0% 31.3% Governance  Risk & Compliance 32.2% 32.1% Legal & Regulatory 15.6%12.5% Total adjusted operating profit margin 28.2% 26.9% ∆: % Change; ∆ CC: % Change in constant currencies (€/$ 1.18); ∆ OG: % Organic growth.Total recurring revenues  which include subscriptions and other renewing revenue streams  accounted for 81% of total revenues in HY 2022 (HY 2021: 81%) and grew 7% organically (HY 2021: 5%).

Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial StatementsNote 1 Reporting entityWolters Kluwer N.V. (the company) with its subsidiaries (together referred to as 'the group'  and individually as ‘group entities’) is a global provider of professional information  software solutions  and services for clinicians  nurses  accountants  lawyers  and tax  finance  audit  risk  compliance  and regulatory sectors. Our expert solutions combine deep domain knowledge with technology to deliver both content and workflow automation to drive improved outcomes and productivity for our customers.These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (interim financial statements) for the six months ended June 30  2022  comprise the group and the group’s interests in associates.Note 2 Basis of preparationStatement of complianceThese interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting  as adopted by the European Union. As such  the financial statements do not include all the information required for a complete set of IFRS financial statements. However  selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to get an understanding of the changes in the group’s financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2021.The interim financial statements for the six months period ended June 30  2022  have been abridged from Wolters Kluwer’s 2021 Financial Statements as part of the 2021 Annual Report. These interim financial statements have not been audited or reviewed by the external auditor. The interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board on August 2  2022.Accounting policiesThe accounting policies applied in these interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the 2021 Financial Statements  apart from the effect of the following new accounting standards and amendments which became effective as of January 1  2022:References to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3);Property  Plant  and Equipment – Proceeds before intended use (Amendments to IAS 16); andOnerous contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37).These amendments did not have any impact on the amounts recognized in the current or prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect future periods.Effect of forthcoming accounting standardsA number of new standards and amendments are not yet effective for the year ending December 31  2022  and have not been early adopted in these interim financial statements. The group expects no significant changes as a result of these new standards and amendments.Functional and presentation currencyThe interim financial statements are presented in euros  which is the company’s functional and presentation currency. Unless otherwise indicated  the financial information in these interim financial statements is in euros and has been rounded to the nearest million.Exchange rates to the euro 2022 2021 U.S. dollar (at June 30) 1.05 1.20 U.S. dollar (average six months) 1.10 1.21 U.S. dollar (at December 31) 1.13Judgments and estimatesThe preparation of the interim financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets  liabilities  income  and expense.In preparing these interim financial statements  the significant judgments made by management in applying the group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation and uncertainty were the same as those applied to the 2021 Financial Statements (reference is made to Note 3 – Accounting Estimates and Judgments of the 2021 Financial Statements).The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not clear from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates and may result in material adjustments in the next financial period(s).Reference is also made to Note 30 - Financial Risk Management of the 2021 Financial Statements  which outlines Wolters Kluwer’s exposure to a variety of risks  including market risk  currency risk  interest rate risk  liquidity risk  and credit risk. These risks have not substantially changed since the issuance of our 2021 Annual Report.Impact of Russian-Ukrainian warIn February 2022  global geopolitical tension began to worsen following the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war. The repercussions on the global macroeconomic scenario  already characterized by difficulties in global supply chains and high inflation rates  are currently highly uncertain. It is likely that the war between Russia and Ukraine could have consequences on global economic activities and spending patterns in current and future periods.Some suppliers of Wolters Kluwer have operations in Ukraine  predominantly in technology support services. Wolters Kluwer has been working closely together with these suppliers to ensure a minimal impact on our products and services.Wolters Kluwer has been carefully considering the future of our customer relationships in Russia and Belarus  where we have a limited footprint  and  above all  what our actions would mean for people in the region. We have discontinued doing business in Russia and Belarus except for certain health products where there are compelling humanitarian reasons.Revenues generated in Russia  Belarus  and Ukraine represented less than 0.5% of group revenues in the first half of 2022 and in full year 2021. At June 30  2022  trade receivables regarding customers based in Russia  Belarus  and Ukraine were neglectable. The Russian-Ukrainian war did not result in an impairment trigger on the group’s non-current assets.Note 3 SeasonalityThe overall impact of seasonality on group revenues and costs is limited. Revenue recognition does not always follow the pattern of cash flows as the revenues for certain license contracts are deferred.Note 4 Benchmark FiguresWherever used in these interim financial statements  the term ‘adjusted’ refers to figures adjusted for non-benchmark items and  where applicable  amortization and impairment of goodwill and acquired identifiable intangible assets.Adjusted figures are non-IFRS compliant financial figures  but are internally regarded as key performance indicators to measure the underlying performance of the business. These figures are presented as additional information and do not replace the information in the consolidated interim statement of profit or loss and in the consolidated interim statement of cash flows. The term ‘adjusted’ is not a defined term under IFRS.Reconciliation of benchmark figuresRevenue Bridge(in millions of euros) € % Revenues HY 2021 2 280 Organic change 160 7 Acquisitions 9 0 Divestments (15) 0 Currency impact 166 7 Revenues HY 2022 2 600 14U.S. dollar 2022: HY average €/$=1.10 versus 2021: HY average €/$=1.21Reconciliation between operating profit and adjusted operating profit(in millions of euros) Six months ended June 30 2022 2021 Operating profit 640 519 Amortization and impairment of acquired identifiable intangible assets 88 60 Non-benchmark items in operating profit 6 34 Adjusted operating profit (A) 734 613For our continuing medical education solutions for physicians (Learner’s Digest)  we identified a triggering event in the first half of 2022 as expectations of market growth deteriorated.

This disposal results in the accounting of a loss in income statement of EUR 3.3 billion before tax  largely absorbed this semester with Group net income share at EUR -640 million. Despite a residual capital impact of -7 basis points over the quarter  the phased in CET 1 ratio remained stable at 12.9% at the end-June 2022.Net banking incomeNet banking income was substantially higher in Q2 22  up +12.8% (+13.4%*) vs. Q2 21  driven by an excellent performance by all the businesses.The healthy momentum continued in French Retail Banking  with an increase in net banking income of +8.5% vs. Q2 21 reflecting notably a good commercial momentum  a high level of service fees and a record performance in Private Banking.International Retail Banking & Financial Services enjoyed strong revenue growth (+21.4%* vs.Q2 21)  driven by a record quarter for ALD and International Retail Banking. As a result  International Retail Banking saw its activities grow +12.7%* vs. Q2 21. Financial Services’ net banking income was substantially higher (+45.1%* vs. Q2 21) while Insurance net banking income rose +7.9%* vs. Q2 21.Global Banking & Investor Solutions once again delivered an excellent performance  with revenues up +18.3% (+16.1%*) vs. Q2 21. Global Markets & Investor Services was substantially higher (+25.3%  +19.8%*) than in Q2 21 while Financing & Advisory activities were at a record level  up +14.0% (+9.1%*) vs. Q2 21.In H1 22  the Group posted strong revenue growth of +14.7% (+14.8%*) vs. H1 21  with growth in all the businesses.Operating expensesIn Q2 22  operating expenses totalled EUR 4 458 million on a reported basis and EUR 4 590 million on an underlying basis (restated for transformation costs and the linearisation of IFRIC 21)  an increase of +8.6% vs. Q2 21.In H1 22  underlying operating expenses were up +7.1% vs. H1 21 at EUR 8 915 million on an underlying basis (EUR 9 787 million on a reported basis). This rise can be explained primarily by the higher contribution to the Single Resolution Fund (EUR +138 million)  the increase in variable remuneration linked to the growth in revenues and the Global Employee Share Ownership Plan (EUR +152 million). The increase in other expenses therefore amounts to EUR +303 million  representing a rise of +3.5% vs. H1 21.Driven by a very positive jaws effect  underlying gross operating income grew substantially in Q2 2022 (+21.6%) to EUR 2 475 million and the underlying cost to income ratio  excluding the Single Resolution Fund  improved by more than 3 points (61.8% vs. 65.1% in Q2 21).In H1 2022  underlying gross operating income enjoyed a strong growth momentum  up +29.8% vs. H1 21 at EUR 5 431 million.The Group now expects an underlying cost to income ratio excluding the Single Resolution Fund of between 64% and 66% in 2022.Cost of riskThe cost of risk stood at a low level of 15 basis points in Q2 22  or EUR 217 million  lower than inQ1 22 which included the cost of risk of the Russian activities sold (39 basis points). It breaks down into a limited provision on non-performing loans of EUR 156 million and an additional provision on performing loans of EUR 61 million.In H1 2022  the cost of risk amounted to 27 basis points.Offshore exposure to Russia was reduced to EUR 2.6 billion of EAD (Exposure At Default) at June 30th  2022.

Furthermore  the Group is aiming to reduce its CO2 emissions by around 50% between 2019 and 2030.Acceleration of digital and technological transformationThe Group wants to accelerate on the digital and technological aspect throughout the value chain. It already has a secure  resilient  and modern IT infrastructure. Our IT strategy aims to better serve our customers in terms of digital offering and customer experience and to continue to increase our efficiency and reactivity. In this respect  the Group is aiming for an IT intensity ratio of between 14% and 15% in 2025.The Group also wants to build the bank of the future by innovating  through partnerships with start-ups and the development of new  differentiating and value-creating business models. It has already demonstrated its ability to develop and create new business models such as Boursorama.Execution of strategic initiativesThe Group’s roadmap is essentially based on the strategic initiatives presented to the market over the last few quarters by different businesses and is structured around three pillars: Retail Banking and Insurance  Global Banking & Investor Solutions and Mobility.In French Retail Banking & Private Banking  the merger of the Societe Generale and Crédit du Nord networks aims to create a new reference bank  rooted in the regions  and fully adapted to the new economic and societal paradigms. This new bank  larger and more coherent  will benefit from an upgrade to increase the customer value proposition  accelerate digitalisation  and improve efficiency. Based on the quality and know-how of the franchises  French Retail Banking intends to accelerate the bancassurance model  extend Private Banking’s expertise to high-net-worth clients and develop the mobility and ESG offering. This strategy aims to position the bank among the top 3 banks in terms of customer satisfaction  with a cost to income ratio of between 67% and 69% and profitability (RONE) of 10%.In recent years  Boursorama has demonstrated the quality of its business model  capable of generating strong growth by benefiting from substantial economies of scale. The number of products per customer has also grown signficantly over the period. The Group wants to take Boursorama to maturity and establish it as the definitive leader in online banking in France. Boursorama is aiming for net income of around EUR 200 million and profitability (RONE) above 25% under the IRBA in 2025.The Group is pursuing its ambition of profitable growth in International Retail Banking by strengthening its leadership positions in its core geographical regions and capitalising on its strong franchises particularly in the corporate market. The Group is aiming for a cost to income ratio of between 50% and 52% in 2025 and profitability (RONE) above 16% in 2025.In Insurance  the Group wants to strengthen its bancassurance model by capitalising on its leadership positions in life insurance and enhancing its offering in protection insurance with a strong ESG focus. The strengthening of retirement savings and partnerships are also strategic and differentiating areas of development between now and 2025. Insurance intends to achieve a cost to income ratio of around 40% and profitability (RONE) above 25% under IFRS4.Mobility becomes the Group’s third pillar with the creation of a major global player resulting from ALD’s acquisition of LeasePlan. It represents a key development area for the Group  with estimated annual growth in the fleet of more than 6% following the integration of LeasePlan  a cost to income ratio of around 45%(1) and a RONE above 20% in 2025.In line with the strategic plan presented in May 2021  Global Banking & Investor Solutions maintains its ambition to be a major European player with the support of a diversified and resilient business model. It is aiming for a cost to income ratio of between 65% and 68% and profitability (RONE) of between 12% and 14% in 2025.Global Markets & Investor Services is pursuing the strategy initiated in 2021 regarding diversifying  rebalancing activities  and innovation  particularly in ESG and digital technology  in order to consolidate its positions and seize market opportunities. Risk appetite is set to remain stable over the period in accordance with the objective of ensuring greater resilience and predictability of performance. Global Markets’ revenues are expected to be within a range of between EUR 4.7 and 5.3 billion.Financing & Advisory is a key development area for the Group  with a target of average annual revenue growth of around 3% over the period 2021-2025. The strengthening of the franchises and the diversification of capital allocation towards the most dynamic sectors  customer segments or geographical regions remains a priority (Technology  Media and Telecoms  healthcare  and renewable energies) in the same way as accelerating the dissemination of ESG throughout the business. The Group is also continuing with its investment towards a more integrated  modular  and open platform in the Global Transaction and Payment businesses.2025 financial targetsThrough the execution of strategic initiatives  the selective allocation of capital to the most profitable and fast-growing businesses  and a focus on advisory and fee-generating activities  the Group is aiming for average annual revenue growth above or equal to 3% over the 2021-2025 period based on the lower end of the expected revenue range in Global Markets.Thanks to the completion of the cost-cutting plans undertaken  the end of the Single Resolution Fund constitution phase and continued strict discipline  the increase in costs is expected to be lower than expected average inflation over the period. On these bases and on the back of revenue growth  the Group is aiming for a cost to income ratio below or equal to 62% in 2025.Moreover  the cost of risk is expected to be at a normalised level of around 30 basis points in 2025.In the case of the CET1 ratio  the Group is aiming for a level of 12% in 2025  after taking into account in particular a capital impact from the finalisation of Basel III estimated at around 120 basis points on a fully loaded basis  excluding output floor (or 100 basis points in 2025  taking into account the phase-in)  and an attractive shareholder distribution policy.As a result  the Group’s profitability (ROTE) is expected to be 10% in 2025.8. 2022 FINANCIAL CALENDAR2022 and 2023 Financial communication calendarNovember 4th  2022 Third quarter and nine-month 2022 resultsFebruary 8th  2023 Fourth quarter and FY 2022 results May 12th  2023 First quarter 2023 resultsThe Alternative Performance Measures  notably the notions of net banking income for the pillars  operating expenses  IFRIC 21 adjustment  cost of risk in basis points  ROE  ROTE  RONE  net assets  tangible net assets  and the amounts serving as a basis for the different restatements carried out (in particular  the transition from published data to underlying data) are presented in the methodology notes  as are the principles for the presentation of prudential ratios.This document contains forward-looking statements relating to the targets and strategies of the Societe Generale Group.These forward-looking statements are based on a series of assumptions  both general and specific  in particular the application of accounting principles and methods in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) as adopted in the European Union  as well as the application of existing prudential regulations.These forward-looking statements have also been developed from scenarios based on a number of economic assumptions in the context of a given competitive and regulatory environment.

It has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at this date. The limited review procedures on the condensed interim financial statements at June 30th  2022 carried by the Statutory Auditors are currently underway.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars’ net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms “Revenues” or “Net Banking Income” are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar’s net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses are defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document. The term “costs” is also used to refer to Operating Expenses.The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e.  a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (« SRF ») are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 – Exceptional items – Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar’s activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:in EUR m H1 22 H1 21 Q2 22 Q2 21 Exceptional operating expenses (-) 872 533 (132) (118) IFRIC linearisation 570 398 (291) (203) Transformation costs(1) 302 135 159 85 Of which related to French Retail Banking 201 60 97 38 Of which related to Global Banking & Investor Solutions 39 43 25 26 Of which related to Corporate Centre 62 32 37 21 Exceptional Net profit or losses from other assets (+/-) (3 303) 0 (3 303) 0 Net losses from the disposal of Russian activities(1) (3 300) (3 300) Net losses from the disposal of Lyxor(1) (3) (3) Total exceptional items (pre-tax) 4 175 533 3 171 (118) Reported Net income - Group Share (640) 2 253 (1 482) 1 439 Total exceptional items - Group share (post-tax) 3 719 394 2 987 (90) Underlying Net income - Group Share 3 079 2 647 1 505 1 349(1) Allocated to Corporate Centre(2)6 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 43 and 663 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document.

This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (“doubtful”).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notion of ROE (Return On Equity) and ROTE (Return On Tangible Equity)  as well as the methodology for calculating it  are specified on pages 43 and 44 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess return on equity and Societe Generale’s return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group’s businesses  according to the principles presented on page 44 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document.The net result by the group retained for the numerator of the ratio is the net profit attributable to the accounting group adjusted by the interest to be paid on TSS & TSDI  interest paid to the holders of TSS & TSDI amortization of premiums issues and the impairment of goodwill.Details of the corrections made to book equity in order to calculate ROE and ROTE for the period are given in the table below:ROTE calculation: calculation methodologyEnd of period (in EURm) Q2 22 Q2 21 H1 22 H1 21 Shareholders' equity Group share 64 583 63 136 64 583 63 136 Deeply subordinated notes (8 683) (8 905) (8 683) (8 905) Undated subordinated notes - (62) - (62) Interest of deeply & undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations(1) (8) (1) (8) (1) OCI excluding conversion reserves 854 (699) 854 (699) Distribution provision(2) (1 193) (1 021) (1 193) (1 021) Distribution for N-1 (914) - (914) - ROE equity end-of-period 54 638 52 448 54 638 52 448 Average ROE equity* 54 833 52 161 54 751 51 856 Average Goodwill (3 646) (3 927) (3 636) (3 928) Average Intangible Assets (2 723) (2 542) (2 738) (2 524) Average ROTE equity* 48 464 45 692 48 377 45 404 Group net Income (1 482) 1 439 (640) 2 253 Interest on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes (159) (165) (278) (309) Cancellation of goodwill impairment - - 2 - Adjusted Group net Income (1 641) 1 274 (916) 1 944 Average ROTE equity* 48 464 45 692 48 377 45 404 ROTE -13.5% 11.2% -3.8% 8.6% Underlying Group net income 1 505 1 349 3 079 2 647 Interest on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes (159) (165) (278) (309) Cancellation of goodwill impairment - - 2 - Adjusted Underlying Group net Income 1 346 1 184 2 803 2 338 Average ROTE equity (underlying)* 51 451 45 602 52 096 45 797 Underlying ROTE 10.5% 10.4% 10.8% 10.2%(1) Interest net of tax  payable or paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes & undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations(2) The dividend to be paid is calculated based on a pay-out ratio of 50% of the underlying Group net income  after deduction of deeply subordinated notes and on undated subordinated notes(*) Amounts restated compared with the financial statements published in 2020 (See Note1.7 of the financial statements)RONE calculation: Average capital allocated to Core Businesses (in EURm)In EURm Q2 22 Q2 21 Change H1 22 H1 21 Change French Retail Banking 12 295 12 116 +1.5% 12 058 12 162 -0.9% International Retail Banking and Financial Services 10 570 10 158 +4.1% 10 794 10 058 +7.3% Global Banking and Investor Solutions 14 642 13 581 +7.8% 14 386 13 492 +6.6% Core Businesses 37 507 35 857 +4.6% 37 238 35 713 +4.3% Corporate Center 17 326 16 306 +6.3% 17 513 16 144 +8.5% Group 54 833 52 161 +5.1% 54 751 51 856 +5.6%NB: Amounts restated in Q1 22 to take into account the transfer of Private Banking activities (French and international) to the French Retail Banking.

Second Quarter 2022 Results Call. Thank you for your patience.My name is Daisy  and I'll be your coordinator today. You will have the opportunity to ask a question at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the call over to Hans Zayed  the Group Investor Relations Director to begin. So Hans  please go ahead.Hans ZayedThank you  and good afternoon and good morning to our audience in the US. Thank you for joining the OCI N.V. Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call.With me today are Ahmed El-Hoshy  our Chief Executive Officer; and Hassan Badrawi  our Chief Financial Officer. On this call  we will review OCI's key operational events and financial highlights for the quarter  followed by a discussion of OCI's outlook. And as usual  at the end of the call  we will host a question-and-answer session. The quarterly reports and the presentation are available on our IR website that we posted this morning  and I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made on this call involve risks and the actual results will differ materially from these statements.With that  let me hand over to Ahmed.Ahmed El-HoshyThank you  Hans  and thank you all for joining us today. Hassan and I will provide some more perspective on the results we published this morning throughout this call. We're pleased that we continued our strong performance with an adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion for the quarter and $3.8 billion for the LTM trailing 12-month period and a reduction in net debt to a very low leverage level. This enables us to return almost $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders this calendar year and pursue value-creative decarbonization and growth opportunities. However  we have to put these results in a global perspective as the global and especially European macro environment faces many challenges. The uncertainty is particularly true for gas markets in Europe as widely discussed. Many European producers in our industry cannot recover their cash costs due to the high prices of gas  especially those that cannot import ammonia as an alternative. Yet we were able to deliver excellent results as we benefit from our flexibility and diversified platform across Middle East and North Africa  US and Europe and our leading position in the global ammonia market.This enables us to reduce gas consumption in Europe when necessary by replacing that with the ammonia from our global operations as well as third parties. Currently  we're running our ammonia lines at approximately 40% of our capacity in the Netherlands. All this is reflected in our results. We recorded strong results in the US and in Fertiglobe  and we were able to operate our downstream production in Europe profitably while we continue to provide essential nitrogen fertilizers to our European agricultural customers and nitrogen products to our industrial customers. The latter is even more important in the current environment. At OCI  we aim to address potential green shortfalls and be part of the solution to help alleviate overall food security concerns by providing as much product as possible and fill in the play gaps that may arise. Our methanol operations  however  stopped production at the end of June last year when gas prices were already high  making it difficult to run the plant economically.You can also see this in our group's own produced sales volumes of 3.1 million metric tons  which were down 5% during the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021. But this can largely be explained by the continued shutdown of BioMCN in Europe. Our overall European business also benefits from the sale of excess EUAs or CO2 credits  including $88 million reported during the second quarter. As we discussed in our past conference calls  we are excited about our strategic growth opportunities that can both decarbonize and grow our asset base in a value accretive way in the emerging hydrogen economy. We are pleased with our progress on the various projects under development. But as always  and before I hand it over to Hassan  I'd like to cover our top priority  which is safety  as we want all our employees and contractors to go home safe every day. We also see safety as crucial for our business as ESG performance as we improve occupational safety and process safety  reliability and even energy of site will increase all part of our operational excellence program.Our 12-month rolling and reportable incident rate at the end of March was 0.37 incidents per 200 000 man out  slightly higher than at the end of Q1. Despite being below industry averages  we continue to stress our relentless focus on operational and process safety across all our facilities. The whole OCI team is working hard to make this happen. I'd like to thank all our employees for their strong commitment to safety as well as operational excellence and growing our business at the same time via commercial excellence and growth projects. I'll now hand it over to Hassan for further commentary on the company's results. Hassan?Hassan BadrawiThank you  Ahmed. I'll begin with summarizing some positive developments for both OCA and Fertiglobe that occurred in the last few months. Following the earlier upgrade of OCI to investment-grade status is a stable outlook by S&P  resonate credit rating agencies have now also issued first-time investment-grade ratings on our ADX subsidiary  Fertiglobe in June  recognizing its strong free cash flow generation  financial policy and robust outlook. We're also pleased that in the month of June  OCI was included in the MSCI World Index and the Stock 600 Index  making a return to some of the world's leading global equity indices for which we dropped at the beginning of a prolonged downturn for our end markets in 2016. Benefit conclusions coincided with a noticeable step-up in the liquidity of our shares to a consistent $40 million to $50 million per day on average this year compared to previous levels of $10 million to $15 million per day  partially reflecting some share price appreciation and changes in our shareholding structure. In addition  Fertiglobe was also included in the FTSE EM emerging market index in June following its March inclusion in the FTSE ADX15 index  which represents that we see largest and most liquid companies of the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange. We hope that such developments combined with the prospect of a consistent offering of the dividend yield and the exciting growth prospects that lie ahead for OCI in the energy transition should continue to broaden our appeal to the investor community.Turning to the quarter's results. Focusing on the quarter results  OCI's consolidated revenues increased by 95% to $2.9 billion. And as Ahmed mentioned earlier  our adjusted EBITDA rose by 141% to almost $1.3 billion during the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year as we continue to benefit from higher prices for all of our products. And all segments of the business contributed to this growth. In line with our guidance  our adjusted EBITDA is also 33% higher than the first quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year  consolidated adjusted net income saw a marked improvement of 322% and reached $528 million for the quarter  and our reported net income increased by 226% to $478 million. The primary difference between adjusted and reported net income is related to balance sheet FX translations and treatment of one-off refinancing costs. We also generated $928 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. Of note is that this free cash flow figure is after deducting $250 million of dividends paid to non controlling interest. This includes $170 million of semiannual dividends to Fertiglobe's minority shareholders other than OCI. Excuse the interuption. As I was saying  this is after deducting $250 million paid in uncertain interest  which includes $170 million of semiannual dividends to Fertiglobe's minority shareholders other than OCI  minorities in EBIC  which is Fertiglobe's subsidiary and some minorities and some dividends who they met the group minorities.Also after tax payments of 800 -- sorry  this is also after tax payments of $82 million  mostly on [indiscernible] which are up from a year ago due to the improvement in performance. And this is also after interest payments of $51 million  which were down substantially $91 million in the second quarter of 2021 as a result of our continued deleveraging. For the full year  we expect cash interest on gross debt to be below $120 million  which is a substantial reduction from 2021 interest level of over $180 million. Below the free cash flow line  we had cost to the tune of $65 million related to our successful refinancing of IFCo in April  which we covered in the previous quarter results and conference call. We have successfully returned to cash to shareholders of €1.45 per share or the equivalent of $320 million. The first cash payments to our shareholders is our listing in Euronext Amsterdam in 2013. Fertiglobe also paid an interim dividend to shareholders during the second quarter of $340 million  of which 50% was received by OCI and 50%  of course  to ADNOC  our strategic partner and the minority investors in Fertiglobe.After all these cash distributions and one-offs  net debt still declined by $553 million during the second quarter to $708 million as of 30th of June 2022  or the net leverage of 0.2x based on the last 12 months EBITDA of $3.8 million. This is compared to a consolidated leverage of 0.9x as of 31st December 2021. Looking at proportionate leverage as of 30th of June 2022 and based on OCI's ownership  so adjusted for all minorities and including off-balance sheet debt at Natgasoline  the proportionate leverage at 30th of June was 0.5x compared to 0.8x as of March 31st of March and compared to 1.3x as of 31st December 2021.With regards to future returns of capital to shareholders. In early July  we announced the proposal for a cash distribution with respect to the performance of our performance in H1 2022 of €3.55 per share or just over $750 million based on the FX risk day. We have scheduled an extraordinary general meeting for this on the schedule on the 19th of August. And this distribution will bring total return to shareholders during the calendar year 2022 to €5 per share or just shy of a total of $1.1 billion returns to shareholders applying a dividend yield of 15% on yesterday's evening closing price  but that we saw some positive share price movement today  so that number would have changed.Separately  Fertiglobe announced today in line with the dividend policy of distributing excess free cash flow to the shareholders a cash distribution of $750 million for the first half of 2022 payable in October 2022. OCI's share of this dividend will be $375 million accordingly. The 2 dividends  combined with the declared dividends and noncontrolling interest in Algeria  of $342 million  which were related to the last year will result in cash outflows of almost $1.5 billion in the second half of 2022. Even with these cash outflows  we are still poised to maintain a healthy balance sheet  which enables us to continue to return capital to shareholders  balanced while with investing in strategic growth opportunities  both within an investment-grade framework  as we have consistently laid out.On a pro forma consolidated net leverage basis as of 30th of June  after taking into consideration all these proposed cash distributions and without giving any regard to cash generation during the second half  our leverage effectively would be at 0.6x on a consolidated basis and below 1x on a proportionate basis. With regards to growth opportunities and CapEx  there is no change to our CapEx guidance for 2022. We continue to expect around $300 million of maintenance CapEx. In addition  we continue to guide for between 75.50 of growth CapEx depending on the various progress on projects and potential FIDs in 2022. We also maintained our estimate of up to $350 million to $450 million in growth CapEx for 2023  which includes previously announced projects. However  ultimately  all projects depend on factors such as legislation incentives and market developments.Moving to natural gas. Our natural gas procurement -- regarding our natural gas operant and hedging activities. As you will have seen in the press release  we covered that the topic expensively with the prospect. As we saw the prospect of increasing LNG exports in the US  Europe in the coming years  we have locked in a large part of our long-term gas requirements in the United States. As Natgasoline already had hedges in place  this applies mostly to new hedges related to IFCo and our OCI Beaumont operation and marked change in OCI's policy with respect to long-term hedging.In the first half of 2020  Fertiglobe accounted for 60% of our global natural gas consumption. The US accounted for 31%  including our proportionate share of Natgasoline and Europe were on 9% given that our BioMCN operations remains shut. And we are also running our ammonia capacity in Europe at reduced rates around between 40% to 60%. Therefore  the hedging alongside Fertoglobe's favorable gas up life contracts gives good visibility on more than 90% of our long-term gas requirements that further enhances our cost resiliency. For the period between 2023 and 2029  we have hedged circa 50% of our gas requirements in the US and locked in natural gas prices at a weighted average price of $4.3 per MMBtu. For the period between August and December 2022  so the balance of the year  we have hedged circa 60% at a weighted average price of $5.3 per MMBtu  which compares to the Henry Hub price of $8.3 per MMBtu for the September  December 2022 forward curve.Note that OCI does not apply hedge accounting and commodity hedges. Therefore  mark-to-market gains and losses are recognized in the P&L statement  except for the physical purchase contracts  which is treated under their own use exemption methodology  and we're happy to provide anybody who requests some additional narrative on that. However  market-to-market gains or losses on excludes from adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted net income when we reported. Current mark-to-market as of the close of 1st of August 2022 indicates a gain of $184 million in these hedges. With that  I would like invite Ahmed to provide further commentary on results  commodity market conditions and the strategic initiatives of the company. Ahmed?Ahmed El-HoshySure. Thanks  Hassan. Our outlook for our end markets has not changed directionally since we last spoke in May despite volatility that we've seen over the last few months. If I start with the outlook for nitrogen market  we had expected we saw some declines in pricing over the summer in line with usual seasonality but remained at much higher levels than we have seen in the off-season period during 2016 to 2020 downturn given the demand-driven environment we currently see ourselves in today. Going forward  we continue to see an environment with support for pricing for the medium term driven by a few key items. Firstly  the prospect is structurally higher gas pricing environment in Europe for a prolonged period of time. On today's gas price in Europe of $60 per MMBtu  the ammonia support level would be $2 100 a ton for marginal costs  excluding CO2  which people are increasingly viewing as a variable cost.In our presentation  you can see that based on gas price futures  long-term support levels for ammonia  urea and nitric pricing for this year and 2023 are 6 to 9x higher higher than the support level we saw for marginal cost producers during the downturn period of 2016 to 2020. Pricing today is actually materially lower than the support levels  but it is not uncommon to see prices drop below such floor levels during off-season period with low liquidity. Economics have historically prevailed when margins for producers remain negative for a longer period  triggering shutdowns as we have already seen happening in Europe over the last 12 months. In Europe  we estimate that around 7 million tons of ammonia capacity out of the total of 19 is currently shut due to high gas prices. And given elevated futures and risks associated with Russian gas supply  more capacity may be shut down should selling prices remain below gas-based production costs. In total  up to 19 million tons of European ammonia capacity is at risk of being shut if pricing remains materially below cost versus same period of time.Secondly  nitrogen supply is expected to be structurally tighter over the next several years between 2022 and 2026 compared to the previous 5 years with limited new capacity additions. This is exacerbated by a less supply promotion on the ammonia side in the black seed  which impacts circa 2 million tonnes of ammonia or 10% of the global sales. The Chinese government continues to curb exports and prioritize domestic supply at least until H2 2023  which tightens the markets further. Exports are expected to be below the 3 million ton level per year over the medium term and even lower than that level in 2022. To put this into context  in January  the expectation was that China would export over 4 million tons in 2022. As we moved on to May  this number had reduced to $3 million and now has dropped further to $1.5 million for calendar year 2022. This $2.5 million drop in expectations since the beginning of the year represents approximately 2 world-scale facilities running the whole year out.Thirdly  Propundamentals remain supportive for nitrogen demand to help alleviate critical grain shortages. The global grain stocks such ratio remains a decade low and will take at least until 2024 to replenish stocks assuming strong nitrogen applications. Grain futures with US corn futures that are around $6 and weak futures at $8 a bushel from the second half of this year until the end of 2024 remain at levels that incentivize farmers globally to maximize yields by using more nitrogen in grain exporting regions such as the US  Brazil  Europe and Australia  where demand is expected to be robust in 2022 and 2023. Furthermore  dry weather in the US  Europe and Argentina is expected to lower corn and wheat yields  which combined with lower corn production in Ukraine tightens the agricultural cycle even further into 2022.In India  we also expect strong import demand for urea in 2022  with a series of tenders expected to be issued over the coming months to replenish low stock levels and support for [beer] demand. 2022 and 2023 is expected to be higher than last year  given its high wheat prices man for Indian wheat on the back of the Russian Ukraine conflict  good monsoons and nitrogen subsidies in place. In addition  there have now been news reports in the last day that India is rationing gas supplies to fertilizer customers after imports were limited given global LNG shortages into the crush.Now moving on to methanol. The volatility in the macro environment had some effect on prices in Q2  but we've seen some improvements in the stock prices in the last few weeks. Last week  US contract price for [August] settled at $592 per ton  almost the same level as in July. Of course  we are monitoring the macroeconomic environment closely as part of the methanol linked to GDP  but we are currently seeing stable methanol markets into Q3 and continued downstream demand from a diversified customer base. Our operating rates for major derivative segments  including formaldehyde acidic acid MMA are reported to be at healthy rates in the United States and Europe. In China  in particular  economic development is expected to improve as a result of financial stimulus measures.Fuel consumption in China is picking up post-covid lockdowns and higher oil prices are supportive of methanol substitution for other fuels and supported for MTO or methanol olefin economics as a result of higher energy and olefins pricing in China and are supporting operating rates to continue to exceed 80%. Methanol is currently also significantly cheaper than LNG and gasoline and other oil substitutes and can be used as a lower cost and as a cleaner alternative to multiple fuel applications worldwide  including heating and transportation. Looking at the medium term  we continue to expect tighter methanol market fundamentals over the period of 2022 to 2026 with incremental demand expected to exceed supply by approximately 8 million tons and no new major supply expected to come on stream during this year. This does not consider obviously the meaningful upside and additional sense from hydrogen fuel demand  notably for road and in particular  marine fuel applications that  as you all know  is developing.This leads to some comments on our growth strategy and outlook. We continue to make good progress with our pipeline of projects to capture value-accretive opportunities from emerging demand for clean hydrogen as we aim to become one of the largest producers of clean fuels and feedstock. We see large upside from additional demand emerging in a range of new applications and sectors as a result of the hydro hydrogen transition  notably for road and marine fuels applications where ammonia and methanol are ideally positioned. In June  we announced the expansion of our Rotterdam ammonia import terminal  which is the only ammonia import terminal in Rotterdam  and we're tripling the throughput capacity to 1.2 million tonnes per year during 2023. This infrastructure has been crucial in our flexible operating model and the current high gas price environment as discussed earlier. For the second phase  OCI has completed the basic engineering package for the construction of a new ammonia tank at the terminal  which along with the scale up in the jetty infrastructure will allow a potential increase in throughputs above 3 million tonnes per add. The terminal is strategically located to facilitate emerging ammonia demand for bunkering to ocean-going vessels and the unique supply chain is the one we can also leverage in the future by importing low and no carbon hydrogen in the form of ammonia methanol  which can help decarbonize the EU as well as reduce reliance on imported natural gas during [indiscernible].We're also pleased that period a waste and biomass gasification project developed by RWE was selected for funding by the EU Innovation Fund. This project will produce hydrogen at the industrial site in Camila using household waste from Limburg in the Netherlands to replace natural gas. OCI is expected to be the offtaker for the circular of hydrogen to use in our ammonia synthesis  replacing part of our steam methane reformer and to produce hydrogen. Which would result in a reduction in our carbon footprint and lower the carbon intensity of our ultimate products. Throughout the value chain  the project will reduce emission about 500 000 tonnes of CO2 per year  corresponding to the annual consumption of about 26 000 households or 250 000 conventional passenger cars. First  the project is still under development with FID expected in 2023  subject to definitive documentation in commercial briefs.To conclude  we are excited about the prospects for the company. In 2021 and year-to-date 2022  we saw the start of a strong and we believe sustained general improvement in nitrogen pricing. Shorter-term recent nitrogen price movements and the outlook for natural gas provides good visibility and set us up well for Q3 and Q4 of this year. OCI's nitrogen and methanol assets are favorably positioned on the global cost curve given stock spread between the regions. The hedging in place at attractive pricing levels now in the US gives us visibility on more than 90% of our long-term national gas requirements. We are ideally positioned as we leverage our competitive global platform  growth scale young assets and strong logistics platform and harmonize our hydrogen strategy with our continued focus on shareholder and stakeholder value. With that  we'll open the line up for questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. If anyone would like to register a question on the telephone line  please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you would love to withdraw your question please press start followed by two. And when preparing to ask your question  please ensure you are unmuted locally. Our first question is from Christian Faitz from Kepler. Christian  your line is open. Please go ahead.Christian FaitzYes. Thank you. Good afternoon Ahmed  Hassan and Hans. Two questions  if I may. First of all  how do you see ammonia demand for the upcoming fall application in the US? Do you have any early signs from your salespeople on the ground? And then second  can you give us an update on the gas cost situation for both your used and methanol operations as well as for IFCo? Thank you very much.Ahmed El-HoshySure  Chris. Good. Thanks for the question. So obviously  we know that we had a pretty weak ammonia demand for the spring  just given weather conditions that we saw in the US. For this coming fall  we've seen quite a lot of demand for fall prepay  which has helped soak up some of the excess inventory that was in the system following kind of the weak spring that we just ended. And we also see  obviously  exports to Europe that make a lot of sense in this type of pricing environment. So Trinidad and US  Gulf  alone you have to make way the Euro proband grows in the Midwest. So with kind of the reduction in those supplies over time  some of the fall prepay  if the weather cooperates  we should have a record season. And I think the industry will start to work through a lot of the stocks that have been in place from the end of June. Thank you. Could you repeat the second question?Christian FaitzYes. Just update us on your gas costs setup in the use methanol operations and IFCo  please?Ahmed El-HoshySo Hassan walked through  we've done quite a bit of hedging of the underlying gas exposure in the US to the levels that we discussed. I think it was 60% through December and then from the beginning of 2023 until 2028  approximately 50%. And the way we buy our gas in Iowa is actually off of South in our Southwest basis  which is on average usually for the year  quite an attractive basis level  and we would have hedged the basis across most of the hedging. And with regards to OCI Beaumont  we're on the Houston Ship Channel  sub Texas basis. And we've been able to also hedge basis as well as the underlying 99. Are you asking about what you're seeing today in the market? The best price?Christian FaitzYes. Yes  indeed. Indeed.Ahmed El-HoshySo I think I don't have them right in front of me  but basically  you look at the Henry Hub price and to get the basis for A&R Southwest because it's been relatively volatile. That will give you a sense of kind of the underlying gas that we're using to supply our IFCo plant in our Southwest hub  and we have some transport long-term trends we have taken out with TransCanada  our pipeline there. So I think generally  we're about flat to Henry Hub when it comes to Iowa. With regards to Beaumont  Texas  we end up being a little bit of a discount to Henry Hub based on where the fusion ship channel in South Texas bases levels of trading. But you would look at SPX South Texas basis and you look at Houston ship channel when it comes to OCI.Christian FaitzOkay. Great. And then if I may  one last question on IFCo and then I'll shut up. If I'm not mistaken your last bigger turnaround in Iowa and it more or less exactly 3 years ago. So when do you believe the next bigger turnarounds or maintenance is scheduled?Ahmed El-HoshySo I mean  as you know  we don't give kind of guidance with regards to turnaround  but typically  they happen every 4 years  depending on which plants you're at. We had a long outage  which we did a lot of turnaround activities on  as you know  last year. It's actually still reflected in our LTM numbers. So despite the strong LTM performance  Iowa  which is obviously a very important plant in Q3 of 2021 had a very low EBITDA and free cash flow generation because the outage we had there at that plant. So I think in future years  we'll see if we provide more guidance around turnoffs  but they're typically every 4 years. So I'll leave it at that for now.Christian FaitzOkay. That is very helpful. Thank you  Ahmed.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from Lisa De Neve from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open  please go ahead.Lisa De NeveHi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have 2 and the bit related too. First and foremost  can you following on from the last question  you discussed a little bit of demand trends on the ammonia side. But can you also share what you're seeing on the demand side for the other nitrogen products you're selling? And where you're seeing still some levels of potential down-trading or some levels of price elasticity or liquidity concerns  and maybe where you actually see a pickup in demand? And my second question is  in your presentation  you sort of detailed that nitrate stock levels are at pretty low levels. Can you share a little bit about how  for example  urea inventories are at a global level where they are high low? Any sort of indication on that because there's no real data on these things would be helpful. Thank you.Ahmed El-HoshySorry  I was speaking to myself on mute. So back to your question  Lisa  with regards to the the questions on how demand is looking. European farmers are seeing still very strong economics to continue to apply nitrogen for for example  wheat production. And this is despite the drop we saw in pricing on the grain side for both wheat down to $8 a bushel now and corn down to $6 a bushel on the futures for the next few years. You run those numbers and the math around that  they're still making a good margin  and that's why we're seeing increased hedging forward and some buying of fertilizer forward even in this off-season period. So still seeing good demand there  and we've built kind of a healthy order book on nitrates here in the third quarter as we've seen some increased prices.I think I talked previously as well about India  where we still see very low stocks. That's one where we see stocks of about 11% lower than prior period. Still needs several million tons by the end of this year to support the [beer] demand and replenish stock levels as well. So we see imports close to the 9-plus million tons versus the 7 or so last year. On the Latin America side  we've seen demand picking up. Brazil needs another 4 million tons of urea yet  and farmer economics still look quite strong there. And Argentina will need a little over 0.5 million tons  probably close to 600 000 tonnes at that side. Across the system  we're still seeing very low inventories globally historically low levels for almost all nitrogen products. Some of what you talked about with regards to demand destruction  we think was not just  for example  commentary on Europe was not a function affiliate  demand destructure for price  but actual availability.Russia is a big provider of ammonium nitrate and there were just difficulties getting ammonia nitrate and enough stock and levels to get into the market. And when it comes to other areas for kind of ""demand destruction concerns""  areas where it's difficulty in accessing credit  sub-Sahara Africa  some areas in South Asia  outside of India have been a concern. So we've seen multilaterals and government transactions helping support the purchase of nitrogen fertilizer with replenish use levels. So I think that covers most of there other particular geographies you'd like to talk about or specific products?Lisa De NeveNo  sorry  that was actually very helpful. I just wanted to get your thoughts on inventory. And I think the conclusion is that overall inventories have reached quite low levels across those nutrients. I think that's a fair assumption  is that? I mean  to the extent we can see that.Ahmed El-HoshyYes  I'd say that qualitatively  Lisa  I'd say that we think it's historically  the fact that China is not exporting is a big deal. The fact that there's a lot of shutdowns in Europe is a big deal. There was some overhang in the US as you know with some UAN that didn't get put down in June and now you look into Q3  they're getting into that turnaround season and others have announced some turnarounds in Q3. So we're seeing that combined with a decent fill program producing UAN levels. And on the ammonia side  as I stated in the past question  we've seen exports from the US as well as all prepaid sales  really work through some of the stocks there for UAN in athemoment. So those are kind of the 2 levels. And I think now the next step is to see how harvesting looks and where yields are at in terms of the outlook for demand.Lisa De NeveOkay. Great. And I was going to take the following question offline because I think it's a really stupid one  but I'm going to ask it anyway. So in your presentation and your statement  you say that you have now visibility of more than 90% of the company's long-term [debt] requirements. How do we get to the 90%? Is this just US  Fertiglobe  your hedges in place? I mean  how do I get to that 90%?Ahmed El-HoshyYes  that's exactly right. When you think about our overall exposure  it's the combination of where we're at in terms of gas exposure. We do not have long-term hedges or medium-term hedges on in Europe  but we're also not consuming much gas in Europe right now. And with the outlook  it doesn't look like we're going to be running methanol anytime soon  given how stored methanol has been  and that's been the case for over a year now. And with regards to ammonia  we're running at 40% right now. And with the disconnect between product pricing for ammonia and gas cost of producing ammonia  we're assuming that kind of we made a [surge] on that level  put that in the numbers as well as Fertiglobe with the long-term contracts and the US hedging that Hassan talked through.Lisa De NeveOkay. Yeah. That makes sense. Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from Mubasher Chaudhry from Citi. Mubasher  your line is open. Please go ahead.Mubasher ChaudhryHi guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a couple  please. Are you able to provide any guidance range for the second half  given that you had quite a strong first half as well and then we're looking forward to what looks to be a relatively strong second half at all. And any comments around the cadence between the third quarter and the fourth quarter would be helpful. And just on the kind of on the macro level  can you provide any thoughts on the quantity of the harvest being reported on in the recent weeks out of the US? And just trying to gauge around your commentary on stock-to-use ratios not normalizing until at least 2024. Yes  I just wanted to kind of go those 2 comments  please. Thank you.Hassan BadrawiI can take the first question regarding guidance. I mean  we have provided a time certain level of guidance looking at quarter ahead. However  like most of our peers  we usually don't give any existing guidance exept for directional comments on the market outlook  which we hope the ones we provided this quarter were health in that regard  focusing really on sort of pricing environment  the macro variables that underpin our business performance  the predictability of our increased feasibility of our cost base  the most important cost base. So I think the combination of all these is sort of our attempt to give some directional guidance to our investors in the market. But as we get closer  as in November as part of our Q2 results  we will be giving some more guidance on sort of the next dividend cycle as we have a bit more visibility on our order book that's relevant for the performance of that period. And as we continue to sort of see how the markets unfold given the past changing environment. What do you want to add?Ahmed El-HoshyYes. I mean in terms of your other question with regards to harvesting and everything that’s obviously a few months away in the US But in terms of kind of crop conditions today  they’re a bit behind the 5-year average and behind last year in terms of the corn ratings from what we can see at this point. There are concerns on yield in terms of a little bit less nitrogen application that happened in the course of Q2  as you know. And lease planting combined with quite dry weather. So there are concerns about what yield we’ll see come kind of September  October time frame and what that means for grain stocks overall? And this is similar to what we’re seeing in Europe on the very dry summer so far here in Europe. And so those 2 are areas of concern in terms of yields  but I think we’ll see more and no more over the coming months. And I think I did mention earlier  LatAm dry conditions  particularly if we look at the wheat in Argentina. Those are some of the areas where there are concerns about the production there of crops  and then when you look forward and what that means  that means potentially a more difficult time replenishing stocks of grains and driving some of the commentary you were saying about  I think  your last question there  which is the need for replenishing grain stocks to get to more normalized levels because we are at decade lows where we stand today and have risks around the output and the yield that we anticipate seeing later this year.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from Chetan Udeshi from JPMorgan. Chetan  your line is open. Please go ahead.Chetan UdeshiYes  hi. I had two questions. I'm just wondering on your comment that you are running your European ammonia capacity at I heard 40% utilization. I'm curious why are you even running it at this point  even though it's really not going to be profitable. And the second question was  you've talked about  at least we've seen the press filings on some Greenfield projects in the US  are you able to give us some color on how should we think about the CapEx road map for OCI over the next two  three years? Are we talking about a big step up or are we talking about maybe a few $50 million increase per year until you get to a point where there is a peak CapEx on some of these Greenfield blue  green ammonia  or methanol plants globally? And do you worry that maybe some of these new green and blue plants are coming way too soon compared to when the real demand will start to kick in?Hassan BadrawiSure. No  good question. I mean your 40% question makes a lot of sense when you think about our capacity. You talked about 1 million tons per year of ammonia capacity we have in the Southern Netherlands. We announced that we're at around $400 000. To your question  could it be 0 given where we're at right now  it could be 0  and I wouldn't move that out. But when we look at the products that we produce  some of the products we produce  as you know  like urea for the production of melamine or urea for the production of UAN  you need the CO2 from that ammonia line to run some of that. And that's some of the concerns people have and why it's not just an ammonia effect  but it's a UAN effect  is really affected by gas bit.The importance of imports is very important for us to be able to continue to buy ammonia from third parties at $1 000 a ton when the cash cost of making it is still north of $2 000 a ton. So that generates the margin of itself. But we have the ability to potentially shut down both lines and continue to potentially produce CAN because that doesn't need CO2 to produce. So you just import ammonia  you run your nitric acid plant and you produce calcium ammonium nitrate into that market. So yes  it's a good question  and that's one of the areas you can find us in depending on how pricing trajectory moves and how gas prices move. Is that clear on the first question?Chetan UdeshiYes.Hassan BadrawiOkay. With regards to your other question  so we have given CapEx guidance growth CapEx guidance  I think in the prior conference call of $350 million to $450 million a year next year. And that's informed by obviously being within our financial policy and subject to the FID of projects. And so if we FID a project  we'll obviously come to the market with that to announce that we've actually FID'd a project subject to our economic return focus  our focus on decarbonization  and then staying within our investment-grade financial profile target. So that guidance assumes that there's some forward movement in FIDs on potential projects in terms of informing it. So to kind of give you a sense of the bookends of if growth CapEx were to get to that level.Chetan UdeshiUnderstood. Thank you.Hassan BadrawiThank you.OperatorThank you. Before we take our next question  I would just like to remind everyone if they would like to ask a question on their telephone line  please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. Or if you have joined us on the webcast  please write in the question box. The slide presentation can also be found on the webcast under the meeting materials. Our next question is from Faisal Al Azmeh from Goldman Sachs. Faisal  your line is open. Please go ahead.Faisal Al AzmehHi and congratulations on the strong set of numbers. Just a quick or two quick questions on my end. The first one is on your stake in Fertiglobe. I mean  at some point  are you or not thinking about reducing your stake to allow the company to be included in MSCI increased liquidity. Is that something that is being considered or at no stage would you be reducing your stake in the business? That's my first question. And my second question relates to the methanol market. I've been reading that effectively  they're changing the contracts from quarterly to monthly contracts  how do you look at this development? I mean does it change anything at all? Or is this something that is better or worse from your perspective? Thank you.Ahmed El-HoshyYes. So Faisal with regards to your first question  obviously  Fertiglobe is a strategic asset for OCI as well as for ADNOC. So we have the ability of both ADNOC and OCI in the future to reduce the stake. And yes  there's MSCI inclusion  but we would come back to the market and announce plans to do so if we were intending to do so in the near term. So there's a responsibility to do it continues to remain strategic to both the sponsors. We both enjoy the asset significantly and as you know  it's doing very well. But yes  I wouldn't rule that out in the long term. But for now  we're comfortable with the stake that we have in place and obviously has a lot of synergies with OCI's place in business.Hassan BadrawiIt's also a very important growth platform given the positioning of the business as an export platform at a time where exports are very important and the balance sheet is really under leverage  allowing us to look at both growth opportunities and continue to return a really good dividend shareholders going forward. So we're very happy with this partnership and this investment is intense.Faisal Al AzmehThank you.Ahmed El-HoshyAnd then the second question. Your second question  it's in regards to the European contract price  which has been an interesting one that is set quarterly. We haven't been a huge fan of that because as a European producer  we haven't been producing in 13 months out of our BioMCN the European producer. We thought that they're always just going to be this lumpiness and lag and it's not good for the suppliers  and it's really not good for the customers  but we've seen that the suppliers have gotten the short end of the stick often  right? You'll have a 3-month period where global price in methanol change  where gas price in Europe changes you see daily now  and you're set for an entire quarter. So usually  one side's relatively happy as a buyer seller on the other side  conversely unhappy. And so we would likely see how that develops over time. We'd be in support of that and be in line with how monthly contract pricing is set in the US  and you wouldn't just have this disconnected price  for example  where there could be a demand shock or a supply shock in either direction and you're stuck in a quarterly pricing low.Faisal Al AzmehGreat. Thank you very much.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from [Stinch Demeister] from ING. [Stinch]  please go ahead your line is open.Unidentified AnalystYes. Good afternoon. [Stan Demeisters] ING. My question is on the sale of EUAs. Is the entirety of the €88 million recorded in methanol? And should we expect you to continue this policy of selling credits as long as these operations are idle? And then maybe also a follow-up on the question of Mubasher on the cadence of Q3 versus Q4  which I think you haven't really answered. So maybe here some color on this. Thank you.Ahmed El-HoshyYes. So with regards to the $88 million EUA sales that is lost fully in the European methanol business  a portion of that is. I think the number is $68 million has gone into the European results  and there's some cost  obviously  of BioMCN in the business itself  that's a negative. And then the Clean Fuels business has done over a little over $20 million of EBITDA all factored into that. That leaves approximately $20 million that was not reported at the segment level. It was done at the whole co level in Europe. And then to your question of whether we would continue to do so going forward? Kind of just depends on what we're doing operationally at the time. But yes  we think that there is an excess surplus of units that we have. We are able to sell that to offset the cost. But obviously  as you know  kind of as you have less production  we get [indiscernible] over tax. So that's something we take into account. And we're having  I think  quite constructive discussions about the green future of our methanol business in Europe with the Dutch government. You see as this is one of the largest companies in the Netherlands  I think we're number 1 or 2 hydrogen producer consumer who are fully running in the Netherlands. And as a partner in [Norwich] too with some of these projects in the Northern Netherlands where our classes that they'll sell with the electrolyzer hydrogen offtakers in need. BioMCN buying can is a private candidate for that. So we're working through what we can do on that to get to that great future and bridging some of the costs that we have associated with keeping the flat their EUAs. And I think it seems like a good job we're doing purposing some of our personnel to other parts of the business that have been very busy  like the Rotterdam import terminal or our OCI nitrogen plant. So good work across the board kind of collaborating during this difficult time. Your second question  I didn't fully understand. You said something about Q3 and Q4?Unidentified AnalystYes  there was a previous question on sort of how should we look at the cadence or the strength of Q3 versus Q4? Not really guidance  but yes  we're in sort of abnormal situation  should we expect a typical seasonal restarting in Q3 or should that be sort of dampened this year? Your view here.Hassan BadrawiWell  so like we mentioned before  we're reluctant to give any specific guidance for the remaining quarters of the year. I think what we have shared is our view on the price  sort of the support level for nitrogen pricing and the recovery in methanol stock prices. And we  of course -- what is within our control is our continued focus on our manufacturing excellence program and to make sure that our plants are running better CAN not only for the financial results  but because we feel it's our responsibility to do so in such a volatile time where there is inventory levels are low and there's clear shortages across the system as Ahmed described earlier. So the combination of those factors are big motivators for us. But as you can see  the pricing environment continues to be tight and hopefully without any disruption in our operations of note that we should continue to perform well and continue to leverage our position in the global cost curve to generate free cash flow that allows us to move on with our forward with our plans. of being able to look at the growth opportunities that we already guided to in terms of the growth CapEx number for next year using government calls and hopefully continuing to meet expectations and generate excess cash flow that we can give back to shareholders as well. I hope that answers your question to some agree to some degree.Unidentified AnalystTo some degree  yes. Thank you.OperatorThank you. We will now move on to the webcast questions. So over to Hans to read them.Hans ZayedYes. Thank you. There are a few questions from Richford [Backenhouse]. And I'll read the first question  which is in the press release  you mentioned that in a low seasonal period  prices can drop below cost of marginal producers  do you expect a quick ramp-up in prices when demand picks up in Q3? That's the first question.Ahmed El-HoshyYes. As we covered in the call  we've seen good recovery in the nitrogen prices as Hassan has mentioned  kind of the start towards the recovery given the higher cash costs and still operating at a biggest the cash cost right now in Europe with the production curtailments as well as the demand that we talked about the system. Australia  Brazil  India  southern hemisphere type demand that really needs to come up as well as some positive grain-producing hedging going forward to buy some products in the field period and a reasonably strong fall prepay already on ammonia. We think that's supportive  it's hard to give kind of month-to-month guidance  but definitely it has a bit of a bull trajectory from what we're seeing in the market and how we see transactions taking place. I think we talked about methanol spot prices also recovering a bit. That's obviously less affected by European gas. But there's been a recovery there  and I think a lot of outages globally on the methanol side as part of the support into that stock market. Also  we tend to obviously see later in the year  as you recall  some more methanol switching  for example  for industrial boilers  we expect to see that later this year. And I think now methanol's the cheapest  as I mentioned on the last call  it's been relative to other products. So we should see more of that and that could give some support for demand in the East Asian markets and potentially the transport market over time.Hans ZayedThanks. And then the next question is  do you see any signs in recession by lower demands for industrial application of ammonia and methanol?Ahmed El-HoshyYes. So with regards to the reduction in demand  it's also an important question. We have seen some of these kind of higher ammonia price levels. We've seen some demand destruction in some of our products but overall  people are still consuming a reasonable amount of ammonia. And obviously  there's more than enough demand to go around given the shutdowns that we're seeing on the macro side. Given the energy crisis and reductions in supply of kind of energy in the form of methanol and ammonia  we're seeing a lot of supply related reductions offsetting the demand for [indiscernible] . But it's something you have to watch  right? Because the SMB is if you have some demand destruction because they can't get access energy  for example  in Europe or because of the recession  how does that affect overall SMBs? So far from what we've seen  it hasn't been something kind of that gives us a material concern  but it's something we'll continue to monitor  particularly for methanol and ammonia.I think I'll also mention that other industrial products  we're still seeing strong demand for spot diesel exhaust fluid for truck movements. But that's something if there's a recession  if you see some reduction  that's something that we're monitoring closely. But there's a natural increase year-over-year with just increased conversions to SCR engines and global ES demand and less supply for TDS globally that helps support that market. We've seen also melamine pricing continue to be relatively strong with potentially some demand destruction in certain areas  but at the same time  offset by how the business in the United States as well as curtailments in Europe  which are obviously gasoline as well as in China so in offsetting some of the Chinese import Europe. Yes. I mean I think we've covered the main areas.Hans ZayedYes. Thanks  Ahmed. Next question is several US producers note that they have large planned turnarounds in Q3. Are you going to respond to this in the US?Ahmed El-HoshyI mean  as we've stated before  our goal is to maximize production  particularly at these margin levels outside of Europe. So we'll continue to maximize production where we can. I mean we obviously have a time scheduled turnaround  as you know. But we have seen that there have been more turnarounds that have been kind of postponed from last year into the Q3 period  which is typically a bit slow. So that's supportive for that first question that came in with regards to the trajectory of potential nitrogen and ammonia price.Hans ZayedThanks. And then the next question is  what is the current status of ammonia and methanol application as a shipping fuel? When can we expect real demand picking up for this?Ahmed El-HoshyYes. I mean we have seen quite a number of vessels ordered by various players with methanol  the shipping fuel. We expect demand for nontraditional kind of methanol consumers going into  for example  container vessels  et cetera  to come on in 2024  2025. But we already have  for example  Methanex  which is the largest ethanol producer in the world  half of its fleet is running on methanol. Others in the market are running on methanol as well so we're starting to see that fast. Absolutely  the retrofit engine possibilities are there. We have them on the water already. We're very bullish on seeing a lot more methanol demand even as soon as 2024  2025. And as I stated earlier  I think we have demand outstripping supply by 8 million tonnes between 2022 and 2026. That doesn't take into account the marine fuels  which can be quite substantial changes  and we think we're just still to provide per given the movements with the IMO  you focus on decarbonization and people making big CapEx decisions on [indiscernible] saying  ""You know what  I need to have an alter fuel that I can be carbonized and methanol is a good one."" So that's what we see on the methanol side.Ammonia  we see it coming later. Ammonia has a few things kind of potentially going forward on the demand side. Ammonia blending into coal-fired power plants to reduce emissions in Korea and Japan  which is moving along quite swiftly  and we're going to see a few million tons of demand of that probably by the middle of the decade and potentially launch more by the end of the decade. We see increasingly more and more chatter in Europe of using ammonia as a feedstock for a power class for gas-fired power class. And I think we mentioned this in other investor interactions but when you think about taking a ton of blue ammonia out of the Middle East  for example  the US  not even green and it's GHG footprint where you requested the CO2  we take that ammonia  you move it with minus 30 degrees refrigerated on a tanker into Europe and then you combust it in Germany in a power plant or in France in a power plant.The only CO2 emissions were very upstream right in the beginning with the production of that ammonia and you've reduced the carbon footprint of it already  but you're not producing CO2 to move it. You're not producing CO2 when you combust it ultimately in Europe as NH3 so there's no carbon. That compares very favorably to LNG  you have to produce quite a lot of CO2 to liquefy it  you have to have boil-off and produce CO2 on the way to Europe. And then in Europe  you're going to have to produce CO2 again when you combust it for energy. So increasingly  more and more discussion of that where ammonia can be a win-win  particularly with the advent of carbon bordering mechanism to reduce CO2 as well as diversify away from natural gas  imported natural gas  in particular  but potentially even LNG having that as an alternative. Lastly  marine fuels I put at kind of 2025 is where that starts to your question and increasing potentially quite swiftly from there  but there are a few elements that need to come in place. One  primarily and most importantly  the engine  which we think will be ready in  call it  12 to 18 months and then start seeing ship orders for 2025 and into 2026. So following methanol.Hans ZayedThanks. And the next question is why such large dividends and not share buybacks? Do you think your valuation is too high  with not opportunistic buybacks on share weakness and retiring stock not improve long-term per share value will be significantly more valuable?Ahmed El-HoshyYes. I mean  this is the first year of -- we returned capital to shareholders  we mentioned earlier since since we listed on the Euronext Amsterdam in 2013. So we're very pleased that we're out of the gate with such an attractive return and such a meaningful dividend yield. I think we're just shy  as I mentioned earlier of $1.1 billion of cash distributions in a very tax-efficient manner for all our shareholders holders. We wouldn't rule out any other mode of returning capital shareholders. Everything is on the table. We'll be evaluating all available avenues going forward. Normally  I would not and actually I'm not going to comment on valuation per se on this call  but I would point you to a new slide that we added in our results presentation  which we find interesting. And it's looking at just some back on Page 9 of our results presentation  which shows that our market cap growth has been largely a reflection of our net debt reduction despite the underlying performance of the business  the derisked balance sheet and the improved outlook. And I think it's a very interesting choice that we decided to include. So hopefully  that gives some geate content for discussion in terms of the outlook of the company.In terms of forward guidance. And I mean we're reluctant to give any specific guidance per se  but I think the underlying drivers in the market  if we come throughout the call  looking at pricing  looking at our focus on volume reduction and looking at our continued focus on value creation. I think we believe we're in a good position  and we're relatively comfortable with the outlook for the year. And also  we have reduced our gross debt by $1 billion since the beginning of the year and leverage almost consolidated leverage at 0.2x  I think we're in a really good place and poised to really to deal with any conditions that may come our way in the future while maintaining our condition to grow and continue to return capital to shareholders. Thanks.Hans ZayedYes. Thank you. The next question is  can you give an indication on third quarter EBITDA relative to the second quarter given current spreads imply a big drop?Ahmed El-HoshyUnfortunately  we're reluctant to give this kind of guidance. As I mentioned earlier  the underlying drivers of our business continue to be relatively healthy for the remainder of the year.Hans ZayedThank you. And the next question is about how you can promote the company as a clean fuel producer at the upcoming COP 27 and COP 28 conferences? Is there an opportunity to achieve a re-rating for the shares if ESC investors start to understand the story?Ahmed El-HoshySo it's a good question. With COP 27 and COP 28  the stars have aligned quite well with our Fertiglobe business  right? COP 27 is in Egypt  COP 28 is in Abu Dhabi. So obviously  we'll have a presence  a heavy presence in both of those markets. I think increasingly OCI and Fertiglobe's profile has increased over the last year  and we are seeing increasingly more ESG investors looking at the value they can derive by getting into a cash flowing business trading that we believe to be quite low multiples and have the growth trajectory associated with sitting in the markets in which we sit in with the assets that we have that are advantaged to decarbonize and through the hydrogen economy. So we think over time  as ESG investors are looking at where to allocate capital  having an asset or an investment in a company like OCI  companies like Fertiglobe that are cash flow and providing these stable baseline dividends and have solid growth opportunities while below replacement cost with good target IRRs are ones where we're going to showcase in both COPs in both of those locations  working closely with government. I mean the government is a partner as an equity investor in Egypt and our EBIT side at a big partner as a result of wealth Egypt in our EBIT green plant. And we work closely with all the various ministries and stakeholders there in Abu Dhabi. I mean it goes without saying the Abu Dhabi government is a shareholder of Fertiglobe. It is a gas provider at Fertiglobe  and we're doing blue and green ammonia projects together with [Postel] as well as ADQ and ADNOC there. So quite a lot of opportunity over the next 2 COPs to showcase OCI and increase the already growing interest from ESG investors.Hans ZayedThank you. I think that was the last question that came from one of our investors in 91. I don't see any other questions on the web either.Ahmed El-HoshyAll right. Thanks  Hans. Thanks  everyone for your patience on the call today. So to get back to your summer  and we look forward to catching up for Q3 results.Hassan BadrawiThank you.OperatorThank you  everyone  for joining today's call.

When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition  we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative to  GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures  since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures and additional non-GAAP information included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.Adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  adjusted operating margin  adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders  adjusted diluted

Good morning  everyone and thank you for joining us today.I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.32. The 14% increase year-over-year  marking the best second quarter in our company's history  and is on top of 12% growth in the second quarter of 2021. Net revenues totaled $1.8 billion  an increase of 8% versus last year  driven by a balanced contribution from both our diversified transaction revenues and our recurring revenues  which account for over half of our business and increased by 8% versus last year.Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million and were at the low end of our guidance range versus the midpoint of our guide  second quarter expenses benefited from favorable FX  various expense efficiencies and lower variable costs  particularly customer acquisition costs and our listings business.Moving to the full year  we're lowering our expense guidance to a range of $2.97 billion to $2.99 billion midpoint to midpoint this represents a reduction of $35 million versus our prior guidance and similar to our second quarter results is driven by expense efficiencies  lower variable costs and favorable FX.Second quarter adjusted operating income increased by 14% to $1.1 billion their adjusted operating margin expanding to 59%.Moving to the balance sheet  shortly after we reported our first quarter results in May  we took the opportunity to raise $8 billion in new SR notes. We used 3 billion of these proceeds to refinance our 2022 and 2023 maturities and along with the proceeds from our sale of Euroclear reduced our commercial paper balances to zero with no maturities until the middle of 2025  we enter the second half of the balance sheet that is well positioned and it's an exceptionally volatile interest rate environment.The remaining $5 billion of proceeds raised in May  is earmarked to fund a portion of our announced acquisition of Black Knight based on a favorable rates that we've secured on these long-term notes  and the current forward rate expectations for both our commercial paper and term loan  we anticipate we will be well within our targeted 4% to 4.5% cost of debt financing for the transaction. It is also worth noting that alongside the financing in May  we maintained our A minus and A3 pre-acquisition ratings from both S&P and Moody's.Now let's move to Slide five  to provide an overview of the performance of our exchange segment. Second quarter exchange net revenues totaling $1 billion  an increase of 13% year-over-year  this strong performance was driven by an 80% increase in our interest rate futures  and that's 36% increase in our equity derivatives revenues. Importantly  total open interest  which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth  and in July up 11% versus the end of last year  including 6% growth in energy and 21% growth across our financial futures and options complex.Second quarter cash equities and equity options revenue increased by 17% year-over-year  and in July  we successfully migrated the NYCE Arca Options platform to our new pillar technology  while continuing to seamlessly process record message volume  a testament to our team's hard work and our broader technology expertise.Exchange recurring revenues increased by 7% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand in our energy exchange data continued benefit from our record 2021 listings performance and a one-time accrual in our listings business that we do not expect will reoccur in the second half.Turning now to Slide six. In our fixed income and data services segment  second quarter revenue totaled a record $512 million a 13% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 78%  including 85% growth in ICE bonds  and 76% growth in our CDS clearing business. This strong growth was driven in part by customers re-engaging and allocating more capital to CDS trading  as well as our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity through our bond platforms  where we're seeing market share gains and our municipal bond business.Recurring revenue growth  which accounted for over 80% of segment revenues grew 5% in the quarter and was once again driven by strength in our consolidated fees business as well as continued growth in the ICE global network.Looking to the second half  we expect year-over-year growth in our recurring revenues to continue supported by an ASD that interest in the third quarter up over 5% year-over-year. And in that second half as reported recurring revenues  we flat to slightly up versus our first half results driven by your Euronext data center migration which was included in our original guidance and $10 million of additional FX headwinds.Shifting to mortgage technology on Slide seven. Second quarter revenues totaled $297 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for over half of the segment revenues and totaled $160 million in the quarter increased 18% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes. While the current macroeconomic backdrop is challenging for a number of our customers is also presented an opportunity to have more constructive conversations around efficiency and automation across the mortgage origination workflow.It's worth noting that second quarter unit origination volumes were similar to those in the second quarter of 2019. However  second quarter 2022 revenues in our mortgage technology business were over $100 million greater or up almost 60% when compared to pro forma revenues in 2Q ‘19. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth and customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow.I'll conclude on Slide eight. To the first half of the year  we've grown total ICE revenue by 7% adjusted operating income by 11%  including 200 basis points of margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share by 12%  representing the best first half in our history. In addition  we've positioned our balance sheet for the acquisition of Black Knight while also growing our dividend and continuing to invest in future growth. As we look to the balance of the year  we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us  and we remain focused on creating value for our stockholders.With that  I'll hand it over to Ben.Ben JacksonThank you  Warren. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide nine.Rising inflation has created an interest rate environment  many of our customers have not navigated in over a decade. Meanwhile  the continued war in Ukraine has triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain  creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants. Importantly  we remain focused on connecting customers to our leading technology  mission critical data  and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions.In our interest rate markets  we've seen record year-to-date volumes in our your [indiscernible] contract as customers increasingly seek to manage risks associated with rising rates and central bank activity across Europe and the U.K. This heightened risk has also contributed to strength in our equity derivatives complex  driving an 18% increase in volumes year-to-date.Across our global energy markets  customers are navigating supply uncertainty alongside longer term Clean Energy Transition priorities. This will continue to introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets  which should drive greater demand for risk management. And it is our diverse global energy markets that provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools customers need to navigate both the near-term and long-term complexities.Globalization of gas and the clean energy transition are trends that have contributed to the 43% average annual volume growth in our TTF gas business over the past five years  driving TTF to emerge as a global gas benchmark.Through the first half of this year  as a result of the Russia Ukraine conflict  global gas markets have tightened significantly  increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas in an uncertain geopolitical environment. This volatility and uncertainty has driven our global gas volumes increased 31% year-to-date  including 49% growth in our North American gas business in the second quarter. Commercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk  as evidenced by the record share in open interest we've achieved in our Henry Hub contract  surpassing 50% for the first time ever. Because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America  Europe and Asia  we are well positioned to benefit from both the near- term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets.Despite these global energy concerns  governments  corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such  valuing externalities such as placing a price on pollution  carbon free electricity  and carbon sequestration and storage will continue to increase in importance. ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle  including renewable fuel contracts  carbon allowances  nature-based solutions  and renewable energy certificates.The breadth of our complex  coupled with the growing importance of carbon price transparency  has contributed to the 19% average annual volume growth in our environmental complex over the past five years.As the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities  uncertainties and volatility to energy markets  our global environmental alongside our gas and oil complexes will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks.Turning now to our mortgage business. I first want to touch on our pending acquisition of Black Knight as announced on May 4 of this year. As we said  when we made our announcement back then we continued to believe the transaction will close during the first half of 2023. Since the announcement  and in accordance with our initial expected timeline  we have submitted the necessary regulatory filings. We are working with the FTC as they perform their thoughtful and comprehensive reviews of the proposed transaction.Out of respect for the FTC is important work on this matter as we work with them toward regulatory approval  we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly  we remain very excited about the efficiencies that combined entities will bring to the end consumer and other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem.As interest rates rise  and mortgage origination volumes soften from recent record levels  our customers continue to turn to our mission critical technology to operate more efficiently. In the second quarter  we once again grew recurring revenues and outperformed the broader industry.Our focus during these evolving market conditions is first and foremost  our customer. Customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation and we continued to work with our customers to find the most efficient ways they can benefit from the breadth of offerings across our network.For example  we recently made the decision to offer interested customers our base eCO solution included in an Encompass subscription  making it easier and cheaper for customers to adopt and benefit from the efficiencies from an electronic closing.To focus on efficiencies has also led to increased interest in our data and analytics products  leveraging machine learning technology  our analytics platform automates the steps in the loan manufacturing process  and can save lenders 1000s of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity.Year-to-date  our data analytics business  which is made up largely of recurring revenues  has grown 21% year-over-year  we continue to see increased adoption of our analytics and new customers coming onto the platform  with a host of new clients added this year alone represented the likes of Chase  a number of leading independent mortgage bankers  and a top three home builder.We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders  and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff SprecherThank you  Ben. Good morning  everyone. And thank you for joining us.Please turn to Slide 10. The first half of the year has been marked by rising inflation  rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers are navigating evolving risks and continued to rely on our data  technology and liquid markets to manage these risks.In the second quarter  we once again grew revenues  grew adjusted operating income  and grew adjusted earnings per share these record setting second quarter results reflect the strength of our network and the all weather nature of our business model.Our strategy has always been to find unique and novel ways to apply data and technology to bring efficiencies and transparency to markets whether it was moving energy trading to the screen  clearing OTC swaps  modernizing the technology powering the U.S. equity markets  or building datasets for the opaque fixed income markets. As we've grown and diversified  we've broadened our opportunity set and our expertise has grown  providing new markets to grow into  and importantly  new ways to provide innovative solutions to customers.We've leveraged our leading pricing and reference data to build new tools for the front office. We've married our fixed income data to newly expanded climate capabilities. And more recently  we've combined our expertise in futures contract construction  with our index capabilities  and with our unique mortgage data to launch both the ICE mortgage rate lock index and its associated futures contract. These are just a few examples of the innovation that we can deliver with our expanded technology  datasets and expertise.Our evolution has been intentional  diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues with the goal of building a business that today generates compounding earnings growth. It's how we've grown our adjusted earnings per share for the past 15 years in every year that we've been a public company. The net result of our compounding earnings growth is the compounding growth in our dividend  which we've grown double digits each year on average since we initiated it in 2013 and which we also grew 15% in this quarter.Looking now to the second half of the year and beyond  we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us. And we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers while driving compounding growth for our stockholders.I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and their trust and I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter  following on the heels of our best first quarter  making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company.With that  I'll now turn the call back to our moderator Victoria  and will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. We will now start our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Rich Repetto at Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Rich RepettoGood morning  Jeff and Ben and Warren. It's unfortunate  we can't get any comments on the Black Knight acquisition  because that's certainly on everybody's mind. But anyway  I'll ask about fixed income. Ben  you saw probably a nice uptick in fixed income execution  I think it's up 85% up 10 million  just quarter-over-quarter. And I would suspect that's just the retail  your retail complex [muni] [ph] picking up? And then one other question related to fixed income  the recurring revenues went down quarter-to-quarter just by a million  I suspect that's currency  but just wanted to get some clarification there as well.Jeff SprecherHi  Rich. I'm going to hand it over to Lynn to go through this.Lynn MartinHi  Rich. Thanks for the question. You're right that we saw strong growth in our fixed income trading business this quarter. And as mentioned in our prepared remarks that was driven off of strengthened our muni trading business. And while volatility and the return of retail has certainly been a contributor  we're seeing our institutional efforts pay off. As you are aware over the last two years  we really focused on leveraging our market leading assets in the muni ecosystem  including our data assets and our index business  which now serves as the benchmark for more than 60% of the AUM in this area to build out the infrastructure to connect the institutional market to our muni execution platforms. And in this quarter alone  we're seeing the benefits of that work manifest itself. And that institutional share within our muni execution platforms has doubled since 2020  enabling us to take share in the broader muni market. And finally  it's worth noting that our institutional business in munis has grown 250%  year-over-year  a further sign that we're gaining share in this asset class.Warren GardinerAnd then  Rich  its Warren on your question on the recurring revenues. You're right. That's FX  largely FX  there's also a little bit of AUM related revenue in our ETF business. So as we saw during the quarter people shifting into treasuries and out of equities  and some of the credit focused ETFs. There's lower economics on those treasury ETFs that we bent that track our benchmarks and so that was a little bit of a mix shift impact for us as well within the AUM portion of the index. The rest of the index business did really well during the quarter up double digits. Again  some of the subscription revenue  pure subscription revenue  if you will  in there. So really just kind of the macro dynamics taking hold there that why you saw that slight sequential decline.Rich RepettoGot it. Thanks for the update.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm at UBS. Please go ahead.Alex KrammYes. Hey  good morning. Lots of info you gave already on the mortgage side. But we'd like to dig a little bit deeper in particular on the recurring side. So few questions here. One I don't know if you gave an update to the recurring revenue guide for that segment that would be interested if that's still unchanged  but then more importantly  I think you mentioned that even like some of the challenges in the end markets you are seeing some bankruptcies  et cetera. So maybe you could give us an update what you're seeing in terms of customer losses  and maybe remind us how the revenue model is if there's any receipts  et cetera.And then  sorry  lastly  maybe give us a little bit of the algorithm of growth that you've seen so far in the recurring revenues year-to-date between customer losses  but then also some of the upsells that you guys were talking about earlier. And then  also this continued shift to moving the contract terms to more recurring  so I know that's a mouthful  but hopefully I get out of it.Ben JacksonYes  that's a lot Alex. This is Ben. I'll start and Warren will also I'm sure add in here. So in terms of  I'll start with this  just the overall challenges in the environment. If you take a step back  and you look at what we're building  we're building a business here that in mortgage whether a number of different market environments with an eye towards an 8% to 10% growth over the long-haul. And why are we confident in our ability to do that is the reasons are one we have absolutely mission critical software for these clients that we're providing. We have long-term contracts with our clients  four to five years of the high amount of retention in them. And we are heavily focused  as you've seen in our results  on shifting the revenue to more and more towards recurring. And we did it again this quarter  on the backdrop of 40% down market in terms of volumes  with 18% year-over-year recurring revenue growth in the business.The other Proofpoint  you've seen in terms of being able to weather various market environments is our data analytics line item. With that being up 36% last quarter alone. And one of the key inputs and drivers to that is our AIQ and analyzer solutions  we're seeing tremendous uptake in that we're seeing clients now more than ever just looking to adopt automation to automate as much of the workflow as possible to lower their costs.And the other proof point I put out  there was a comment Warren made in his prepared remarks  in that if you look at Q2 of 2019  very similar volume environment to what we saw in this past quarter  we generated more than $100 million of revenue on a pro forma basis. And that's  what enables us to do as we do time studies  with our clients  and clients that adopt our full automation suite  we see are saving anywhere from 570 to $1 400 per loan that they're manufacturing when they adopt our solutions. So our ability to capture some benefit from that from the efficiencies that we're providing to the industry has been tremendous.In terms of the algorithm of growth  on recurring revenue  it's really -- it's a mix that we've described before  it's a mix of  there is some pricing in there  there is sales to new clients. So I mentioned  we had a good start of the year for sales on Encompass. We've had a good sales for the year on our AIQ business. And then also the other input is that shift as customers are renewing that shift of -- even if we have to forego some transaction revenue of moving more to subscription  we're continuing to do that  and have a lot of success. And we're still early days  we're really in the first year of a codified program to do that. And with contracts with clients going four to five years in the future we have a long runway to go.Warren GardinerAlex  this is Warren  you asked about the guidance. So yes  you're correct. There's no change to the guidance that we gave to start the year. We did assume  as we said back then that there will be some headwinds from people potentially going out of business or maybe not as many new market participants  I'll say I'm highly confident that to the extent that starts to play out  that's going to be a cyclical trend  not a secular one  because I think if you think about the process for and this is reiterating what Ben just said  we think about the rest of getting a mortgage  it continues to be very costly for the consumer  it's very inefficient. And we have the tools that are -- building the tools that are really solving those problems. And so I know that probably doesn't help  solve for 2022  EPS or 2023 EPS  but it should really factor into kind of the multiple people are thinking about when you're valuing the overall enterprise at the end of the day.Alex KrammSo you haven't seen a lot of impact from cancellations at this point  just to clarify.Ben JacksonHey  Alex. It's Ben again. So we have seen a small  small number of lenders that have had some challenges and potentially go out of business  but it's a very small number that we've seen so far.Alex KrammVery good. Thank you.OperatorPerfect. Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtHi  good morning. So last quarter  you spoke about energy traders moving away from using futures and towards options at least for oil specifically  just given the decline in oil futures open interest throughout 2Q it seemed like that trend may have continued. Just wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing from commodity trading firms right now trying to manage risk in an extremely volatile environment. Because I guess given the volatility  we've seen the market  it's a bit surprising to see energy volumes only up 3% in the second quarter and now seemingly kind of trending lower year-on-year into the third quarter. Thank you.Ben JacksonHey  Kyle  it's Ben. So you have a -- we have a confluence of issues that are going on around the world that are really unprecedented. And against that backdrop  we're pleased that our overall  our overall futures business is up for year-over-year in terms of open interest and since the end of the year  and our energy businesses up in open interest since the end of the year  given all of these events. And what are we looking at  we're looking at an inflationary environment  we're looking at a recession  you've got in particular in Europe  governments in Europe  have to figure out the balance between sanctions against Russia  the impact of those sanctions against their civilians  in terms of near-term price impact on energy  and move towards cleaner energy.So you've got this pothole mix and then you also have in China continued COVID lockdowns that are happening  and obviously geopolitical tensions happening with China.So given all those issues  we believe that our marketplace has been set up as best as can be in the in the world to help clients navigate through all of these events  and they're utilizing us to do that. And I'll give a few examples. So first  we have one of the most deep and liquid markets across that energy spectrum. So think of oil  gas  LNG  power and environmentals. So as clients are looking to move and switch between fuels  looking towards  moving towards a cleaner environment  we are the exchange and clearing businesses that they're going to do that.Second  in managing global supply shocks  you have deep -- we have deep liquid global markets in each of those respective asset classes that I mentioned with oil  gas  LNG  power  and environmentals and enable customers because we have all these deep liquid points at the points of production and consumption  as clients need to hedge their risks using different risk management tools. We're very well positioned to do that. And a perfect example is right now with Russia  stifling gas supplies going into Europe  we are seeing U.S. step in and U.S. providing natural gas via LNG cargos going into Northern Europe.And given that we are the home to the vast majority of commercial traders  that trade our U.S. gas products  both Henry Hub and our bases markets  we're seeing clients use that to hedge those cargos. And it's one of the inputs that's led to what I mentioned in my prepared remarks of the record we've seen in market share from a Henry Hub perspective  as well as a North American gas and at a highest well in the global gas complex.The third thing I'd point out is that we're engaged as much as ever with clients and governments around the world around the sanctions and as they're taking shape. And there's no question it had some impact  as there was uncertainty as to how issues would play out in products like gas and oil  where Russian fuel oil is an input into that historically  as governments have made it clear that as of February of 23  Russian fuel oil will no longer be provided  it no longer be consumed in Europe  we've changed the specification on our gas oil contract. And now we started to see open interest in volume starting to build again in gas oil  calendar 23 and beyond.And then you pointed out  our deep liquid options market. So options is clearly one of the most efficient ways to hedge geopolitical tail risk because it helps to hedge a number of different scenarios that could play out and embrace our volume in open or volume in Brent options  year-over-year is up 25%. So when you look at me stand your lens and look at the overall energy complex. We feel really good about how we're positioned.Kyle VoigtThank you so much.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Craig SiegenthalerHey  good morning  everyone. So my question is on mortgage tech origination revenues were down not that surprising. But you help us with some perspective on incremental downside from current levels. And also  in terms of timing  when should we think these revenues will stabilize? And any perspective on that relative to what rates are doing would be helpful too?Ben JacksonHey  Craig  it's Ben  I'll start. So basically reiterate some of the things that I said before  when you widen out what our strategy is  within the mortgage and mortgage technology business  our strategy here has been to move more and more of the revenue towards recurring to take some of that cyclicality out of the business and we continue to do that. And we've been successfully doing that.In terms of predicting the rate environment and how that's going to play out just look at how the rate environments played out over the last week  it's been extraordinarily hard for to see and be able to predict when that this volume environment and stuff will settle down. But despite that  we're going to continue to make investments in the innovation that we're providing to our clients. As we mentioned  a lot of the investments that we made is what fueled that $100 million growth that we saw over the last three years in a similar environment to what we had in 2019. Those are investments -- those investments are in and around everything that we've been doing in the closing side  our simple file business continues to gain market share and do very well. And then all of the innovation that we've been introducing on the data and analytics side with our AIQ platform  as well as the automation of the underwrite platform  we see that those are all tailwinds that regardless of the rate environment and the volume environment that our growth drivers for us.Jeff SprecherAnd this is Jeff  let me just mention that a lot of our mortgage strategy is driven by the fact that we're trying to really position the company to be an all weather named that in all interest rate and macroeconomic environments that I can continue to end my prepared remarks on the same page that shows a graph of compounding earnings growth  for shareholders. And having a U.S. mortgage strategy gives us exposure we own LIBOR  which is the London Interbank index we trade U.K. and EU interest rate futures. We have a credit default swap business that is completely global that includes Russian sovereign  hedging and companies across the globe.We have a fixed income business that is truly global  we provide pricing data in almost every single country that has bond issuance. And we were relatively thin on having exposure to U.S. interest rates  and moving into mortgage gives us that.I also think  when we step back and look at the mortgage complex  the U.S. mortgage complex  and the way we're building the business  is that there is a demographic of millennials  that is huge  that are underserved by homeownership. And there's been supply chain issues during COVID to meet housing. And we generally believe that that any house that gets built will be sold and that there will be a mortgage on it  and that the supply chain issues are getting better and that the underperformance of building is increasing.We also have seen from our limited ownership of having mortgage assets that cash out refinancings happen when the value of homes go up  and which is an inflationary input. And the one that I think a lot of people and maybe is at the root of your question focus on is the absolute interest rate  which leads to people refinancing in a declining interest rate market.Long story short is there are a number of inputs into the housing market. We want to have exposure to the U.S. interest rate environment. It's going to help plus built in all weather name. And even with a downturn in the number of U.S. mortgages  we've had the best second quarter in our company's history.Craig SiegenthalerGreat. Thanks for taking my question.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Brian BedellGreat. Thanks. Good morning  folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just a two-parter on the environmental initiatives. So maybe Ben  if you could just comment on within the energy complex  obviously  we're seeing very good strength in that gas. We did see a couple quarters now sequential declines in the environmental so the question there is  our customers substituting that gas for some of the environmental versus something else driving on the environmental side short-term? And then  the second part of the question is  if you could comment on this  maybe Lynn  but on the acquisition of Urgentem and the overall climate data strategy  whether you're seeking to get more to grow substantially in that business linking that into the data more heavily into the environmental trading side?Ben JacksonGot it. Thanks  Brian. Yes  I'll start and then I’ll hand it to Lynn for the second part of that. So as I mentioned before  there's this confluences issues going on  in particular in Europe and where we have seen some impacts  so the balance between Russia and sanctions and the impact on the civilians and the move to cleaner energy. In Europe in specifically  we have seen some time and attention from traders that would trade things like our EUA markets  our European Union Allowances  moving and shifting more towards just the acute energy issues that everyone's faced with right now. So we have seen some headwinds in that part.But the flip side of it is in North America  we've had a very strong business continuing to do very  very well. North America is doing well and our Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiatives  our California Carbon Allowances  our renewable fuels  our REC markets  each of these are doing very  very well and we're continuing to invest. So we recently launched Biofuel Contracts they're doing well  we recently launched a global index  a Global Carbon Index Future  as well and we're getting more and more on the index itself we're getting more ETS to license and on futures are starting to develop there. We recently launched Texas Wind and Solar contracts  we recently launched nature-based offset contracts for the voluntary markets.So we see a lot of tailwinds coming in the foreseeable future  and you also have other developments like State of Pennsylvania likely to join Reggie [ph] and Washington State likely to put in their Cap and Trade Program for the first time. So we have a lot of good tailwinds there in North America. And I think what you're seeing in the overall complex is just a wait little bit on the EUA market in Europe.Lynn MartinAnd thanks  Brian  for the follow-up question. So given the strength in our fixed income data  we're uniquely positioned to add transparency around ESG  really focused on the climate risk. Given our ability to tie alternative datasets into datasets that the market knows you've seen us further position this offering. In Q4  we announced the acquisition of risQ and Level 11  which enabled us to execute on the opportunity to turn physical climate data into actionable insights starting with our muni bond service  but more recently expanding into the mortgage-backed securities market. And now we have the ability to offer a parcel level information measured by geographic coordinates in the U.S.  and we plan to expand that globally.And then  finally  as you know we recently announced the purchase of our Gen10  which really expands our climate risk offering to include corporate transition risk  given its coverage of 30 000 public and private companies  which was an attractive dataset to us to add to the climate offering.Brian BedellThat's great color. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Michael CyprysGreat  thanks so much. Wanted to ask about the commodities franchise  just curious how you guys are thinking about the longer-term growth drivers there  what factors ultimately drive volumes higher in your commodities franchise  is it production of the underlying commodities  for example  some more oil and gas rigs  producing more oil and gas are going to drive volumes higher over the long-term? Just curious how you think about those growth drivers and the algorithm and how is that evolving? Thank you.Ben JacksonThanks  Michael. This is Ben. And the way we think about it is  we need to have as I described earlier  that breadth of offerings of global offerings across the each of the inputs into producing energy is  as the statistics that are out there point to energy consumption doubling between now and 2050. And it's just what are the inputs into the production of that energy are going to change and will change over-time. And we believe with the breadth of offerings that we have across oil  gas  LNG  power and then the significant early start that we had and thinking about the environmental markets with the acquisition of the Climate Exchange over a decade ago  we're very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So that's one input into it.You do have a global focus on the reduction of carbon emissions around the world and as I said before  with our environmental markets  we are very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So those are two. I think the third is that even though we have had some near-term headwinds in some of the products in Europe in particular the ones that have been at the center of this Ukraine  Russia situation we continue to see user growth. So we continue to see more and more users taking data subscriptions and coming onto the platform to get visibility into what's happening in those markets  how those markets correlate  or de-correlate at times to others around the world. So when we look at the underlying health of the market  looking at user growth  looking at open interest and looking at the global breadth of the offerings that we provide to our clients  those are all inputs into our growth outlook [ph].Michael CyprysGreat. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your question. Our final question is a follow-up from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.Rich RepettoYes. Thanks for taking the question. Just one last question on mortgage  and this I think is more for Jeff. In the prepared remarks  it was mentioned about efficiency and automation and how the downturn is maybe emphasizing that more in the mortgage segment. But I guess the question  Jeff is  I think people are really looking for the connection between mortgage and how that can automate overtime as you've done so in other markets. So the question is  how is it comparing given that mortgage has a longer workflow process  but what you are seeing so far in regards to the automation of the market longer term versus the other asset classes you've dealt with?Jeff SprecherSure  that's a great question Rich  because I'm a company founder  I get asked to speak to entrepreneurs from time-to-time and I always tell them  the best time to start a business is when there's a downturn and not that having us moved into this space  you wish a downturn on anybody  but it's very  very hard to get people in finance and I say this broadly  whether it's trading  clearing  data  acquisition it is very  very hard to get people in finance to change their behavior when they're making a lot of money and when things are going well.And the best time to get people to think about making a change is when their businesses are under pressure and Ben alluded to that a number of times in why our subscription revenues are doing well in the mortgage space.Broadly speaking again  I appreciate the question. I know you've followed our company for many years  and you see us putting data and analytic tools into the mortgage market. The mortgage market that we're talking a lot about is the cash market. You've seen us and I mentioned in my prepared remarks  launch our first derivative product against in a new index that we created. And so I think this space has a lot of inefficiencies throughout the entire  not just the manufacturing the mortgage  but the way mortgages are financed and traded and retreated in the secondary market  very poor data available due to the paper based nature of the contract  difficult to regulate for regulate regulators  regulators think that there may be biases in the market  but without the right data  it's very hard to know  it's very hard to correct for the participants in the market  very expensive for consumers  banks that spend a lot of money to court a consumer  tend to lose them when there's a refinancing or a change in that client's behavior.The market is not very thoughtful about keeping connectivity between those that lend and those that borrow and all of that I think is fertile ground for us and may go for decades  honestly as we build out the infrastructure. But at the core  we need a foundation of data and information that borrowers  that lenders and that regulators can all look at and use to make it easier.I think I may have mentioned to you even that  it's odd to me that you can buy a completely consumable good  you can buy toothpaste on an online platform and when you go to checkout it'll ask you if you want to buy now and pay later  knowing that an algorithm underwrote your credit against no collateral and yet  it takes almost two months for somebody to refinance a mortgage in a house that they live in  that has a foundation that's in the ground that has an address that you can see from space that is part of the Maslow's hierarchy of need of safety and security and will be abandoned by that person  the last thing they do. And yet we  an existing mortgage talking to their bank takes two months.It just something is wrong in those equations. And we could argue that by now pay later lending maybe too generous  but certainly 60 days to do work with an existing client than an existing home just feels too long. And that's  that is the challenge that I think we will tackle successfully and put the entire industry on a better footing.Rich RepettoGot it. Thank you. That's helpful.OperatorThank you for your question. We have received a follow up from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtThanks for taking my follow up. So a question on the OTC and other revenue line in the exchange segment was quite strong in the quarter. I just want to confirm that the increase that we saw there was really driven by collateral fees that ICE is clearing house or is there something else that was driving that? And can you remind us if those collateral fees are entirely fixed basis point fees  or if there is or will be any benefit from rate hikes we've seen in the U.S. and EU?Warren GardinerSo hey  Kyle  it's Warren. So in terms of the OTC and other yes  you're correct that the performance there has been collateral driven that's largely from net interest income or earning at ICE Future or ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Europe and so as collateral bounces move around and you've seen that over the course of this year. That's obviously going to benefit that particular line item.In terms of rates moving higher  we do have a benefit from that that's going to show up there more on -- will show up on the CDS clearing side because we do park some collateral funds there as a Fed. And so we do get a benefit as collateral moves up  but then also as Fed funds rates move up there and so that's part of the strong performance you've seen in CDS there. So  not in that OTC and other line but in the spirit of your question  yes  that there's a benefit from better rate hikes coming through over-time.Kyle VoigtUnderstood. Thanks.OperatorThank you for your question  Kyle. This concludes our Q&A session. And now I'd like to pass over to Chair CEO  Jeff Sprecher for any final remarks.Jeff SprecherThank you  Victoria.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the first six months of 2022 ended June 30  2022.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.)Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries  commented:""Pharming delivered strong half year results with total revenues up 4% compared to the same period last year. RUCONEST® sales growth was supported by increases in physicians prescribing and number of patients. For the second quarter of 2022  sales were US$50.1 million bringing the first half year of 2022 to US$96.8 million.Concerning pipeline development  we continued to advance leniolisib through the regulatory process as we seek marketing authorization in the US  the UK  and the EEA for the treatment of APDS  a rare  complex and progressive primary immunodeficiency. In the US  we filed a New Drug Application with the FDA for the treatment of APDS in adults and adolescents aged 12 or older at the end of July 2022. On August 2  we announced a new diagnosis code for reporting cases of APDS  which will be added to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The diagnosis code  D81.82  will be effective starting October 1  2022.Looking to Europe  the EEA and the UK remain on track for regulatory filings from October this year. On August 1  we announced the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older.Story continuesIn our drive to focus on RUCONEST® sales  the launch and commercialization of leniolisib  and the management of our pipeline  we initiated an internal review of our pipeline. As a result of these initial findings  we have taken the strategic decision to discontinue the development of rhC1INH for acute kidney injury and pre-eclampsia. In line with this decision  we will also de-prioritize further development in the large-scale production of rhC1INH through the use of our transgenic cattle herd. The herd will be maintained while we consider strategic options for acute kidney injury (AKI) to gain value from the work done to date. We will continue to progress the ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial in AKI until further notice.With these decisions  we continue to evolve as a company  and continue to focus our efforts and resources on the most value enhancing initiatives for our stakeholders.""Strategic highlightsDuring the first half of 2022  we continued to execute on our strategic objectives of building a sustainable business by focusing on RUCONEST® sales  the approval  launch and commercialization of leniolisib  and the ongoing development and management of our pipeline.The development of our pipeline will be through a combination of internal development projects - including the development of additional indications for leniolisib and OTL-105 as a gene therapy for HAE - and the potential acquisition of new  late-stage assets through in-licensing and M&A opportunities.These potential acquisitions will be financed through a combination of positive cash flow from the RUCONEST® business  anticipated future leniolisib businesses  as well as available cash from our strong balance sheet. If required  Pharming will access additional funding from the capital markets.Therefore  with the ongoing focus on our strategic objectives  we have initiated an internal review of our pipeline. As a result  we are announcing a number of initial changes to the pipeline as detailed below.Pipeline developmentleniolisibFor leniolisib  a three-step approach has been planned for the coming years.The first step is the anticipated commercial approval and market launch in the US during the first half of 2023  followed by key markets in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK in the second half of 2023. The Company will evaluate additional countries and regions and will commercialize the product either directly  or through strategic distribution partnerships.The second step includes the approval and launch of leniolisib as a treatment of APDS in children as young as one year of age.The third step is the continued life cycle management of the leniolisib compound into further indications.US marketSubject to FDA approval and granting of priority review by the FDA in the US  we remain on track for the commercial approval of leniolisib in the first quarter and market launch early in the second quarter of 2023.On July 29  2022  a New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the US FDA for leniolisib  for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents aged 12 or older. Aligned with the goals set out in PDUFA VI  Pharming expects a Filing Notification Letter by Day 60  which will include the FDA's determination of priority review. If priority review is granted  it is expected that the FDA review will be completed within six months of the 60-day filing date.In anticipation of a positive outcome from the FDA  we continue to grow our US field force and leverage our marketing capabilities for the commercialization of leniolisib.Finally for the US market  on August 2  2022  Pharming announced that a new diagnosis code for reporting cases of APDS  will be added to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The diagnosis code  D81.82  will be effective starting October 1  2022  and will help accurately identify  stratify and triage US patients eligible for APDS treatments and research opportunities.EU and UK marketsIn Europe  we remain on track with anticipated filings of the market authorization applications to both regulatory agencies - the European Medical Agency (EMA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - in the second half of 2022. Additionally  the MHRA granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS.Additionally  on August 1  we announced the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. Pharming plans to submit the MAA for leniolisib to EMA in October 2022.Pediatric clinical developmentThe studies to support the initial applications in the US  EU  and UK have enrolled patients ages 12 years and older. To expand access to leniolisib for the treatment of pediatric APDS  Pharming has developed a clinical plan to include children as young as one year of age. During the first half of the year  positive decisions were received from EMA and MHRA on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children.The leniolisib PIP includes two planned  global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS aged 4 to 11 with a second study in patients aged 1 to 6. These two studies will support regulatory filings worldwide. Pharming expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib in the second half of 2022.OTL-105In July 2021  Pharming announced a strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE). The program has made significant progress developing the lentiviral vector to enhance C1-inhibitor expression and is now testing in preclinical HAE disease models. We anticipate providing further updates as we move towards preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing.Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)Following an internal review of our pipeline  we have taken the strategic decision to discontinue further development of this therapy.While we consider strategic options to gain value from the work done to date  we will de-prioritize further development and investment in the large-scale production of rhC1INH through the use of our transgenic cattle herd. The herd will continue to be maintained to allow all possible outcomes to be explored.The ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial will continue as we evaluate these strategic options.Pre-eclampsiaFollowing an internal review of our pipeline  a decision has been made to discontinue further development and investment. This was due to the choices we have made to prioritize the investments to support the sales of RUCONEST® and the commercialization of leniolisib.PompeThe study into the development of a next-generation alpha-glucosidase therapy for the treatment of Pompe disease is ongoing. We are currently engaged in preclinical studies. If and when results from these preclinical studies become available  we will update the market.Operational highlightsRUCONEST®RUCONEST® sales were up 4% in the first half of 2022 providing stable cash flow for Pharming's future growth. Total revenues were US$96.8 million compared to US$93.2 million in the first half of 2021. RUCONEST® sales growth was supported by increases in physicians prescribing and number of patients.The US market represented 97% of total revenues for the first half of the year  while Rest of World (RoW) and Europe represented 3%.With a continued need for safe and reliable acute treatment options for hereditary angioedema (HAE)  we remain confident in the ongoing demand for RUCONEST® and continued single digit growth for the 2022 financial year.Organizational updateRobert Friesen  Chief Scientific Officer and Executive Board member resigned from his role at Pharming Group. Mr Friesen's succession is currently under review.Financial SummaryAmounts in US$m except per share data H1 2022 H1 2021 % ChangeIncome StatementRevenues 96.8 93.2 4 % Gross profit 87.9 83.8 5 % Operating profit 20.6 17.2 20 % Profit for the year 19.2 14.4 33 % Balance SheetCash & marketable securities 190.9 189.8 1 % Share InformationBasic earnings per share (US$) 0.029 0.022 32 % Diluted earnings per share (US$) 0.027 0.019 42 %Financial highlightsH1 2022Total revenues increased by 4% during the first half of 2022 to US$96.8 million  versus US$93.2 million during the first half of 2021.Gross profit increased by 5% during the first half of 2022  in line with the growth in revenues. Gross profit for 2022 was US$87.9 million (2021: US$83.8 million).Other income increased significantly in 2022 (US$15.0 million) as compared to 2021 (US$1.4 million) as Pharming reduced its minority stake in BioConnection from 43.85% to 22.98% in April 2022. As a result of this transaction  Pharming has received one-off net cash proceeds of US$7.5 million (EUR6.9 million) and recognized a gain of US$12.8 million.Operating profit for the first half of 2022 amounted to US$20.6 million  a 20% increase compared to the same period last year (US$17.2 million). This was mainly driven by the increase in other income of US$13.6 million. This was partly offset by an increase in operating costs resulting from a combination of increased R&D expenditure  launch preparation and manufacturing cost for leniolisib  and an increase in travel related expenses post-COVID.Net profit for H1 2022 was US$19.2 million  a 33% increase compared to H1 2021 (US$14.4 million). This was due to higher operating profit  increased financial income  and a decrease in tax expenses  which was offset by a decrease in the net profits in associates using the equity method.Cash and cash equivalents  together with restricted cash  decreased from US$193.0 million at the end of 2021 to US$190.9 million at the end of the second quarter 2022.Q2 2022For the second quarter of 2022  revenues increased by 1.0% to US$50.1 million  compared to US$49.7 million in the second quarter of 2021.Gross profit increased by 2.4%  to US$46.1 million as compared to the same period last year. This was in line with the growth in revenues.Operating profit of US$17.8 million was recorded for the second quarter of 2022. This was a 63.3% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This was a result of Pharming recognizing a gain of US$12.8 million in relation to the reduction in its minority stake in BioConnection  partly offset by increased costs for the leniolisib launch preparations.Net profit for the second quarter was US$15.7 million compared to US$5.8 million in the second quarter of 2021. This was mainly due to the one-off recognized gain of US$12.8 million from the reduction in its minority stake in BioConnection.OutlookFor the remainder of 2022  we expect:Single digit growth in Group revenues from RUCONEST® sales  driven by the US and expanded EU markets  are subject to potential business restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarterly fluctuations are expected.The submission of leniolisib's regulatory filings to EMA and UK MHRA are expected in the second half of 2022.Subject to positive outcomes of the FDA review and granting of a Priority Review for leniolisib  we anticipate commercial approval from the FDA in the first quarter of 2023  with an anticipated launch and commercialization soon after.Pharming will continue to allocate resources towards the anticipated launch and commercialization of leniolisib with the view of accelerating future growth. Investments in launch preparations and focused clinical development for leniolisib will continue to impact profit for 2022.

to the condensed consolidated financial statementsFor the period ended 30 June 20221.

Statement of complianceThe consolidated interim financial statements for the six-month period ended 30 June 2022 have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 34  Interim financial reporting. The condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021  which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS interpretations committee (IFRS IC) interpretations applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and valid as of the balance sheet date.These condensed interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 3 August 2022.The published figures in these condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited.3. Accounting policiesAccounting policies are consistent with those of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.4. Estimates and judgementsThe preparation of interim financial statements in conformity with IAS 34 and Book 2 Title 9 of the Dutch Civil Code requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. In preparing these condensed interim financial statements  the significant judgements made by management in applying the Company's accounting policies were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.5. Going concernIn preparing and finishing the interim financial statements the Board of Directors of Pharming have assessed the Company's ability to fund its operations for a period of at least twelve months after the date the interim financial statements are issued. Based upon the assessment on a going concern basis  the Company has concluded that funding of its operations for a period of twelve months  after the date the interim financial statements are issued  is realistic and achievable. Overall  based on the outcome of this assessment  the interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.6. Seasonality of operationsSeasonality has no material impact on Company's interim financial statements.7. Segment informationThe Board of Directors consider the business from both a product and geographic perspective. From a product perspective  the Company's business is exclusively related to the recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor business. From a geographic perspective  the Company is operating in the US  Europe and RoW. The Board of Directors primarily measures revenues and gross profit to assess the performance of the geographic areas. Operating costs as well as non-current assets are not sub-allocated to the geographic areas.Total revenues and gross profit per geographic segment for the period ended 30 June:Amounts in US$ '000 H1 2022 H1 2021 Revenues:US 94 136 90 079 Europe & RoW 2 627 3 158 Total revenues 96 763 93 237 Gross profit:US 86 329 82 505 Europe & RoW 1 528 1 245 Total gross profit 87 857 83 7508. Other incomeOther income increased significantly in 2022 (US$15.0 million) as compared to 2021 (US$1.4 million) as Pharming reduced its minority stake in BioConnection from 43.85% to 22.98% in April 2022. As a result of this transaction  Pharming has recognized a gain of US$12.8 million. The remainder of the increase relates to increased government grants granted on R&D activities.9. Expenses by natureCost of sales in the first half year of 2022 amounted to US$8.9 million (HY 2021: US$9.5 million) and relate to actual product sales.Other operating costs increased to US$82.2 million compared to US$68.0 million in the first half year of 2021. The increase was a combination of increased R&D expenditure  launch preparation and manufacturing cost for leniolisib  and an increase in travel related expenses post-COVID.Employee benefitsEmployee benefits are charged to research and development costs  general and administrative costs or marketing and sales costs based on the nature of the services provided.Depreciation and amortization chargesAmounts in US$ '000 H1 2022 H1 2021 Property  plant and equipment (877) (1 044) Right-of-use assets (1 135) (1 385) Intangible assets (2 251) (2 089) Total (4 263) (4 518)The decrease of depreciation charges of property  plant and equipment and right-of-use assets in 2022 as compared to 2021 stems mainly from favorable currency translation effects.The increase in amortization of the intangible assets mainly relates to amortization of our new ERP system  which is operational as of January 2022. This is partly offset by favorable currency translation effects.10. Financial income (expenses)Amounts in US$ '000 H1 2022 H1 2021 Foreign currency results 6 474 5 355 Interest income — 43 Other financial income 6 474 5 398 Foreign currency results 0 (1) Interest on convertible bonds (2 434) (2 667) Other interest expenses (295) (479) Contingent consideration — 253 Other financial expenses (51) (64) Other financial expenses (2 780) (2 958) Total other financial income and expenses 3 694 2 440Foreign currency results in the EUR functional currency entities  primarily follow from the revaluation of bank balances and the loan which are denominated in foreign currencies  mainly US dollars. The US dollar strengthened over the course of 2022.11. InvestmentsInvestments accounted for using the equity methodThe asset relates to an investment in the ordinary shares of BioConnection Investments B.V. During the second quarter of 2022  Pharming entered into a share purchase agreement  following receipt of an offer for all shares in BioConnection by Gimv  a European investment company listed on Euronext Brussels. The existing shareholders (including Pharming) reached agreement with Gimv on the sale of all issued and outstanding shares to a new holding company (BioConnection Investments B.V.) incorporated by Gimv  followed by a partial re-investment by existing shareholders of the purchase price in the share capital of BioConnection Investments B.V. The re-investment relates to the purchase of ordinary shares and a preference share.The Board of Directors made an assessment on the accounting treatment of the agreement and concluded that the sale of the BioConnection ordinary shares and purchase of the BioConnection Investments B.V. ordinary shares shall be considered as a dilution of an existing equity stake in an investment in associate. Hence Pharming recognized the dilution of its equity stake as a reduction of the carrying amount of the investment in associate accounted for using the equity method. The preference share is valued as an investment in debt instruments designated as at fair value with changes through profit and loss (FVTPL). As a result of this transaction  Pharming has received one-off net cash proceeds of US$7.5 million (EUR6.9 million) and recognized a gain of US$12.8 millionIn the Board of Directors' judgement  the investment in BioConnection constitutes an investment in an associated company and is therefore not consolidated  as Pharming has significant influence but does not have control of BioConnection and is embargoed by a shareholders agreement between the shareholders of BioConnection from influencing any activity between the two parties which is in any significant way different from the relationship which existed between the two prior to the investment.The carrying amount of this investment has changed as follows:Amounts in US $ '000 June 30 2022 December 31 2021 Balance at 1 January 7 201 7 118 Amortization of financial guarantee (15) (33) Dilution of equity stake (3 104) — Profit (loss) for the period (550) 694 Foreign exchange rate movements (389) (578) Balance at end of period 3 143 7 201Investment in debt instruments designated as at FVTPLThe asset relates to the preference share as obtained as part of the agreement referred to above relating to BioConnection Investments B.V. The Board of Director's made an assessment on the accounting treatment of the preference share obtained. The Board concluded that the asset should be recognized as a financial asset (debt instrument) measured at initial recognition at fair value  subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. The fair value is calculated using the forward-looking Black-Scholes-Merton (""BSM"") financial instrument pricing framework.The carrying amount of this investment has changed as follows:Amounts in US $ '000 June 30 2022 December 31 2021 Balance at 1 January — — Investment 8 235 — Foreign exchange rate movements (390) — Balance at end of period 7 845 —Investment in equity instruments designated as at FVTOCIThe Group holds 1 0 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Orchard Therapeutics  a global gene therapy leader. The share were acquired as of July 1  2021  as part of strategic collaboration between Pharming Group N.V. and Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex-vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE)  a life-threatening rare disorder that causes recurring swelling attacks in the face  throat  extremities and abdomen.The Board of Directors do not consider that the Group is able to exercise significant influence over Orchard Therapeutics as the other 99.0 percent of the ordinary share capital is publicly traded at the Nasdaq stock exchange (Nasdaq: ORTX).The carrying amount of this investment has changed as follows:Amounts in US $ '000 June 30 2022 December 31 2021 Balance at 1 January 1 449 — Initial recognition — 4 589 Fair value adjustments through OCI (702) (3 077) Currency translation (104) (63) Balance at end of period 643 1 44912. Intangible assetsThe decrease in intangible assets mainly stems from regular amortization charges (US$2.3 million) and currency translation effects (US$6.6 million)  partly offset by capital expenditures (US$0.8 million).13. Property  plant and equipmentThe decrease in property  plant and equipment mainly stems from regular depreciation charges (US$1.4 million) and currency translation effects (US$0.9 million)  partly offset by capital expenditures (US$0.7 million).14. Right-of-use assetsThe decrease in the right of use asset is mainly caused by regular depreciation. No new significant investments for the first half year of 2022.15. Deferred tax assetsThe deferred tax asset decreased mainly due to offsetting the current tax expense with unused tax losses from prior years.16.

The impairment includes an impairment for obsolescence and an impairment to write inventories down to their net realizable value.Inventories are available for use in commercial  preclinical and clinical activities. Estimates have been made with respect to the ultimate use or sale of product  taking into account current and expected sales as well as preclinical and clinical programs. These estimates are reflected in the additions to the impairment.The costs of vials used in preclinical and clinical programs are presented under the research and development costs.The main portion of inventories at June 30  2022 have expiration dates starting beyond 2023 and are all expected to be sold and/or used before expiration.17.

The Flash Memory Summit Awards represent an industry recognition of innovation that Kalray’s Flashbox™ solution brings to the market.“Designing an enterprise storage array today can benefit from a disaggregated architecture that can address performance at the highest levels and capacity expansion in a cost-effective manner.” said Jay Kramer  Chairman of the Awards Program and President of Network Storage Advisors Inc. “We are proud to recognize the collaboration between Viking and Kalray which provides an integrated storage solution delivering seral millions of IOPS using 12x 100 Gb/s network interface connections distributed across six DPUs-based acceleration cards.”Flashbox™ is a new concept of All-Flash-Array  based on Kalray’s MPPA® DPU processor (“Data Processing Unit”) and co-designed with Viking Enterprise Solutions.Whereas most advanced All-Flash Array solutions currently use multiple adapter cards with power-hungry and expensive CPUs (x86) that run storage services  the concept of Flashbox™ is to run all of the critical functions of a disaggregated storage appliance on a single chip: the Kalray MPPA® DPU. This solution delivers an unprecedent level of integration  speed  scalability and performance at an affordable cost. Thanks to Flashbox™ All-Flash-Array  data centers can reduce critical metrics such as $/IOP and IOPs/watt.“It is a great honor to win a Flash Memory Summit award for our innovative concept of Flashbox™ All-Flash Array.” said Kalray CEO  Éric Baissus. “We strongly believe that wide adoption of NVMe requires adopting new innovative approaches. This is Flashbox™. Flashbox™ is a unique high-performance  low power  cost-effective  high-available new generation of storage appliances based on Kalray’s DPU technology. Powered by our Smart Storage Acceleration Card  Flashbox™ allows data center customers to disaggregate their Flash tier while maintaining the same performance of local NVMe  thereby optimizing both Flash performance and capacity across the compute tier of their data center.”A unique concept on the market today  Flashbox™ benefits from ultra-fast interfaces and low power consumption. It can deliver unprecedent performance figures using 12x 100 Gb/s network interface connections distributed across six K200-LP cards and is based on market standards such as Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK)  NVMe/TCP or RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCEv1/v2).Flashbox™ is a 2U array  with support for 24 U.2 NVMe SSDs. Flashbox™ JBOF (Just A Bunch of Flash) replaces x86 servers of traditional storage nodes with Kalray PCIe cards (K200-LP) which incorporate the Kalray DPU. The high-availability Flashbox™ has two Viking Enterprise Solutions fabric modules  each module has a PCIe switch network and supports three PCIe add-in card slots (half-height  half-length). Each Kalray DPU PCIe add-in card can run all the critical functions and data services required of a storage appliance. Flashbox™ can scale from two to six of the K200-LP PCIe add-in cards allowing the end customer to scale performance independently of capacity of the array. This unique solution is lower cost and significantly lower power from a traditional NVMe storage array.Additionally  users will be able to take advantage of current and future data services integrated into the solution software stack such as data reduction (compression or deduplication)  data availability (RAID or erasure encoding) or data security (encryption). This will further enhance critical business metrics by offloading these services from the data center compute tiers. Flashbox™ offers the ideal SDS (software defined storage) solution by abstracting and disaggregating the Flash tier from the compute tier.About KALRAYKalray (Euronext Growth Paris - FR0010722819 - ALKAL) is a fabless semiconductor company  a leading provider of a new class of processors  specialized in Intelligent Data Processing from Cloud to Edge.

However  it requires vigilance and understanding of what users actually sign up for to avoid any risky activities with customers’ assets.“If you’re concerned about ""not your keys — not your coins "" you should just understand who this firm is  what the reputation is  how they are embracing regulation  or they are not embracing regulation ” Peck said. He added that self-custody has been trending in the community over the past few months as firms like the crypto lender Celcius were pausing withdrawals due to liquidity issues amid the massive crypto winter of 2022.“They were doing incredibly risky things with those deposits ” Peck noted.Related: Self-custody is key during extreme market conditions: Here's what experts sayThe latest remarks by WisdomTree’s head of digital assets come amid the company debuting its proprietary custodial wallet solution  WisdomTree Prime. The platform aims to provide exposure to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH)  as well as tokenized versions of physical assets like the U.S. dollar and gold.One of the largest crypto ETP providers  WisdomTree has launched eight crypto asset ETPs on Börse Xetra  SIX  the Swiss Stock Exchange and Euronext exchanges in Amsterdam and Paris.

Dual targeting of CD20 and CD22  both validated targets in B-cell malignancies  represents a potential therapeutic alternative to CD19-directed therapies.In 2018  Cellectis made the decision to internalize manufacturing for its therapeutic product candidates  with the goal of providing the company with manufacturing independence. UCART20x22 is the first example of achieving this milestone  as our first product candidate with fully integrated in-house development. It showcases our transformation into an end-to-end cell and gene therapy company  from discovery & product development  transfer  and GMP manufacturing and clinical development. We are very excited to start the clinical trial for patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in the second half of this year.Story continuesWe continue to make progress enrolling patients in our three Cellectis-sponsored Phase 1 dose escalation trials and take notable steps forward with our partnerships programs. These updates illustrate our potential and ability to advance the field of allogeneic CAR T cell therapy.”Pipeline highlightsCellectis continues to make progress  enrolling patients throughout its sponsored Phase 1 dose escalation trials:BALLI-01 (evaluating UCART22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL)UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD22 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r B-ALL in the BALLI-01 Phase 1 dose escalation clinical study.BALLI-01 is currently enrolling patients at dose level 3 (DL3) (5 × 10 6 cells/kg) with fludarabine  cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab (FCA) preconditioning regimen.Cellectis plans to initiate dosing patients with UCART22 product candidate manufactured fully in-house in the second half of this year.AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123) in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML)UCART123 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD123 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r AML in the AMELI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.MELANI-01 (evaluating UCARTCS1) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)UCARTCS1 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CS1 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r MM in the MELANI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.Cellectis is currently enrolling patients at dose level 1 (DL1) (1 × 106 cells/kg) with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) preconditioning regimen.NatHaLi-01 (evaluating UCART20x22) in relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (r/r NHL)UCART20x22 is Cellectis’ first allogeneic dual CAR T-cell product candidate being developed for patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (r/r NHL).UCART20x22 is Cellectis’ first product candidate fully designed  developed and manufactured in-house  showcasing the Company’s transformation into an end-to-end cell and gene therapy platform spanning discovery  product development  manufacturing of both starting materials and final cell therapy product candidate  as well as clinical development.On August 1st  the FDA allowed Cellectis’ IND to proceed for UCART20x22 for patients with r/r NHL. Cellectis plans to begin enrolling patients in the NatHaLi-01 Phase 1/2a clinical trial in the second half of the year.UCART Preclinical Data & ProgramsNovel universal CAR T-cellOn May 16  Cellectis presented research data on the development of a novel universal CAR T-cell with immune-evasive properties using TALEN ® -gene editing  at an oral presentation at the American Society of Cell and Gene Therapy Annual Meeting (ASGCT). Click here to access the presentation.Following its oral presentation at ASGCT  Cellectis published its research data in Nature Communications on June 30. Click here to access the article.Cellectis’ next generation of universal CAR T-cells have the potential to improve the persistence and to allow large-scale deployment of T-cell product candidates in allogeneic settings against multiple malignancies. This novel immune-evasive CAR T-cell scaffold is deficient in Class 1 major histocompatibility complex (MHC-1) and expresses the Natural Killer (NK) inhibitor HLA-E. These two genomic modifications enable CAR T-cells to evade NK (Natural Killer) cells as well as alloresponsive T-cells attacks and impart efficient antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo.Licensed Allogeneic CAR-T Cell Development ProgramsAllogene Therapeutics  Inc.’s CAR T programs utilize Cellectis technologies. ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A are anti-CD19 products being jointly developed under a collaboration agreement between Les Laboratoires Servier (“Servier”) and Allogene Therapeutics  Inc. (“Allogene”) based on an exclusive license granted by Cellectis to Servier2. Servier grants to Allogene exclusive rights to ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A in the U.S. while Servier retains exclusive rights for all other countries. Allogene’s anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programs are licensed exclusively from Cellectis to Allogene and Allogene holds global development and commercial rights to these programs.Anti-CD19 programIn June 2022  Allogene announced that FDA granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to ALLO-501A in relapsed/refractory Large B Cell Lymphoma (r/r LBCL). The RMAT designation was based on the potential of ALLO-501A to address the unmet need for patients who have failed other therapies and follows positive data from the Phase 1 ALPHA2 trial in heavily pretreated patients with r/r LBCL.Allogene previously announced that enrollment in the Phase 1 portion of the ALLO-501A ALPHA2 trial in relapsed/refractory (r/r) Large B Cell Lymphoma (LBCL) re-opened with the goal of offering AlloCAR T™ to patients while Allogene prepares to launch the pivotal Phase 2 ALPHA2 trial. They also previously said that the single-arm pivotal ALPHA2 trial of ALLO-501A in r/r LBCL is on track to begin mid-year 2022 with FDA discussions directed at finalizing clinical trial design and Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) requirements. AlloCAR T™ is a trademark of Allogene Therapeutics  Inc.Anti-BCMA programIn May 2022  Allogene announced that the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for ALLO-605 for the treatment of r/r MM.Allogene previously announced that enrollment had resumed in trials targeting BCMA for the treatment of patients with r/r MM  including the UNIVERSAL trial with ALLO-715 and the IGNITE trial with the TurboCAR™ candidate  ALLO-605.Anti-CD70 programIn April 2022  Allogene presented preclinical data at the 2022 AACR Annual Meeting which support the ongoing clinical evaluation of ALLO-316 for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and other CD70 expressing cancers. The findings were simultaneously published in AACR’s Cancer Research.Allogene previously announced that the Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial of ALLO-316 in RCC  now in its second dose level cohort  continues to accrue patients.Gene Editing PartnershipsIovance Biotherapeutics  Inc. (“Iovance”)First in human trial of genetically modified Iovance TIL therapy IOV-4001: site activation and patient recruitment are underway in the IOV-GM1-201 clinical trial of Iovance’s first genetically modified TIL therapy  IOV-4001  for the treatment of previously treated advanced melanoma or mNSCLC. IOV-4001 leverages the gene editing TALEN® technology licensed from Cellectis to inactivate PD-1 expression.Research Programs for Next-Generation TIL Therapies and Related Technologies: Several targets for genetic modification using the gene-editing TALEN® technology  including double genetic knock-out programs  are advancing in preclinical development.Cytovia Therapeutics  Inc. (“Cytovia”)The research and development collaboration with Cytovia to develop TALEN®-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) NK and CAR-NK cells is progressing. Cellectis has developed custom TALEN® which Cytovia is using to edit iPSCs in a safe and effective manner.Cytovia has generated promising preclinical data of TALEN®-edited iPSC-derived NK cells that it expects to present at upcoming scientific conferences later this year.Corporate UpdatesOn June 28  2022  Cellectis announced that during the annual shareholders meeting  Axel-Sven Malkomes and Donald Bergstrom  M.D.  Ph.D.  were appointed as Directors of the Company’s Board of Directors  with immediate effect.Previously  Donald A Bergstrom  M.D.  Ph.D.  was appointed as a Board Observer on the Company’s Board of Directors on November 4  2021. Dr. Bergstrom currently serves as Executive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Relay Therapeutics  Inc.  a clinical-stage precision medicines company.Axel-Sven Malkomes served as Chief Financial Officer & Chief Business Officer at Medigene AG  a clinical stage immuno-oncology company focusing on the development of T-cell immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer  until March 31st  2022. He brings with him over 25 years of experience in the healthcare sector.Financial ResultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  which consolidate the results of Calyxt  Inc. of which Cellectis owned approximately 51.3% of outstanding shares of common stock (as of June 30  2022)  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants – in the appendices of this Q2 2022 financial results press release.Cash: As of June 30  2022  Cellectis  including Calyxt  had $135 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of which $123 million are attributable to Cellectis on a stand-alone basis. This compares to $191 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2021  of which $177 million was attributable to Cellectis on a stand-alone basis. This net decrease of $56 million primarily reflects (i) $56 million of net cash flows used in operating  investing and lease financing activities of Cellectis  (ii) $13 million of net cash flows used in operating  capital expenditures and lease financing activities of Calyxt  and (iii) a $4 million defavorable FOREX impact which was partially offset by (i) $10 million of net proceeds from capital raise at Calyxt and  (ii) $5 million of cash received related to research tax credit prefinancing. Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis excluding Calyxt anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of $123 million as of June 30  2022 will fund its operations into early 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $7 million for the six months ended June 30  2022 compared to $43 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. 99% of consolidated revenues and other income was attributable to Cellectis in the first six months of 2022. This decrease between the six months ended June 30  2022 and 2021 was mainly attributable to (i) a decrease of revenue pursuant to the recognition of a $15.0 million convertible note obtained as consideration for a “right-to-use” license granted to Cytovia and a $5.1 million Allogene milestone during the six-month period ended June 30  2021  while revenue related to collaboration agreements for the six months of 2022 consists of the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million and the recognition of $1.0 million related to a change of control of a licensee pursuant to the terms of the license agreement with Cellectis and amendment to the license agreement (extension of the option term) (ii) a decrease in other revenues of $5 million relating to a change in Calyxt’s business model for its PlantSpring technology and BioFactory  in which no significant revenue was yet recognized.Cost of Revenues: Consolidated cost of revenues were $0 7 million for the six months ended June 30  2022 compared to $20 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. This decrease is driven by the change in Calyxt’s business model for its PlantSpring and BioFactory.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $59 million for the six months ended June 30  2022 compared to $62 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. 89% of consolidated R&D expenses was attributable to Cellectis in the first six months of 2022. The $3 million decrease between the first six months of 2022 and 2021 was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease of purchases  external expenses and other by $4.5 million (from $36 million in 2021 to $31 million in 2022) due to lower consumables  subcontracting costs and depreciation and amortization for the therapeutic segment  (ii) a $0.9 million decrease in social charges on stock option  and (iii) a $0.9 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense partially offset by an increase of $3 million in wages and salaries mainly driven by the increased R&D headcount in the therapeutic segment.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $17.7 million for the six months ended June 30  2022 compared to $18.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. 62% of consolidated SG&A expenses was attributable to Cellectis in the first six months of 2022. The $0.5 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $3 million decrease in wages and salaries  (ii) a $0.3 million decrease in social charges on stock option grants and (iii) a $0.5 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $9.2 million in 2021 to $8.7 million in 2022) partially offset by (i) a $3 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense mainly explained by the favorable impact in 2021 of the recapture of non-cash stock-based compensation from the forfeiture of certain of Calyxt’s former CEO’s unvested stock options  restricted stock units  and performance stock units following his departure.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $51 million (or $1.12 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022  of which $47 million was attributed to Cellectis  compared to $52 million (or $1.17 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2021  of which $43 million was attributed to Cellectis. This $1 million decrease in net loss between first six months 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by (i) an increase in net financial gain of $14.7  (ii) a decrease of $19 million of cost of revenue and  (iii) a $3.8 million decrease of research and development expenses partially offset by a decrease in revenues and other income of $36 million.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $46 million (or $1.00 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022  of which $43 million is attributed to Cellectis  compared to a net loss of 48 million (or $1.08 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2021  of which $38 million was attributed to Cellectis. Please see ""Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for the Full Year of 2022 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCARTCS1  and UCART20x22  andOperating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  U.S.A); andContinuing strengthening our manufacturing and clinical departments.CELLECTIS S.A.(unaudited)STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION($ in thousands  except per share data)As of December 31  2021 June 30  2022 ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 1 854 1 584 Property  plant  and equipment 78 846 73 953 Right-of-use assets 69 423 61 086 Non-current financial assets 6 524 9 093 Total non-current assets 156 647 145 716 Current assets Trade receivables 20 361 2 602 Subsidies receivables 9 268 11 244 Other current assets 9 665 7 694 Cash and cash equivalent and Current financial assets 186 135 153 626 Total current assets 225 429 175 167 TOTAL ASSETS 382 076 320 883 LIABILITIES Shareholders’ equity Share capital 2 945 2 946 Premiums related to the share capital 934 696 567 284 Currency translation adjustment (18 021 ) (29 626 ) Retained earnings (584 129 ) (320 812 ) Net income (loss) (114 197 ) (50 858 ) Total shareholders’ equity -

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME – Second Quarter(unaudited)($ in thousands  except per share data)For the three-month period ended June 30  2021 2022 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (39 919 ) (18 947 ) Adjustment:Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 3 635 2 684 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (36 284 ) (16 264 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0 80 ) (0 36 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) (1) 45 461 310 45 507 921 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0 80 ) (0 36 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) (1) 45 461 310 45 507 921When we have adjusted net loss  in accordance with IFRS  we use the Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic to compute the Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share).

We are well positioned as we look to the future.”Highlights for the Three Months Ended June 30  2022Reported net income allocable to common shareholders of $3.42 per diluted share.Reported core FFO allocable to common shareholders (“Core FFO”) of $3.99 per diluted share  an increase of 26.7% relative to the same period in 2021.Increased Same Store (as defined below) direct net operating income by 17.8%  resulting from a 15.9% increase in Same Store revenues.Achieved 80.6% Same Store direct net operating income margin  an increase of 1.6% relative to the same period in 2021.Acquired ten self-storage facilities with 0.7 million net rentable square feet for $123.6 million. Subsequent to June 30  2022  we acquired or were under contract to acquire 24 self-storage facilities with 1.7 million net rentable square feet  for $257.4 million.Completed various expansion projects with 0.3 million net rentable square feet costing $36.9 million. At June 30  2022  we had various facilities in development and expansion with 5.4 million net rentable square feet estimated to cost $1.0 billion.Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30  2022For the three months ended June 30  2022  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $603.4 million or $3.42 per diluted common share  compared to $346.2 million or $1.97 per diluted common share in 2021  representing an increase of $257.2 million or $1.45 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $160.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income  (ii) a $114.4 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable  (iii) a $21.1 million increase in our equity share of gains on sale of real estate recorded by our unconsolidated real estate entities  and (iv) a $17.0 million decrease in allocations to preferred shareholders with respect to redemption of preferred shares  partially offset by (v) a $46.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and (vi) a $10.9 million increase in interest expense.The $160.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended June 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $95.7 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $65.2 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 15.9% or $108.4 million in the three months ended June 30  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per available square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 7.6% or $12.7 million in the three months ended June 30  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to increased property tax expense  on-site property manager payroll expense  marketing expense  other direct property costs  and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $65.2 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Operating Results for the Six Months Ended June 30  2022For the six months ended June 30  2022  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1 067.5 million or $6.05 per diluted common share  compared to $732.1 million or $4.18 per diluted common share in 2021  representing an increase of $335.4 million or $1.87 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $328.2 million increase in self-storage net operating income  (ii) a $104.4 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable  (iii) a $44.7 million increase in our equity share of gains on sale of real estate recorded by our unconsolidated real estate entities  and (iv) a $17.0 million decrease in allocations to preferred shareholders with respect to redemption of preferred shares  partially offset by (v) a $121.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and (vi) a $28.8 million increase in interest expense.The $328.2 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the six months ended June 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $191.3 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $136.9 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 15.9% or $210.5 million in the six months ended June 30  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per available square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 5.5% or $19.2 million in the six months ended June 30  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to increased property tax expense  on-site property manager payroll expense  other direct property costs  and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $136.9 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Funds from OperationsFor the three months ended June 30  2022  funds from operations (“FFO”) was $4.58 per diluted common share as compared to $2.99 in the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 53.2%. FFO is a non-GAAP measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and generally represents net income before depreciation and amortization expense  gains and losses and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets. A reconciliation of GAAP diluted net income per share to FFO per share  and additional descriptive information regarding this non-GAAP measure  is attached.For the six months ended June 30  2022  FFO was $8.41 per diluted common share  as compared to $6.07 in the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 38.6%.We also present “Core FFO” and “Core FFO per share ” non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing  with respect to the periods presented below  unrealized gain on private equity investments and our equity share of merger transaction costs  severance of a senior executive  and casualties from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance  and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However  Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such measures  Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.The following table reconciles FFO per share to Core FFO per share and FFO to Core FFO  respectively (unaudited):Three Months Ended June 30  Six Months Ended June 30  2022 2021 Percentage Change 2022 2021 Percentage Change (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Reconciliation of FFO per Share to Core FFO per Share: FFO per share $ 4.58 $ 2.99 53.2 % $ 8.41 $ 6.07 38.6 % Eliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO  including our equity share from investments: Foreign currency exchange (gain) loss (0.58 ) 0.07 (0.78 ) (0.19 ) Preferred share redemption charge — 0.10 — 0.10 Other items (0.01 ) (0.01 ) 0.01 (0.01 ) Core FFO per share $ 3.99 $ 3.15 26.7 % $ 7.64 $ 5.97 28.0 % Reconciliation of FFO to Core FFO: FFO allocable to common shares $ 807 481 $ 525 009 53.8 % $ 1 483 685 $ 1 064 263 39.4 % Eliminate the impact of items excluded from Core FFO  including our equity share from investments: Foreign currency exchange (gain) loss (101 723 ) 12 707 (137 100 ) (32 678 ) Preferred share redemption charge — 16 989 — 16 989 Other items (1 781 ) (2 194 ) 766 (2 543 ) Core FFO allocable to common shares $ 703 977 $ 552 511 27.4 % $ 1 347 351 $ 1 046 031 28.8 % Diluted weighted average common shares 176 312 175 547 176 325 175 194 Core FFO per share $ 3.99 $ 3.15 26.7 % $ 7.64 $ 5.97 28.0 %Property Operations – Same Store FacilitiesThe Same Store Facilities consist of facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy  revenues  and cost of operations since January 1  2020. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2020  2021  and 2022 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities  which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However  because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such a measure  Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2 282 facilities (149.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 75% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at June 30  2022 (unaudited):Three Months Ended June 30  Six Months Ended June 30  2022 2021 Percentage Change 2022 2021 Percentage Change (Dollar amounts in thousands  except for per square foot data) Revenues (a): Rental income $ 765 081 $ 661 345 15.7 % $ 1 490 514 $ 1 288 497 15.7 % Late charges and administrative fees 23 857 19 197 24.3 % 47 694 39 245 21.5 % Total revenues 788 938 680 542 15.9 % 1 538 208 1 327 742 15.9 % Direct cost of operations (a): Property taxes 71 227 67 484 5.5 % 141 231 134 266 5.2 % On-site property manager payroll 29 531 25 650 15.1 % 60 231 54 394 10.7 % Repairs and maintenance 13 255 13 107 1.1 % 28 745 26 128 10.0 % Utilities 10 143 9 379 8.1 % 21 589 20 175 7.0 % Marketing 8 648 6 863 26.0 % 19 888 21 473 (7.4 )% Other direct property costs 20 253 18 311 10.6 % 40 319 36 675 9.9 % Total direct cost of operations 153 057 140 794 8.7 % 312 003 293 111 6.4 % Direct net operating income (b) 635 881 539 748 17.8 % 1 226 205 1 034 631 18.5 % Indirect cost of operations (a): Supervisory payroll (8 739 ) (9 214 ) (5.2 )% (18 306 ) (19 544 ) (6.3 )% Centralized management costs (14 767 ) (13 091 ) 12.8 % (30 324 ) (26 328 ) 15.2 % Share-based compensation (3 768 ) (4 554 ) (17.3 )% (7 627 ) (10 089 ) (24.4 )% Net operating income (c) $ 608 607 $ 512 889 18.7 % $ 1 169 948 $ 978 670 19.5 % Gross margin (before indirect costs  depreciation and amortization expense) 80.6% 79.3% 1.6 % 79.7% 77.9% 2.3 % Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense) 77.1% 75.4% 2.3 % 76.1% 73.7% 3.3 % Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy 95.8% 97.0% (1.2 )% 95.7% 96.3% (0.6 )% Realized annual rental income per (d): Occupied square foot $ 21.37 $ 18.23 17.2 % $ 20.83 $ 17.89 16.4 % Available square foot $ 20.47 $ 17.69 15.7 % $ 19.94 $ 17.23 15.7 % At June 30: Square foot occupancy 94.8% 96.5% (1.8 )% Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (e) $ 21.92 $ 18.67 17.4 %(a) Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales and expenses generated at the facilities. (b) Direct net operating income (“Direct NOI”)  a subtotal within NOI  is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll  centralized management costs  and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors. (c) See attached reconciliation of self-storage NOI to net income. (d) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency  and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition  the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts  which reduce rental income. (e) Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in  and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis  such as late charges and administrative fees  does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts  and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.Property Operations – Non-Same Store FacilitiesIn addition to the 2 282 Same Store Facilities  we have 525 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies  revenues  or cost of operations since January 1  2020 or that we did not own as of January 1  2020  including 314 facilities that were acquired  54 newly developed facilities  91 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion  and 66 facilities that are unstabilized because they are under fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively  the “Non-Same Store Facilities”). Operating data  metrics  and further commentary with respect to these facilities  including detail by vintage  are included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under “Analysis of Net Income – Self-Storage Operations” in our June 30  2022 Form 10-Q.Investing and Capital ActivitiesDuring the three months ended June 30  2022  we acquired ten self-storage facilities (two each in North Carolina and Texas  and one each in Colorado  Florida  Georgia  Maryland  Oregon  and Tennessee) with 0.7 million net rentable square feet for $123.6 million. During the six months ended June 30  2022  we acquired 20 self-storage facilities (five in Texas  three in North Carolina  two in Maryland  and one each in Arizona  Colorado  Florida  Georgia  Indiana  Minnesota  Nevada  Oregon  Pennsylvania  and Tennessee) with 1.5 million net rentable square feet for $251.3 million.Subsequent to June 30  2022  we acquired or were under contract to acquire 24 self-storage facilities across ten states with 1.7 million net rentable square feet  for $257.4 million. Additionally  on July 8  2022  we acquired the commercial interests of PS Business Parks  Inc. (“PSB”) at three sites  totaling five properties  jointly occupied with our self-storage facilities located in Maryland and Virginia  for $47 million.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of ezStorage for $1.8 billion  which includes 47 self-storage facilities and a property that was under construction. These facilities generated revenues of $48.7 million  NOI of $38.3 million (including Direct NOI of $39.7 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 89.7% for the six months ended June 30  2022.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of All Storage for $1.5 billion  with 55 properties closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and one property closed in February 2022. These facilities generated revenues of $35.2 million  NOI of $21.4 million (including Direct NOI of $22.8 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 78.4% for the six months ended June 30  2022.During the three months ended June 30  2022  we completed various expansion projects (0.3 million net rentable square feet – 0.2 million in Minnesota and 0.1 million in Florida) costing $36.9 million. During six months ended June 30  2022  we completed various expansion projects (0.4 million net rentable square feet – 0.2 million in Minnesota  0.1 million in Florida and 0.1 million in other states) costing $56.3 million. At June 30  2022  we had various facilities in development (2.6 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $480.3 million and various expansion projects (2.8 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $547.0 million. Our aggregate 5.4 million net rentable square foot pipeline of development and expansion facilities includes 1.6 million in California  0.7 million in Texas  0.6 million in Florida  0.5 million in Maryland  0.3 million Washington  0.2 million each in Hawaii  Michigan  Nevada  New Jersey  and New York  and 0.7 million in other states. The remaining $647.3 million of development costs for these projects is expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months.On April 24  2022  PSB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate (""Blackstone"") agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of PSB's common stock for $187.50 per share in cash. On July 20  2022  PSB announced that it completed the merger transaction with Blackstone. Each share of PSB common stock and each common unit of partnership interest we held in PSB were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $187.50 per share or unit and a $0.22 prorated quarterly cash dividend per share or unit  for a total of $187.72 per share or unit. At the close of the merger transaction  we received a total of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and recognized a $2.1 billion gain on the sale of our equity investment in PSB in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the third quarter of 2022.In connection with the sale of our equity investment in PSB  on July 22  2022  our Board of Trustees declared a special cash dividend of $13.15 per common share. The special dividend is payable on August 4  2022 to shareholders of record as of August 1  2022.On July 26  2022  the Company called for redemption on August 15  2022 its 2.370% Senior Notes  with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $500.0 million  due September 15  2022.Distributions DeclaredOn August 3  2022  our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $2.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on September 29  2022 to shareholders of record as of September 14  2022.Outlook for the Year Ending December 31  2022The following table outlines the Company’s Core FFO per share estimate and certain underlying assumptions for the year ending December 31  2022  including estimates for the impact of the sale of our investment in PSB to Blackstone on July 20  2022:Guidance Ranges for 2022 Low High (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Same Store: Revenue growth 12.00% 15.00% Expense growth 6.00% 8.00% Net operating income growth 13.40% 18.00% Acquisitions $1 000 000 Development openings $250 000 Non-Same Store net operating income $480 000 $500 000 Ancillary net operating income $155 000 $160 000 General and administrative expense $105 000 $111 000 Interest expense $133 000 Preferred dividends $195 000 Capital expenditures $300 000 Core FFO per share (before the impact of the sale of PSB) $15.22 $15.92 Impact of the sale of PSB (0.22) (0.22) Core FFO per share $15.00 $15.70 Incremental Non-Same Store NOI to stabilization (2023 and beyond) $172 000Forward-looking Core FFO per share measures exclude estimates for the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other significant non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items such as loss contingency accruals  casualties  transactional due diligence  and advisory costs. Public Storage is unable to provide a reconciliation of Core FFO per share guidance measures to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future U.S. GAAP results.Second Quarter Conference CallA conference call is scheduled for August 5  2022 at 9:00 a.m. (PDT) to discuss the second quarter earnings results.

National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and  along with the non-GAAP measure FAD  are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. FFO represents GAAP net income before depreciation and amortization  real estate gains or losses and impairment charges  which are excluded because they are based upon historical costs and assume that building values diminish ratably over time  while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FAD represents FFO adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges and to deduct capital expenditures.

Good morning  everyone and thank you for joining us today.I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.32. The 14% increase year-over-year  marking the best second quarter in our company's history  and is on top of 12% growth in the second quarter of 2021. Net revenues totaled $1.8 billion  an increase of 8% versus last year  driven by a balanced contribution from both our diversified transaction revenues and our recurring revenues  which account for over half of our business and increased by 8% versus last year.Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million and were at the low end of our guidance range versus the midpoint of our guide  second quarter expenses benefited from favorable FX  various expense efficiencies and lower variable costs  particularly customer acquisition costs and our listings business.Moving to the full year  we're lowering our expense guidance to a range of $2.97 billion to $2.99 billion midpoint to midpoint this represents a reduction of $35 million versus our prior guidance and similar to our second quarter results is driven by expense efficiencies  lower variable costs and favorable FX.Second quarter adjusted operating income increased by 14% to $1.1 billion their adjusted operating margin expanding to 59%.Moving to the balance sheet  shortly after we reported our first quarter results in May  we took the opportunity to raise $8 billion in new SR notes. We used 3 billion of these proceeds to refinance our 2022 and 2023 maturities and along with the proceeds from our sale of Euroclear reduced our commercial paper balances to zero with no maturities until the middle of 2025  we enter the second half of the balance sheet that is well positioned and it's an exceptionally volatile interest rate environment.The remaining $5 billion of proceeds raised in May  is earmarked to fund a portion of our announced acquisition of Black Knight based on a favorable rates that we've secured on these long-term notes  and the current forward rate expectations for both our commercial paper and term loan  we anticipate we will be well within our targeted 4% to 4.5% cost of debt financing for the transaction. It is also worth noting that alongside the financing in May  we maintained our A minus and A3 pre-acquisition ratings from both S&P and Moody's.Now let's move to Slide five  to provide an overview of the performance of our exchange segment. Second quarter exchange net revenues totaling $1 billion  an increase of 13% year-over-year  this strong performance was driven by an 80% increase in our interest rate futures  and that's 36% increase in our equity derivatives revenues. Importantly  total open interest  which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth  and in July up 11% versus the end of last year  including 6% growth in energy and 21% growth across our financial futures and options complex.Second quarter cash equities and equity options revenue increased by 17% year-over-year  and in July  we successfully migrated the NYCE Arca Options platform to our new pillar technology  while continuing to seamlessly process record message volume  a testament to our team's hard work and our broader technology expertise.Exchange recurring revenues increased by 7% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand in our energy exchange data continued benefit from our record 2021 listings performance and a one-time accrual in our listings business that we do not expect will reoccur in the second half.Turning now to Slide six. In our fixed income and data services segment  second quarter revenue totaled a record $512 million a 13% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 78%  including 85% growth in ICE bonds  and 76% growth in our CDS clearing business. This strong growth was driven in part by customers re-engaging and allocating more capital to CDS trading  as well as our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity through our bond platforms  where we're seeing market share gains and our municipal bond business.Recurring revenue growth  which accounted for over 80% of segment revenues grew 5% in the quarter and was once again driven by strength in our consolidated fees business as well as continued growth in the ICE global network.Looking to the second half  we expect year-over-year growth in our recurring revenues to continue supported by an ASD that interest in the third quarter up over 5% year-over-year. And in that second half as reported recurring revenues  we flat to slightly up versus our first half results driven by your Euronext data center migration which was included in our original guidance and $10 million of additional FX headwinds.Shifting to mortgage technology on Slide seven. Second quarter revenues totaled $297 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for over half of the segment revenues and totaled $160 million in the quarter increased 18% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes. While the current macroeconomic backdrop is challenging for a number of our customers is also presented an opportunity to have more constructive conversations around efficiency and automation across the mortgage origination workflow.It's worth noting that second quarter unit origination volumes were similar to those in the second quarter of 2019. However  second quarter 2022 revenues in our mortgage technology business were over $100 million greater or up almost 60% when compared to pro forma revenues in 2Q ‘19. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth and customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow.I'll conclude on Slide eight. To the first half of the year  we've grown total ICE revenue by 7% adjusted operating income by 11%  including 200 basis points of margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share by 12%  representing the best first half in our history. In addition  we've positioned our balance sheet for the acquisition of Black Knight while also growing our dividend and continuing to invest in future growth. As we look to the balance of the year  we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us  and we remain focused on creating value for our stockholders.With that  I'll hand it over to Ben.Ben JacksonThank you  Warren. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide nine.Rising inflation has created an interest rate environment  many of our customers have not navigated in over a decade. Meanwhile  the continued war in Ukraine has triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain  creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants. Importantly  we remain focused on connecting customers to our leading technology  mission critical data  and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions.In our interest rate markets  we've seen record year-to-date volumes in our your [indiscernible] contract as customers increasingly seek to manage risks associated with rising rates and central bank activity across Europe and the U.K. This heightened risk has also contributed to strength in our equity derivatives complex  driving an 18% increase in volumes year-to-date.Across our global energy markets  customers are navigating supply uncertainty alongside longer term Clean Energy Transition priorities. This will continue to introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets  which should drive greater demand for risk management. And it is our diverse global energy markets that provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools customers need to navigate both the near-term and long-term complexities.Globalization of gas and the clean energy transition are trends that have contributed to the 43% average annual volume growth in our TTF gas business over the past five years  driving TTF to emerge as a global gas benchmark.Through the first half of this year  as a result of the Russia Ukraine conflict  global gas markets have tightened significantly  increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas in an uncertain geopolitical environment. This volatility and uncertainty has driven our global gas volumes increased 31% year-to-date  including 49% growth in our North American gas business in the second quarter. Commercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk  as evidenced by the record share in open interest we've achieved in our Henry Hub contract  surpassing 50% for the first time ever. Because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America  Europe and Asia  we are well positioned to benefit from both the near- term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets.Despite these global energy concerns  governments  corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such  valuing externalities such as placing a price on pollution  carbon free electricity  and carbon sequestration and storage will continue to increase in importance. ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle  including renewable fuel contracts  carbon allowances  nature-based solutions  and renewable energy certificates.The breadth of our complex  coupled with the growing importance of carbon price transparency  has contributed to the 19% average annual volume growth in our environmental complex over the past five years.As the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities  uncertainties and volatility to energy markets  our global environmental alongside our gas and oil complexes will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks.Turning now to our mortgage business. I first want to touch on our pending acquisition of Black Knight as announced on May 4 of this year. As we said  when we made our announcement back then we continued to believe the transaction will close during the first half of 2023. Since the announcement  and in accordance with our initial expected timeline  we have submitted the necessary regulatory filings. We are working with the FTC as they perform their thoughtful and comprehensive reviews of the proposed transaction.Out of respect for the FTC is important work on this matter as we work with them toward regulatory approval  we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly  we remain very excited about the efficiencies that combined entities will bring to the end consumer and other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem.As interest rates rise  and mortgage origination volumes soften from recent record levels  our customers continue to turn to our mission critical technology to operate more efficiently. In the second quarter  we once again grew recurring revenues and outperformed the broader industry.Our focus during these evolving market conditions is first and foremost  our customer. Customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation and we continued to work with our customers to find the most efficient ways they can benefit from the breadth of offerings across our network.For example  we recently made the decision to offer interested customers our base eCO solution included in an Encompass subscription  making it easier and cheaper for customers to adopt and benefit from the efficiencies from an electronic closing.To focus on efficiencies has also led to increased interest in our data and analytics products  leveraging machine learning technology  our analytics platform automates the steps in the loan manufacturing process  and can save lenders 1000s of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity.Year-to-date  our data analytics business  which is made up largely of recurring revenues  has grown 21% year-over-year  we continue to see increased adoption of our analytics and new customers coming onto the platform  with a host of new clients added this year alone represented the likes of Chase  a number of leading independent mortgage bankers  and a top three home builder.We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders  and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff SprecherThank you  Ben. Good morning  everyone. And thank you for joining us.Please turn to Slide 10. The first half of the year has been marked by rising inflation  rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers are navigating evolving risks and continued to rely on our data  technology and liquid markets to manage these risks.In the second quarter  we once again grew revenues  grew adjusted operating income  and grew adjusted earnings per share these record setting second quarter results reflect the strength of our network and the all weather nature of our business model.Our strategy has always been to find unique and novel ways to apply data and technology to bring efficiencies and transparency to markets whether it was moving energy trading to the screen  clearing OTC swaps  modernizing the technology powering the U.S. equity markets  or building datasets for the opaque fixed income markets. As we've grown and diversified  we've broadened our opportunity set and our expertise has grown  providing new markets to grow into  and importantly  new ways to provide innovative solutions to customers.We've leveraged our leading pricing and reference data to build new tools for the front office. We've married our fixed income data to newly expanded climate capabilities. And more recently  we've combined our expertise in futures contract construction  with our index capabilities  and with our unique mortgage data to launch both the ICE mortgage rate lock index and its associated futures contract. These are just a few examples of the innovation that we can deliver with our expanded technology  datasets and expertise.Our evolution has been intentional  diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues with the goal of building a business that today generates compounding earnings growth. It's how we've grown our adjusted earnings per share for the past 15 years in every year that we've been a public company. The net result of our compounding earnings growth is the compounding growth in our dividend  which we've grown double digits each year on average since we initiated it in 2013 and which we also grew 15% in this quarter.Looking now to the second half of the year and beyond  we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us. And we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers while driving compounding growth for our stockholders.I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and their trust and I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter  following on the heels of our best first quarter  making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company.With that  I'll now turn the call back to our moderator Victoria  and will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. We will now start our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Rich Repetto at Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Rich RepettoGood morning  Jeff and Ben and Warren. It's unfortunate  we can't get any comments on the Black Knight acquisition  because that's certainly on everybody's mind. But anyway  I'll ask about fixed income. Ben  you saw probably a nice uptick in fixed income execution  I think it's up 85% up 10 million  just quarter-over-quarter. And I would suspect that's just the retail  your retail complex [muni] [ph] picking up? And then one other question related to fixed income  the recurring revenues went down quarter-to-quarter just by a million  I suspect that's currency  but just wanted to get some clarification there as well.Jeff SprecherHi  Rich. I'm going to hand it over to Lynn to go through this.Lynn MartinHi  Rich. Thanks for the question. You're right that we saw strong growth in our fixed income trading business this quarter. And as mentioned in our prepared remarks that was driven off of strengthened our muni trading business. And while volatility and the return of retail has certainly been a contributor  we're seeing our institutional efforts pay off. As you are aware over the last two years  we really focused on leveraging our market leading assets in the muni ecosystem  including our data assets and our index business  which now serves as the benchmark for more than 60% of the AUM in this area to build out the infrastructure to connect the institutional market to our muni execution platforms. And in this quarter alone  we're seeing the benefits of that work manifest itself. And that institutional share within our muni execution platforms has doubled since 2020  enabling us to take share in the broader muni market. And finally  it's worth noting that our institutional business in munis has grown 250%  year-over-year  a further sign that we're gaining share in this asset class.Warren GardinerAnd then  Rich  its Warren on your question on the recurring revenues. You're right. That's FX  largely FX  there's also a little bit of AUM related revenue in our ETF business. So as we saw during the quarter people shifting into treasuries and out of equities  and some of the credit focused ETFs. There's lower economics on those treasury ETFs that we bent that track our benchmarks and so that was a little bit of a mix shift impact for us as well within the AUM portion of the index. The rest of the index business did really well during the quarter up double digits. Again  some of the subscription revenue  pure subscription revenue  if you will  in there. So really just kind of the macro dynamics taking hold there that why you saw that slight sequential decline.Rich RepettoGot it. Thanks for the update.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm at UBS. Please go ahead.Alex KrammYes. Hey  good morning. Lots of info you gave already on the mortgage side. But we'd like to dig a little bit deeper in particular on the recurring side. So few questions here. One I don't know if you gave an update to the recurring revenue guide for that segment that would be interested if that's still unchanged  but then more importantly  I think you mentioned that even like some of the challenges in the end markets you are seeing some bankruptcies  et cetera. So maybe you could give us an update what you're seeing in terms of customer losses  and maybe remind us how the revenue model is if there's any receipts  et cetera.And then  sorry  lastly  maybe give us a little bit of the algorithm of growth that you've seen so far in the recurring revenues year-to-date between customer losses  but then also some of the upsells that you guys were talking about earlier. And then  also this continued shift to moving the contract terms to more recurring  so I know that's a mouthful  but hopefully I get out of it.Ben JacksonYes  that's a lot Alex. This is Ben. I'll start and Warren will also I'm sure add in here. So in terms of  I'll start with this  just the overall challenges in the environment. If you take a step back  and you look at what we're building  we're building a business here that in mortgage whether a number of different market environments with an eye towards an 8% to 10% growth over the long-haul. And why are we confident in our ability to do that is the reasons are one we have absolutely mission critical software for these clients that we're providing. We have long-term contracts with our clients  four to five years of the high amount of retention in them. And we are heavily focused  as you've seen in our results  on shifting the revenue to more and more towards recurring. And we did it again this quarter  on the backdrop of 40% down market in terms of volumes  with 18% year-over-year recurring revenue growth in the business.The other Proofpoint  you've seen in terms of being able to weather various market environments is our data analytics line item. With that being up 36% last quarter alone. And one of the key inputs and drivers to that is our AIQ and analyzer solutions  we're seeing tremendous uptake in that we're seeing clients now more than ever just looking to adopt automation to automate as much of the workflow as possible to lower their costs.And the other proof point I put out  there was a comment Warren made in his prepared remarks  in that if you look at Q2 of 2019  very similar volume environment to what we saw in this past quarter  we generated more than $100 million of revenue on a pro forma basis. And that's  what enables us to do as we do time studies  with our clients  and clients that adopt our full automation suite  we see are saving anywhere from 570 to $1 400 per loan that they're manufacturing when they adopt our solutions. So our ability to capture some benefit from that from the efficiencies that we're providing to the industry has been tremendous.In terms of the algorithm of growth  on recurring revenue  it's really -- it's a mix that we've described before  it's a mix of  there is some pricing in there  there is sales to new clients. So I mentioned  we had a good start of the year for sales on Encompass. We've had a good sales for the year on our AIQ business. And then also the other input is that shift as customers are renewing that shift of -- even if we have to forego some transaction revenue of moving more to subscription  we're continuing to do that  and have a lot of success. And we're still early days  we're really in the first year of a codified program to do that. And with contracts with clients going four to five years in the future we have a long runway to go.Warren GardinerAlex  this is Warren  you asked about the guidance. So yes  you're correct. There's no change to the guidance that we gave to start the year. We did assume  as we said back then that there will be some headwinds from people potentially going out of business or maybe not as many new market participants  I'll say I'm highly confident that to the extent that starts to play out  that's going to be a cyclical trend  not a secular one  because I think if you think about the process for and this is reiterating what Ben just said  we think about the rest of getting a mortgage  it continues to be very costly for the consumer  it's very inefficient. And we have the tools that are -- building the tools that are really solving those problems. And so I know that probably doesn't help  solve for 2022  EPS or 2023 EPS  but it should really factor into kind of the multiple people are thinking about when you're valuing the overall enterprise at the end of the day.Alex KrammSo you haven't seen a lot of impact from cancellations at this point  just to clarify.Ben JacksonHey  Alex. It's Ben again. So we have seen a small  small number of lenders that have had some challenges and potentially go out of business  but it's a very small number that we've seen so far.Alex KrammVery good. Thank you.OperatorPerfect. Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtHi  good morning. So last quarter  you spoke about energy traders moving away from using futures and towards options at least for oil specifically  just given the decline in oil futures open interest throughout 2Q it seemed like that trend may have continued. Just wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing from commodity trading firms right now trying to manage risk in an extremely volatile environment. Because I guess given the volatility  we've seen the market  it's a bit surprising to see energy volumes only up 3% in the second quarter and now seemingly kind of trending lower year-on-year into the third quarter. Thank you.Ben JacksonHey  Kyle  it's Ben. So you have a -- we have a confluence of issues that are going on around the world that are really unprecedented. And against that backdrop  we're pleased that our overall  our overall futures business is up for year-over-year in terms of open interest and since the end of the year  and our energy businesses up in open interest since the end of the year  given all of these events. And what are we looking at  we're looking at an inflationary environment  we're looking at a recession  you've got in particular in Europe  governments in Europe  have to figure out the balance between sanctions against Russia  the impact of those sanctions against their civilians  in terms of near-term price impact on energy  and move towards cleaner energy.So you've got this pothole mix and then you also have in China continued COVID lockdowns that are happening  and obviously geopolitical tensions happening with China.So given all those issues  we believe that our marketplace has been set up as best as can be in the in the world to help clients navigate through all of these events  and they're utilizing us to do that. And I'll give a few examples. So first  we have one of the most deep and liquid markets across that energy spectrum. So think of oil  gas  LNG  power and environmentals. So as clients are looking to move and switch between fuels  looking towards  moving towards a cleaner environment  we are the exchange and clearing businesses that they're going to do that.Second  in managing global supply shocks  you have deep -- we have deep liquid global markets in each of those respective asset classes that I mentioned with oil  gas  LNG  power  and environmentals and enable customers because we have all these deep liquid points at the points of production and consumption  as clients need to hedge their risks using different risk management tools. We're very well positioned to do that. And a perfect example is right now with Russia  stifling gas supplies going into Europe  we are seeing U.S. step in and U.S. providing natural gas via LNG cargos going into Northern Europe.And given that we are the home to the vast majority of commercial traders  that trade our U.S. gas products  both Henry Hub and our bases markets  we're seeing clients use that to hedge those cargos. And it's one of the inputs that's led to what I mentioned in my prepared remarks of the record we've seen in market share from a Henry Hub perspective  as well as a North American gas and at a highest well in the global gas complex.The third thing I'd point out is that we're engaged as much as ever with clients and governments around the world around the sanctions and as they're taking shape. And there's no question it had some impact  as there was uncertainty as to how issues would play out in products like gas and oil  where Russian fuel oil is an input into that historically  as governments have made it clear that as of February of 23  Russian fuel oil will no longer be provided  it no longer be consumed in Europe  we've changed the specification on our gas oil contract. And now we started to see open interest in volume starting to build again in gas oil  calendar 23 and beyond.And then you pointed out  our deep liquid options market. So options is clearly one of the most efficient ways to hedge geopolitical tail risk because it helps to hedge a number of different scenarios that could play out and embrace our volume in open or volume in Brent options  year-over-year is up 25%. So when you look at me stand your lens and look at the overall energy complex. We feel really good about how we're positioned.Kyle VoigtThank you so much.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Craig SiegenthalerHey  good morning  everyone. So my question is on mortgage tech origination revenues were down not that surprising. But you help us with some perspective on incremental downside from current levels. And also  in terms of timing  when should we think these revenues will stabilize? And any perspective on that relative to what rates are doing would be helpful too?Ben JacksonHey  Craig  it's Ben  I'll start. So basically reiterate some of the things that I said before  when you widen out what our strategy is  within the mortgage and mortgage technology business  our strategy here has been to move more and more of the revenue towards recurring to take some of that cyclicality out of the business and we continue to do that. And we've been successfully doing that.In terms of predicting the rate environment and how that's going to play out just look at how the rate environments played out over the last week  it's been extraordinarily hard for to see and be able to predict when that this volume environment and stuff will settle down. But despite that  we're going to continue to make investments in the innovation that we're providing to our clients. As we mentioned  a lot of the investments that we made is what fueled that $100 million growth that we saw over the last three years in a similar environment to what we had in 2019. Those are investments -- those investments are in and around everything that we've been doing in the closing side  our simple file business continues to gain market share and do very well. And then all of the innovation that we've been introducing on the data and analytics side with our AIQ platform  as well as the automation of the underwrite platform  we see that those are all tailwinds that regardless of the rate environment and the volume environment that our growth drivers for us.Jeff SprecherAnd this is Jeff  let me just mention that a lot of our mortgage strategy is driven by the fact that we're trying to really position the company to be an all weather named that in all interest rate and macroeconomic environments that I can continue to end my prepared remarks on the same page that shows a graph of compounding earnings growth  for shareholders. And having a U.S. mortgage strategy gives us exposure we own LIBOR  which is the London Interbank index we trade U.K. and EU interest rate futures. We have a credit default swap business that is completely global that includes Russian sovereign  hedging and companies across the globe.We have a fixed income business that is truly global  we provide pricing data in almost every single country that has bond issuance. And we were relatively thin on having exposure to U.S. interest rates  and moving into mortgage gives us that.I also think  when we step back and look at the mortgage complex  the U.S. mortgage complex  and the way we're building the business  is that there is a demographic of millennials  that is huge  that are underserved by homeownership. And there's been supply chain issues during COVID to meet housing. And we generally believe that that any house that gets built will be sold and that there will be a mortgage on it  and that the supply chain issues are getting better and that the underperformance of building is increasing.We also have seen from our limited ownership of having mortgage assets that cash out refinancings happen when the value of homes go up  and which is an inflationary input. And the one that I think a lot of people and maybe is at the root of your question focus on is the absolute interest rate  which leads to people refinancing in a declining interest rate market.Long story short is there are a number of inputs into the housing market. We want to have exposure to the U.S. interest rate environment. It's going to help plus built in all weather name. And even with a downturn in the number of U.S. mortgages  we've had the best second quarter in our company's history.Craig SiegenthalerGreat. Thanks for taking my question.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Brian BedellGreat. Thanks. Good morning  folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just a two-parter on the environmental initiatives. So maybe Ben  if you could just comment on within the energy complex  obviously  we're seeing very good strength in that gas. We did see a couple quarters now sequential declines in the environmental so the question there is  our customers substituting that gas for some of the environmental versus something else driving on the environmental side short-term? And then  the second part of the question is  if you could comment on this  maybe Lynn  but on the acquisition of Urgentem and the overall climate data strategy  whether you're seeking to get more to grow substantially in that business linking that into the data more heavily into the environmental trading side?Ben JacksonGot it. Thanks  Brian. Yes  I'll start and then I’ll hand it to Lynn for the second part of that. So as I mentioned before  there's this confluences issues going on  in particular in Europe and where we have seen some impacts  so the balance between Russia and sanctions and the impact on the civilians and the move to cleaner energy. In Europe in specifically  we have seen some time and attention from traders that would trade things like our EUA markets  our European Union Allowances  moving and shifting more towards just the acute energy issues that everyone's faced with right now. So we have seen some headwinds in that part.But the flip side of it is in North America  we've had a very strong business continuing to do very  very well. North America is doing well and our Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiatives  our California Carbon Allowances  our renewable fuels  our REC markets  each of these are doing very  very well and we're continuing to invest. So we recently launched Biofuel Contracts they're doing well  we recently launched a global index  a Global Carbon Index Future  as well and we're getting more and more on the index itself we're getting more ETS to license and on futures are starting to develop there. We recently launched Texas Wind and Solar contracts  we recently launched nature-based offset contracts for the voluntary markets.So we see a lot of tailwinds coming in the foreseeable future  and you also have other developments like State of Pennsylvania likely to join Reggie [ph] and Washington State likely to put in their Cap and Trade Program for the first time. So we have a lot of good tailwinds there in North America. And I think what you're seeing in the overall complex is just a wait little bit on the EUA market in Europe.Lynn MartinAnd thanks  Brian  for the follow-up question. So given the strength in our fixed income data  we're uniquely positioned to add transparency around ESG  really focused on the climate risk. Given our ability to tie alternative datasets into datasets that the market knows you've seen us further position this offering. In Q4  we announced the acquisition of risQ and Level 11  which enabled us to execute on the opportunity to turn physical climate data into actionable insights starting with our muni bond service  but more recently expanding into the mortgage-backed securities market. And now we have the ability to offer a parcel level information measured by geographic coordinates in the U.S.  and we plan to expand that globally.And then  finally  as you know we recently announced the purchase of our Gen10  which really expands our climate risk offering to include corporate transition risk  given its coverage of 30 000 public and private companies  which was an attractive dataset to us to add to the climate offering.Brian BedellThat's great color. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Michael CyprysGreat  thanks so much. Wanted to ask about the commodities franchise  just curious how you guys are thinking about the longer-term growth drivers there  what factors ultimately drive volumes higher in your commodities franchise  is it production of the underlying commodities  for example  some more oil and gas rigs  producing more oil and gas are going to drive volumes higher over the long-term? Just curious how you think about those growth drivers and the algorithm and how is that evolving? Thank you.Ben JacksonThanks  Michael. This is Ben. And the way we think about it is  we need to have as I described earlier  that breadth of offerings of global offerings across the each of the inputs into producing energy is  as the statistics that are out there point to energy consumption doubling between now and 2050. And it's just what are the inputs into the production of that energy are going to change and will change over-time. And we believe with the breadth of offerings that we have across oil  gas  LNG  power and then the significant early start that we had and thinking about the environmental markets with the acquisition of the Climate Exchange over a decade ago  we're very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So that's one input into it.You do have a global focus on the reduction of carbon emissions around the world and as I said before  with our environmental markets  we are very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So those are two. I think the third is that even though we have had some near-term headwinds in some of the products in Europe in particular the ones that have been at the center of this Ukraine  Russia situation we continue to see user growth. So we continue to see more and more users taking data subscriptions and coming onto the platform to get visibility into what's happening in those markets  how those markets correlate  or de-correlate at times to others around the world. So when we look at the underlying health of the market  looking at user growth  looking at open interest and looking at the global breadth of the offerings that we provide to our clients  those are all inputs into our growth outlook [ph].Michael CyprysGreat. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your question. Our final question is a follow-up from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.Rich RepettoYes. Thanks for taking the question. Just one last question on mortgage  and this I think is more for Jeff. In the prepared remarks  it was mentioned about efficiency and automation and how the downturn is maybe emphasizing that more in the mortgage segment. But I guess the question  Jeff is  I think people are really looking for the connection between mortgage and how that can automate overtime as you've done so in other markets. So the question is  how is it comparing given that mortgage has a longer workflow process  but what you are seeing so far in regards to the automation of the market longer term versus the other asset classes you've dealt with?Jeff SprecherSure  that's a great question Rich  because I'm a company founder  I get asked to speak to entrepreneurs from time-to-time and I always tell them  the best time to start a business is when there's a downturn and not that having us moved into this space  you wish a downturn on anybody  but it's very  very hard to get people in finance and I say this broadly  whether it's trading  clearing  data  acquisition it is very  very hard to get people in finance to change their behavior when they're making a lot of money and when things are going well.And the best time to get people to think about making a change is when their businesses are under pressure and Ben alluded to that a number of times in why our subscription revenues are doing well in the mortgage space.Broadly speaking again  I appreciate the question. I know you've followed our company for many years  and you see us putting data and analytic tools into the mortgage market. The mortgage market that we're talking a lot about is the cash market. You've seen us and I mentioned in my prepared remarks  launch our first derivative product against in a new index that we created. And so I think this space has a lot of inefficiencies throughout the entire  not just the manufacturing the mortgage  but the way mortgages are financed and traded and retreated in the secondary market  very poor data available due to the paper based nature of the contract  difficult to regulate for regulate regulators  regulators think that there may be biases in the market  but without the right data  it's very hard to know  it's very hard to correct for the participants in the market  very expensive for consumers  banks that spend a lot of money to court a consumer  tend to lose them when there's a refinancing or a change in that client's behavior.The market is not very thoughtful about keeping connectivity between those that lend and those that borrow and all of that I think is fertile ground for us and may go for decades  honestly as we build out the infrastructure. But at the core  we need a foundation of data and information that borrowers  that lenders and that regulators can all look at and use to make it easier.I think I may have mentioned to you even that  it's odd to me that you can buy a completely consumable good  you can buy toothpaste on an online platform and when you go to checkout it'll ask you if you want to buy now and pay later  knowing that an algorithm underwrote your credit against no collateral and yet  it takes almost two months for somebody to refinance a mortgage in a house that they live in  that has a foundation that's in the ground that has an address that you can see from space that is part of the Maslow's hierarchy of need of safety and security and will be abandoned by that person  the last thing they do. And yet we  an existing mortgage talking to their bank takes two months.It just something is wrong in those equations. And we could argue that by now pay later lending maybe too generous  but certainly 60 days to do work with an existing client than an existing home just feels too long. And that's  that is the challenge that I think we will tackle successfully and put the entire industry on a better footing.Rich RepettoGot it. Thank you. That's helpful.OperatorThank you for your question. We have received a follow up from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtThanks for taking my follow up. So a question on the OTC and other revenue line in the exchange segment was quite strong in the quarter. I just want to confirm that the increase that we saw there was really driven by collateral fees that ICE is clearing house or is there something else that was driving that? And can you remind us if those collateral fees are entirely fixed basis point fees  or if there is or will be any benefit from rate hikes we've seen in the U.S. and EU?Warren GardinerSo hey  Kyle  it's Warren. So in terms of the OTC and other yes  you're correct that the performance there has been collateral driven that's largely from net interest income or earning at ICE Future or ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Europe and so as collateral bounces move around and you've seen that over the course of this year. That's obviously going to benefit that particular line item.In terms of rates moving higher  we do have a benefit from that that's going to show up there more on -- will show up on the CDS clearing side because we do park some collateral funds there as a Fed. And so we do get a benefit as collateral moves up  but then also as Fed funds rates move up there and so that's part of the strong performance you've seen in CDS there. So  not in that OTC and other line but in the spirit of your question  yes  that there's a benefit from better rate hikes coming through over-time.Kyle VoigtUnderstood. Thanks.OperatorThank you for your question  Kyle. This concludes our Q&A session. And now I'd like to pass over to Chair CEO  Jeff Sprecher for any final remarks.Jeff SprecherThank you  Victoria. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me again thank my colleagues for delivering yet another record quarter and we very much appreciate and want to say thank you to our customers for putting your faith in us during the quarter. We'll look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to execute on these exciting growth opportunities that we mentioned on the call.

Flashbox™ is a unique high-performance  low power  cost-effective  high-available new generation of storage appliances based on Kalray's DPU technology. Powered by our Smart Storage Acceleration Card  Flashbox™ allows data center customers to disaggregate their Flash tier while maintaining the same performance of local NVMe  thereby optimizing both Flash performance and capacity across the compute tier of their data center.""A unique concept on the market today  Flashbox™ benefits from ultra-fast interfaces and low power consumption. It can deliver unprecedent performance figures using 12x 100 Gb/s network interface connections distributed across six K200-LP cards and is based on market standards such as Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK)  NVMe/TCP or RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCEv1/v2). Flashbox™ is a 2U array  with support for 24 U.2 NVMe SSDs. Flashbox™ JBOF (Just A Bunch of Flash) replaces x86 servers of traditional storage nodes with Kalray PCIe cards (K200-LP) which incorporate the Kalray DPU. The high-availability Flashbox™ has two Viking Enterprise Solutions fabric modules  each module has a PCIe switch network and supports three PCIe add-in card slots (half-height  half-length). Each Kalray DPU PCIe add-in card can run all the critical functions and data services required of a storage appliance. Flashbox™ can scale from two to six of the K200-LP PCIe add-in cards allowing the end customer to scale performance independently of capacity of the array. This unique solution is lower cost and significantly lower power from a traditional NVMe storage array.Additionally  users will be able to take advantage of current and future data services integrated into the solution software stack such as data reduction (compression or deduplication)  data availability (RAID or erasure encoding) or data security (encryption). This will further enhance critical business metrics by offloading these services from the data center compute tiers. Flashbox™ offers the ideal SDS (software defined storage) solution by abstracting and disaggregating the Flash tier from the compute tier.
