When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition  we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative to  GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures  since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures and additional non-GAAP information included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q  including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.Adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  adjusted operating margin  adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders  adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below  which are not reflective of our cash operations and core

Good morning  everyone and thank you for joining us today.I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.32. The 14% increase year-over-year  marking the best second quarter in our company's history  and is on top of 12% growth in the second quarter of 2021. Net revenues totaled $1.8 billion  an increase of 8% versus last year  driven by a balanced contribution from both our diversified transaction revenues and our recurring revenues  which account for over half of our business and increased by 8% versus last year.Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million and were at the low end of our guidance range versus the midpoint of our guide  second quarter expenses benefited from favorable FX  various expense efficiencies and lower variable costs  particularly customer acquisition costs and our listings business.Moving to the full year  we're lowering our expense guidance to a range of $2.97 billion to $2.99 billion midpoint to midpoint this represents a reduction of $35 million versus our prior guidance and similar to our second quarter results is driven by expense efficiencies  lower variable costs and favorable FX.Second quarter adjusted operating income increased by 14% to $1.1 billion their adjusted operating margin expanding to 59%.Moving to the balance sheet  shortly after we reported our first quarter results in May  we took the opportunity to raise $8 billion in new SR notes. We used 3 billion of these proceeds to refinance our 2022 and 2023 maturities and along with the proceeds from our sale of Euroclear reduced our commercial paper balances to zero with no maturities until the middle of 2025  we enter the second half of the balance sheet that is well positioned and it's an exceptionally volatile interest rate environment.The remaining $5 billion of proceeds raised in May  is earmarked to fund a portion of our announced acquisition of Black Knight based on a favorable rates that we've secured on these long-term notes  and the current forward rate expectations for both our commercial paper and term loan  we anticipate we will be well within our targeted 4% to 4.5% cost of debt financing for the transaction. It is also worth noting that alongside the financing in May  we maintained our A minus and A3 pre-acquisition ratings from both S&P and Moody's.Now let's move to Slide five  to provide an overview of the performance of our exchange segment. Second quarter exchange net revenues totaling $1 billion  an increase of 13% year-over-year  this strong performance was driven by an 80% increase in our interest rate futures  and that's 36% increase in our equity derivatives revenues. Importantly  total open interest  which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth  and in July up 11% versus the end of last year  including 6% growth in energy and 21% growth across our financial futures and options complex.Second quarter cash equities and equity options revenue increased by 17% year-over-year  and in July  we successfully migrated the NYCE Arca Options platform to our new pillar technology  while continuing to seamlessly process record message volume  a testament to our team's hard work and our broader technology expertise.Exchange recurring revenues increased by 7% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand in our energy exchange data continued benefit from our record 2021 listings performance and a one-time accrual in our listings business that we do not expect will reoccur in the second half.Turning now to Slide six. In our fixed income and data services segment  second quarter revenue totaled a record $512 million a 13% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 78%  including 85% growth in ICE bonds  and 76% growth in our CDS clearing business. This strong growth was driven in part by customers re-engaging and allocating more capital to CDS trading  as well as our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity through our bond platforms  where we're seeing market share gains and our municipal bond business.Recurring revenue growth  which accounted for over 80% of segment revenues grew 5% in the quarter and was once again driven by strength in our consolidated fees business as well as continued growth in the ICE global network.Looking to the second half  we expect year-over-year growth in our recurring revenues to continue supported by an ASD that interest in the third quarter up over 5% year-over-year. And in that second half as reported recurring revenues  we flat to slightly up versus our first half results driven by your Euronext data center migration which was included in our original guidance and $10 million of additional FX headwinds.Shifting to mortgage technology on Slide seven. Second quarter revenues totaled $297 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for over half of the segment revenues and totaled $160 million in the quarter increased 18% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes. While the current macroeconomic backdrop is challenging for a number of our customers is also presented an opportunity to have more constructive conversations around efficiency and automation across the mortgage origination workflow.It's worth noting that second quarter unit origination volumes were similar to those in the second quarter of 2019. However  second quarter 2022 revenues in our mortgage technology business were over $100 million greater or up almost 60% when compared to pro forma revenues in 2Q ‘19. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth and customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow.I'll conclude on Slide eight. To the first half of the year  we've grown total ICE revenue by 7% adjusted operating income by 11%  including 200 basis points of margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share by 12%  representing the best first half in our history. In addition  we've positioned our balance sheet for the acquisition of Black Knight while also growing our dividend and continuing to invest in future growth. As we look to the balance of the year  we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us  and we remain focused on creating value for our stockholders.With that  I'll hand it over to Ben.Ben JacksonThank you  Warren. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide nine.Rising inflation has created an interest rate environment  many of our customers have not navigated in over a decade. Meanwhile  the continued war in Ukraine has triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain  creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants. Importantly  we remain focused on connecting customers to our leading technology  mission critical data  and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions.In our interest rate markets  we've seen record year-to-date volumes in our your [indiscernible] contract as customers increasingly seek to manage risks associated with rising rates and central bank activity across Europe and the U.K. This heightened risk has also contributed to strength in our equity derivatives complex  driving an 18% increase in volumes year-to-date.Across our global energy markets  customers are navigating supply uncertainty alongside longer term Clean Energy Transition priorities. This will continue to introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets  which should drive greater demand for risk management. And it is our diverse global energy markets that provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools customers need to navigate both the near-term and long-term complexities.Globalization of gas and the clean energy transition are trends that have contributed to the 43% average annual volume growth in our TTF gas business over the past five years  driving TTF to emerge as a global gas benchmark.Through the first half of this year  as a result of the Russia Ukraine conflict  global gas markets have tightened significantly  increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas in an uncertain geopolitical environment. This volatility and uncertainty has driven our global gas volumes increased 31% year-to-date  including 49% growth in our North American gas business in the second quarter. Commercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk  as evidenced by the record share in open interest we've achieved in our Henry Hub contract  surpassing 50% for the first time ever. Because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America  Europe and Asia  we are well positioned to benefit from both the near- term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets.Despite these global energy concerns  governments  corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such  valuing externalities such as placing a price on pollution  carbon free electricity  and carbon sequestration and storage will continue to increase in importance. ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle  including renewable fuel contracts  carbon allowances  nature-based solutions  and renewable energy certificates.The breadth of our complex  coupled with the growing importance of carbon price transparency  has contributed to the 19% average annual volume growth in our environmental complex over the past five years.As the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities  uncertainties and volatility to energy markets  our global environmental alongside our gas and oil complexes will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks.Turning now to our mortgage business. I first want to touch on our pending acquisition of Black Knight as announced on May 4 of this year. As we said  when we made our announcement back then we continued to believe the transaction will close during the first half of 2023. Since the announcement  and in accordance with our initial expected timeline  we have submitted the necessary regulatory filings. We are working with the FTC as they perform their thoughtful and comprehensive reviews of the proposed transaction.Out of respect for the FTC is important work on this matter as we work with them toward regulatory approval  we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly  we remain very excited about the efficiencies that combined entities will bring to the end consumer and other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem.As interest rates rise  and mortgage origination volumes soften from recent record levels  our customers continue to turn to our mission critical technology to operate more efficiently. In the second quarter  we once again grew recurring revenues and outperformed the broader industry.Our focus during these evolving market conditions is first and foremost  our customer. Customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation and we continued to work with our customers to find the most efficient ways they can benefit from the breadth of offerings across our network.For example  we recently made the decision to offer interested customers our base eCO solution included in an Encompass subscription  making it easier and cheaper for customers to adopt and benefit from the efficiencies from an electronic closing.To focus on efficiencies has also led to increased interest in our data and analytics products  leveraging machine learning technology  our analytics platform automates the steps in the loan manufacturing process  and can save lenders 1000s of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity.Year-to-date  our data analytics business  which is made up largely of recurring revenues  has grown 21% year-over-year  we continue to see increased adoption of our analytics and new customers coming onto the platform  with a host of new clients added this year alone represented the likes of Chase  a number of leading independent mortgage bankers  and a top three home builder.We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders  and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff SprecherThank you  Ben. Good morning  everyone. And thank you for joining us.Please turn to Slide 10. The first half of the year has been marked by rising inflation  rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers are navigating evolving risks and continued to rely on our data  technology and liquid markets to manage these risks.In the second quarter  we once again grew revenues  grew adjusted operating income  and grew adjusted earnings per share these record setting second quarter results reflect the strength of our network and the all weather nature of our business model.Our strategy has always been to find unique and novel ways to apply data and technology to bring efficiencies and transparency to markets whether it was moving energy trading to the screen  clearing OTC swaps  modernizing the technology powering the U.S. equity markets  or building datasets for the opaque fixed income markets. As we've grown and diversified  we've broadened our opportunity set and our expertise has grown  providing new markets to grow into  and importantly  new ways to provide innovative solutions to customers.We've leveraged our leading pricing and reference data to build new tools for the front office. We've married our fixed income data to newly expanded climate capabilities. And more recently  we've combined our expertise in futures contract construction  with our index capabilities  and with our unique mortgage data to launch both the ICE mortgage rate lock index and its associated futures contract. These are just a few examples of the innovation that we can deliver with our expanded technology  datasets and expertise.Our evolution has been intentional  diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues with the goal of building a business that today generates compounding earnings growth. It's how we've grown our adjusted earnings per share for the past 15 years in every year that we've been a public company. The net result of our compounding earnings growth is the compounding growth in our dividend  which we've grown double digits each year on average since we initiated it in 2013 and which we also grew 15% in this quarter.Looking now to the second half of the year and beyond  we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us. And we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers while driving compounding growth for our stockholders.I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and their trust and I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter  following on the heels of our best first quarter  making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company.With that  I'll now turn the call back to our moderator Victoria  and will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. We will now start our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Rich Repetto at Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Rich RepettoGood morning  Jeff and Ben and Warren. It's unfortunate  we can't get any comments on the Black Knight acquisition  because that's certainly on everybody's mind. But anyway  I'll ask about fixed income. Ben  you saw probably a nice uptick in fixed income execution  I think it's up 85% up 10 million  just quarter-over-quarter. And I would suspect that's just the retail  your retail complex [muni] [ph] picking up? And then one other question related to fixed income  the recurring revenues went down quarter-to-quarter just by a million  I suspect that's currency  but just wanted to get some clarification there as well.Jeff SprecherHi  Rich. I'm going to hand it over to Lynn to go through this.Lynn MartinHi  Rich. Thanks for the question. You're right that we saw strong growth in our fixed income trading business this quarter. And as mentioned in our prepared remarks that was driven off of strengthened our muni trading business. And while volatility and the return of retail has certainly been a contributor  we're seeing our institutional efforts pay off. As you are aware over the last two years  we really focused on leveraging our market leading assets in the muni ecosystem  including our data assets and our index business  which now serves as the benchmark for more than 60% of the AUM in this area to build out the infrastructure to connect the institutional market to our muni execution platforms. And in this quarter alone  we're seeing the benefits of that work manifest itself. And that institutional share within our muni execution platforms has doubled since 2020  enabling us to take share in the broader muni market. And finally  it's worth noting that our institutional business in munis has grown 250%  year-over-year  a further sign that we're gaining share in this asset class.Warren GardinerAnd then  Rich  its Warren on your question on the recurring revenues. You're right. That's FX  largely FX  there's also a little bit of AUM related revenue in our ETF business. So as we saw during the quarter people shifting into treasuries and out of equities  and some of the credit focused ETFs. There's lower economics on those treasury ETFs that we bent that track our benchmarks and so that was a little bit of a mix shift impact for us as well within the AUM portion of the index. The rest of the index business did really well during the quarter up double digits. Again  some of the subscription revenue  pure subscription revenue  if you will  in there. So really just kind of the macro dynamics taking hold there that why you saw that slight sequential decline.Rich RepettoGot it. Thanks for the update.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm at UBS. Please go ahead.Alex KrammYes. Hey  good morning. Lots of info you gave already on the mortgage side. But we'd like to dig a little bit deeper in particular on the recurring side. So few questions here. One I don't know if you gave an update to the recurring revenue guide for that segment that would be interested if that's still unchanged  but then more importantly  I think you mentioned that even like some of the challenges in the end markets you are seeing some bankruptcies  et cetera. So maybe you could give us an update what you're seeing in terms of customer losses  and maybe remind us how the revenue model is if there's any receipts  et cetera.And then  sorry  lastly  maybe give us a little bit of the algorithm of growth that you've seen so far in the recurring revenues year-to-date between customer losses  but then also some of the upsells that you guys were talking about earlier. And then  also this continued shift to moving the contract terms to more recurring  so I know that's a mouthful  but hopefully I get out of it.Ben JacksonYes  that's a lot Alex. This is Ben. I'll start and Warren will also I'm sure add in here. So in terms of  I'll start with this  just the overall challenges in the environment. If you take a step back  and you look at what we're building  we're building a business here that in mortgage whether a number of different market environments with an eye towards an 8% to 10% growth over the long-haul. And why are we confident in our ability to do that is the reasons are one we have absolutely mission critical software for these clients that we're providing. We have long-term contracts with our clients  four to five years of the high amount of retention in them. And we are heavily focused  as you've seen in our results  on shifting the revenue to more and more towards recurring. And we did it again this quarter  on the backdrop of 40% down market in terms of volumes  with 18% year-over-year recurring revenue growth in the business.The other Proofpoint  you've seen in terms of being able to weather various market environments is our data analytics line item. With that being up 36% last quarter alone. And one of the key inputs and drivers to that is our AIQ and analyzer solutions  we're seeing tremendous uptake in that we're seeing clients now more than ever just looking to adopt automation to automate as much of the workflow as possible to lower their costs.And the other proof point I put out  there was a comment Warren made in his prepared remarks  in that if you look at Q2 of 2019  very similar volume environment to what we saw in this past quarter  we generated more than $100 million of revenue on a pro forma basis. And that's  what enables us to do as we do time studies  with our clients  and clients that adopt our full automation suite  we see are saving anywhere from 570 to $1 400 per loan that they're manufacturing when they adopt our solutions. So our ability to capture some benefit from that from the efficiencies that we're providing to the industry has been tremendous.In terms of the algorithm of growth  on recurring revenue  it's really -- it's a mix that we've described before  it's a mix of  there is some pricing in there  there is sales to new clients. So I mentioned  we had a good start of the year for sales on Encompass. We've had a good sales for the year on our AIQ business. And then also the other input is that shift as customers are renewing that shift of -- even if we have to forego some transaction revenue of moving more to subscription  we're continuing to do that  and have a lot of success. And we're still early days  we're really in the first year of a codified program to do that. And with contracts with clients going four to five years in the future we have a long runway to go.Warren GardinerAlex  this is Warren  you asked about the guidance. So yes  you're correct. There's no change to the guidance that we gave to start the year. We did assume  as we said back then that there will be some headwinds from people potentially going out of business or maybe not as many new market participants  I'll say I'm highly confident that to the extent that starts to play out  that's going to be a cyclical trend  not a secular one  because I think if you think about the process for and this is reiterating what Ben just said  we think about the rest of getting a mortgage  it continues to be very costly for the consumer  it's very inefficient. And we have the tools that are -- building the tools that are really solving those problems. And so I know that probably doesn't help  solve for 2022  EPS or 2023 EPS  but it should really factor into kind of the multiple people are thinking about when you're valuing the overall enterprise at the end of the day.Alex KrammSo you haven't seen a lot of impact from cancellations at this point  just to clarify.Ben JacksonHey  Alex. It's Ben again. So we have seen a small  small number of lenders that have had some challenges and potentially go out of business  but it's a very small number that we've seen so far.Alex KrammVery good. Thank you.OperatorPerfect. Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtHi  good morning. So last quarter  you spoke about energy traders moving away from using futures and towards options at least for oil specifically  just given the decline in oil futures open interest throughout 2Q it seemed like that trend may have continued. Just wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing from commodity trading firms right now trying to manage risk in an extremely volatile environment. Because I guess given the volatility  we've seen the market  it's a bit surprising to see energy volumes only up 3% in the second quarter and now seemingly kind of trending lower year-on-year into the third quarter. Thank you.Ben JacksonHey  Kyle  it's Ben. So you have a -- we have a confluence of issues that are going on around the world that are really unprecedented. And against that backdrop  we're pleased that our overall  our overall futures business is up for year-over-year in terms of open interest and since the end of the year  and our energy businesses up in open interest since the end of the year  given all of these events. And what are we looking at  we're looking at an inflationary environment  we're looking at a recession  you've got in particular in Europe  governments in Europe  have to figure out the balance between sanctions against Russia  the impact of those sanctions against their civilians  in terms of near-term price impact on energy  and move towards cleaner energy.So you've got this pothole mix and then you also have in China continued COVID lockdowns that are happening  and obviously geopolitical tensions happening with China.So given all those issues  we believe that our marketplace has been set up as best as can be in the in the world to help clients navigate through all of these events  and they're utilizing us to do that. And I'll give a few examples. So first  we have one of the most deep and liquid markets across that energy spectrum. So think of oil  gas  LNG  power and environmentals. So as clients are looking to move and switch between fuels  looking towards  moving towards a cleaner environment  we are the exchange and clearing businesses that they're going to do that.Second  in managing global supply shocks  you have deep -- we have deep liquid global markets in each of those respective asset classes that I mentioned with oil  gas  LNG  power  and environmentals and enable customers because we have all these deep liquid points at the points of production and consumption  as clients need to hedge their risks using different risk management tools. We're very well positioned to do that. And a perfect example is right now with Russia  stifling gas supplies going into Europe  we are seeing U.S. step in and U.S. providing natural gas via LNG cargos going into Northern Europe.And given that we are the home to the vast majority of commercial traders  that trade our U.S. gas products  both Henry Hub and our bases markets  we're seeing clients use that to hedge those cargos. And it's one of the inputs that's led to what I mentioned in my prepared remarks of the record we've seen in market share from a Henry Hub perspective  as well as a North American gas and at a highest well in the global gas complex.The third thing I'd point out is that we're engaged as much as ever with clients and governments around the world around the sanctions and as they're taking shape. And there's no question it had some impact  as there was uncertainty as to how issues would play out in products like gas and oil  where Russian fuel oil is an input into that historically  as governments have made it clear that as of February of 23  Russian fuel oil will no longer be provided  it no longer be consumed in Europe  we've changed the specification on our gas oil contract. And now we started to see open interest in volume starting to build again in gas oil  calendar 23 and beyond.And then you pointed out  our deep liquid options market. So options is clearly one of the most efficient ways to hedge geopolitical tail risk because it helps to hedge a number of different scenarios that could play out and embrace our volume in open or volume in Brent options  year-over-year is up 25%. So when you look at me stand your lens and look at the overall energy complex. We feel really good about how we're positioned.Kyle VoigtThank you so much.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Craig SiegenthalerHey  good morning  everyone. So my question is on mortgage tech origination revenues were down not that surprising. But you help us with some perspective on incremental downside from current levels. And also  in terms of timing  when should we think these revenues will stabilize? And any perspective on that relative to what rates are doing would be helpful too?Ben JacksonHey  Craig  it's Ben  I'll start. So basically reiterate some of the things that I said before  when you widen out what our strategy is  within the mortgage and mortgage technology business  our strategy here has been to move more and more of the revenue towards recurring to take some of that cyclicality out of the business and we continue to do that. And we've been successfully doing that.In terms of predicting the rate environment and how that's going to play out just look at how the rate environments played out over the last week  it's been extraordinarily hard for to see and be able to predict when that this volume environment and stuff will settle down. But despite that  we're going to continue to make investments in the innovation that we're providing to our clients. As we mentioned  a lot of the investments that we made is what fueled that $100 million growth that we saw over the last three years in a similar environment to what we had in 2019. Those are investments -- those investments are in and around everything that we've been doing in the closing side  our simple file business continues to gain market share and do very well. And then all of the innovation that we've been introducing on the data and analytics side with our AIQ platform  as well as the automation of the underwrite platform  we see that those are all tailwinds that regardless of the rate environment and the volume environment that our growth drivers for us.Jeff SprecherAnd this is Jeff  let me just mention that a lot of our mortgage strategy is driven by the fact that we're trying to really position the company to be an all weather named that in all interest rate and macroeconomic environments that I can continue to end my prepared remarks on the same page that shows a graph of compounding earnings growth  for shareholders. And having a U.S. mortgage strategy gives us exposure we own LIBOR  which is the London Interbank index we trade U.K. and EU interest rate futures. We have a credit default swap business that is completely global that includes Russian sovereign  hedging and companies across the globe.We have a fixed income business that is truly global  we provide pricing data in almost every single country that has bond issuance. And we were relatively thin on having exposure to U.S. interest rates  and moving into mortgage gives us that.I also think  when we step back and look at the mortgage complex  the U.S. mortgage complex  and the way we're building the business  is that there is a demographic of millennials  that is huge  that are underserved by homeownership. And there's been supply chain issues during COVID to meet housing. And we generally believe that that any house that gets built will be sold and that there will be a mortgage on it  and that the supply chain issues are getting better and that the underperformance of building is increasing.We also have seen from our limited ownership of having mortgage assets that cash out refinancings happen when the value of homes go up  and which is an inflationary input. And the one that I think a lot of people and maybe is at the root of your question focus on is the absolute interest rate  which leads to people refinancing in a declining interest rate market.Long story short is there are a number of inputs into the housing market. We want to have exposure to the U.S. interest rate environment. It's going to help plus built in all weather name. And even with a downturn in the number of U.S. mortgages  we've had the best second quarter in our company's history.Craig SiegenthalerGreat. Thanks for taking my question.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Brian BedellGreat. Thanks. Good morning  folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just a two-parter on the environmental initiatives. So maybe Ben  if you could just comment on within the energy complex  obviously  we're seeing very good strength in that gas. We did see a couple quarters now sequential declines in the environmental so the question there is  our customers substituting that gas for some of the environmental versus something else driving on the environmental side short-term? And then  the second part of the question is  if you could comment on this  maybe Lynn  but on the acquisition of Urgentem and the overall climate data strategy  whether you're seeking to get more to grow substantially in that business linking that into the data more heavily into the environmental trading side?Ben JacksonGot it. Thanks  Brian. Yes  I'll start and then I’ll hand it to Lynn for the second part of that. So as I mentioned before  there's this confluences issues going on  in particular in Europe and where we have seen some impacts  so the balance between Russia and sanctions and the impact on the civilians and the move to cleaner energy. In Europe in specifically  we have seen some time and attention from traders that would trade things like our EUA markets  our European Union Allowances  moving and shifting more towards just the acute energy issues that everyone's faced with right now. So we have seen some headwinds in that part.But the flip side of it is in North America  we've had a very strong business continuing to do very  very well. North America is doing well and our Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiatives  our California Carbon Allowances  our renewable fuels  our REC markets  each of these are doing very  very well and we're continuing to invest. So we recently launched Biofuel Contracts they're doing well  we recently launched a global index  a Global Carbon Index Future  as well and we're getting more and more on the index itself we're getting more ETS to license and on futures are starting to develop there. We recently launched Texas Wind and Solar contracts  we recently launched nature-based offset contracts for the voluntary markets.So we see a lot of tailwinds coming in the foreseeable future  and you also have other developments like State of Pennsylvania likely to join Reggie [ph] and Washington State likely to put in their Cap and Trade Program for the first time. So we have a lot of good tailwinds there in North America. And I think what you're seeing in the overall complex is just a wait little bit on the EUA market in Europe.Lynn MartinAnd thanks  Brian  for the follow-up question. So given the strength in our fixed income data  we're uniquely positioned to add transparency around ESG  really focused on the climate risk. Given our ability to tie alternative datasets into datasets that the market knows you've seen us further position this offering. In Q4  we announced the acquisition of risQ and Level 11  which enabled us to execute on the opportunity to turn physical climate data into actionable insights starting with our muni bond service  but more recently expanding into the mortgage-backed securities market. And now we have the ability to offer a parcel level information measured by geographic coordinates in the U.S.  and we plan to expand that globally.And then  finally  as you know we recently announced the purchase of our Gen10  which really expands our climate risk offering to include corporate transition risk  given its coverage of 30 000 public and private companies  which was an attractive dataset to us to add to the climate offering.Brian BedellThat's great color. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Michael CyprysGreat  thanks so much. Wanted to ask about the commodities franchise  just curious how you guys are thinking about the longer-term growth drivers there  what factors ultimately drive volumes higher in your commodities franchise  is it production of the underlying commodities  for example  some more oil and gas rigs  producing more oil and gas are going to drive volumes higher over the long-term? Just curious how you think about those growth drivers and the algorithm and how is that evolving? Thank you.Ben JacksonThanks  Michael. This is Ben. And the way we think about it is  we need to have as I described earlier  that breadth of offerings of global offerings across the each of the inputs into producing energy is  as the statistics that are out there point to energy consumption doubling between now and 2050. And it's just what are the inputs into the production of that energy are going to change and will change over-time. And we believe with the breadth of offerings that we have across oil  gas  LNG  power and then the significant early start that we had and thinking about the environmental markets with the acquisition of the Climate Exchange over a decade ago  we're very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So that's one input into it.You do have a global focus on the reduction of carbon emissions around the world and as I said before  with our environmental markets  we are very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So those are two. I think the third is that even though we have had some near-term headwinds in some of the products in Europe in particular the ones that have been at the center of this Ukraine  Russia situation we continue to see user growth. So we continue to see more and more users taking data subscriptions and coming onto the platform to get visibility into what's happening in those markets  how those markets correlate  or de-correlate at times to others around the world. So when we look at the underlying health of the market  looking at user growth  looking at open interest and looking at the global breadth of the offerings that we provide to our clients  those are all inputs into our growth outlook [ph].Michael CyprysGreat. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your question. Our final question is a follow-up from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.Rich RepettoYes. Thanks for taking the question. Just one last question on mortgage  and this I think is more for Jeff. In the prepared remarks  it was mentioned about efficiency and automation and how the downturn is maybe emphasizing that more in the mortgage segment. But I guess the question  Jeff is  I think people are really looking for the connection between mortgage and how that can automate overtime as you've done so in other markets. So the question is  how is it comparing given that mortgage has a longer workflow process  but what you are seeing so far in regards to the automation of the market longer term versus the other asset classes you've dealt with?Jeff SprecherSure  that's a great question Rich  because I'm a company founder  I get asked to speak to entrepreneurs from time-to-time and I always tell them  the best time to start a business is when there's a downturn and not that having us moved into this space  you wish a downturn on anybody  but it's very  very hard to get people in finance and I say this broadly  whether it's trading  clearing  data  acquisition it is very  very hard to get people in finance to change their behavior when they're making a lot of money and when things are going well.And the best time to get people to think about making a change is when their businesses are under pressure and Ben alluded to that a number of times in why our subscription revenues are doing well in the mortgage space.Broadly speaking again  I appreciate the question. I know you've followed our company for many years  and you see us putting data and analytic tools into the mortgage market. The mortgage market that we're talking a lot about is the cash market. You've seen us and I mentioned in my prepared remarks  launch our first derivative product against in a new index that we created. And so I think this space has a lot of inefficiencies throughout the entire  not just the manufacturing the mortgage  but the way mortgages are financed and traded and retreated in the secondary market  very poor data available due to the paper based nature of the contract  difficult to regulate for regulate regulators  regulators think that there may be biases in the market  but without the right data  it's very hard to know  it's very hard to correct for the participants in the market  very expensive for consumers  banks that spend a lot of money to court a consumer  tend to lose them when there's a refinancing or a change in that client's behavior.The market is not very thoughtful about keeping connectivity between those that lend and those that borrow and all of that I think is fertile ground for us and may go for decades  honestly as we build out the infrastructure. But at the core  we need a foundation of data and information that borrowers  that lenders and that regulators can all look at and use to make it easier.I think I may have mentioned to you even that  it's odd to me that you can buy a completely consumable good  you can buy toothpaste on an online platform and when you go to checkout it'll ask you if you want to buy now and pay later  knowing that an algorithm underwrote your credit against no collateral and yet  it takes almost two months for somebody to refinance a mortgage in a house that they live in  that has a foundation that's in the ground that has an address that you can see from space that is part of the Maslow's hierarchy of need of safety and security and will be abandoned by that person  the last thing they do. And yet we  an existing mortgage talking to their bank takes two months.It just something is wrong in those equations. And we could argue that by now pay later lending maybe too generous  but certainly 60 days to do work with an existing client than an existing home just feels too long. And that's  that is the challenge that I think we will tackle successfully and put the entire industry on a better footing.Rich RepettoGot it. Thank you. That's helpful.OperatorThank you for your question. We have received a follow up from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtThanks for taking my follow up. So a question on the OTC and other revenue line in the exchange segment was quite strong in the quarter. I just want to confirm that the increase that we saw there was really driven by collateral fees that ICE is clearing house or is there something else that was driving that? And can you remind us if those collateral fees are entirely fixed basis point fees  or if there is or will be any benefit from rate hikes we've seen in the U.S. and EU?Warren GardinerSo hey  Kyle  it's Warren. So in terms of the OTC and other yes  you're correct that the performance there has been collateral driven that's largely from net interest income or earning at ICE Future or ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Europe and so as collateral bounces move around and you've seen that over the course of this year. That's obviously going to benefit that particular line item.In terms of rates moving higher  we do have a benefit from that that's going to show up there more on -- will show up on the CDS clearing side because we do park some collateral funds there as a Fed. And so we do get a benefit as collateral moves up  but then also as Fed funds rates move up there and so that's part of the strong performance you've seen in CDS there. So  not in that OTC and other line but in the spirit of your question  yes  that there's a benefit from better rate hikes coming through over-time.Kyle VoigtUnderstood. Thanks.OperatorThank you for your question  Kyle. This concludes our Q&A session. And now I'd like to pass over to Chair CEO  Jeff Sprecher for any final remarks.Jeff SprecherThank you  Victoria.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the first six months of 2022 ended June 30  2022.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.)Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries  commented:""Pharming delivered strong half year results with total revenues up 4% compared to the same period last year. RUCONEST® sales growth was supported by increases in physicians prescribing and number of patients. For the second quarter of 2022  sales were US$50.1 million bringing the first half year of 2022 to US$96.8 million.Concerning pipeline development  we continued to advance leniolisib through the regulatory process as we seek marketing authorization in the US  the UK  and the EEA for the treatment of APDS  a rare  complex and progressive primary immunodeficiency. In the US  we filed a New Drug Application with the FDA for the treatment of APDS in adults and adolescents aged 12 or older at the end of July 2022. On August 2  we announced a new diagnosis code for reporting cases of APDS  which will be added to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The diagnosis code  D81.82  will be effective starting October 1  2022.Looking to Europe  the EEA and the UK remain on track for regulatory filings from October this year. On August 1  we announced the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older.Story continuesIn our drive to focus on RUCONEST® sales  the launch and commercialization of leniolisib  and the management of our pipeline  we initiated an internal review of our pipeline. As a result of these initial findings  we have taken the strategic decision to discontinue the development of rhC1INH for acute kidney injury and pre-eclampsia. In line with this decision  we will also de-prioritize further development in the large-scale production of rhC1INH through the use of our transgenic cattle herd. The herd will be maintained while we consider strategic options for acute kidney injury (AKI) to gain value from the work done to date. We will continue to progress the ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial in AKI until further notice.With these decisions  we continue to evolve as a company  and continue to focus our efforts and resources on the most value enhancing initiatives for our stakeholders.""Strategic highlightsDuring the first half of 2022  we continued to execute on our strategic objectives of building a sustainable business by focusing on RUCONEST® sales  the approval  launch and commercialization of leniolisib  and the ongoing development and management of our pipeline.The development of our pipeline will be through a combination of internal development projects - including the development of additional indications for leniolisib and OTL-105 as a gene therapy for HAE - and the potential acquisition of new  late-stage assets through in-licensing and M&A opportunities.These potential acquisitions will be financed through a combination of positive cash flow from the RUCONEST® business  anticipated future leniolisib businesses  as well as available cash from our strong balance sheet. If required  Pharming will access additional funding from the capital markets.Therefore  with the ongoing focus on our strategic objectives  we have initiated an internal review of our pipeline. As a result  we are announcing a number of initial changes to the pipeline as detailed below.Pipeline developmentleniolisibFor leniolisib  a three-step approach has been planned for the coming years.The first step is the anticipated commercial approval and market launch in the US during the first half of 2023  followed by key markets in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK in the second half of 2023. The Company will evaluate additional countries and regions and will commercialize the product either directly  or through strategic distribution partnerships.The second step includes the approval and launch of leniolisib as a treatment of APDS in children as young as one year of age.The third step is the continued life cycle management of the leniolisib compound into further indications.US marketSubject to FDA approval and granting of priority review by the FDA in the US  we remain on track for the commercial approval of leniolisib in the first quarter and market launch early in the second quarter of 2023.On July 29  2022  a New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the US FDA for leniolisib  for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents aged 12 or older. Aligned with the goals set out in PDUFA VI  Pharming expects a Filing Notification Letter by Day 60  which will include the FDA's determination of priority review. If priority review is granted  it is expected that the FDA review will be completed within six months of the 60-day filing date.In anticipation of a positive outcome from the FDA  we continue to grow our US field force and leverage our marketing capabilities for the commercialization of leniolisib.Finally for the US market  on August 2  2022  Pharming announced that a new diagnosis code for reporting cases of APDS  will be added to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The diagnosis code  D81.82  will be effective starting October 1  2022  and will help accurately identify  stratify and triage US patients eligible for APDS treatments and research opportunities.EU and UK marketsIn Europe  we remain on track with anticipated filings of the market authorization applications to both regulatory agencies - the European Medical Agency (EMA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - in the second half of 2022. Additionally  the MHRA granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS.Additionally  on August 1  we announced the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted an accelerated assessment for the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. Pharming plans to submit the MAA for leniolisib to EMA in October 2022.Pediatric clinical developmentThe studies to support the initial applications in the US  EU  and UK have enrolled patients ages 12 years and older. To expand access to leniolisib for the treatment of pediatric APDS  Pharming has developed a clinical plan to include children as young as one year of age. During the first half of the year  positive decisions were received from EMA and MHRA on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children.The leniolisib PIP includes two planned  global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS aged 4 to 11 with a second study in patients aged 1 to 6. These two studies will support regulatory filings worldwide. Pharming expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib in the second half of 2022.OTL-105In July 2021  Pharming announced a strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE). The program has made significant progress developing the lentiviral vector to enhance C1-inhibitor expression and is now testing in preclinical HAE disease models. We anticipate providing further updates as we move towards preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing.Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)Following an internal review of our pipeline  we have taken the strategic decision to discontinue further development of this therapy.While we consider strategic options to gain value from the work done to date  we will de-prioritize further development and investment in the large-scale production of rhC1INH through the use of our transgenic cattle herd. The herd will continue to be maintained to allow all possible outcomes to be explored.The ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial will continue as we evaluate these strategic options.Pre-eclampsiaFollowing an internal review of our pipeline  a decision has been made to discontinue further development and investment. This was due to the choices we have made to prioritize the investments to support the sales of RUCONEST® and the commercialization of leniolisib.PompeThe study into the development of a next-generation alpha-glucosidase therapy for the treatment of Pompe disease is ongoing. We are currently engaged in preclinical studies. If and when results from these preclinical studies become available  we will update the market.Operational highlightsRUCONEST®RUCONEST® sales were up 4% in the first half of 2022 providing stable cash flow for Pharming's future growth. Total revenues were US$96.8 million compared to US$93.2 million in the first half of 2021. RUCONEST® sales growth was supported by increases in physicians prescribing and number of patients.The US market represented 97% of total revenues for the first half of the year  while Rest of World (RoW) and Europe represented 3%.With a continued need for safe and reliable acute treatment options for hereditary angioedema (HAE)  we remain confident in the ongoing demand for RUCONEST® and continued single digit growth for the 2022 financial year.Organizational updateRobert Friesen  Chief Scientific Officer and Executive Board member resigned from his role at Pharming Group. Mr Friesen's succession is currently under review.Financial SummaryAmounts in US$m except per share data H1 2022 H1 2021 % ChangeIncome StatementRevenues 96.8 93.2 4 % Gross profit 87.9 83.8 5 % Operating profit 20.6 17.2 20 % Profit for the year 19.2 14.4 33 % Balance SheetCash & marketable securities 190.9 189.8 1 % Share InformationBasic earnings per share (US$) 0.029 0.022 32 % Diluted earnings per share (US$) 0.027 0.019 42 %Financial highlightsH1 2022Total revenues increased by 4% during the first half of 2022 to US$96.8 million  versus US$93.2 million during the first half of 2021.Gross profit increased by 5% during the first half of 2022  in line with the growth in revenues. Gross profit for 2022 was US$87.9 million (2021: US$83.8 million).Other income increased significantly in 2022 (US$15.0 million) as compared to 2021 (US$1.4 million) as Pharming reduced its minority stake in BioConnection from 43.85% to 22.98% in April 2022. As a result of this transaction  Pharming has received one-off net cash proceeds of US$7.5 million (EUR6.9 million) and recognized a gain of US$12.8 million.Operating profit for the first half of 2022 amounted to US$20.6 million  a 20% increase compared to the same period last year (US$17.2 million). This was mainly driven by the increase in other income of US$13.6 million. This was partly offset by an increase in operating costs resulting from a combination of increased R&D expenditure  launch preparation and manufacturing cost for leniolisib  and an increase in travel related expenses post-COVID.Net profit for H1 2022 was US$19.2 million  a 33% increase compared to H1 2021 (US$14.4 million). This was due to higher operating profit  increased financial income  and a decrease in tax expenses  which was offset by a decrease in the net profits in associates using the equity method.Cash and cash equivalents  together with restricted cash  decreased from US$193.0 million at the end of 2021 to US$190.9 million at the end of the second quarter 2022.Q2 2022For the second quarter of 2022  revenues increased by 1.0% to US$50.1 million  compared to US$49.7 million in the second quarter of 2021.Gross profit increased by 2.4%  to US$46.1 million as compared to the same period last year. This was in line with the growth in revenues.Operating profit of US$17.8 million was recorded for the second quarter of 2022. This was a 63.3% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This was a result of Pharming recognizing a gain of US$12.8 million in relation to the reduction in its minority stake in BioConnection  partly offset by increased costs for the leniolisib launch preparations.Net profit for the second quarter was US$15.7 million compared to US$5.8 million in the second quarter of 2021. This was mainly due to the one-off recognized gain of US$12.8 million from the reduction in its minority stake in BioConnection.OutlookFor the remainder of 2022  we expect:Single digit growth in Group revenues from RUCONEST® sales  driven by the US and expanded EU markets  are subject to potential business restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarterly fluctuations are expected.The submission of leniolisib's regulatory filings to EMA and UK MHRA are expected in the second half of 2022.Subject to positive outcomes of the FDA review and granting of a Priority Review for leniolisib  we anticipate commercial approval from the FDA in the first quarter of 2023  with an anticipated launch and commercialization soon after.Pharming will continue to allocate resources towards the anticipated launch and commercialization of leniolisib with the view of accelerating future growth. Investments in launch preparations and focused clinical development for leniolisib will continue to impact profit for 2022. With continued cash flow from RUCONEST® funding these investments  no additional financing to support the current business is expected.Investment and continued focused on the potential acquisitions and in-licensing of new  late-stage development opportunities and assets in rare diseases. Financing  if required  would come via a combination of our strong balance sheet and access to capital markets.No further specific financial guidance for 2022 is provided.Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on the Pharming.com website from 10:30 CET.Conference CallThe conference call will begin at 13:30 CET.

to the condensed consolidated financial statementsFor the period ended 30 June 20221. Company informationPharming Group N.V. is a limited liability public company which is listed on Euronext Amsterdam (PHARM) and on the NASDAQ (PHAR)  with its headquarters and registered office located at:Darwinweg 242333 CR LeidenThe Netherlands2. Statement of complianceThe consolidated interim financial statements for the six-month period ended 30 June 2022 have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 34  Interim financial reporting. The condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021  which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS interpretations committee (IFRS IC) interpretations applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and valid as of the balance sheet date.These condensed interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 3 August 2022.The published figures in these condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited.3. Accounting policiesAccounting policies are consistent with those of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.4. Estimates and judgementsThe preparation of interim financial statements in conformity with IAS 34 and Book 2 Title 9 of the Dutch Civil Code requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. In preparing these condensed interim financial statements  the significant judgements made by management in applying the Company's accounting policies were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.5. Going concernIn preparing and finishing the interim financial statements the Board of Directors of Pharming have assessed the Company's ability to fund its operations for a period of at least twelve months after the date the interim financial statements are issued. Based upon the assessment on a going concern basis  the Company has concluded that funding of its operations for a period of twelve months  after the date the interim financial statements are issued  is realistic and achievable. Overall  based on the outcome of this assessment  the interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.6. Seasonality of operationsSeasonality has no material impact on Company's interim financial statements.7. Segment informationThe Board of Directors consider the business from both a product and geographic perspective. From a product perspective  the Company's business is exclusively related to the recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor business. From a geographic perspective  the Company is operating in the US  Europe and RoW. The Board of Directors primarily measures revenues and gross profit to assess the performance of the geographic areas. Operating costs as well as non-current assets are not sub-allocated to the geographic areas.Total revenues and gross profit per geographic segment for the period ended 30 June:Amounts in US$ '000 H1 2022 H1 2021 Revenues:US 94 136 90 079 Europe & RoW 2 627 3 158 Total revenues 96 763 93 237 Gross profit:US 86 329 82 505 Europe & RoW 1 528 1 245 Total gross profit 87 857 83 7508. Other incomeOther income increased significantly in 2022 (US$15.0 million) as compared to 2021 (US$1.4 million) as Pharming reduced its minority stake in BioConnection from 43.85% to 22.98% in April 2022. As a result of this transaction  Pharming has recognized a gain of US$12.8 million. The remainder of the increase relates to increased government grants granted on R&D activities.9. Expenses by natureCost of sales in the first half year of 2022 amounted to US$8.9 million (HY 2021: US$9.5 million) and relate to actual product sales.Other operating costs increased to US$82.2 million compared to US$68.0 million in the first half year of 2021. The increase was a combination of increased R&D expenditure  launch preparation and manufacturing cost for leniolisib  and an increase in travel related expenses post-COVID.Employee benefitsEmployee benefits are charged to research and development costs  general and administrative costs or marketing and sales costs based on the nature of the services provided.Depreciation and amortization chargesAmounts in US$ '000 H1 2022 H1 2021 Property  plant and equipment (877) (1 044) Right-of-use assets (1 135) (1 385) Intangible assets (2 251) (2 089) Total (4 263) (4 518)The decrease of depreciation charges of property  plant and equipment and right-of-use assets in 2022 as compared to 2021 stems mainly from favorable currency translation effects.The increase in amortization of the intangible assets mainly relates to amortization of our new ERP system  which is operational as of January 2022. This is partly offset by favorable currency translation effects.10. Financial income (expenses)Amounts in US$ '000 H1 2022 H1 2021 Foreign currency results 6 474 5 355 Interest income — 43 Other financial income 6 474 5 398 Foreign currency results 0 (1) Interest on convertible bonds (2 434) (2 667) Other interest expenses (295) (479) Contingent consideration — 253 Other financial expenses (51) (64) Other financial expenses (2 780) (2 958) Total other financial income and expenses 3 694 2 440Foreign currency results in the EUR functional currency entities  primarily follow from the revaluation of bank balances and the loan which are denominated in foreign currencies  mainly US dollars. The US dollar strengthened over the course of 2022.11. InvestmentsInvestments accounted for using the equity methodThe asset relates to an investment in the ordinary shares of BioConnection Investments B.V. During the second quarter of 2022  Pharming entered into a share purchase agreement  following receipt of an offer for all shares in BioConnection by Gimv  a European investment company listed on Euronext Brussels. The existing shareholders (including Pharming) reached agreement with Gimv on the sale of all issued and outstanding shares to a new holding company (BioConnection Investments B.V.) incorporated by Gimv  followed by a partial re-investment by existing shareholders of the purchase price in the share capital of BioConnection Investments B.V. The re-investment relates to the purchase of ordinary shares and a preference share.The Board of Directors made an assessment on the accounting treatment of the agreement and concluded that the sale of the BioConnection ordinary shares and purchase of the BioConnection Investments B.V. ordinary shares shall be considered as a dilution of an existing equity stake in an investment in associate. Hence Pharming recognized the dilution of its equity stake as a reduction of the carrying amount of the investment in associate accounted for using the equity method. The preference share is valued as an investment in debt instruments designated as at fair value with changes through profit and loss (FVTPL). As a result of this transaction  Pharming has received one-off net cash proceeds of US$7.5 million (EUR6.9 million) and recognized a gain of US$12.8 millionIn the Board of Directors' judgement  the investment in BioConnection constitutes an investment in an associated company and is therefore not consolidated  as Pharming has significant influence but does not have control of BioConnection and is embargoed by a shareholders agreement between the shareholders of BioConnection from influencing any activity between the two parties which is in any significant way different from the relationship which existed between the two prior to the investment.The carrying amount of this investment has changed as follows:Amounts in US $ '000 June 30 2022 December 31 2021 Balance at 1 January 7 201 7 118 Amortization of financial guarantee (15) (33) Dilution of equity stake (3 104) — Profit (loss) for the period (550) 694 Foreign exchange rate movements (389) (578) Balance at end of period 3 143 7 201Investment in debt instruments designated as at FVTPLThe asset relates to the preference share as obtained as part of the agreement referred to above relating to BioConnection Investments B.V. The Board of Director's made an assessment on the accounting treatment of the preference share obtained. The Board concluded that the asset should be recognized as a financial asset (debt instrument) measured at initial recognition at fair value  subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. The fair value is calculated using the forward-looking Black-Scholes-Merton (""BSM"") financial instrument pricing framework.The carrying amount of this investment has changed as follows:Amounts in US $ '000 June 30 2022 December 31 2021 Balance at 1 January — — Investment 8 235 — Foreign exchange rate movements (390) — Balance at end of period 7 845 —Investment in equity instruments designated as at FVTOCIThe Group holds 1 0 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Orchard Therapeutics  a global gene therapy leader. The share were acquired as of July 1  2021  as part of strategic collaboration between Pharming Group N.V. and Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex-vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE)  a life-threatening rare disorder that causes recurring swelling attacks in the face  throat  extremities and abdomen.The Board of Directors do not consider that the Group is able to exercise significant influence over Orchard Therapeutics as the other 99.0 percent of the ordinary share capital is publicly traded at the Nasdaq stock exchange (Nasdaq: ORTX).The carrying amount of this investment has changed as follows:Amounts in US $ '000 June 30 2022 December 31 2021 Balance at 1 January 1 449 — Initial recognition — 4 589 Fair value adjustments through OCI (702) (3 077) Currency translation (104) (63) Balance at end of period 643 1 44912. Intangible assetsThe decrease in intangible assets mainly stems from regular amortization charges (US$2.3 million) and currency translation effects (US$6.6 million)  partly offset by capital expenditures (US$0.8 million).13. Property  plant and equipmentThe decrease in property  plant and equipment mainly stems from regular depreciation charges (US$1.4 million) and currency translation effects (US$0.9 million)  partly offset by capital expenditures (US$0.7 million).14. Right-of-use assetsThe decrease in the right of use asset is mainly caused by regular depreciation. No new significant investments for the first half year of 2022.15. Deferred tax assetsThe deferred tax asset decreased mainly due to offsetting the current tax expense with unused tax losses from prior years.16.

The impairment includes an impairment for obsolescence and an impairment to write inventories down to their net realizable value.Inventories are available for use in commercial  preclinical and clinical activities. Estimates have been made with respect to the ultimate use or sale of product  taking into account current and expected sales as well as preclinical and clinical programs. These estimates are reflected in the additions to the impairment.The costs of vials used in preclinical and clinical programs are presented under the research and development costs.The main portion of inventories at June 30  2022 have expiration dates starting beyond 2023 and are all expected to be sold and/or used before expiration.17. EquityThe Company's authorized share capital amounts to €8.8 million and is divided into 880 000 000 ordinary shares with a nominal value of €0.01 each. All 652 414 282 shares outstanding at June 30  2022 have been fully paid-up.

The Flash Memory Summit Awards represent an industry recognition of innovation that Kalray’s Flashbox™ solution brings to the market.“Designing an enterprise storage array today can benefit from a disaggregated architecture that can address performance at the highest levels and capacity expansion in a cost-effective manner.” said Jay Kramer  Chairman of the Awards Program and President of Network Storage Advisors Inc. “We are proud to recognize the collaboration between Viking and Kalray which provides an integrated storage solution delivering seral millions of IOPS using 12x 100 Gb/s network interface connections distributed across six DPUs-based acceleration cards.”Flashbox™ is a new concept of All-Flash-Array  based on Kalray’s MPPA® DPU processor (“Data Processing Unit”) and co-designed with Viking Enterprise Solutions.Whereas most advanced All-Flash Array solutions currently use multiple adapter cards with power-hungry and expensive CPUs (x86) that run storage services  the concept of Flashbox™ is to run all of the critical functions of a disaggregated storage appliance on a single chip: the Kalray MPPA® DPU. This solution delivers an unprecedent level of integration  speed  scalability and performance at an affordable cost. Thanks to Flashbox™ All-Flash-Array  data centers can reduce critical metrics such as $/IOP and IOPs/watt.“It is a great honor to win a Flash Memory Summit award for our innovative concept of Flashbox™ All-Flash Array.” said Kalray CEO  Éric Baissus. “We strongly believe that wide adoption of NVMe requires adopting new innovative approaches. This is Flashbox™. Flashbox™ is a unique high-performance  low power  cost-effective  high-available new generation of storage appliances based on Kalray’s DPU technology. Powered by our Smart Storage Acceleration Card  Flashbox™ allows data center customers to disaggregate their Flash tier while maintaining the same performance of local NVMe  thereby optimizing both Flash performance and capacity across the compute tier of their data center.”A unique concept on the market today  Flashbox™ benefits from ultra-fast interfaces and low power consumption. It can deliver unprecedent performance figures using 12x 100 Gb/s network interface connections distributed across six K200-LP cards and is based on market standards such as Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK)  NVMe/TCP or RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCEv1/v2).Flashbox™ is a 2U array  with support for 24 U.2 NVMe SSDs. Flashbox™ JBOF (Just A Bunch of Flash) replaces x86 servers of traditional storage nodes with Kalray PCIe cards (K200-LP) which incorporate the Kalray DPU. The high-availability Flashbox™ has two Viking Enterprise Solutions fabric modules  each module has a PCIe switch network and supports three PCIe add-in card slots (half-height  half-length). Each Kalray DPU PCIe add-in card can run all the critical functions and data services required of a storage appliance. Flashbox™ can scale from two to six of the K200-LP PCIe add-in cards allowing the end customer to scale performance independently of capacity of the array. This unique solution is lower cost and significantly lower power from a traditional NVMe storage array.Additionally  users will be able to take advantage of current and future data services integrated into the solution software stack such as data reduction (compression or deduplication)  data availability (RAID or erasure encoding) or data security (encryption). This will further enhance critical business metrics by offloading these services from the data center compute tiers. Flashbox™ offers the ideal SDS (software defined storage) solution by abstracting and disaggregating the Flash tier from the compute tier.About KALRAYKalray (Euronext Growth Paris - FR0010722819 - ALKAL) is a fabless semiconductor company  a leading provider of a new class of processors  specialized in Intelligent Data Processing from Cloud to Edge.

However  it requires vigilance and understanding of what users actually sign up for to avoid any risky activities with customers’ assets.“If you’re concerned about ""not your keys — not your coins "" you should just understand who this firm is  what the reputation is  how they are embracing regulation  or they are not embracing regulation ” Peck said. He added that self-custody has been trending in the community over the past few months as firms like the crypto lender Celcius were pausing withdrawals due to liquidity issues amid the massive crypto winter of 2022.“They were doing incredibly risky things with those deposits ” Peck noted.Related: Self-custody is key during extreme market conditions: Here's what experts sayThe latest remarks by WisdomTree’s head of digital assets come amid the company debuting its proprietary custodial wallet solution  WisdomTree Prime. The platform aims to provide exposure to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH)  as well as tokenized versions of physical assets like the U.S. dollar and gold.One of the largest crypto ETP providers  WisdomTree has launched eight crypto asset ETPs on Börse Xetra  SIX  the Swiss Stock Exchange and Euronext exchanges in Amsterdam and Paris.

Dual targeting of CD20 and CD22  both validated targets in B-cell malignancies  represents a potential therapeutic alternative to CD19-directed therapies.In 2018  Cellectis made the decision to internalize manufacturing for its therapeutic product candidates  with the goal of providing the company with manufacturing independence. UCART20x22 is the first example of achieving this milestone  as our first product candidate with fully integrated in-house development. It showcases our transformation into an end-to-end cell and gene therapy company  from discovery & product development  transfer  and GMP manufacturing and clinical development. We are very excited to start the clinical trial for patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in the second half of this year.Story continuesWe continue to make progress enrolling patients in our three Cellectis-sponsored Phase 1 dose escalation trials and take notable steps forward with our partnerships programs. These updates illustrate our potential and ability to advance the field of allogeneic CAR T cell therapy.”Pipeline highlightsCellectis continues to make progress  enrolling patients throughout its sponsored Phase 1 dose escalation trials:BALLI-01 (evaluating UCART22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL)UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD22 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r B-ALL in the BALLI-01 Phase 1 dose escalation clinical study.BALLI-01 is currently enrolling patients at dose level 3 (DL3) (5 × 10 6 cells/kg) with fludarabine  cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab (FCA) preconditioning regimen.Cellectis plans to initiate dosing patients with UCART22 product candidate manufactured fully in-house in the second half of this year.AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123) in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML)UCART123 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD123 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r AML in the AMELI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.MELANI-01 (evaluating UCARTCS1) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)UCARTCS1 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CS1 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r MM in the MELANI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.Cellectis is currently enrolling patients at dose level 1 (DL1) (1 × 106 cells/kg) with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) preconditioning regimen.NatHaLi-01 (evaluating UCART20x22) in relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (r/r NHL)UCART20x22 is Cellectis’ first allogeneic dual CAR T-cell product candidate being developed for patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (r/r NHL).UCART20x22 is Cellectis’ first product candidate fully designed  developed and manufactured in-house  showcasing the Company’s transformation into an end-to-end cell and gene therapy platform spanning discovery  product development  manufacturing of both starting materials and final cell therapy product candidate  as well as clinical development.On August 1st  the FDA allowed Cellectis’ IND to proceed for UCART20x22 for patients with r/r NHL. Cellectis plans to begin enrolling patients in the NatHaLi-01 Phase 1/2a clinical trial in the second half of the year.UCART Preclinical Data & ProgramsNovel universal CAR T-cellOn May 16  Cellectis presented research data on the development of a novel universal CAR T-cell with immune-evasive properties using TALEN ® -gene editing  at an oral presentation at the American Society of Cell and Gene Therapy Annual Meeting (ASGCT). Click here to access the presentation.Following its oral presentation at ASGCT  Cellectis published its research data in Nature Communications on June 30. Click here to access the article.Cellectis’ next generation of universal CAR T-cells have the potential to improve the persistence and to allow large-scale deployment of T-cell product candidates in allogeneic settings against multiple malignancies. This novel immune-evasive CAR T-cell scaffold is deficient in Class 1 major histocompatibility complex (MHC-1) and expresses the Natural Killer (NK) inhibitor HLA-E. These two genomic modifications enable CAR T-cells to evade NK (Natural Killer) cells as well as alloresponsive T-cells attacks and impart efficient antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo.Licensed Allogeneic CAR-T Cell Development ProgramsAllogene Therapeutics  Inc.’s CAR T programs utilize Cellectis technologies. ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A are anti-CD19 products being jointly developed under a collaboration agreement between Les Laboratoires Servier (“Servier”) and Allogene Therapeutics  Inc.

Servier grants to Allogene exclusive rights to ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A in the U.S. while Servier retains exclusive rights for all other countries. Allogene’s anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programs are licensed exclusively from Cellectis to Allogene and Allogene holds global development and commercial rights to these programs.Anti-CD19 programIn June 2022  Allogene announced that FDA granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to ALLO-501A in relapsed/refractory Large B Cell Lymphoma (r/r LBCL). The RMAT designation was based on the potential of ALLO-501A to address the unmet need for patients who have failed other therapies and follows positive data from the Phase 1 ALPHA2 trial in heavily pretreated patients with r/r LBCL.Allogene previously announced that enrollment in the Phase 1 portion of the ALLO-501A ALPHA2 trial in relapsed/refractory (r/r) Large B Cell Lymphoma (LBCL) re-opened with the goal of offering AlloCAR T™ to patients while Allogene prepares to launch the pivotal Phase 2 ALPHA2 trial. They also previously said that the single-arm pivotal ALPHA2 trial of ALLO-501A in r/r LBCL is on track to begin mid-year 2022 with FDA discussions directed at finalizing clinical trial design and Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) requirements. AlloCAR T™ is a trademark of Allogene Therapeutics  Inc.Anti-BCMA programIn May 2022  Allogene announced that the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for ALLO-605 for the treatment of r/r MM.Allogene previously announced that enrollment had resumed in trials targeting BCMA for the treatment of patients with r/r MM  including the UNIVERSAL trial with ALLO-715 and the IGNITE trial with the TurboCAR™ candidate  ALLO-605.Anti-CD70 programIn April 2022  Allogene presented preclinical data at the 2022 AACR Annual Meeting which support the ongoing clinical evaluation of ALLO-316 for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and other CD70 expressing cancers. The findings were simultaneously published in AACR’s Cancer Research.Allogene previously announced that the Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial of ALLO-316 in RCC  now in its second dose level cohort  continues to accrue patients.Gene Editing PartnershipsIovance Biotherapeutics  Inc.

Dr. Bergstrom currently serves as Executive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Relay Therapeutics  Inc.  a clinical-stage precision medicines company.Axel-Sven Malkomes served as Chief Financial Officer & Chief Business Officer at Medigene AG  a clinical stage immuno-oncology company focusing on the development of T-cell immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer  until March 31st  2022. He brings with him over 25 years of experience in the healthcare sector.Financial ResultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  which consolidate the results of Calyxt  Inc. of which Cellectis owned approximately 51.3% of outstanding shares of common stock (as of June 30  2022)  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants – in the appendices of this Q2 2022 financial results press release.Cash: As of June 30  2022  Cellectis  including Calyxt  had $135 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of which $123 million are attributable to Cellectis on a stand-alone basis. This compares to $191 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2021  of which $177 million was attributable to Cellectis on a stand-alone basis. This net decrease of $56 million primarily reflects (i) $56 million of net cash flows used in operating  investing and lease financing activities of Cellectis  (ii) $13 million of net cash flows used in operating  capital expenditures and lease financing activities of Calyxt  and (iii) a $4 million defavorable FOREX impact which was partially offset by (i) $10 million of net proceeds from capital raise at Calyxt and  (ii) $5 million of cash received related to research tax credit prefinancing. Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis excluding Calyxt anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of $123 million as of June 30  2022 will fund its operations into early 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $7 million for the six months ended June 30  2022 compared to $43 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. 99% of consolidated revenues and other income was attributable to Cellectis in the first six months of 2022. This decrease between the six months ended June 30  2022 and 2021 was mainly attributable to (i) a decrease of revenue pursuant to the recognition of a $15.0 million convertible note obtained as consideration for a “right-to-use” license granted to Cytovia and a $5.1 million Allogene milestone during the six-month period ended June 30  2021  while revenue related to collaboration agreements for the six months of 2022 consists of the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million and the recognition of $1.0 million related to a change of control of a licensee pursuant to the terms of the license agreement with Cellectis and amendment to the license agreement (extension of the option term) (ii) a decrease in other revenues of $5 million relating to a change in Calyxt’s business model for its PlantSpring technology and BioFactory  in which no significant revenue was yet recognized.Cost of Revenues: Consolidated cost of revenues were $0 7 million for the six months ended June 30  2022 compared to $20 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. This decrease is driven by the change in Calyxt’s business model for its PlantSpring and BioFactory.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $59 million for the six months ended June 30  2022 compared to $62 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. 89% of consolidated R&D expenses was attributable to Cellectis in the first six months of 2022. The $3 million decrease between the first six months of 2022 and 2021 was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease of purchases  external expenses and other by $4.5 million (from $36 million in 2021 to $31 million in 2022) due to lower consumables  subcontracting costs and depreciation and amortization for the therapeutic segment  (ii) a $0.9 million decrease in social charges on stock option  and (iii) a $0.9 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense partially offset by an increase of $3 million in wages and salaries mainly driven by the increased R&D headcount in the therapeutic segment.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $17.7 million for the six months ended June 30  2022 compared to $18.2 million for the six months ended June 30  2021. 62% of consolidated SG&A expenses was attributable to Cellectis in the first six months of 2022. The $0.5 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $3 million decrease in wages and salaries  (ii) a $0.3 million decrease in social charges on stock option grants and (iii) a $0.5 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $9.2 million in 2021 to $8.7 million in 2022) partially offset by (i) a $3 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense mainly explained by the favorable impact in 2021 of the recapture of non-cash stock-based compensation from the forfeiture of certain of Calyxt’s former CEO’s unvested stock options  restricted stock units  and performance stock units following his departure.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $51 million (or $1.12 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022  of which $47 million was attributed to Cellectis  compared to $52 million (or $1.17 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2021  of which $43 million was attributed to Cellectis. This $1 million decrease in net loss between first six months 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by (i) an increase in net financial gain of $14.7  (ii) a decrease of $19 million of cost of revenue and  (iii) a $3.8 million decrease of research and development expenses partially offset by a decrease in revenues and other income of $36 million.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $46 million (or $1.00 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2022  of which $43 million is attributed to Cellectis  compared to a net loss of 48 million (or $1.08 per share) for the six months ended June 30  2021  of which $38 million was attributed to Cellectis.

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME – Second Quarter(unaudited)($ in thousands  except per share data)For the three-month period ended June 30  2021 2022 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (39 919 ) (18 947 ) Adjustment:Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 3 635 2 684 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (36 284 ) (16 264 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0 80 ) (0 36 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) (1) 45 461 310 45 507 921 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0 80 ) (0 36 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) (1) 45 461 310 45 507 921When we have adjusted net loss  in accordance with IFRS  we use the Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic to compute the Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share).

The increase is due primarily to (i) a $160.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income  (ii) a $114.4 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable  (iii) a $21.1 million increase in our equity share of gains on sale of real estate recorded by our unconsolidated real estate entities  and (iv) a $17.0 million decrease in allocations to preferred shareholders with respect to redemption of preferred shares  partially offset by (v) a $46.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and (vi) a $10.9 million increase in interest expense.The $160.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended June 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $95.7 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $65.2 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 15.9% or $108.4 million in the three months ended June 30  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per available square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 7.6% or $12.7 million in the three months ended June 30  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to increased property tax expense  on-site property manager payroll expense  marketing expense  other direct property costs  and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $65.2 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Operating Results for the Six Months Ended June 30  2022For the six months ended June 30  2022  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1 067.5 million or $6.05 per diluted common share  compared to $732.1 million or $4.18 per diluted common share in 2021  representing an increase of $335.4 million or $1.87 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $328.2 million increase in self-storage net operating income  (ii) a $104.4 million increase in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable  (iii) a $44.7 million increase in our equity share of gains on sale of real estate recorded by our unconsolidated real estate entities  and (iv) a $17.0 million decrease in allocations to preferred shareholders with respect to redemption of preferred shares  partially offset by (v) a $121.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and (vi) a $28.8 million increase in interest expense.The $328.2 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the six months ended June 30  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $191.3 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $136.9 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 15.9% or $210.5 million in the six months ended June 30  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per available square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 5.5% or $19.2 million in the six months ended June 30  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to increased property tax expense  on-site property manager payroll expense  other direct property costs  and centralized management costs. The increase in net operating income of $136.9 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Funds from OperationsFor the three months ended June 30  2022  funds from operations (“FFO”) was $4.58 per diluted common share as compared to $2.99 in the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 53.2%. FFO is a non-GAAP measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and generally represents net income before depreciation and amortization expense  gains and losses and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets. A reconciliation of GAAP diluted net income per share to FFO per share  and additional descriptive information regarding this non-GAAP measure  is attached.For the six months ended June 30  2022  FFO was $8.41 per diluted common share  as compared to $6.07 in the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 38.6%.We also present “Core FFO” and “Core FFO per share ” non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing  with respect to the periods presented below  unrealized gain on private equity investments and our equity share of merger transaction costs  severance of a senior executive  and casualties from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance  and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However  Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such measures  Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.The following table reconciles FFO per share to Core FFO per share and FFO to Core FFO  respectively (unaudited):Three Months Ended June 30  Six Months Ended June 30  2022 2021 Percentage Change 2022 2021 Percentage Change (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Reconciliation of FFO per Share to Core FFO per Share: FFO per share $ 4.58 $ 2.99 53.2 % $ 8.41 $ 6.07 38.6 % Eliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO  including our equity share from investments: Foreign currency exchange (gain) loss (0.58 ) 0.07 (0.78 ) (0.19 ) Preferred share redemption charge — 0.10 — 0.10 Other items (0.01 ) (0.01 ) 0.01 (0.01 ) Core FFO per share $ 3.99 $ 3.15 26.7 % $ 7.64 $ 5.97 28.0 % Reconciliation of FFO to Core FFO: FFO allocable to common shares $ 807 481 $ 525 009 53.8 % $ 1 483 685 $ 1 064 263 39.4 % Eliminate the impact of items excluded from Core FFO  including our equity share from investments: Foreign currency exchange (gain) loss (101 723 ) 12 707 (137 100 ) (32 678 ) Preferred share redemption charge — 16 989 — 16 989 Other items (1 781 ) (2 194 ) 766 (2 543 ) Core FFO allocable to common shares $ 703 977 $ 552 511 27.4 % $ 1 347 351 $ 1 046 031 28.8 % Diluted weighted average common shares 176 312 175 547 176 325 175 194 Core FFO per share $ 3.99 $ 3.15 26.7 % $ 7.64 $ 5.97 28.0 %Property Operations – Same Store FacilitiesThe Same Store Facilities consist of facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy  revenues  and cost of operations since January 1  2020. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2020  2021  and 2022 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities  which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However  because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such a measure  Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2 282 facilities (149.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 75% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at June 30  2022 (unaudited):Three Months Ended June 30  Six Months Ended June 30  2022 2021 Percentage Change 2022 2021 Percentage Change (Dollar amounts in thousands  except for per square foot data) Revenues (a): Rental income $ 765 081 $ 661 345 15.7 % $ 1 490 514 $ 1 288 497 15.7 % Late charges and administrative fees 23 857 19 197 24.3 % 47 694 39 245 21.5 % Total revenues 788 938 680 542 15.9 % 1 538 208 1 327 742 15.9 % Direct cost of operations (a): Property taxes 71 227 67 484 5.5 % 141 231 134 266 5.2 % On-site property manager payroll 29 531 25 650 15.1 % 60 231 54 394 10.7 % Repairs and maintenance 13 255 13 107 1.1 % 28 745 26 128 10.0 % Utilities 10 143 9 379 8.1 % 21 589 20 175 7.0 % Marketing 8 648 6 863 26.0 % 19 888 21 473 (7.4 )% Other direct property costs 20 253 18 311 10.6 % 40 319 36 675 9.9 % Total direct cost of operations 153 057 140 794 8.7 % 312 003 293 111 6.4 % Direct net operating income (b) 635 881 539 748 17.8 % 1 226 205 1 034 631 18.5 % Indirect cost of operations (a): Supervisory payroll (8 739 ) (9 214 ) (5.2 )% (18 306 ) (19 544 ) (6.3 )% Centralized management costs (14 767 ) (13 091 ) 12.8 % (30 324 ) (26 328 ) 15.2 % Share-based compensation (3 768 ) (4 554 ) (17.3 )% (7 627 ) (10 089 ) (24.4 )% Net operating income (c) $ 608 607 $ 512 889 18.7 % $ 1 169 948 $ 978 670 19.5 % Gross margin (before indirect costs  depreciation and amortization expense) 80.6% 79.3% 1.6 % 79.7% 77.9% 2.3 % Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense) 77.1% 75.4% 2.3 % 76.1% 73.7% 3.3 % Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy 95.8% 97.0% (1.2 )% 95.7% 96.3% (0.6 )% Realized annual rental income per (d): Occupied square foot $ 21.37 $ 18.23 17.2 % $ 20.83 $ 17.89 16.4 % Available square foot $ 20.47 $ 17.69 15.7 % $ 19.94 $ 17.23 15.7 % At June 30: Square foot occupancy 94.8% 96.5% (1.8 )% Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (e) $ 21.92 $ 18.67 17.4 %(a) Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales and expenses generated at the facilities. (b) Direct net operating income (“Direct NOI”)  a subtotal within NOI  is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll  centralized management costs  and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors. (c) See attached reconciliation of self-storage NOI to net income. (d) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency  and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition  the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts  which reduce rental income. (e) Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in  and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis  such as late charges and administrative fees  does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts  and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.Property Operations – Non-Same Store FacilitiesIn addition to the 2 282 Same Store Facilities  we have 525 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies  revenues  or cost of operations since January 1  2020 or that we did not own as of January 1  2020  including 314 facilities that were acquired  54 newly developed facilities  91 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion  and 66 facilities that are unstabilized because they are under fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively  the “Non-Same Store Facilities”). Operating data  metrics  and further commentary with respect to these facilities  including detail by vintage  are included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under “Analysis of Net Income – Self-Storage Operations” in our June 30  2022 Form 10-Q.Investing and Capital ActivitiesDuring the three months ended June 30  2022  we acquired ten self-storage facilities (two each in North Carolina and Texas  and one each in Colorado  Florida  Georgia  Maryland  Oregon  and Tennessee) with 0.7 million net rentable square feet for $123.6 million. During the six months ended June 30  2022  we acquired 20 self-storage facilities (five in Texas  three in North Carolina  two in Maryland  and one each in Arizona  Colorado  Florida  Georgia  Indiana  Minnesota  Nevada  Oregon  Pennsylvania  and Tennessee) with 1.5 million net rentable square feet for $251.3 million.Subsequent to June 30  2022  we acquired or were under contract to acquire 24 self-storage facilities across ten states with 1.7 million net rentable square feet  for $257.4 million. Additionally  on July 8  2022  we acquired the commercial interests of PS Business Parks  Inc. (“PSB”) at three sites  totaling five properties  jointly occupied with our self-storage facilities located in Maryland and Virginia  for $47 million.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of ezStorage for $1.8 billion  which includes 47 self-storage facilities and a property that was under construction. These facilities generated revenues of $48.7 million  NOI of $38.3 million (including Direct NOI of $39.7 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 89.7% for the six months ended June 30  2022.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of All Storage for $1.5 billion  with 55 properties closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and one property closed in February 2022. These facilities generated revenues of $35.2 million  NOI of $21.4 million (including Direct NOI of $22.8 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 78.4% for the six months ended June 30  2022.During the three months ended June 30  2022  we completed various expansion projects (0.3 million net rentable square feet – 0.2 million in Minnesota and 0.1 million in Florida) costing $36.9 million. During six months ended June 30  2022  we completed various expansion projects (0.4 million net rentable square feet – 0.2 million in Minnesota  0.1 million in Florida and 0.1 million in other states) costing $56.3 million. At June 30  2022  we had various facilities in development (2.6 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $480.3 million and various expansion projects (2.8 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $547.0 million. Our aggregate 5.4 million net rentable square foot pipeline of development and expansion facilities includes 1.6 million in California  0.7 million in Texas  0.6 million in Florida  0.5 million in Maryland  0.3 million Washington  0.2 million each in Hawaii  Michigan  Nevada  New Jersey  and New York  and 0.7 million in other states. The remaining $647.3 million of development costs for these projects is expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months.On April 24  2022  PSB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate (""Blackstone"") agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of PSB's common stock for $187.50 per share in cash. On July 20  2022  PSB announced that it completed the merger transaction with Blackstone. Each share of PSB common stock and each common unit of partnership interest we held in PSB were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $187.50 per share or unit and a $0.22 prorated quarterly cash dividend per share or unit  for a total of $187.72 per share or unit. At the close of the merger transaction  we received a total of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and recognized a $2.1 billion gain on the sale of our equity investment in PSB in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the third quarter of 2022.In connection with the sale of our equity investment in PSB  on July 22  2022  our Board of Trustees declared a special cash dividend of $13.15 per common share. The special dividend is payable on August 4  2022 to shareholders of record as of August 1  2022.On July 26  2022  the Company called for redemption on August 15  2022 its 2.370% Senior Notes  with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $500.0 million  due September 15  2022.Distributions DeclaredOn August 3  2022  our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $2.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on September 29  2022 to shareholders of record as of September 14  2022.Outlook for the Year Ending December 31  2022The following table outlines the Company’s Core FFO per share estimate and certain underlying assumptions for the year ending December 31  2022  including estimates for the impact of the sale of our investment in PSB to Blackstone on July 20  2022:Guidance Ranges for 2022 Low High (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Same Store: Revenue growth 12.00% 15.00% Expense growth 6.00% 8.00% Net operating income growth 13.40% 18.00% Acquisitions $1 000 000 Development openings $250 000 Non-Same Store net operating income $480 000 $500 000 Ancillary net operating income $155 000 $160 000 General and administrative expense $105 000 $111 000 Interest expense $133 000 Preferred dividends $195 000 Capital expenditures $300 000 Core FFO per share (before the impact of the sale of PSB) $15.22 $15.92 Impact of the sale of PSB (0.22) (0.22) Core FFO per share $15.00 $15.70 Incremental Non-Same Store NOI to stabilization (2023 and beyond) $172 000Forward-looking Core FFO per share measures exclude estimates for the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other significant non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items such as loss contingency accruals  casualties  transactional due diligence  and advisory costs. Public Storage is unable to provide a reconciliation of Core FFO per share guidance measures to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future U.S. GAAP results.Second Quarter Conference CallA conference call is scheduled for August 5  2022 at 9:00 a.m. (PDT) to discuss the second quarter earnings results.

National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and  along with the non-GAAP measure FAD  are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. FFO represents GAAP net income before depreciation and amortization  real estate gains or losses and impairment charges  which are excluded because they are based upon historical costs and assume that building values diminish ratably over time  while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FAD represents FFO adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges and to deduct capital expenditures. We utilize FAD in evaluating our ongoing cash flow available for investment  debt repayment and common distributions. We believe investors and analysts utilize FAD in a similar manner. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO and FAD are not substitutes for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends  because they exclude investing and financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition  other REITs may compute these measures differently  so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Reconciliation of Self-Storage Net Operating Income to Net Income (Unaudited – amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended June 30  Six Months Ended June 30  2022 2021 2022 2021 Self-storage revenues for: Same Store Facilities $ 788 938 $ 680 542 $ 1 538 208 $ 1 327 742 Acquired facilities 95 498 32 372 181 869 43 495 Newly developed and expanded facilities 65 899 46 214 125 975 87 691 Other non-same store facilities 22 951 17 865 44 249 34 412 Self-storage revenues 973 286 776 993 1 890 301 1 493 340 Self-storage cost of operations for: Same Store Facilities 180 331 167 653 368 260 349 072 Acquired facilities 32 860 11 961 63 891 19 138 Newly developed and expanded facilities 19 304 17 300 38 721 34 635 Other non-same store facilities 5 494 5 681 12 611 11 855 Self-storage cost of operations 237 989 202 595 483 483 414 700 Self-storage NOI for: Same Store Facilities 608 607 512 889 1 169 948 978 670 Acquired facilities 62 638 20 411 117 978 24 357 Newly developed and expanded facilities 46 595 28 914 87 254 53 056 Other non-same store facilities 17 457 12 184 31 638 22 557 Self-storage NOI (a) 735 297 574 398 1 406 818 1 078 640 Ancillary revenues 58 759 52 322 115 189 103 237 Ancillary cost of operations (17 210 ) (15 991 ) (32 725 ) (32 309 ) Depreciation and amortization (218 708 ) (172 728 ) (440 836 ) (319 587 ) General and administrative expense (28 831 ) (27 740 ) (51 900 ) (47 314 ) Interest and other income 10 279 3 113 13 658 5 965 Interest expense (32 941 ) (21 994 ) (66 065 ) (37 244 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities 48 525 29 066 91 949 48 522 Gain on sale of real estate — 3 991 — 13 404 Foreign currency exchange gain (loss) 101 723 (12 707 ) 137 100 32 678 Net income on our income statement $ 656 893 $ 411 730 $ 1 173 188 $ 845 992",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.02,positive,0.95,0.04,0.01,True,English,"['Public Storage Reports Results', 'Six Months', 'Three', 'Same Store direct net operating income margin', 'site property manager payroll expense', '0.7 million net rentable square feet', '1.7 million net rentable square feet', '0.3 million net rentable square feet', '5.4 million net rentable square feet', 'other direct property costs', 'higher realized annual rent', 'self-storage net operating income', 'foreign currency exchange gains', 'unconsolidated real estate entities', 'available square foot', 'property tax expense', 'centralized management costs', 'non-same store portfolios', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'digital customer experience', 'multi-factor external growth', 'Euro denominated notes', 'ten self-storage facilities', 'Non-Same Store Facilities', 'balance sheet strength', 'Same Store revenues', 'Public Storage team', 'net income', 'various expansion projects', 'diluted common share', 'operating strength', '24 self-storage facilities', 'operating results', 'various facilities', 'same period', 'amortization expense', 'interest expense', 'marketing expense', '$160.9 million increase', '$114.4 million increase', '$21.1 million increase', '$46.0 million increase', '$10.9 million increase', '$95.7 million increase', '$65.2 million increase', '$328.2 million increase', '$104.4 million increase', '$44.7 million increase', '$121.2 million increase', '$28.8 million increase', '$191.3 million increase', '$136.9 million increase', 'common shareholders', '$17.0 million decrease', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'six months', 'strong performance', 'back half', 'Joe Russell', '50th Anniversary', 'exceptional performance', 'industry-leading platform', 'core FFO', 'equity share', 'preferred shareholders', 'preferred shares', 'Three Months', '15.9% increase', 'GLENDALE', 'Calif.', 'NYSE', 'PSA', 'quarter', 'outlook', 'year', 'President', 'future', 'Highlights', 'June', 'contract', 'development', 'sale', 'allocations', 'respect', 'redemption', 'depreciation', 'operations', 'impact', 'fill-up']",2022-08-04,2022-08-05,businesswire.com

Good morning  everyone and thank you for joining us today.I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.32. The 14% increase year-over-year  marking the best second quarter in our company's history  and is on top of 12% growth in the second quarter of 2021. Net revenues totaled $1.8 billion  an increase of 8% versus last year  driven by a balanced contribution from both our diversified transaction revenues and our recurring revenues  which account for over half of our business and increased by 8% versus last year.Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million and were at the low end of our guidance range versus the midpoint of our guide  second quarter expenses benefited from favorable FX  various expense efficiencies and lower variable costs  particularly customer acquisition costs and our listings business.Moving to the full year  we're lowering our expense guidance to a range of $2.97 billion to $2.99 billion midpoint to midpoint this represents a reduction of $35 million versus our prior guidance and similar to our second quarter results is driven by expense efficiencies  lower variable costs and favorable FX.Second quarter adjusted operating income increased by 14% to $1.1 billion their adjusted operating margin expanding to 59%.Moving to the balance sheet  shortly after we reported our first quarter results in May  we took the opportunity to raise $8 billion in new SR notes. We used 3 billion of these proceeds to refinance our 2022 and 2023 maturities and along with the proceeds from our sale of Euroclear reduced our commercial paper balances to zero with no maturities until the middle of 2025  we enter the second half of the balance sheet that is well positioned and it's an exceptionally volatile interest rate environment.The remaining $5 billion of proceeds raised in May  is earmarked to fund a portion of our announced acquisition of Black Knight based on a favorable rates that we've secured on these long-term notes  and the current forward rate expectations for both our commercial paper and term loan  we anticipate we will be well within our targeted 4% to 4.5% cost of debt financing for the transaction. It is also worth noting that alongside the financing in May  we maintained our A minus and A3 pre-acquisition ratings from both S&P and Moody's.Now let's move to Slide five  to provide an overview of the performance of our exchange segment. Second quarter exchange net revenues totaling $1 billion  an increase of 13% year-over-year  this strong performance was driven by an 80% increase in our interest rate futures  and that's 36% increase in our equity derivatives revenues. Importantly  total open interest  which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth  and in July up 11% versus the end of last year  including 6% growth in energy and 21% growth across our financial futures and options complex.Second quarter cash equities and equity options revenue increased by 17% year-over-year  and in July  we successfully migrated the NYCE Arca Options platform to our new pillar technology  while continuing to seamlessly process record message volume  a testament to our team's hard work and our broader technology expertise.Exchange recurring revenues increased by 7% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand in our energy exchange data continued benefit from our record 2021 listings performance and a one-time accrual in our listings business that we do not expect will reoccur in the second half.Turning now to Slide six. In our fixed income and data services segment  second quarter revenue totaled a record $512 million a 13% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 78%  including 85% growth in ICE bonds  and 76% growth in our CDS clearing business. This strong growth was driven in part by customers re-engaging and allocating more capital to CDS trading  as well as our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity through our bond platforms  where we're seeing market share gains and our municipal bond business.Recurring revenue growth  which accounted for over 80% of segment revenues grew 5% in the quarter and was once again driven by strength in our consolidated fees business as well as continued growth in the ICE global network.Looking to the second half  we expect year-over-year growth in our recurring revenues to continue supported by an ASD that interest in the third quarter up over 5% year-over-year. And in that second half as reported recurring revenues  we flat to slightly up versus our first half results driven by your Euronext data center migration which was included in our original guidance and $10 million of additional FX headwinds.Shifting to mortgage technology on Slide seven. Second quarter revenues totaled $297 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for over half of the segment revenues and totaled $160 million in the quarter increased 18% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes. While the current macroeconomic backdrop is challenging for a number of our customers is also presented an opportunity to have more constructive conversations around efficiency and automation across the mortgage origination workflow.It's worth noting that second quarter unit origination volumes were similar to those in the second quarter of 2019. However  second quarter 2022 revenues in our mortgage technology business were over $100 million greater or up almost 60% when compared to pro forma revenues in 2Q ‘19. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth and customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow.I'll conclude on Slide eight. To the first half of the year  we've grown total ICE revenue by 7% adjusted operating income by 11%  including 200 basis points of margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share by 12%  representing the best first half in our history. In addition  we've positioned our balance sheet for the acquisition of Black Knight while also growing our dividend and continuing to invest in future growth. As we look to the balance of the year  we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us  and we remain focused on creating value for our stockholders.With that  I'll hand it over to Ben.Ben JacksonThank you  Warren. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide nine.Rising inflation has created an interest rate environment  many of our customers have not navigated in over a decade. Meanwhile  the continued war in Ukraine has triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain  creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants. Importantly  we remain focused on connecting customers to our leading technology  mission critical data  and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions.In our interest rate markets  we've seen record year-to-date volumes in our your [indiscernible] contract as customers increasingly seek to manage risks associated with rising rates and central bank activity across Europe and the U.K. This heightened risk has also contributed to strength in our equity derivatives complex  driving an 18% increase in volumes year-to-date.Across our global energy markets  customers are navigating supply uncertainty alongside longer term Clean Energy Transition priorities. This will continue to introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets  which should drive greater demand for risk management. And it is our diverse global energy markets that provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools customers need to navigate both the near-term and long-term complexities.Globalization of gas and the clean energy transition are trends that have contributed to the 43% average annual volume growth in our TTF gas business over the past five years  driving TTF to emerge as a global gas benchmark.Through the first half of this year  as a result of the Russia Ukraine conflict  global gas markets have tightened significantly  increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas in an uncertain geopolitical environment. This volatility and uncertainty has driven our global gas volumes increased 31% year-to-date  including 49% growth in our North American gas business in the second quarter. Commercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk  as evidenced by the record share in open interest we've achieved in our Henry Hub contract  surpassing 50% for the first time ever. Because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America  Europe and Asia  we are well positioned to benefit from both the near- term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets.Despite these global energy concerns  governments  corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such  valuing externalities such as placing a price on pollution  carbon free electricity  and carbon sequestration and storage will continue to increase in importance. ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle  including renewable fuel contracts  carbon allowances  nature-based solutions  and renewable energy certificates.The breadth of our complex  coupled with the growing importance of carbon price transparency  has contributed to the 19% average annual volume growth in our environmental complex over the past five years.As the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities  uncertainties and volatility to energy markets  our global environmental alongside our gas and oil complexes will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks.Turning now to our mortgage business. I first want to touch on our pending acquisition of Black Knight as announced on May 4 of this year. As we said  when we made our announcement back then we continued to believe the transaction will close during the first half of 2023. Since the announcement  and in accordance with our initial expected timeline  we have submitted the necessary regulatory filings. We are working with the FTC as they perform their thoughtful and comprehensive reviews of the proposed transaction.Out of respect for the FTC is important work on this matter as we work with them toward regulatory approval  we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly  we remain very excited about the efficiencies that combined entities will bring to the end consumer and other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem.As interest rates rise  and mortgage origination volumes soften from recent record levels  our customers continue to turn to our mission critical technology to operate more efficiently. In the second quarter  we once again grew recurring revenues and outperformed the broader industry.Our focus during these evolving market conditions is first and foremost  our customer. Customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation and we continued to work with our customers to find the most efficient ways they can benefit from the breadth of offerings across our network.For example  we recently made the decision to offer interested customers our base eCO solution included in an Encompass subscription  making it easier and cheaper for customers to adopt and benefit from the efficiencies from an electronic closing.To focus on efficiencies has also led to increased interest in our data and analytics products  leveraging machine learning technology  our analytics platform automates the steps in the loan manufacturing process  and can save lenders 1000s of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity.Year-to-date  our data analytics business  which is made up largely of recurring revenues  has grown 21% year-over-year  we continue to see increased adoption of our analytics and new customers coming onto the platform  with a host of new clients added this year alone represented the likes of Chase  a number of leading independent mortgage bankers  and a top three home builder.We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders  and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff SprecherThank you  Ben. Good morning  everyone. And thank you for joining us.Please turn to Slide 10. The first half of the year has been marked by rising inflation  rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers are navigating evolving risks and continued to rely on our data  technology and liquid markets to manage these risks.In the second quarter  we once again grew revenues  grew adjusted operating income  and grew adjusted earnings per share these record setting second quarter results reflect the strength of our network and the all weather nature of our business model.Our strategy has always been to find unique and novel ways to apply data and technology to bring efficiencies and transparency to markets whether it was moving energy trading to the screen  clearing OTC swaps  modernizing the technology powering the U.S. equity markets  or building datasets for the opaque fixed income markets. As we've grown and diversified  we've broadened our opportunity set and our expertise has grown  providing new markets to grow into  and importantly  new ways to provide innovative solutions to customers.We've leveraged our leading pricing and reference data to build new tools for the front office. We've married our fixed income data to newly expanded climate capabilities. And more recently  we've combined our expertise in futures contract construction  with our index capabilities  and with our unique mortgage data to launch both the ICE mortgage rate lock index and its associated futures contract. These are just a few examples of the innovation that we can deliver with our expanded technology  datasets and expertise.Our evolution has been intentional  diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues with the goal of building a business that today generates compounding earnings growth. It's how we've grown our adjusted earnings per share for the past 15 years in every year that we've been a public company. The net result of our compounding earnings growth is the compounding growth in our dividend  which we've grown double digits each year on average since we initiated it in 2013 and which we also grew 15% in this quarter.Looking now to the second half of the year and beyond  we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us. And we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers while driving compounding growth for our stockholders.I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and their trust and I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter  following on the heels of our best first quarter  making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company.With that  I'll now turn the call back to our moderator Victoria  and will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. We will now start our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Rich Repetto at Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Rich RepettoGood morning  Jeff and Ben and Warren. It's unfortunate  we can't get any comments on the Black Knight acquisition  because that's certainly on everybody's mind. But anyway  I'll ask about fixed income. Ben  you saw probably a nice uptick in fixed income execution  I think it's up 85% up 10 million  just quarter-over-quarter. And I would suspect that's just the retail  your retail complex [muni] [ph] picking up? And then one other question related to fixed income  the recurring revenues went down quarter-to-quarter just by a million  I suspect that's currency  but just wanted to get some clarification there as well.Jeff SprecherHi  Rich. I'm going to hand it over to Lynn to go through this.Lynn MartinHi  Rich. Thanks for the question. You're right that we saw strong growth in our fixed income trading business this quarter. And as mentioned in our prepared remarks that was driven off of strengthened our muni trading business. And while volatility and the return of retail has certainly been a contributor  we're seeing our institutional efforts pay off. As you are aware over the last two years  we really focused on leveraging our market leading assets in the muni ecosystem  including our data assets and our index business  which now serves as the benchmark for more than 60% of the AUM in this area to build out the infrastructure to connect the institutional market to our muni execution platforms. And in this quarter alone  we're seeing the benefits of that work manifest itself. And that institutional share within our muni execution platforms has doubled since 2020  enabling us to take share in the broader muni market. And finally  it's worth noting that our institutional business in munis has grown 250%  year-over-year  a further sign that we're gaining share in this asset class.Warren GardinerAnd then  Rich  its Warren on your question on the recurring revenues. You're right. That's FX  largely FX  there's also a little bit of AUM related revenue in our ETF business. So as we saw during the quarter people shifting into treasuries and out of equities  and some of the credit focused ETFs. There's lower economics on those treasury ETFs that we bent that track our benchmarks and so that was a little bit of a mix shift impact for us as well within the AUM portion of the index. The rest of the index business did really well during the quarter up double digits. Again  some of the subscription revenue  pure subscription revenue  if you will  in there. So really just kind of the macro dynamics taking hold there that why you saw that slight sequential decline.Rich RepettoGot it. Thanks for the update.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm at UBS. Please go ahead.Alex KrammYes. Hey  good morning. Lots of info you gave already on the mortgage side. But we'd like to dig a little bit deeper in particular on the recurring side. So few questions here. One I don't know if you gave an update to the recurring revenue guide for that segment that would be interested if that's still unchanged  but then more importantly  I think you mentioned that even like some of the challenges in the end markets you are seeing some bankruptcies  et cetera. So maybe you could give us an update what you're seeing in terms of customer losses  and maybe remind us how the revenue model is if there's any receipts  et cetera.And then  sorry  lastly  maybe give us a little bit of the algorithm of growth that you've seen so far in the recurring revenues year-to-date between customer losses  but then also some of the upsells that you guys were talking about earlier. And then  also this continued shift to moving the contract terms to more recurring  so I know that's a mouthful  but hopefully I get out of it.Ben JacksonYes  that's a lot Alex. This is Ben. I'll start and Warren will also I'm sure add in here. So in terms of  I'll start with this  just the overall challenges in the environment. If you take a step back  and you look at what we're building  we're building a business here that in mortgage whether a number of different market environments with an eye towards an 8% to 10% growth over the long-haul. And why are we confident in our ability to do that is the reasons are one we have absolutely mission critical software for these clients that we're providing. We have long-term contracts with our clients  four to five years of the high amount of retention in them. And we are heavily focused  as you've seen in our results  on shifting the revenue to more and more towards recurring. And we did it again this quarter  on the backdrop of 40% down market in terms of volumes  with 18% year-over-year recurring revenue growth in the business.The other Proofpoint  you've seen in terms of being able to weather various market environments is our data analytics line item. With that being up 36% last quarter alone. And one of the key inputs and drivers to that is our AIQ and analyzer solutions  we're seeing tremendous uptake in that we're seeing clients now more than ever just looking to adopt automation to automate as much of the workflow as possible to lower their costs.And the other proof point I put out  there was a comment Warren made in his prepared remarks  in that if you look at Q2 of 2019  very similar volume environment to what we saw in this past quarter  we generated more than $100 million of revenue on a pro forma basis. And that's  what enables us to do as we do time studies  with our clients  and clients that adopt our full automation suite  we see are saving anywhere from 570 to $1 400 per loan that they're manufacturing when they adopt our solutions. So our ability to capture some benefit from that from the efficiencies that we're providing to the industry has been tremendous.In terms of the algorithm of growth  on recurring revenue  it's really -- it's a mix that we've described before  it's a mix of  there is some pricing in there  there is sales to new clients. So I mentioned  we had a good start of the year for sales on Encompass. We've had a good sales for the year on our AIQ business. And then also the other input is that shift as customers are renewing that shift of -- even if we have to forego some transaction revenue of moving more to subscription  we're continuing to do that  and have a lot of success. And we're still early days  we're really in the first year of a codified program to do that. And with contracts with clients going four to five years in the future we have a long runway to go.Warren GardinerAlex  this is Warren  you asked about the guidance. So yes  you're correct. There's no change to the guidance that we gave to start the year. We did assume  as we said back then that there will be some headwinds from people potentially going out of business or maybe not as many new market participants  I'll say I'm highly confident that to the extent that starts to play out  that's going to be a cyclical trend  not a secular one  because I think if you think about the process for and this is reiterating what Ben just said  we think about the rest of getting a mortgage  it continues to be very costly for the consumer  it's very inefficient. And we have the tools that are -- building the tools that are really solving those problems. And so I know that probably doesn't help  solve for 2022  EPS or 2023 EPS  but it should really factor into kind of the multiple people are thinking about when you're valuing the overall enterprise at the end of the day.Alex KrammSo you haven't seen a lot of impact from cancellations at this point  just to clarify.Ben JacksonHey  Alex. It's Ben again. So we have seen a small  small number of lenders that have had some challenges and potentially go out of business  but it's a very small number that we've seen so far.Alex KrammVery good. Thank you.OperatorPerfect. Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtHi  good morning. So last quarter  you spoke about energy traders moving away from using futures and towards options at least for oil specifically  just given the decline in oil futures open interest throughout 2Q it seemed like that trend may have continued. Just wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing from commodity trading firms right now trying to manage risk in an extremely volatile environment. Because I guess given the volatility  we've seen the market  it's a bit surprising to see energy volumes only up 3% in the second quarter and now seemingly kind of trending lower year-on-year into the third quarter. Thank you.Ben JacksonHey  Kyle  it's Ben. So you have a -- we have a confluence of issues that are going on around the world that are really unprecedented. And against that backdrop  we're pleased that our overall  our overall futures business is up for year-over-year in terms of open interest and since the end of the year  and our energy businesses up in open interest since the end of the year  given all of these events. And what are we looking at  we're looking at an inflationary environment  we're looking at a recession  you've got in particular in Europe  governments in Europe  have to figure out the balance between sanctions against Russia  the impact of those sanctions against their civilians  in terms of near-term price impact on energy  and move towards cleaner energy.So you've got this pothole mix and then you also have in China continued COVID lockdowns that are happening  and obviously geopolitical tensions happening with China.So given all those issues  we believe that our marketplace has been set up as best as can be in the in the world to help clients navigate through all of these events  and they're utilizing us to do that. And I'll give a few examples. So first  we have one of the most deep and liquid markets across that energy spectrum. So think of oil  gas  LNG  power and environmentals. So as clients are looking to move and switch between fuels  looking towards  moving towards a cleaner environment  we are the exchange and clearing businesses that they're going to do that.Second  in managing global supply shocks  you have deep -- we have deep liquid global markets in each of those respective asset classes that I mentioned with oil  gas  LNG  power  and environmentals and enable customers because we have all these deep liquid points at the points of production and consumption  as clients need to hedge their risks using different risk management tools. We're very well positioned to do that. And a perfect example is right now with Russia  stifling gas supplies going into Europe  we are seeing U.S. step in and U.S. providing natural gas via LNG cargos going into Northern Europe.And given that we are the home to the vast majority of commercial traders  that trade our U.S. gas products  both Henry Hub and our bases markets  we're seeing clients use that to hedge those cargos. And it's one of the inputs that's led to what I mentioned in my prepared remarks of the record we've seen in market share from a Henry Hub perspective  as well as a North American gas and at a highest well in the global gas complex.The third thing I'd point out is that we're engaged as much as ever with clients and governments around the world around the sanctions and as they're taking shape. And there's no question it had some impact  as there was uncertainty as to how issues would play out in products like gas and oil  where Russian fuel oil is an input into that historically  as governments have made it clear that as of February of 23  Russian fuel oil will no longer be provided  it no longer be consumed in Europe  we've changed the specification on our gas oil contract. And now we started to see open interest in volume starting to build again in gas oil  calendar 23 and beyond.And then you pointed out  our deep liquid options market. So options is clearly one of the most efficient ways to hedge geopolitical tail risk because it helps to hedge a number of different scenarios that could play out and embrace our volume in open or volume in Brent options  year-over-year is up 25%. So when you look at me stand your lens and look at the overall energy complex. We feel really good about how we're positioned.Kyle VoigtThank you so much.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Craig SiegenthalerHey  good morning  everyone. So my question is on mortgage tech origination revenues were down not that surprising. But you help us with some perspective on incremental downside from current levels. And also  in terms of timing  when should we think these revenues will stabilize? And any perspective on that relative to what rates are doing would be helpful too?Ben JacksonHey  Craig  it's Ben  I'll start. So basically reiterate some of the things that I said before  when you widen out what our strategy is  within the mortgage and mortgage technology business  our strategy here has been to move more and more of the revenue towards recurring to take some of that cyclicality out of the business and we continue to do that. And we've been successfully doing that.In terms of predicting the rate environment and how that's going to play out just look at how the rate environments played out over the last week  it's been extraordinarily hard for to see and be able to predict when that this volume environment and stuff will settle down. But despite that  we're going to continue to make investments in the innovation that we're providing to our clients. As we mentioned  a lot of the investments that we made is what fueled that $100 million growth that we saw over the last three years in a similar environment to what we had in 2019. Those are investments -- those investments are in and around everything that we've been doing in the closing side  our simple file business continues to gain market share and do very well. And then all of the innovation that we've been introducing on the data and analytics side with our AIQ platform  as well as the automation of the underwrite platform  we see that those are all tailwinds that regardless of the rate environment and the volume environment that our growth drivers for us.Jeff SprecherAnd this is Jeff  let me just mention that a lot of our mortgage strategy is driven by the fact that we're trying to really position the company to be an all weather named that in all interest rate and macroeconomic environments that I can continue to end my prepared remarks on the same page that shows a graph of compounding earnings growth  for shareholders. And having a U.S. mortgage strategy gives us exposure we own LIBOR  which is the London Interbank index we trade U.K. and EU interest rate futures. We have a credit default swap business that is completely global that includes Russian sovereign  hedging and companies across the globe.We have a fixed income business that is truly global  we provide pricing data in almost every single country that has bond issuance. And we were relatively thin on having exposure to U.S. interest rates  and moving into mortgage gives us that.I also think  when we step back and look at the mortgage complex  the U.S. mortgage complex  and the way we're building the business  is that there is a demographic of millennials  that is huge  that are underserved by homeownership. And there's been supply chain issues during COVID to meet housing. And we generally believe that that any house that gets built will be sold and that there will be a mortgage on it  and that the supply chain issues are getting better and that the underperformance of building is increasing.We also have seen from our limited ownership of having mortgage assets that cash out refinancings happen when the value of homes go up  and which is an inflationary input. And the one that I think a lot of people and maybe is at the root of your question focus on is the absolute interest rate  which leads to people refinancing in a declining interest rate market.Long story short is there are a number of inputs into the housing market. We want to have exposure to the U.S. interest rate environment. It's going to help plus built in all weather name. And even with a downturn in the number of U.S. mortgages  we've had the best second quarter in our company's history.Craig SiegenthalerGreat. Thanks for taking my question.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Brian BedellGreat. Thanks. Good morning  folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just a two-parter on the environmental initiatives. So maybe Ben  if you could just comment on within the energy complex  obviously  we're seeing very good strength in that gas. We did see a couple quarters now sequential declines in the environmental so the question there is  our customers substituting that gas for some of the environmental versus something else driving on the environmental side short-term? And then  the second part of the question is  if you could comment on this  maybe Lynn  but on the acquisition of Urgentem and the overall climate data strategy  whether you're seeking to get more to grow substantially in that business linking that into the data more heavily into the environmental trading side?Ben JacksonGot it. Thanks  Brian. Yes  I'll start and then I’ll hand it to Lynn for the second part of that. So as I mentioned before  there's this confluences issues going on  in particular in Europe and where we have seen some impacts  so the balance between Russia and sanctions and the impact on the civilians and the move to cleaner energy. In Europe in specifically  we have seen some time and attention from traders that would trade things like our EUA markets  our European Union Allowances  moving and shifting more towards just the acute energy issues that everyone's faced with right now. So we have seen some headwinds in that part.But the flip side of it is in North America  we've had a very strong business continuing to do very  very well. North America is doing well and our Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiatives  our California Carbon Allowances  our renewable fuels  our REC markets  each of these are doing very  very well and we're continuing to invest. So we recently launched Biofuel Contracts they're doing well  we recently launched a global index  a Global Carbon Index Future  as well and we're getting more and more on the index itself we're getting more ETS to license and on futures are starting to develop there. We recently launched Texas Wind and Solar contracts  we recently launched nature-based offset contracts for the voluntary markets.So we see a lot of tailwinds coming in the foreseeable future  and you also have other developments like State of Pennsylvania likely to join Reggie [ph] and Washington State likely to put in their Cap and Trade Program for the first time. So we have a lot of good tailwinds there in North America. And I think what you're seeing in the overall complex is just a wait little bit on the EUA market in Europe.Lynn MartinAnd thanks  Brian  for the follow-up question. So given the strength in our fixed income data  we're uniquely positioned to add transparency around ESG  really focused on the climate risk. Given our ability to tie alternative datasets into datasets that the market knows you've seen us further position this offering. In Q4  we announced the acquisition of risQ and Level 11  which enabled us to execute on the opportunity to turn physical climate data into actionable insights starting with our muni bond service  but more recently expanding into the mortgage-backed securities market. And now we have the ability to offer a parcel level information measured by geographic coordinates in the U.S.  and we plan to expand that globally.And then  finally  as you know we recently announced the purchase of our Gen10  which really expands our climate risk offering to include corporate transition risk  given its coverage of 30 000 public and private companies  which was an attractive dataset to us to add to the climate offering.Brian BedellThat's great color. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your question. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Michael CyprysGreat  thanks so much. Wanted to ask about the commodities franchise  just curious how you guys are thinking about the longer-term growth drivers there  what factors ultimately drive volumes higher in your commodities franchise  is it production of the underlying commodities  for example  some more oil and gas rigs  producing more oil and gas are going to drive volumes higher over the long-term? Just curious how you think about those growth drivers and the algorithm and how is that evolving? Thank you.Ben JacksonThanks  Michael. This is Ben. And the way we think about it is  we need to have as I described earlier  that breadth of offerings of global offerings across the each of the inputs into producing energy is  as the statistics that are out there point to energy consumption doubling between now and 2050. And it's just what are the inputs into the production of that energy are going to change and will change over-time. And we believe with the breadth of offerings that we have across oil  gas  LNG  power and then the significant early start that we had and thinking about the environmental markets with the acquisition of the Climate Exchange over a decade ago  we're very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So that's one input into it.You do have a global focus on the reduction of carbon emissions around the world and as I said before  with our environmental markets  we are very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So those are two. I think the third is that even though we have had some near-term headwinds in some of the products in Europe in particular the ones that have been at the center of this Ukraine  Russia situation we continue to see user growth. So we continue to see more and more users taking data subscriptions and coming onto the platform to get visibility into what's happening in those markets  how those markets correlate  or de-correlate at times to others around the world. So when we look at the underlying health of the market  looking at user growth  looking at open interest and looking at the global breadth of the offerings that we provide to our clients  those are all inputs into our growth outlook [ph].Michael CyprysGreat. Thank you.OperatorThank you for your question. Our final question is a follow-up from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.Rich RepettoYes. Thanks for taking the question. Just one last question on mortgage  and this I think is more for Jeff. In the prepared remarks  it was mentioned about efficiency and automation and how the downturn is maybe emphasizing that more in the mortgage segment. But I guess the question  Jeff is  I think people are really looking for the connection between mortgage and how that can automate overtime as you've done so in other markets. So the question is  how is it comparing given that mortgage has a longer workflow process  but what you are seeing so far in regards to the automation of the market longer term versus the other asset classes you've dealt with?Jeff SprecherSure  that's a great question Rich  because I'm a company founder  I get asked to speak to entrepreneurs from time-to-time and I always tell them  the best time to start a business is when there's a downturn and not that having us moved into this space  you wish a downturn on anybody  but it's very  very hard to get people in finance and I say this broadly  whether it's trading  clearing  data  acquisition it is very  very hard to get people in finance to change their behavior when they're making a lot of money and when things are going well.And the best time to get people to think about making a change is when their businesses are under pressure and Ben alluded to that a number of times in why our subscription revenues are doing well in the mortgage space.Broadly speaking again  I appreciate the question. I know you've followed our company for many years  and you see us putting data and analytic tools into the mortgage market. The mortgage market that we're talking a lot about is the cash market. You've seen us and I mentioned in my prepared remarks  launch our first derivative product against in a new index that we created. And so I think this space has a lot of inefficiencies throughout the entire  not just the manufacturing the mortgage  but the way mortgages are financed and traded and retreated in the secondary market  very poor data available due to the paper based nature of the contract  difficult to regulate for regulate regulators  regulators think that there may be biases in the market  but without the right data  it's very hard to know  it's very hard to correct for the participants in the market  very expensive for consumers  banks that spend a lot of money to court a consumer  tend to lose them when there's a refinancing or a change in that client's behavior.The market is not very thoughtful about keeping connectivity between those that lend and those that borrow and all of that I think is fertile ground for us and may go for decades  honestly as we build out the infrastructure. But at the core  we need a foundation of data and information that borrowers  that lenders and that regulators can all look at and use to make it easier.I think I may have mentioned to you even that  it's odd to me that you can buy a completely consumable good  you can buy toothpaste on an online platform and when you go to checkout it'll ask you if you want to buy now and pay later  knowing that an algorithm underwrote your credit against no collateral and yet  it takes almost two months for somebody to refinance a mortgage in a house that they live in  that has a foundation that's in the ground that has an address that you can see from space that is part of the Maslow's hierarchy of need of safety and security and will be abandoned by that person  the last thing they do. And yet we  an existing mortgage talking to their bank takes two months.It just something is wrong in those equations. And we could argue that by now pay later lending maybe too generous  but certainly 60 days to do work with an existing client than an existing home just feels too long. And that's  that is the challenge that I think we will tackle successfully and put the entire industry on a better footing.Rich RepettoGot it. Thank you. That's helpful.OperatorThank you for your question. We have received a follow up from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead.Kyle VoigtThanks for taking my follow up. So a question on the OTC and other revenue line in the exchange segment was quite strong in the quarter. I just want to confirm that the increase that we saw there was really driven by collateral fees that ICE is clearing house or is there something else that was driving that? And can you remind us if those collateral fees are entirely fixed basis point fees  or if there is or will be any benefit from rate hikes we've seen in the U.S. and EU?Warren GardinerSo hey  Kyle  it's Warren. So in terms of the OTC and other yes  you're correct that the performance there has been collateral driven that's largely from net interest income or earning at ICE Future or ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Europe and so as collateral bounces move around and you've seen that over the course of this year. That's obviously going to benefit that particular line item.In terms of rates moving higher  we do have a benefit from that that's going to show up there more on -- will show up on the CDS clearing side because we do park some collateral funds there as a Fed. And so we do get a benefit as collateral moves up  but then also as Fed funds rates move up there and so that's part of the strong performance you've seen in CDS there. So  not in that OTC and other line but in the spirit of your question  yes  that there's a benefit from better rate hikes coming through over-time.Kyle VoigtUnderstood. Thanks.OperatorThank you for your question  Kyle. This concludes our Q&A session. And now I'd like to pass over to Chair CEO  Jeff Sprecher for any final remarks.Jeff SprecherThank you  Victoria. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me again thank my colleagues for delivering yet another record quarter and we very much appreciate and want to say thank you to our customers for putting your faith in us during the quarter. We'll look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to execute on these exciting growth opportunities that we mentioned on the call.

Enrolment of patients can be initiated for the two induction studies and subsequently for the maintenance trial. Patients and caregivers urgently need alternative therapeutic options for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The obefazimod phase 2b study provides compelling long-term efficacy data demonstrating potential for obefazimod to substantially and durably improve the lives of UC patients in the US and worldwide. Abivax is confident that the phase 3 studies will confirm the positive and promising results of the phase 2a and 2b induction and maintenance trials.1""Story continuesAnd Didier Blondel  CFO of Abivax  added: ""We are pursuing several options for extending our cash runway beyond end of September 2022  taking into account the current fundraising environment for biotech companies.

Importantly  with our world-class intellectual property focused on allogeneic CAR T technology  we have multiple opportunities for partnerships with peers in the industry ” commented Michel Lussier  interim Chief Executive Officer of Celyad Oncology. “We also were proud to recently announce that the FDA lifted the clinical hold on our CYAD-101 program. In addition  we look forward to the upcoming data read out for CYAD-211 in the second half of 2022. We are truly ushering in a new chapter for Celyad Oncology by unlocking the potential of not only our product candidates  but also our portfolio of IP  technology  and overall expertise in cell therapy.”Second Quarter 2022 and Recent Business HighlightsThe Board of Directors named Hilde Windels as Chair of the Board of DirectorsMichel Lussier named Interim Chief Executive Officer of the CompanyPipeline and Business UpdatesCYAD-211 – Allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T for r/r MMStory continuesCYAD-211 is an investigational  short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based allogeneic CAR T candidate for the treatment of r/r MM. CYAD-211 is engineered to co-express a B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) targeting CAR and a single shRNA  which interferes with the expression of the CD3ζ component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex.Preliminary data reported in December 2021 from the dose-escalation segment of the IMMUNICY-1 Phase 1 trial evaluating CYAD-211 following cyclophosphamide/fludarabine (CyFlu) preconditioning chemotherapy in patients with r/r MM showed evidence of clinical activity with a good tolerability profile including no evidence of Graft versus Host Disease. In addition  all patients in the trial had detectable CYAD-211 cells in the peripheral blood.Enrollment is currently ongoing in the IMMUNICY-1 Phase 1 trial to evaluate enhanced lymphodepletion (eLD) and increased CYAD-211 doses with the aim to improve cell persistence and potentially maximize the clinical benefit of CYAD-211. The IMMUNICY-1 protocol also allows for CYAD-211 redosing in certain patients.Additional data updates from the eLD cohorts of the Phase 1 IMMUNICY-1 trial of CYAD-211 for r/r MM are expected during second half of 2022.CYAD-101 – Allogeneic TIM-based NKG2D CAR T for mCRCCYAD-101 is an investigational  non-gene edited  allogeneic CAR T candidate engineered to co-expresses the TIM peptide alongside a CAR based on NKG2D  a receptor expressed on natural killer (NK) and T cells  that binds to eight stress-induced ligands.In June 2022 we submitted our complete response to the clinical hold of the CYAD-101-002 phase 1b trial to the FDA stating our intent to amend the eligibility criteria to exclude patients who have bilateral lung metastases and patients who have received treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting monoclonal antibodies within the previous 9 months prior to trial recruitment. In July 2022  based on that complete response  we received notification that the FDA lifted the clinical hold on the CYAD-101-002 phase 1b trialshARC PlatformDiscovery research continues on programs focused on the co-expression of Interleukin-18 in conjunction with our short hairpin RNA shRNA technology platform  also known as our shARC (shRNA Armored CAR) franchise  with a focus on the development of next-generation  allogeneic CAR T candidates.CYAD-02 – Autologous NKG2D CAR-T for r/r AML and MDSCYAD-02 is an investigational  autologous CAR T therapy that co-expresses both the NKG2D CAR and a single shRNA targeting the NKG2D ligands MICA/MICB on the CAR T cells.In December 2021  the Company presented clinical results from the dose-escalation CYCLE-1 Phase 1 trial evaluating CYAD-02 for the treatment of r/r acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Data from the trial showed that a single shRNA can target two independent genes (MICA/MICB) to enhance the phenotype of the CAR T cells. In addition  the dual knockdown showed a positive contribution to the initial clinical activity of CYAD-02 as well as a trend towards increased engraftment and persistence compared to the first-generation  autologous NKG2D receptor CAR T.The Company continues to explore potential partnership opportunities for the future development of CYAD-02.Strategic Focus on Intellectual PropertyThe Company maintains a robust intellectual property portfolio within the landscape of CAR T  including twelve foundational U.S. patents associated with allogeneic CAR T for the treatment of cancer as well as patents for NKG2D receptor-based cell therapies. We believe these patents provide an avenue for the Company to develop its own programs as well as to seek potential partnership opportunities.First Half 2022 Financial ResultsKey financial figures for the first half of 2022  compared with the first half of 2021 and full year 2021  are summarized below:Selected key financial figures (€ millions) Half Year30 June 2022 Half Year30 June 2021 Full Year31 December 2021 Revenue - - - Research and development expenses (10.5) (10.0) (20.8) General and administrative expenses (6.2) (4.8) (9.9) Change in fair value of contingent consideration 1.1 (2.0) 0.8 Other income/(expenses) 1.6 1.8 3.4 Operating loss (14.1) (14.9) (26.4) Loss for the period/year (14.1) (14.9) (26.5) Net cash used in operations (16.3) (12.2) (26.6) Cash and cash equivalents 14.4 12.0 30.0Research and Development expenses were €10.5 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €10.0 million for the first half of 2021. The €0.5 million increase was mainly driven by intellectual property filing and maintenance fees to strengthen intellectual property prosecution and the increase of employee expenses mainly related to the full expense impact of the employees recruited during 2021 to support the Group’s preclinical and clinical programs  employee turnover and management changes  both of which were partially offset by the decrease in clinical activities resulting from the Phase 1b CYAD-101-002 (KEYNOTE-B79) trial which was on clinical hold during the second quarter of 2022.General and Administrative expenses were €6.2 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €4.8 million for the first half of 2021. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in insurance costs for the period  combined with an increase in employee expenses mainly related to management changes through the six-month period ended June 30  2022.A fair value adjustment of €1.1 million (non-cash income) related to the reassessment of the contingent consideration and other financial liabilities associated with the advancement of the Company’s NKG2D-based CAR T candidates as of June 30  2022  required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  was mainly driven by the updated assumptions on projected revenue associated with the Company’s CYAD-101 program  for which the timing of the potential commercialization has been delayed by one year. Additionally  the addressable patient population for CYAD-101 has been reduced based on recent safety findings from the CYAD-101-002 Phase 1b trial. The fair value adjustment was also driven by updated assumptions to discount rate and revaluation of the U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate.The Company also posted €1.6 million in net other income for the first half of 2022  compared to a net other income of €1.8 million for the first half of 2021. Other income for the first half of 2022 is primarily due to grant income from the Walloon Region of €1.4 million.Net loss for the first half of 2022 was €14.1 million  or € (0.62) per share  compared to a net loss of €14.9 million  or € (1.02) per share  for the first half of 2021.Net cash used in operations was €16.3 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €12.2 million for the first half of 2021.As of June 30  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €14.4 million ($15.0 million).As of June 30  2022  the total number of basic shares outstanding were 22.6 million similar to December 31  2021.Celyad Oncology First Half 2022 Conference Call DetailsDate: Friday  August 5  2022Time: 2 p.m. CEST / 8 a.m. EDTDial-in: +1 201 493 6779 (International)  + 1 877 407 9716 (United States) or +32 (0) 800 73 904 (Belgium).

""We also were proud to recently announce that the FDA lifted the clinical hold on our CYAD-101 program. In addition  we look forward to the upcoming data read out for CYAD-211 in the second half of 2022. We are truly ushering in a new chapter for Celyad Oncology by unlocking the potential of not only our product candidates  but also our portfolio of IP  technology  and overall expertise in cell therapy.""Second Quarter 2022 and Recent Business HighlightsThe Board of Directors named Hilde Windels as Chair of the Board of DirectorsMichel Lussier named Interim Chief Executive Officer of the CompanyStory continuesPipeline and Business UpdatesCYAD-211 – Allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T for r/r MMCYAD-211 is an investigational  short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based allogeneic CAR T candidate for the treatment of r/r MM. CYAD-211 is engineered to co-express a B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) targeting CAR and a single shRNA  which interferes with the expression of the CD3ζ component of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex.Preliminary data reported in December 2021 from the dose-escalation segment of the IMMUNICY-1 Phase 1 trial evaluating CYAD-211 following cyclophosphamide/fludarabine (CyFlu) preconditioning chemotherapy in patients with r/r MM showed evidence of clinical activity with a good tolerability profile including no evidence of Graft versus Host Disease. In addition  all patients in the trial had detectable CYAD-211 cells in the peripheral blood.Enrollment is currently ongoing in the IMMUNICY-1 Phase 1 trial to evaluate enhanced lymphodepletion (eLD) and increased CYAD-211 doses with the aim to improve cell persistence and potentially maximize the clinical benefit of CYAD-211. The IMMUNICY-1 protocol also allows for CYAD-211 redosing in certain patients.Additional data updates from the eLD cohorts of the Phase 1 IMMUNICY-1 trial of CYAD-211 for r/r MM are expected during second half of 2022.CYAD-101 – Allogeneic TIM-based NKG2D CAR T for mCRCCYAD-101 is an investigational  non-gene edited  allogeneic CAR T candidate engineered to co-expresses the TIM peptide alongside a CAR based on NKG2D  a receptor expressed on natural killer (NK) and T cells  that binds to eight stress-induced ligands.In June 2022 we submitted our complete response to the clinical hold of the CYAD-101-002 phase 1b trial to the FDA stating our intent to amend the eligibility criteria to exclude patients who have bilateral lung metastases and patients who have received treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting monoclonal antibodies within the previous 9 months prior to trial recruitment. In July 2022  based on that complete response  we received notification that the FDA lifted the clinical hold on the CYAD-101-002 phase 1b trialshARC PlatformDiscovery research continues on programs focused on the co-expression of Interleukin-18 in conjunction with our short hairpin RNA shRNA technology platform  also known as our shARC (shRNA Armored CAR) franchise  with a focus on the development of next-generation  allogeneic CAR T candidates.CYAD-02 – Autologous NKG2D CAR-T for r/r AML and MDSCYAD-02 is an investigational  autologous CAR T therapy that co-expresses both the NKG2D CAR and a single shRNA targeting the NKG2D ligands MICA/MICB on the CAR T cells.In December 2021  the Company presented clinical results from the dose-escalation CYCLE-1 Phase 1 trial evaluating CYAD-02 for the treatment of r/r acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Data from the trial showed that a single shRNA can target two independent genes (MICA/MICB) to enhance the phenotype of the CAR T cells. In addition  the dual knockdown showed a positive contribution to the initial clinical activity of CYAD-02 as well as a trend towards increased engraftment and persistence compared to the first-generation  autologous NKG2D receptor CAR T.The Company continues to explore potential partnership opportunities for the future development of CYAD-02.Strategic Focus on Intellectual PropertyThe Company maintains a robust intellectual property portfolio within the landscape of CAR T  including twelve foundational U.S.patents associated with allogeneic CAR T for the treatment of cancer as well as patents for NKG2D receptor-based cell therapies. We believe these patents provide an avenue for the Company to develop its own programs as well as to seek potential partnership opportunities.First Half 2022 Financial ResultsKey financial figures for the first half of 2022  compared with the first half of 2021 and full year 2021  are summarized below:Selected key financial figures (€ millions) Half Year30 June 2022 Half Year30 June 2021 Full Year31 December 2021 Revenue - - - Research and development expenses (10.5) (10.0) (20.8) General and administrative expenses (6.2) (4.8) (9.9) Change in fair value of contingent consideration 1.1 (2.0) 0.8 Other income/(expenses) 1.6 1.8 3.4 Operating loss (14.1) (14.9) (26.4) Loss for the period/year (14.1) (14.9) (26.5) Net cash used in operations (16.3) (12.2) (26.6) Cash and cash equivalents 14.4 12.0 30.0Research and Development expenses were €10.5 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €10.0 million for the first half of 2021. The €0.5 million increase was mainly driven by intellectual property filing and maintenance fees to strengthen intellectual property prosecution and the increase of employee expenses mainly related to the full expense impact of the employees recruited during 2021 to support the Group’s preclinical and clinical programs  employee turnover and management changes  both of which were partially offset by the decrease in clinical activities resulting from the Phase 1b CYAD-101-002 (KEYNOTE-B79) trial which was on clinical hold during the second quarter of 2022.General and Administrative expenses were €6.2 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €4.8 million for the first half of 2021. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in insurance costs for the period  combined with an increase in employee expenses mainly related to management changes through the six-month period ended June 30  2022.A fair value adjustment of €1.1 million (non-cash income) related to the reassessment of the contingent consideration and other financial liabilities associated with the advancement of the Company’s NKG2D-based CAR T candidates as of June 30  2022  required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  was mainly driven by the updated assumptions on projected revenue associated with the Company’s CYAD-101 program  for which the timing of the potential commercialization has been delayed by one year. Additionally  the addressable patient population for CYAD-101 has been reduced based on recent safety findings from the CYAD-101-002 Phase 1b trial. The fair value adjustment was also driven by updated assumptions to discount rate and revaluation of the U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate.The Company also posted €1.6 million in net other income for the first half of 2022  compared to a net other income of €1.8 million for the first half of 2021. Other income for the first half of 2022 is primarily due to grant income from the Walloon Region of €1.4 million.Net loss for the first half of 2022 was €14.1 million  or € (0.62) per share  compared to a net loss of €14.9 million  or € (1.02) per share  for the first half of 2021.Net cash used in operations was €16.3 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €12.2 million for the first half of 2021.As of June 30  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €14.4 million ($15.0 million).As of June 30  2022  the total number of basic shares outstanding were 22.6 million similar to December 31  2021.Celyad Oncology First Half 2022 Conference Call DetailsDate: Friday  August 5  2022Time: 2 p.m. CEST / 8 a.m. EDTDial-in: +1 201 493 6779 (International)  + 1 877 407 9716 (United States) or +32 (0) 800 73 904 (Belgium).
