On that basis  the Company expects that its resources will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditure requirements through at least February 2023.Thomas Kuhn  Chief Executive Officer of Poxel  stated: “We have an important milestone coming up this quarter with the topline results of the Phase 2 DESTINY-1 study for PXL065 in NASH. We have thus been working diligently these past months to extend our cash runway to capitalize on this opportunity and independently finance our strategy in rare diseases. Together  the successful completion of the debt restructuring and the equity-linked financing facility not only improves the Company’s balance sheet to support ongoing operations  but both agreements also provide further flexibility to finalize additional financing initiatives  including ongoing active partnership discussions related to our programs. We continue to work towards the initiation of our planned Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trials in adrenoleukodystrophy which represent the foundation of our rare disease strategy.”The Company has entered into an agreement with IPF to restructure its debt  resulting in the postponement of the Q3 2022 and Q4 2022 amortization payments under the existing debt facility  and lowering certain financial covenants until the end of January 2023.Edouard Guillet  Partner at IPF Partners  commented: “With this agreement to restructure the existing debt facility  we are pleased to provide Poxel with increased flexibility to complete its other financing initiatives which we strongly believe will be finalized in the near future and will allow Poxel to execute on its robust strategy in rare diseases.”Concurrently  the Company has entered into an equity-linked financing arrangement with IRIS for an initial gross amount of EUR 4 million  with the option  at the latest on December 31  2022 and at the Company’s sole discretion  to draw a second and third tranche of up to EUR 1 million each. Upon conversion of the equity-linked instruments  IRIS will be issued Poxel shares to be created from the Company’s authorized capital and is expected to sell these newly issued shares on the market or in block trades. The equity-linked financing is intended to provide additional liquidity in support of the Company’s ongoing regulatory and development activities as well as general corporate purposes.Based on:its cash position at June 30  2022  the current development plan of the Company including 1) the completion of its ongoing Phase 2 NASH trial for PXL065 (DESTINY-1) but excluding 2) the two identical Phase 2a clinical proof-of-concept (POC) biomarker studies for PXL065 and PXL770 in adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  the cash forecast for the year 2022 approved by the Board of Directors of the Company  that does not include  as a conservative approach  any net royalties from Imeglimin in Japan  a strict control of its operating expenses  and the amendment to the IPF debt facility with the postponement of the Q3 2022 and Q4 2022 amortization payments until end of February 2023  as well as a full drawdown of all tranches of the equity-linked financing arrangement with IRIS for a total amount of EUR 6 million  before December 31  2022 the Company expects that its resources will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditure requirements through at least February 2023.The Company is actively pursuing additional financing options  prioritizing non-dilutive sources  including ongoing active partnership discussions related to its programs.Debt Restructuring with IPFWith the objective to extend its cash runway  the Company has entered into an agreement with IPF to restructure its existing debt  consisting of postponing repayment of EUR 3.2 million  corresponding to Q3 2022 and Q4 2022 amortizations  until February 2023.In addition  IPF and the Company agreed to temporarily amend the financial covenants of the debt facility until 31 January 2023 so that no breach occurs before February 2023  independently of any other potential additional financing of the Company. Under the revised financial covenants  the Company shall maintain a minimum cash position between EUR 15 million and EUR 10 million through January 2023. After such date  the previously existing financial covenants will be reinstated 1 .. The amendment of the debt facility also includes an increase of 3% of the PIK margin (in addition to the existing 2% PIK). IPF shall also be entitled to a fee payable at the maturity date of each tranche and set at a total amount of approximately EUR 4 million.Should the Company close a financing transaction of a minimum amount of EUR 15 million  and subject to the then applicable debt to market capitalization gearing ratio of the Company  Poxel will partially prepay IPF debt with an amount up to 20% of the proceeds of such transaction as a partial early debt repayment  which would reduce the Company’s indebtedness. Such early repayment shall consist in principal and shall not include any early repayment fee.As part of the amendment agreement  IPF will be appointed as an observer to the Company’s Board of Directors. IPF will have the same right to information as the Directors and may participate in meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company in an advisory capacity but will not have any voting rights.The terms of the existing warrants held by IPF which were attached to the Tranche 1  2 and 3 bonds giving right to subscribe 630 804 shares at respectively €7.37  €7.14  €6.72 per warrant for each Tranche  remain unchanged and thus trigger no potential additional dilution.Equity-linked financing with IRISLegal basis of issuanceActing on the delegation of the Board of Directors and in accordance with the 17th resolution of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of June 21  2022  the Company decided to implement this equity-linked financing  provided by IRIS  a venture capital firm specialized in providing financing solutions to listed companies.Operation objectivesThis funding aims to increase the Company’s cash position to support its operations. Proceeds shall be used mainly to support ongoing regulatory and development activities as well as general corporate purposes.Operation arrangementsIn accordance with the terms of the agreement  IRIS  acting as a specialized investor without a strategy to retain a stake in the Company’s share capital  has committed to subscribe to bonds convertible into new ordinary shares of the Company for an initial amount of EUR 4 million. At the Company’s sole discretion  two additional tranches of EUR 1 million each  may be drawn down in Q4 2022.IRIS has the right to request the conversion of its bonds into new ordinary shares of the Company at any time in one or several occasions until full repayment of the bonds. The issuance of shares upon conversion of the bonds shall be made on each conversion date on the basis of the average volume weighted share price over the last trading day preceding each issue  less a discount of 8%  subject to a floor corresponding to the average volume weighted share price over the twenty trading days preceding each issue  less a discount of 20%.During the term of the financing  IRIS is expected to sell the newly issued shares received upon conversion of the convertible bonds on the market or in block trades. In connection with the financing  Poxel will issue shares out of its authorized share capital in accordance with the 17th resolution of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of June 21  2022 with excluded pre-emptive rights of the existing shareholders for the benefit of certain category of investors.The new shares issued under the terms of this agreement shall be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris.No application for admission to trading on any market whatsoever will be made for the convertible bonds.Considering the anticipated number of shares to be issued upon conversion of the convertible bonds issued  based on the share price of the Company on the last trading day preceding the date of this press release  this operation does not give rise at this stage to publication of a prospectus to be submitted to the approval by the French securities regulator  the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF). Should a prospectus be required in the future due to a potentially higher than expected issuance of shares  the Company and IRIS have agreed that the issuance program will be suspended for a maximum period of three months  until such prospectus has been approved by the AMF.On the basis of the issuance of all three tranches of the financing facility with IRIS and the average price weighted by volumes of the Company’s share during the last trading day preceding the date of this press release  the stake of a shareholder with 1% of the Company’s share capital would decrease to 0.91%  i.e. a 9% dilution. As a reminder  based on the decisions of the general assembly meeting of the shareholders on June 21  2022  the Company's board on July 29  2022  and the CEO decision dated August 5  2022  the maximum number of shares to be issued on redemption of convertible bonds is currently set at 15 800 000 shares. Should this maximum amount apply  the stake of a shareholder holding 1% of the Company’s share capital would decrease to 0.65%  i.e. a 35% dilution.To the Company's knowledge  on the basis of the same assumptions  the distribution of its share capital before and after redemption of all the convertible bonds in newly issued shares will be as follows:Shareholders Before the transaction After the transaction (on the basis of the drawdown of all Tranches and the average price weighted by Company’s share volumes during the last trading day preceding the date of this press release) After the transaction (on the basis of the maximum potential dilution authorized by the general assembly meeting of the shareholders under the 17th resolution) Number ofshares % ofcapital Number ofshares % of capital Number ofshares % of capital Founders 2 778 947 9.6% 2 778 947 8.7% 2 778 947 6.2% Bpifrance 5 753 662 19.9% 5 753 662 18.1% 5 753 662 12.9% Free float 20 420 041 70.5% 23 318 311 73.2% 36 220 041 80.9% Total 28 952 650 100.0% 31 850 920 100.0% 44 752 650 100.0%The Company will make available to investors on its website an up-to-date summary chart of its outstanding convertible bonds and the number of shares in circulation.The public’s attention is drawn to the risk factors relative to the Company and its business  presented in its universal registration document filed with the AMF on 4 May 2022  which is available on the Company’s website. The occurrence of all or some of these risks is likely to have an unfavourable effect on the Company's business  financial situation  results  development or prospects.In addition  the public's attention is specifically drawn to the following main risks related to the IRIS financing and its implementation:- Risk of dilution of the Company's shareholders: the Company's shareholders who cannot participate in the operation will suffer dilution when new shares are issued to IRIS upon conversion of the convertible bonds;- Risk in the event of non-fulfillment of all the tranches: the Company may have to seek additional financings and to review accordingly its development strategy and its objectives if an event of default occurs or certain minimum share price prevent the drawdown of the Tranches II and/or III of the financing  respectively of EUR 1 million each.- Risk on the volatility  liquidity and share price of the Company’s shares: Given IRIS’ strategy  which is to sell newly issued shares shortly after conversion of the convertible bonds it holds  the share price and the volatility of the Company's shares could fluctuate significantly after the issuance of the convertible bonds issued to IRIS.This press release and the information it contains do not  and will not  constitute an offer to subscribe for or sell  nor the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy  any securities of the Company in any jurisdiction.Main Characteristics of the financing with IRIS:Maturity Date 48 months Total Commitment EUR 6 million Tranche I EUR 4 million IRIS has subscribed to the first tranche of EUR 4 million at signing Tranche II EUR 1 million maximum  at the option of Poxel At the sole option of Poxel  IRIS will subscribe to a new tranche EUR 1 million on or before November 30  2022 Tranche III EUR 1 million maximum  at the option of Poxel At the sole option of Poxel  IRIS will subscribe to a new tranche EUR 1 million on or before December 31  2022 Nominal of Notes EUR 2 500 Coupon 0% Conversion IRIS may request that the convertible bonds be converted into shares of the company at the prevailing conversion ratio at any time upon delivery of a conversion notice to the CompanyThe conversion of the convertible bonds into new or existing shares of the Company is mandatory at the latest at maturity of the convertible bonds Conversion Price The average volume weighted share price over the last trading day preceding each issue  less a discount of 8%  subject to a floor corresponding to the average volume weighted share price over the twenty trading days preceding each issue  less a discount of 20% Conditions precedent of drawdown for Tranche II and III Usual condition precedents for this type of financing including absence of event of default and minimum share price at the time of drawdown Event of defaults Usual event of defaults for this type of financing including the absence of timely delivery of shares in conversion of the convertible bonds (e.g. in case of insufficient authorizations from the general assembly meeting of the shareholders or in the absence of publication of a prospectus  as the case may be) Subscription price 100% of par value New Shares New shares of the Company issued on redemption of the convertible bonds will bear current dividend rights. They will have the same rights as those attached to existing ordinary shares and be admitted for trading on the Euronext regulated market on Euronext Paris. The Company will keep on its website a chart for monitoring convertible bonds and the number of shares in circulation up to date.Nominal value of the shares of the Company: EUR 0.02 Potential dilution – Maximum share number Pursuant to the decisions of the general assembly meeting of the shareholders on June 21  2022  the Company’s board on July 29  2022 and the CEO decision on August 5  2022  the maximum number of shares for issue on redemption of convertible bonds has been set at 15 800 000 shares. By way of illustration  assuming issuance of all the convertible bonds and the average price weighted by volumes of the Company’s share during the last trading day preceding the date of this press release  i.e.€2.07  the number of new Company shares for subscription by the Investor on redemption of the convertible bonds in new shares would be 2 898 270 shares  representing approximately 10.0% of the share capital (on a non-diluted basis). Based on the same assumptions  the number of new Company shares for subscription by the Investor on redemption of the convertible bonds in new shares for Tranche I only would be 1 932 180 shares representing approximately 6.7% of the share capital (on a non-diluted basis)  and the number of new Company shares for subscription by the Investor on redemption of the convertible bonds in new shares for each of Tranche II and III only would be 483 045 shares representing approximately 1.7% of the share capital (on a non-diluted basis).On the date of this press release  the Company has a share capital of €579 053 divided into 28 952 650 ordinary shares Share Loan Agreement As part of the equity-linked financing  certain shareholders of the Company have undertaken to loan part of their shares to IRIS.

Participants will receive three doses of VLA15 180 µg or saline placebo as a primary vaccination series followed by one booster dose of VLA15 or saline placebo (1:1 ratio).Data from the Phase 2 studies continue to demonstrate strong immunogenicity in adults as well as in children  with acceptable safety and tolerability profiles in both study populations.1 2 Pending successful completion of the Phase 3 study  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.As per the terms of the collaboration agreement between Pfizer and Valneva  Pfizer will make a $25 million milestone payment to Valneva upon initiation of the Phase 3 study.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.3 4 The terms of the collaboration agreement include a $25 million milestone payment made to Valneva upon Pfizer’s initiation of the Phase 3 study. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.5About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States and 130 000 people in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.8About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

One of our key objectives these past months has been to extend our cash runway to leverage this opportunity and independently finance our strategy in rare diseases. The two agreements announced today  the debt restructuring along with the equity-linked financing facility  provide further flexibility to finalize additional financing initiatives  including ongoing active partnership discussions related to our programs. In addition  we will continue our work to initiate our Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies in adrenoleukodystrophy which represent the foundation of our rare disease strategy ” said Thomas Kuhn  Chief Executive Officer of Poxel. “We have also had key regulatory achievements this year  including Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation granted by the FDA for PXL065 and PXL770 in ALD. In addition  the recent patent approval of a new solid form of PXL065 is an important addition to the protection of this compound and significantly extends its exclusivity.”Commercial UpdateTWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)As of June 30  2022  royalty revenue to Poxel based on TWYMEEG net sales in Japan under the Sumitomo Pharma license agreement has been limited following TWYMEEG’s commercial launch on September 16  2021. TWYMEEG’s initial commercial uptake has been affected by restrictions in Japan on prescribing any new drug in its first year of commercialization  and conditions related to COVID-19  which have reduced the frequency of physician visits and limited the extensive prescriber education efforts required for any launch of an innovative drug with a new mechanism of action. However  as a result of Sumitomo Pharma's promotional activities and efforts since launch  TWYMEEG is very well known among prescribers.Clinical UpdatesNASHPXL065 (deuterium-stabilised R-pioglitazone) is in a Phase 2 study (DESTINY-1). Results from this 36-week  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  dose-ranging study designed to assess efficacy and safety are anticipated  as planned  in Q3 2022. The goal of DESTINY-1 is to identify the optimal dose or doses of PXL065 to advance into a Phase 3 registration trial for the treatment of noncirrhotic biopsy-proven NASH patients.Rare metabolic diseasesIn ALD  two Phase 2a biomarker proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trials of PXL065 and PXL770 are expected to initiate as soon as possible  subject to additional financing. These two identical studies will enroll adult male patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  the most common ALD subtype. The POC studies will evaluate the pharmacokinetics  safety and efficacy of PXL065 and PXL770 after 12 weeks of treatment based on relevant disease biomarkers  such as the effect on very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)  the characteristic plasma marker of the disease.In February and April  the FDA awarded Fast Track Designation (FTD) to PXL065 and PXL770 respectively  for ALD. The FDA grants FTD to investigational drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition  and which fill an unmet medical need. Filling an unmet medical need is defined as providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available therapy. The key benefits of FTD comprise enhanced access to the FDA  with regular and more frequent opportunities for consultation and discussion.In May  the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) 1 to PXL065 and PXL770 for ALD. ODD confers a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received.to PXL065 and PXL770 for ALD. ODD confers a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received. Two preclinical articles on X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) for PXL065 and PXL770 were published: The article on PXL065 was published in The Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (“JIMD”) and is entitled “ Therapeutic potential of deuterium-stabilized (R)-pioglitazone - PXL065 - for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ”. It is available here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35510808/. The article on PXL770 was published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (“JPET”)   and is entitled “ Beneficial effects of the direct AMP-Kinase activator PXL770 in in vitro and in vivo models of X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy”. It is available here: https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/early/2022/06/25/jpet.122.001208.Corporate UpdateIn June  the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) issued a new patent for PXL065 that describes a specific form of PXL065 with unique properties. Importantly  this recently issued patent provides additional protection through 2041 and could expand protection for PXL065 worldwide  with the potential for an additional 5 years through patent term extension.On June 21  2022  Poxel held its annual general meeting.

8753,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4531344-valneva-stock-vaccine-business-catalysts-ahead-pfizers-lyme-love,Valneva Stock: Vaccine Business  Catalysts Ahead  And Pfizer's Lyme Love (NASDAQ:VALN),Valneva is a specialty vaccines company with an ongoing travelers vaccine business. Check out the catalysts that bode well for VALN stock here.,VioletaStoimenovaThesisValneva (NASDAQ:VALN) is a French specialty vaccines company which has not been covered on Seeking Alpha after its Nasdaq IPO  even though it sports a market cap of $1.1 billion.It has operating sites all over the world  four of which in Europe and one in both Canada and the US  and has +750 employees worldwide. It has an ongoing travelers health business which I believe may report good results in the coming quarter  probably also with R&D expenses for the quarter reduced.VLA2001  Valneva’s inactivated Covid-vaccine which has strong efficacy across different variants  a good safety profile and booster potential  is currently suffering from an oversupply of Covid-vaccines  at least in the Western world. There may be an occasion here in the longer term  as a shift towards better vaccines than those currently used occurs.In the second half of 2022  Valneva will file for a biologics license application (BLA) for VLA1553  its Chikungunya vaccine candidate. This vaccine candidate has fast-track designation in the US  prime designation in the EU  and is eligible for a priority review voucher. VLA1553 has shown excellent safety and immunogenicity results and seems best placed to become the go-to vaccine for this disease.In the third quarter of 2022  Valneva will initiate a Phase 3 trial for VLA15  the world’s only Lyme vaccine candidate  which is again shown to be safe and efficacious. Pfizer (PFE) co-develops this vaccine  has provided serious funding  will pay more as milestones progress  and has just recently taken an 8.1% stake in Valneva.I see a buying opportunity here  with two important catalysts ahead  i.e. the BLA for the chikungunya vaccine and the Phase 3 trial initiation for the Lyme vaccine candidate. The fact that Pfizer saw the interest in the Lyme vaccine adds to my conviction.With about €300 million in the bank  I believe the market’s current valuation of Valneva is too low. I do see one caveat  and that would be that the market hasn’t fully discounted poor revenue coming from Valneva’s Covid vaccine.The current share priceThe company trades both on Euronext and on the Nasdaq  with much less liquidity on the latter.On Euronext  it trades under the ticker 'VLA'  with a year-high of €29.7 and a year-low of €7.26. Its one-year chart is as follows. Trading on Euronext is more liquid.Valneva stock price chart Euronext (Google)On the Nasdaq  where the company trades under the ticker 'VALN'  its yearly trading range is in between $67.84 and $13.71  with the company now trading around $20. Contrary to Euronext  there is little liquidity on the Nasdaq.There has been volatility in the stock price lately due to negative sentiment surrounding the commercial viability of the Covid vaccine program on the one hand  and positive sentiment relating to the recent €90.5 million stake of Pfizer in Valneva on the other.I will cover Valneva’s portfolio below as a function of each asset’s maturity in the business. I see most potential in both the chikungunya and Lyme disease candidates. Contrary to its Covid-vaccine  I believe those vaccines will not face serious competition  if any  once approved. Hence  I am looking at this company in part as a biotech company with a high-value late-stage pipeline  a fully operational manufacturing and commercial team  and a recovering ongoing business.Valneva’s ongoing business: traveler health portfolio and third-party distributionValneva’s Traveler Health portfolio includes two vaccines  Ixiaro/Jespect and Dukoral  and encompasses vaccines for those traveling to other countries. Ixiaro  commercialized under the name Jespect  is a vaccine for Japanese encephalitis. Dukoral is a vaccine for the cholera and prevention of diarrhea resulting from an enterotoxigenic E. Coli bacteria.This business  covering approvals in most countries in the Western world  had been heavily impacted by travel restrictions and Covid-related lockdowns  mostly in 2020. Revenues declined from $130 million in 2019 to $66 million in 2020 and $63 million 2021  which still saw an impact from the pandemic. US soldiers travel too  and Valneva in fact derives quite some revenue from its long-standing relationship with the US government. The US military has an ongoing 3-year supply contract with Valneva for Ixiaro  and has been using that vaccine for more than 10 years already. The total minimum value of this contract is $118 million.I expect Valneva to report good numbers here for the second and third quarter of 2022.Valneva also commercializes third-party products such as Moskito Guard  Encepur  Flucelvax Tetra  Fluad  Kamrab and Rabipur  amounting to $15.4 million in 2021. It also has some minor other revenues.VLA2001  an inactivated COVID-19 vaccineVLA2001 is an inactivated virus vaccine which has shown robust efficacy and safety against different variants. It applies the same technology as Ixiaro’s  and consists of inactivated Covid-19 particles with preservation of the native structure of Covid-19’s spike-protein. It can be stored at cold chain temperatures (2-8° Celsius)  can be used as primary vaccination or as a booster  and is suitable for routine immunization in the longer term. The Phase 3 trial results showed superiority in neutralizing antibody levels and a better safety profile compared to AZD1222  another EMA-approved vaccine. It has received standard marketing authorization in the EU  conditional marketing authorization in the UK  and emergency use authorization in Bahrain and the UAE. Q3 2022 should see Valneva readout its booster data  which I do not expect the market to react to.Here comes the catch though. Due to oversupply of vaccines in the Western world at this  this vaccine has yet to turn into a commercial success.The UK government had terminated its contract to order several million doses in 2021  which has led to a +$200 million settlement agreement in that year  which led the company to report total revenue of €348.1 for that year  compared to €110.3 million in 2021. I do add that 2020 and 2021 were weak years as the company’s travelers health portfolio revenue was seriously impacted by Covid. In 2019  revenue from the travelers health portfolio had been €129.5 million.The EU has recently expressed its wish to terminate its supply agreement with Valneva to supply up to 60 million doses over a period of two years  which led the stock to sell-off to its year-low in June 2022. The company is in talks with the EU about a remediation plan  as several EU countries have expressed their wish to receive the vaccine. I have seen an analyst write that Valneva may accept a ‘best-we-can-do’ offer to reduce stock inventories. Valneva has nonetheless clearly stated that  if volume indications would be too low  commercialization would not be sustainable. In that sense  I believe the company will have to revise its sales guidance expressed for 2022  but I believe the market has taken that into account.In the longer run  as the world may be ready for better and longer-lasting vaccines than the ones that are currently mainstream  this vaccine may attract business.VLA1553  the chikungunya vaccine candidateVLA1553 is one of three chikungunya vaccine candidates in development  probably best-in-class and furthest-progressed.Chikungunya is carried by mosquitoes in tropical and sub-tropical environments such as the Americas  India  and Thailand. It is prone to cause outbreaks among the population with a severe economic impact. Morbidity is low  but the inflammatory burden and persistent joint pain have a debilitating impact.VLA1553 overview slide (Valneva corporate presentation)The Phase 3 trial results showed outstanding immunogenicity and led to protective chikungunya neutralizing antibody titers in 98.5% of participants 28 days after single-dose administration. That 98.5% seroprotection rate exceeded the bar of 70% that had been agreed with the FDA. VLA1553 has basically been racking up regulator’s favoritism  with fast-track and prime designation respectively by the FDA and the EMA  and breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA in July 2021. Valneva is now likely to receive a priority review voucher  as sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine to be approved in the US.Valneva would include VLA1553 in its travelers health portfolio with approval in the US and the EU underway. It has also entered into an agreement with the Brazilian ‘instituto butantan’ to commercialize this vaccine for less developed countries.Valneva is about to file for a BLA any time now  as it had been announced for mid-2022. I believe this could be a substantial catalyst for this drug candidate. Upon approval  launch can be expected soon after  with the plus here that Valneva has its commercial network set up already.In a global market which is to exceed $500 million by 2032  it can capture that market upon approval and establish its go-to position for years to come. I have read an analyst forecast risk-adjusted peak sales of €260 million by 2028. The above means that upon approval  this business has the potential of tripling the current sales revenue over time.VLA15  the Lyme disease vaccine candidateVLA15 is the biggest horse in the stable in my eyes  as the only Lyme vaccine candidate in the world  with outstanding Phase 2 data  which came in different sets of data over different studies  and huge Pfizer backing/involvement. Lyme disease is commonly known to most people. It is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria  is transmitted by ticks and highly present in several regions of the Western world  where it expands more and more due to climate change.Lyme disease incidence slide (Valneva corporate presentation)Most patients recover  but 10-20% have persistent and sometimes disabling issues such as ongoing fatigue. There is currently no vaccine for Lyme disease available in the world  and although antibiotic treatments may provide relief  these generally come too late because detection of the disease is slow  and the therapeutic window passes.VLA15 has shown strong immune responses across 6 different serotypes. In April 2022  Valneva has reported results of its phase 2 pediatric study showing strong immunogenicity and an outstanding safety profile. These results build on earlier successful Phase 2 results  which is perhaps why the market has not given them much attention  if any.The upcoming catalyst here is the initiation of a phase 3 trial the second half of 2022  the results of which could be expected by year-end 2023.In the US and Europe combined  about 700 000 people each year are diagnosed with Lyme disease  with this number on the rise due to climate change.Pfizer and Valneva have a co-development and co-commercialization partnership here  with development-costs being split 60/40 for Pfizer and Valneva  respectively  and Valneva eligible for milestone payments. Of these milestone payment  $168 million are still to be paid. Initiation of the Phase 3 study  which is for any time now  will lead to a $25 million payment.The Pfizer involvement should ensure perfect marketing and commercialization potential. The most recent terms of the royalty agreement  as recently revised  are tiered royalties ranging from 14% to 22%. Add to that  Valneva is eligible for up to $100 million in milestone payment from Pfizer based on cumulative sales. I will also add to that  Pfizer is flush with cash and apparently on a buying spree. Latest rumors  as reiterated in this Seeking Alpha editor coverage on prognosis for the biotech sector in the current quarter  include rumors of Pfizer being in talks to buy Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) in a $5 billion deal. In my earlier Cardiff Oncology (CRDF) coverage  I had recalled how earlier Pfizer equity investments led to buyouts. An 8.1% stake of Pfizer may bode well here  but I have difficulties to believe that would be a short-term scenario as parties have just revised their deal. I’ll add that Pfizer seems most interested in Valneva’s Lyme business  which I assume could not be included in Valneva’s travelers health portfolio.If one would assume a 400-million-person worldwide market with 3% penetration (i.e. 12 million)  and pricing of $100 in the US and €50 in the EU which would be equally split between the two main markets  one arrives at sales numbers of $1.2 billion and €600 million  respectively. Assuming royalties to be around 18% (the middle of 14% and 22%)  revenues would be $216 million for the US and €108 million for the EU. These are only vague estimates at this stage  as pricing is unknown and the concrete markets are unexplored  but they do give an idea of the value-driving potential here. Pfizer is seeing it  and again  there is no competition for this vaccine in the pipeline.First quarter 2022 results and second quarter expectationsThe results reported by Valneva for Q1 2022 were about the same as those reported for the year before. Total revenue was €21.8 million compared to €23.2 million in 2021  with product sales of €16.2 million compared to €16.1 million in 2021  and with first COVID-19 vaccine sales of €3.8 million. A total of €5.6 million were derived from other revenues  compared to €7.1 million in 2021.As Valneva’s business had been severely impacted by Covid-measures  I expect to see an uptick in business results for the coming quarter  as people are resuming travel again similar to pre-pandemic times to countries where the vaccines in the traveler’s health portfolio are of use. Valneva highlights in its corporate presentation that this business represented $130 million in 2019 when it was growing strongly (slide 18)  and is a key asset for the future.Guidance in the Q1 results on May 5  2022  was that Valneva expected its 2022 revenues to be within the range announced in February  namely €430 million to €590 million. I expect this guidance is no longer applicable in light of the recent termination or termination discussions with regards to the Covid vaccine  both in the UK and in the EU. I do believe the market has already discounted the future revision of that guidance  which one can see in the share price dip right after the Covid-update the company issued on June 10  2022.Already for the first quarter of 2022  R&D costs were reduced to €20.7 million  where they were still €27.7 the year before. This was mainly attributable to ending of the Phase 3 trial for chikungunya and lower investments for the Covid-vaccine. I don’t expect to see any major R&D costs for the second quarter of 2022  as the Phase 2 trials for Lyme disease have now also ended.The reduction of R&D expenses for Q2 2022 that I expect may also have a considerable impact on operating and EBITDA loss compared to previous quarters. For Q1 2022  Valneva’s operating loss was €18.4 million versus €31.1 million in Q1 2021. Q1 2022 adjusted EBITDA loss was €12.7 million compared to €28.3 million in Q1 2021.FinancialsThese were Valneva’s 2021 financial results as reported on March 24  2022.Valneva 2021 financial results (Valneva Full Year 2021 reporting)Total revenues in 2021 were €348.1 million  compared to €110.3 million in 2020  but of that €348.1 million  €253.3 million was attributable to a settlement under the terminated UK agreement. Revenues from normal business  affected by Covid  were €94.8 million. As these were $130 million in 2019 and were apparently on the rise  I expect Valneva to do better here in Q2 2022 than compared to last quarter or last year’s second quarter.Valneva is flush with cash and will be so for the foreseeable future. Its cash position end of March 2022 €311.3 million. In April 2020  Valneva entering into an R&D agreement with Pfizer for the Lyme vaccine candidate  which led to an upfront payment of $130 million in June 2020. Pfizer is due to pay an additional $178 in development milestones  among which $25 million when the vaccine candidate enters Phase 3 trials. In May 2021  Valneva picked up $107.6 million as a result of a global Offering and Nasdaq listing  which was followed by an additional global offering worth $102 million. The collaboration agreement with Pfizer has been adapted in June 2022  with Pfizer taking an equity investment in Valneva of 8.4% for a total of $90.5 million  and with parties agreeing a slightly different royalty split. Finally  a financing arrangement with US healthcare funds Deerfield and Orbimed led to the availability of an additional $40 million in April 2022.A fair value for Valneva’s business potentialAs mentioned above  given its pipeline  I am looking at Valneva as an ongoing business with an even bigger pipeline.With a €1.15 billion market cap and about €300 million in cash  its enterprise value would be €850 million. I would expect yearly revenues from the currently travelers health portfolio to pick to where they were in pre-Covid levels  i.e. at around €120 million or more.For me  Covid sales are unclear at this stage. With the company being in remediation talks with the EU  I can’t expect it to sit on the sidelines with such a perfect vaccine once routine immunization will become more normal. The vaccine  the only of its kind in Europe  can be used as a booster shot leading to hybrid immunity  with persistent efficacy across different variants. The company’s €430 million to €590 million total revenue for the year was largely based on Covid-sales  and that number will have to be revised downward. But I believe the market has discounted that.The company’s R&D expenses should go down as they soon won’t be related from the chikungunya vaccine candidate anymore. Pfizer is in part providing funding for the Lyme disease candidate.Approval of the chikungunya vaccine may be on the company’s doorstep  with risk-adjusted peak sales of €260 million being possible in some years' time  which means this vaccine candidate has the potential of tripling the current sales revenue of around $100 million over time. This vaccine would be included in the travelers health portfolio  for which Valneva already has a commercial team in operation  so I assume that will not lead to disproportionate additional costs.Finally  I have made an estimate above of revenues that could be derived from the world’s only Lyme vaccine backed by Pfizer at $216 million for the US and €108 million for the EU. This asset  too  is largely de-risked in my eyes  as there is no other vaccine candidate in clinical trials.One sees that the company holds the biggest potential in its two late-stage assets  with immediate catalysts around the corner.RisksThe major short-term risk I see is the market’s interpretation of possibly revised sales guidance for the year 2022. I believe Valneva has communicated well about the EU’s wish to terminate the contract for the Covid-vaccine. The company is in remediation talks  as mentioned above  but it is impossible to say at this time what will come out of that. I am  for the short-term future  not giving the Covid vaccine much value.Furthermore  if either the chikungunya vaccine candidate does not get approved  or the Lyme disease candidate would for some reason yield less positive results or show side effects in a Phase 3 trial  then the narrative here would need to be changed. I consider both risks to be low  as we are dealing with far-advanced assets which have been tested abundantly in large-scale trials.A further risk includes delayed uptake of the traveler’s health portfolio  despite a Covid-unwinding world.ConclusionValneva has an ongoing travelers health business which I assume will have done well for the past quarter  with possibly reduced R&D costs. Quarterly earnings will be reported on August 11  2022  so we will know at that time whether that’s correct. On the other hand  I assume the company’s guidance on its Covid-vaccine is off the table in light of an oversupply of Covid-vaccines and the company being in contract remediation talks with the EU.More importantly  two major catalysts are around the corner: a biologics license application for chikungunya vaccine and a Phase 3 trial for the world’s only Lyme vaccine candidate. I explain above why I see both as possibly strong catalysts for the company. Valneva  apparently still quite unknown to the greater public although it has a market cap of more than 1 billion  is trading near the low end of its 52-week range.Looking at the price volatility in June  I assume that the market has taken into account the company’s recent guidance on contract remediation talks with the EU. The caveat is that the market has not fully discounted this yet. I am rating this company as a buy in light of the upcoming catalysts  and in light of the tremendous potential coming from both the chikungunya and Lyme vaccine business as set out above. Pfizer recently took an equity investment of 8.1% and has shown repeated and ever stronger interest in the company’s Lyme vaccine candidate.,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.03,mixed,0.29,0.07,0.64,True,English,"['Valneva Stock', 'Vaccine Business', 'Lyme Love', 'Catalysts', 'Pfizer', 'NASDAQ', 'enterotoxigenic E.

Maersk Drilling Shareholders are advised that exercising the shareholder rights attached to the Topco Offer Shares will differ from the manner of exercise of shareholder rights attached to their Maersk Drilling Shares and will require the participation from Cede & Co.  DTC  Computershare and Euronext Securities Copenhagen. Further  Maersk Drilling Shareholders should note that such exercise of certain shareholder rights may be connected with fees or other expenses.Topco is also offering each Maersk Drilling Shareholder the opportunity to elect to receive Cash Consideration (the ""Cash Election""). To the extent a Maersk Drilling Shareholder makes a Cash Election  the Cash Consideration will be the amount of USD 46.79 (DKK 340.98) per Maersk Drilling Share (calculated as the product of (A) the number of Maersk Drilling Shares subject to the Cash Election  (B) the Exchange Ratio and (C) USD 29.00  which represents the volume-weighted average closing price of the Noble Shares for the 10 trading days ending on the date two business days prior to the publication of the Offer Document  up to the amount of USD 1 000 per Maersk Drilling shareholder  payable in DKK (with such amount payable in DKK translated from USD at the currency rate of 7.2876) (the ""Cash Consideration"")  subject to an aggregate cash consideration cap of USD 50 million (the ""Cash Consideration Cap"")). A Maersk Drilling Shareholder holding Maersk Drilling Shares exceeding a value of USD 1 000 in the aggregate cannot elect to receive less than USD 1 000 in Cash Consideration if it makes a Cash Election. In the event the aggregate Cash Consideration to be paid in the Exchange Offer exceeds the Cash Consideration Cap  each Maersk Drilling shareholder making the Cash Election shall receive their pro rata portion of the Cash Consideration and will receive Share Consideration in respect of their remaining tendered Maersk Drilling Shares.Conditions to the Exchange OfferCompletion of the Exchange Offer is subject to certain conditions  which include the receipt of approval from the UK Competition and Markets Authority  Topco having obtained acceptances  or otherwise having acquired shares  representing at least 80% (which percentage may be lowered by Topco in its sole discretion to not less than 70%) of the outstanding share capital and voting rights of Maersk Drilling  excluding any Maersk Drilling treasury shares  the shares of Topco having been approved for listing on the NYSE and admission to trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen as well as certain other customary conditions. Topco may waive or reduce the scope of any of the conditions to completion that are not satisfied.Declarations from Maersk Drilling ShareholdersAPMH Invest which holds approximately 42% of the issued and outstanding Maersk Drilling Shares  has entered into an irrevocable undertaking (the ""Undertaking"") with Noble  Topco and Maersk Drilling  pursuant to which APMH Invest has  among other things  agreed to: (a) accept the Exchange Offer in respect of the Maersk Drilling Shares that it owns and not withdraw such acceptance; (b) waive the right to receive any Cash Consideration in the Exchange Offer; (c) not vote in favor of any resolution to approve a competing alternative proposal; and (d) subject to certain exceptions  be bound by certain transfer restrictions with respect to the Maersk Drilling Shares that it owns. However  the Undertaking may lapse under certain specific circumstances as further set out in the Offer Document and Exemption Document.In addition  A.P. Møller og Hustru Chastine Mc-Kinney Møllers Familiefond and Den A.P. Møllerske Støttefond  together holding approximately 12% of Maersk Drilling's total share capital and voting rights  have expressed their intention to accept or procure the acceptance of the Exchange Offer in respect of the Maersk Drilling Shares that they own.Acceptance of the Exchange OfferAcceptance of the Exchange Offer must be received by Danske Bank A/S (in its capacity as settlement agent for the Exchange Offer) through the Maersk Drilling Shareholder's own account holding institution prior to the expiration of the Offer Period (subject to any extension of the Offer Period in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer).Maersk Drilling Shareholders wishing to accept the Exchange Offer may use the acceptance form attached to the Offer Document. Maersk Drilling Shareholders may also be able to tender Maersk Drilling Shares online via their account holding institution's web bank solution. Additional information concerning the acceptance procedure for the Exchange Offer is included in the Offer Document.The time until which notification of acceptance to the account holding institution may be given will depend upon the respective Maersk Drilling Shareholder's agreement with  and the rules and procedures of  the relevant account holding institution and may be earlier than the last day of the Offer Period.The use of interim acceptance shares in the Exchange OfferIn order to allow the Maersk Drilling Shareholders to continue to trade their interests in their Maersk Drilling Shares after tendering their Maersk Drilling Shares in the Exchange Offer  and to facilitate the technical aspects of settlement of the Exchange Offer  Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance Shares  as applicable  will be issued and allocated to tendering Maersk Drilling Shareholders.Upon acceptance of the Exchange Offer  all Maersk Drilling Shares validly tendered in the Exchange Offer will be transferred to a separate securities account with Euronext Securities Copenhagen in the name of Danske Bank A/S and a specific transfer restriction with respect to such tendered Maersk Drilling Shares will be entered into the book-entry account system.Simultaneously  a number of interim acceptance shares corresponding to such number of Maersk Drilling Shares tendered in the Exchange Offer will be recorded on each respective Maersk Drilling Shareholder's account with Euronext Securities Copenhagen and issued in the interim ISIN code DK0061803103 (the ""Acceptance Shares""). Each Acceptance Share received by Maersk Drilling Shareholders represents the right to receive 1.6137 Topco Offer Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number) upon completion of the Exchange Offer.Following expiration of the Offer Period  the holders of Acceptance Shares (the ""Acceptance Share Holders"")  may  during a period commencing on 12 September 2022 and ending on 26 September 2022 at 11:59 p.m. CEST  based on an offer period expiring on 8 September 2022 and subject to any potential extensions of the Offer Period  choose to exercise the Cash Election in the Exchange Offer  whereby the Acceptance Share Holder's Acceptance Shares will be exchanged for interim cash acceptance shares issued in the separate interim ISIN code  DK0061803293  and representing a right to receive Cash Consideration (the ""Cash Acceptance Shares""). For further information on the exercise of the Cash Election reference is made to the Offer Document.The Acceptance Shares have been approved for trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen in the interim ISIN code DK0061803103 under the symbol ""DC accept shares"" during the period commencing on 10 August 2022 at 9:00 a.m. CEST and ending on 28 September 2022 at 5:00 p.m. CEST. Similarly  the Cash Acceptance Shares have been conditionally approved for trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen in the interim ISIN code DK0061803293 under the symbol ""DC accept cash"" during the period commencing on 12 September 2022 at 9:00 a.m. CEST and ending on 28 September 2022 at 5:00 p.m. CEST. In case the Offer Period is extended  the period for which the Acceptance Shares are admitted to trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen will be extended accordingly and the first day of trading of the Cash Acceptance Shares will be postponed.On the date of settlement of the Exchange Offer  the Acceptance Shares will automatically be exchanged for A ordinary shares of Topco (in the form of share entitlements) at the Exchange Ratio in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer and the Cash Acceptance Shares will be automatically exchanged for Cash Consideration. In connection with the Acceptance Shares being automatically exchanged for A ordinary shares of Topco (in the form of share entitlements) and the Cash Acceptance Shares being automatically exchanged for Cash Consideration  the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares will cease to exist.In case of fractions of A ordinary shares of Topco (in the form of share entitlements)  the number of A ordinary shares (in the form of share entitlements) such Acceptance Share Holder shall receive under the Exchange Offer will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of A ordinary shares (in the form of share entitlements)  and any entitlement to fractional A ordinary shares of Topco (in the form of share entitlements) will be settled in cash.The A ordinary shares of Topco to be delivered as Share Consideration in the Exchange Offer will be delivered in the form of share entitlements book-entered in the Euronext Securities Copenhagen securities system  representing A ordinary shares in Topco  credited to the account of Computershare Trust Company  N.A. in the name of Euronext Securities Copenhagen (as further described in the Exemption Document and the Offer Document). Maersk Drilling Shareholders should be advised that the legal nature of such share entitlements and how shareholder rights are exercised are different from what otherwise applies to ordinary shares in Danish companies with shares admitted to trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen.As the Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance Shares are admitted to trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen  acceptances tendered early in the Offer Period will not restrict Maersk Drilling Shareholders from trading their interests in their Maersk Drilling Shares (in the form of trading Acceptance Shares or Cash Acceptance Shares  as applicable).The issuance of Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance Shares and the process for exercising the Cash Election is a technical procedure required to facilitate settlement of the Exchange Offer and is part of the settlement of the Exchange Offer. At the time when the Acceptance Share Holders are afforded the opportunity to exercise the Cash Election as described herein  the Offer Period will have ended  and all Acceptance Share Holders will be bound by their acceptance of the Exchange Offer.Until settlement of the Exchange Offer  the liquidity and market prices of the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares under the interim ISIN codes may be substantially different from the liquidity and market price of the Maersk Drilling shares. All dealings in the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares prior to settlement of the Exchange Offer will be for the account of  and at the sole risk of  the parties involved.If Topco does not complete the Exchange Offer  any Acceptance Shares and/or Cash Acceptance Shares held will be exchanged back into a corresponding number of Maersk Drilling Shares in the individual holders of Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptances Shares' book-entry securities accounts with Euronext Securities Copenhagen as soon as technically possible after a notification by Topco that it will not complete the Exchange Offer. In such case  no compensation will be paid to holders of Acceptance Shares or Cash Acceptance Shares.The value of the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares depends on the market price of the Maersk Drilling Shares and the expected market price of the Topco Shares  and  with respect to the Cash Acceptance Shares  the Cash Consideration expected to be payable in the Exchange Offer. Ultimately  the market price of the Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance will be dependent on the price attributed to the Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance Shares by the market and no stabilisation will be conducted in connection with the Exchange Offer. A decline in the market price of the Maersk Drilling shares could have an adverse effect on the value and market price of the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares.The market for the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares may be limited and may only offer limited liquidity  and if a trading market develops  the price of the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares may be subject to greater or lower volatility. This could make it difficult for individual holders to sell their Acceptance Shares and/or the Cash Acceptance Shares.Admission to trading and official listing of the shares of TopcoTopco intends to take the steps necessary for all shares of Topco (which for the purpose of the admission to trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S (""Nasdaq Copenhagen"") shall be in the form of share entitlements) to be admitted to trading and official listing on the regulated market Nasdaq Copenhagen. To effect such admission to trading and official listing  Topco will prior to completion of the Exchange Offer submit an application to Nasdaq Copenhagen for the admission to trading and official listing of the shares of Topco as well as prepare and publish a prospectus to be approved in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation (the ""Listing Prospectus""). The first day of trading is expected to be 3 October 2022.In addition  Topco also intends to take the steps necessary for all shares of Topco to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the ""NYSE""). The listing on NYSE is expected to take place on or about 30 September 2022. Upon closing of the Exchange Offer  Topco expects that the shares of Topco will be dually-listed and tradable on both NYSE and Nasdaq Copenhagen.Compulsory purchaseUpon the consummation of the Exchange Offer  if more than 90% of the issued and outstanding Maersk Drilling Shares  including the attaching voting rights  are acquired by Topco  Topco will redeem any Maersk Drilling Shares not exchanged in the Exchange Offer by Topco for  at the election of the holder  either Topco Shares or cash (or  for those holders that do not make an election  only cash) under Danish law by way of a compulsory purchase.DelistingTopco intends to delist the Maersk Drilling Shares from Nasdaq Copenhagen at an appropriate time (including  to the extent permitted by Nasdaq Copenhagen  if upon completion of the Exchange Offer  Topco holds less than 90% of all Maersk Drilling Shares and voting rights of Maersk Drilling  excluding any treasury shares held by Maersk Drilling). If delisting is achieved  Topco will in due course initiate amendments to the articles of association of Maersk Drilling to reflect that Maersk Drilling is no longer listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen.Timetable for the Exchange OfferThe following timetable sets forth certain key dates relating to the Exchange Offer  provided that the Offer Period has not been extended in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer:10 August 2022 Commencement of Offer Period 10 August 2022 First day of trading of the Acceptance Shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen 8 September 2022at 11:59 p.m. CEST Expected expiration of the Offer Period (subject to extension of the Offer Period) 8 September 2022 Expected publication of the Listing Prospectus 9 September 2022before 5:59 p.m. CEST Latest expected announcement of an extension  withdrawal or satisfaction of theconditions to completion of the Exchange Offer and  in the case of satisfaction of theconditions to completion  the preliminary result of the Exchange Offer 12 September 2022 Commencement of the period for holders of Acceptance Shares to make Cash Elections 12 September 2022 First day of trading of the Cash Acceptance Shares 13 September 2022 Announcement of the final result of the Exchange Offer 26 September 2022at 11:59 p.m. CEST Expiration of the period for holders of Acceptance Share to make Cash Elections 28 September 2022 Last day of trading of Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance Shares 3 October 2022 Completion of the Exchange Offer by the issuance by Euronext Securities Copenhagenof the Topco Offer Shares in the form of share entitlements and the exchange of(i) Acceptance Shares for Topco Offer Shares in the form of share entitlements issued byEuronext Securities Copenhagen (with any fractional shares being settled in cash) and(ii) Cash Acceptance Shares for cash 3 October 2022 First day of trading of the shares of Topco in the form of share entitlements on Nasdaq CopenhagenThe timetable above is subject to change  including in the event that the Offer Period is extended in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer.
