On that basis  the Company expects that its resources will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditure requirements through at least February 2023.Thomas Kuhn  Chief Executive Officer of Poxel  stated: “We have an important milestone coming up this quarter with the topline results of the Phase 2 DESTINY-1 study for PXL065 in NASH. We have thus been working diligently these past months to extend our cash runway to capitalize on this opportunity and independently finance our strategy in rare diseases. Together  the successful completion of the debt restructuring and the equity-linked financing facility not only improves the Company’s balance sheet to support ongoing operations  but both agreements also provide further flexibility to finalize additional financing initiatives  including ongoing active partnership discussions related to our programs. We continue to work towards the initiation of our planned Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trials in adrenoleukodystrophy which represent the foundation of our rare disease strategy.”The Company has entered into an agreement with IPF to restructure its debt  resulting in the postponement of the Q3 2022 and Q4 2022 amortization payments under the existing debt facility  and lowering certain financial covenants until the end of January 2023.Edouard Guillet  Partner at IPF Partners  commented: “With this agreement to restructure the existing debt facility  we are pleased to provide Poxel with increased flexibility to complete its other financing initiatives which we strongly believe will be finalized in the near future and will allow Poxel to execute on its robust strategy in rare diseases.”Concurrently  the Company has entered into an equity-linked financing arrangement with IRIS for an initial gross amount of EUR 4 million  with the option  at the latest on December 31  2022 and at the Company’s sole discretion  to draw a second and third tranche of up to EUR 1 million each. Upon conversion of the equity-linked instruments  IRIS will be issued Poxel shares to be created from the Company’s authorized capital and is expected to sell these newly issued shares on the market or in block trades. The equity-linked financing is intended to provide additional liquidity in support of the Company’s ongoing regulatory and development activities as well as general corporate purposes.Based on:its cash position at June 30  2022  the current development plan of the Company including 1) the completion of its ongoing Phase 2 NASH trial for PXL065 (DESTINY-1) but excluding 2) the two identical Phase 2a clinical proof-of-concept (POC) biomarker studies for PXL065 and PXL770 in adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  the cash forecast for the year 2022 approved by the Board of Directors of the Company  that does not include  as a conservative approach  any net royalties from Imeglimin in Japan  a strict control of its operating expenses  and the amendment to the IPF debt facility with the postponement of the Q3 2022 and Q4 2022 amortization payments until end of February 2023  as well as a full drawdown of all tranches of the equity-linked financing arrangement with IRIS for a total amount of EUR 6 million  before December 31  2022 the Company expects that its resources will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditure requirements through at least February 2023.The Company is actively pursuing additional financing options  prioritizing non-dilutive sources  including ongoing active partnership discussions related to its programs.Debt Restructuring with IPFWith the objective to extend its cash runway  the Company has entered into an agreement with IPF to restructure its existing debt  consisting of postponing repayment of EUR 3.2 million  corresponding to Q3 2022 and Q4 2022 amortizations  until February 2023.In addition  IPF and the Company agreed to temporarily amend the financial covenants of the debt facility until 31 January 2023 so that no breach occurs before February 2023  independently of any other potential additional financing of the Company. Under the revised financial covenants  the Company shall maintain a minimum cash position between EUR 15 million and EUR 10 million through January 2023. After such date  the previously existing financial covenants will be reinstated 1 .. The amendment of the debt facility also includes an increase of 3% of the PIK margin (in addition to the existing 2% PIK). IPF shall also be entitled to a fee payable at the maturity date of each tranche and set at a total amount of approximately EUR 4 million.Should the Company close a financing transaction of a minimum amount of EUR 15 million  and subject to the then applicable debt to market capitalization gearing ratio of the Company  Poxel will partially prepay IPF debt with an amount up to 20% of the proceeds of such transaction as a partial early debt repayment  which would reduce the Company’s indebtedness. Such early repayment shall consist in principal and shall not include any early repayment fee.As part of the amendment agreement  IPF will be appointed as an observer to the Company’s Board of Directors. IPF will have the same right to information as the Directors and may participate in meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company in an advisory capacity but will not have any voting rights.The terms of the existing warrants held by IPF which were attached to the Tranche 1  2 and 3 bonds giving right to subscribe 630 804 shares at respectively €7.37  €7.14  €6.72 per warrant for each Tranche  remain unchanged and thus trigger no potential additional dilution.Equity-linked financing with IRISLegal basis of issuanceActing on the delegation of the Board of Directors and in accordance with the 17th resolution of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of June 21  2022  the Company decided to implement this equity-linked financing  provided by IRIS  a venture capital firm specialized in providing financing solutions to listed companies.Operation objectivesThis funding aims to increase the Company’s cash position to support its operations. Proceeds shall be used mainly to support ongoing regulatory and development activities as well as general corporate purposes.Operation arrangementsIn accordance with the terms of the agreement  IRIS  acting as a specialized investor without a strategy to retain a stake in the Company’s share capital  has committed to subscribe to bonds convertible into new ordinary shares of the Company for an initial amount of EUR 4 million. At the Company’s sole discretion  two additional tranches of EUR 1 million each  may be drawn down in Q4 2022.IRIS has the right to request the conversion of its bonds into new ordinary shares of the Company at any time in one or several occasions until full repayment of the bonds. The issuance of shares upon conversion of the bonds shall be made on each conversion date on the basis of the average volume weighted share price over the last trading day preceding each issue  less a discount of 8%  subject to a floor corresponding to the average volume weighted share price over the twenty trading days preceding each issue  less a discount of 20%.During the term of the financing  IRIS is expected to sell the newly issued shares received upon conversion of the convertible bonds on the market or in block trades. In connection with the financing  Poxel will issue shares out of its authorized share capital in accordance with the 17th resolution of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of June 21  2022 with excluded pre-emptive rights of the existing shareholders for the benefit of certain category of investors.The new shares issued under the terms of this agreement shall be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris.No application for admission to trading on any market whatsoever will be made for the convertible bonds.Considering the anticipated number of shares to be issued upon conversion of the convertible bonds issued  based on the share price of the Company on the last trading day preceding the date of this press release  this operation does not give rise at this stage to publication of a prospectus to be submitted to the approval by the French securities regulator  the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF). Should a prospectus be required in the future due to a potentially higher than expected issuance of shares  the Company and IRIS have agreed that the issuance program will be suspended for a maximum period of three months  until such prospectus has been approved by the AMF.On the basis of the issuance of all three tranches of the financing facility with IRIS and the average price weighted by volumes of the Company’s share during the last trading day preceding the date of this press release  the stake of a shareholder with 1% of the Company’s share capital would decrease to 0.91%  i.e. a 9% dilution. As a reminder  based on the decisions of the general assembly meeting of the shareholders on June 21  2022  the Company's board on July 29  2022  and the CEO decision dated August 5  2022  the maximum number of shares to be issued on redemption of convertible bonds is currently set at 15 800 000 shares. Should this maximum amount apply  the stake of a shareholder holding 1% of the Company’s share capital would decrease to 0.65%  i.e. a 35% dilution.To the Company's knowledge  on the basis of the same assumptions  the distribution of its share capital before and after redemption of all the convertible bonds in newly issued shares will be as follows:Shareholders Before the transaction After the transaction (on the basis of the drawdown of all Tranches and the average price weighted by Company’s share volumes during the last trading day preceding the date of this press release) After the transaction (on the basis of the maximum potential dilution authorized by the general assembly meeting of the shareholders under the 17th resolution) Number ofshares % ofcapital Number ofshares % of capital Number ofshares % of capital Founders 2 778 947 9.6% 2 778 947 8.7% 2 778 947 6.2% Bpifrance 5 753 662 19.9% 5 753 662 18.1% 5 753 662 12.9% Free float 20 420 041 70.5% 23 318 311 73.2% 36 220 041 80.9% Total 28 952 650 100.0% 31 850 920 100.0% 44 752 650 100.0%The Company will make available to investors on its website an up-to-date summary chart of its outstanding convertible bonds and the number of shares in circulation.The public’s attention is drawn to the risk factors relative to the Company and its business  presented in its universal registration document filed with the AMF on 4 May 2022  which is available on the Company’s website.

By way of illustration  assuming issuance of all the convertible bonds and the average price weighted by volumes of the Company’s share during the last trading day preceding the date of this press release  i.e.€2.07  the number of new Company shares for subscription by the Investor on redemption of the convertible bonds in new shares would be 2 898 270 shares  representing approximately 10.0% of the share capital (on a non-diluted basis). Based on the same assumptions  the number of new Company shares for subscription by the Investor on redemption of the convertible bonds in new shares for Tranche I only would be 1 932 180 shares representing approximately 6.7% of the share capital (on a non-diluted basis)  and the number of new Company shares for subscription by the Investor on redemption of the convertible bonds in new shares for each of Tranche II and III only would be 483 045 shares representing approximately 1.7% of the share capital (on a non-diluted basis).On the date of this press release  the Company has a share capital of €579 053 divided into 28 952 650 ordinary shares Share Loan Agreement As part of the equity-linked financing  certain shareholders of the Company have undertaken to loan part of their shares to IRIS.

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announced the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  t…,"NEW YORK & SAINT-HERBLAIN  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announced the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of their investigational Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15.“ With increasing global rates of Lyme disease  providing a new option for people to help protect themselves from the disease is more important than ever ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. “ We hope that the data generated from the Phase 3 study will further support the positive evidence for VLA15 to date  and we are looking forward to collaborating with the research sites across the U.S. and Europe on this important trial.""Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “ We are extremely pleased to reach this important milestone in the development of VLA15. Lyme disease continues to spread  representing a high unmet medical need that impacts the lives of many in the Northern Hemisphere. We look forward to further investigating the VLA15 candidate in Phase 3  which will take us a step closer to potentially bringing this vaccine to both adults and children who would benefit from it.”The randomized  placebo-controlled  Phase 3 VALOR study is planned to enroll approximately 6 000 participants 5 years of age and older. The study is being conducted at up to 50 sites located in areas where Lyme disease is highly endemic  including Finland  Germany  the Netherlands  Poland  Sweden and the United States. Participants will receive three doses of VLA15 180 µg or saline placebo as a primary vaccination series followed by one booster dose of VLA15 or saline placebo (1:1 ratio).Data from the Phase 2 studies continue to demonstrate strong immunogenicity in adults as well as in children  with acceptable safety and tolerability profiles in both study populations.1 2 Pending successful completion of the Phase 3 study  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.As per the terms of the collaboration agreement between Pfizer and Valneva  Pfizer will make a $25 million milestone payment to Valneva upon initiation of the Phase 3 study.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.3 4 The terms of the collaboration agreement include a $25 million milestone payment made to Valneva upon Pfizer’s initiation of the Phase 3 study. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.5About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States and 130 000 people in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.8About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

One of our key objectives these past months has been to extend our cash runway to leverage this opportunity and independently finance our strategy in rare diseases. The two agreements announced today  the debt restructuring along with the equity-linked financing facility  provide further flexibility to finalize additional financing initiatives  including ongoing active partnership discussions related to our programs. In addition  we will continue our work to initiate our Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies in adrenoleukodystrophy which represent the foundation of our rare disease strategy ” said Thomas Kuhn  Chief Executive Officer of Poxel. “We have also had key regulatory achievements this year  including Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation granted by the FDA for PXL065 and PXL770 in ALD. In addition  the recent patent approval of a new solid form of PXL065 is an important addition to the protection of this compound and significantly extends its exclusivity.”Commercial UpdateTWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)As of June 30  2022  royalty revenue to Poxel based on TWYMEEG net sales in Japan under the Sumitomo Pharma license agreement has been limited following TWYMEEG’s commercial launch on September 16  2021. TWYMEEG’s initial commercial uptake has been affected by restrictions in Japan on prescribing any new drug in its first year of commercialization  and conditions related to COVID-19  which have reduced the frequency of physician visits and limited the extensive prescriber education efforts required for any launch of an innovative drug with a new mechanism of action. However  as a result of Sumitomo Pharma's promotional activities and efforts since launch  TWYMEEG is very well known among prescribers.Clinical UpdatesNASHPXL065 (deuterium-stabilised R-pioglitazone) is in a Phase 2 study (DESTINY-1). Results from this 36-week  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  dose-ranging study designed to assess efficacy and safety are anticipated  as planned  in Q3 2022. The goal of DESTINY-1 is to identify the optimal dose or doses of PXL065 to advance into a Phase 3 registration trial for the treatment of noncirrhotic biopsy-proven NASH patients.Rare metabolic diseasesIn ALD  two Phase 2a biomarker proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trials of PXL065 and PXL770 are expected to initiate as soon as possible  subject to additional financing. These two identical studies will enroll adult male patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)  the most common ALD subtype. The POC studies will evaluate the pharmacokinetics  safety and efficacy of PXL065 and PXL770 after 12 weeks of treatment based on relevant disease biomarkers  such as the effect on very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)  the characteristic plasma marker of the disease.In February and April  the FDA awarded Fast Track Designation (FTD) to PXL065 and PXL770 respectively  for ALD. The FDA grants FTD to investigational drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition  and which fill an unmet medical need. Filling an unmet medical need is defined as providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available therapy. The key benefits of FTD comprise enhanced access to the FDA  with regular and more frequent opportunities for consultation and discussion.In May  the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) 1 to PXL065 and PXL770 for ALD. ODD confers a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received.to PXL065 and PXL770 for ALD. ODD confers a company a potential seven-year window of exclusive marketing rights following FDA approval  along with a reduction in certain application fees  and tax credits for expenses related to qualified clinical trials conducted after orphan designation is received. Two preclinical articles on X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) for PXL065 and PXL770 were published: The article on PXL065 was published in The Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (“JIMD”) and is entitled “ Therapeutic potential of deuterium-stabilized (R)-pioglitazone - PXL065 - for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ”. It is available here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35510808/. The article on PXL770 was published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (“JPET”)   and is entitled “ Beneficial effects of the direct AMP-Kinase activator PXL770 in in vitro and in vivo models of X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy”. It is available here: https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/early/2022/06/25/jpet.122.001208.Corporate UpdateIn June  the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) issued a new patent for PXL065 that describes a specific form of PXL065 with unique properties. Importantly  this recently issued patent provides additional protection through 2041 and could expand protection for PXL065 worldwide  with the potential for an additional 5 years through patent term extension.On June 21  2022  Poxel held its annual general meeting. The shareholders approved all the resolutions that were recommended by the Board of Directors.

8753,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4531344-valneva-stock-vaccine-business-catalysts-ahead-pfizers-lyme-love,Valneva Stock: Vaccine Business  Catalysts Ahead  And Pfizer's Lyme Love (NASDAQ:VALN),Valneva is a specialty vaccines company with an ongoing travelers vaccine business. Check out the catalysts that bode well for VALN stock here.,VioletaStoimenovaThesisValneva (NASDAQ:VALN) is a French specialty vaccines company which has not been covered on Seeking Alpha after its Nasdaq IPO  even though it sports a market cap of $1.1 billion.It has operating sites all over the world  four of which in Europe and one in both Canada and the US  and has +750 employees worldwide. It has an ongoing travelers health business which I believe may report good results in the coming quarter  probably also with R&D expenses for the quarter reduced.VLA2001  Valneva’s inactivated Covid-vaccine which has strong efficacy across different variants  a good safety profile and booster potential  is currently suffering from an oversupply of Covid-vaccines  at least in the Western world. There may be an occasion here in the longer term  as a shift towards better vaccines than those currently used occurs.In the second half of 2022  Valneva will file for a biologics license application (BLA) for VLA1553  its Chikungunya vaccine candidate. This vaccine candidate has fast-track designation in the US  prime designation in the EU  and is eligible for a priority review voucher. VLA1553 has shown excellent safety and immunogenicity results and seems best placed to become the go-to vaccine for this disease.In the third quarter of 2022  Valneva will initiate a Phase 3 trial for VLA15  the world’s only Lyme vaccine candidate  which is again shown to be safe and efficacious. Pfizer (PFE) co-develops this vaccine  has provided serious funding  will pay more as milestones progress  and has just recently taken an 8.1% stake in Valneva.I see a buying opportunity here  with two important catalysts ahead  i.e. the BLA for the chikungunya vaccine and the Phase 3 trial initiation for the Lyme vaccine candidate. The fact that Pfizer saw the interest in the Lyme vaccine adds to my conviction.With about €300 million in the bank  I believe the market’s current valuation of Valneva is too low. I do see one caveat  and that would be that the market hasn’t fully discounted poor revenue coming from Valneva’s Covid vaccine.The current share priceThe company trades both on Euronext and on the Nasdaq  with much less liquidity on the latter.On Euronext  it trades under the ticker 'VLA'  with a year-high of €29.7 and a year-low of €7.26. Its one-year chart is as follows. Trading on Euronext is more liquid.Valneva stock price chart Euronext (Google)On the Nasdaq  where the company trades under the ticker 'VALN'  its yearly trading range is in between $67.84 and $13.71  with the company now trading around $20. Contrary to Euronext  there is little liquidity on the Nasdaq.There has been volatility in the stock price lately due to negative sentiment surrounding the commercial viability of the Covid vaccine program on the one hand  and positive sentiment relating to the recent €90.5 million stake of Pfizer in Valneva on the other.I will cover Valneva’s portfolio below as a function of each asset’s maturity in the business. I see most potential in both the chikungunya and Lyme disease candidates. Contrary to its Covid-vaccine  I believe those vaccines will not face serious competition  if any  once approved. Hence  I am looking at this company in part as a biotech company with a high-value late-stage pipeline  a fully operational manufacturing and commercial team  and a recovering ongoing business.Valneva’s ongoing business: traveler health portfolio and third-party distributionValneva’s Traveler Health portfolio includes two vaccines  Ixiaro/Jespect and Dukoral  and encompasses vaccines for those traveling to other countries. Ixiaro  commercialized under the name Jespect  is a vaccine for Japanese encephalitis. Dukoral is a vaccine for the cholera and prevention of diarrhea resulting from an enterotoxigenic E. Coli bacteria.This business  covering approvals in most countries in the Western world  had been heavily impacted by travel restrictions and Covid-related lockdowns  mostly in 2020. Revenues declined from $130 million in 2019 to $66 million in 2020 and $63 million 2021  which still saw an impact from the pandemic. US soldiers travel too  and Valneva in fact derives quite some revenue from its long-standing relationship with the US government. The US military has an ongoing 3-year supply contract with Valneva for Ixiaro  and has been using that vaccine for more than 10 years already. The total minimum value of this contract is $118 million.I expect Valneva to report good numbers here for the second and third quarter of 2022.Valneva also commercializes third-party products such as Moskito Guard  Encepur  Flucelvax Tetra  Fluad  Kamrab and Rabipur  amounting to $15.4 million in 2021. It also has some minor other revenues.VLA2001  an inactivated COVID-19 vaccineVLA2001 is an inactivated virus vaccine which has shown robust efficacy and safety against different variants. It applies the same technology as Ixiaro’s  and consists of inactivated Covid-19 particles with preservation of the native structure of Covid-19’s spike-protein. It can be stored at cold chain temperatures (2-8° Celsius)  can be used as primary vaccination or as a booster  and is suitable for routine immunization in the longer term. The Phase 3 trial results showed superiority in neutralizing antibody levels and a better safety profile compared to AZD1222  another EMA-approved vaccine. It has received standard marketing authorization in the EU  conditional marketing authorization in the UK  and emergency use authorization in Bahrain and the UAE. Q3 2022 should see Valneva readout its booster data  which I do not expect the market to react to.Here comes the catch though. Due to oversupply of vaccines in the Western world at this  this vaccine has yet to turn into a commercial success.The UK government had terminated its contract to order several million doses in 2021  which has led to a +$200 million settlement agreement in that year  which led the company to report total revenue of €348.1 for that year  compared to €110.3 million in 2021. I do add that 2020 and 2021 were weak years as the company’s travelers health portfolio revenue was seriously impacted by Covid. In 2019  revenue from the travelers health portfolio had been €129.5 million.The EU has recently expressed its wish to terminate its supply agreement with Valneva to supply up to 60 million doses over a period of two years  which led the stock to sell-off to its year-low in June 2022. The company is in talks with the EU about a remediation plan  as several EU countries have expressed their wish to receive the vaccine. I have seen an analyst write that Valneva may accept a ‘best-we-can-do’ offer to reduce stock inventories. Valneva has nonetheless clearly stated that  if volume indications would be too low  commercialization would not be sustainable. In that sense  I believe the company will have to revise its sales guidance expressed for 2022  but I believe the market has taken that into account.In the longer run  as the world may be ready for better and longer-lasting vaccines than the ones that are currently mainstream  this vaccine may attract business.VLA1553  the chikungunya vaccine candidateVLA1553 is one of three chikungunya vaccine candidates in development  probably best-in-class and furthest-progressed.Chikungunya is carried by mosquitoes in tropical and sub-tropical environments such as the Americas  India  and Thailand. It is prone to cause outbreaks among the population with a severe economic impact. Morbidity is low  but the inflammatory burden and persistent joint pain have a debilitating impact.VLA1553 overview slide (Valneva corporate presentation)The Phase 3 trial results showed outstanding immunogenicity and led to protective chikungunya neutralizing antibody titers in 98.5% of participants 28 days after single-dose administration. That 98.5% seroprotection rate exceeded the bar of 70% that had been agreed with the FDA. VLA1553 has basically been racking up regulator’s favoritism  with fast-track and prime designation respectively by the FDA and the EMA  and breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA in July 2021. Valneva is now likely to receive a priority review voucher  as sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine to be approved in the US.Valneva would include VLA1553 in its travelers health portfolio with approval in the US and the EU underway. It has also entered into an agreement with the Brazilian ‘instituto butantan’ to commercialize this vaccine for less developed countries.Valneva is about to file for a BLA any time now  as it had been announced for mid-2022. I believe this could be a substantial catalyst for this drug candidate. Upon approval  launch can be expected soon after  with the plus here that Valneva has its commercial network set up already.In a global market which is to exceed $500 million by 2032  it can capture that market upon approval and establish its go-to position for years to come. I have read an analyst forecast risk-adjusted peak sales of €260 million by 2028. The above means that upon approval  this business has the potential of tripling the current sales revenue over time.VLA15  the Lyme disease vaccine candidateVLA15 is the biggest horse in the stable in my eyes  as the only Lyme vaccine candidate in the world  with outstanding Phase 2 data  which came in different sets of data over different studies  and huge Pfizer backing/involvement. Lyme disease is commonly known to most people. It is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria  is transmitted by ticks and highly present in several regions of the Western world  where it expands more and more due to climate change.Lyme disease incidence slide (Valneva corporate presentation)Most patients recover  but 10-20% have persistent and sometimes disabling issues such as ongoing fatigue. There is currently no vaccine for Lyme disease available in the world  and although antibiotic treatments may provide relief  these generally come too late because detection of the disease is slow  and the therapeutic window passes.VLA15 has shown strong immune responses across 6 different serotypes. In April 2022  Valneva has reported results of its phase 2 pediatric study showing strong immunogenicity and an outstanding safety profile. These results build on earlier successful Phase 2 results  which is perhaps why the market has not given them much attention  if any.The upcoming catalyst here is the initiation of a phase 3 trial the second half of 2022  the results of which could be expected by year-end 2023.In the US and Europe combined  about 700 000 people each year are diagnosed with Lyme disease  with this number on the rise due to climate change.Pfizer and Valneva have a co-development and co-commercialization partnership here  with development-costs being split 60/40 for Pfizer and Valneva  respectively  and Valneva eligible for milestone payments. Of these milestone payment  $168 million are still to be paid. Initiation of the Phase 3 study  which is for any time now  will lead to a $25 million payment.The Pfizer involvement should ensure perfect marketing and commercialization potential. The most recent terms of the royalty agreement  as recently revised  are tiered royalties ranging from 14% to 22%. Add to that  Valneva is eligible for up to $100 million in milestone payment from Pfizer based on cumulative sales. I will also add to that  Pfizer is flush with cash and apparently on a buying spree. Latest rumors  as reiterated in this Seeking Alpha editor coverage on prognosis for the biotech sector in the current quarter  include rumors of Pfizer being in talks to buy Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) in a $5 billion deal. In my earlier Cardiff Oncology (CRDF) coverage  I had recalled how earlier Pfizer equity investments led to buyouts. An 8.1% stake of Pfizer may bode well here  but I have difficulties to believe that would be a short-term scenario as parties have just revised their deal. I’ll add that Pfizer seems most interested in Valneva’s Lyme business  which I assume could not be included in Valneva’s travelers health portfolio.If one would assume a 400-million-person worldwide market with 3% penetration (i.e. 12 million)  and pricing of $100 in the US and €50 in the EU which would be equally split between the two main markets  one arrives at sales numbers of $1.2 billion and €600 million  respectively. Assuming royalties to be around 18% (the middle of 14% and 22%)  revenues would be $216 million for the US and €108 million for the EU. These are only vague estimates at this stage  as pricing is unknown and the concrete markets are unexplored  but they do give an idea of the value-driving potential here. Pfizer is seeing it  and again  there is no competition for this vaccine in the pipeline.First quarter 2022 results and second quarter expectationsThe results reported by Valneva for Q1 2022 were about the same as those reported for the year before. Total revenue was €21.8 million compared to €23.2 million in 2021  with product sales of €16.2 million compared to €16.1 million in 2021  and with first COVID-19 vaccine sales of €3.8 million. A total of €5.6 million were derived from other revenues  compared to €7.1 million in 2021.As Valneva’s business had been severely impacted by Covid-measures  I expect to see an uptick in business results for the coming quarter  as people are resuming travel again similar to pre-pandemic times to countries where the vaccines in the traveler’s health portfolio are of use. Valneva highlights in its corporate presentation that this business represented $130 million in 2019 when it was growing strongly (slide 18)  and is a key asset for the future.Guidance in the Q1 results on May 5  2022  was that Valneva expected its 2022 revenues to be within the range announced in February  namely €430 million to €590 million. I expect this guidance is no longer applicable in light of the recent termination or termination discussions with regards to the Covid vaccine  both in the UK and in the EU. I do believe the market has already discounted the future revision of that guidance  which one can see in the share price dip right after the Covid-update the company issued on June 10  2022.Already for the first quarter of 2022  R&D costs were reduced to €20.7 million  where they were still €27.7 the year before. This was mainly attributable to ending of the Phase 3 trial for chikungunya and lower investments for the Covid-vaccine. I don’t expect to see any major R&D costs for the second quarter of 2022  as the Phase 2 trials for Lyme disease have now also ended.The reduction of R&D expenses for Q2 2022 that I expect may also have a considerable impact on operating and EBITDA loss compared to previous quarters. For Q1 2022  Valneva’s operating loss was €18.4 million versus €31.1 million in Q1 2021. Q1 2022 adjusted EBITDA loss was €12.7 million compared to €28.3 million in Q1 2021.FinancialsThese were Valneva’s 2021 financial results as reported on March 24  2022.Valneva 2021 financial results (Valneva Full Year 2021 reporting)Total revenues in 2021 were €348.1 million  compared to €110.3 million in 2020  but of that €348.1 million  €253.3 million was attributable to a settlement under the terminated UK agreement. Revenues from normal business  affected by Covid  were €94.8 million. As these were $130 million in 2019 and were apparently on the rise  I expect Valneva to do better here in Q2 2022 than compared to last quarter or last year’s second quarter.Valneva is flush with cash and will be so for the foreseeable future. Its cash position end of March 2022 €311.3 million. In April 2020  Valneva entering into an R&D agreement with Pfizer for the Lyme vaccine candidate  which led to an upfront payment of $130 million in June 2020. Pfizer is due to pay an additional $178 in development milestones  among which $25 million when the vaccine candidate enters Phase 3 trials. In May 2021  Valneva picked up $107.6 million as a result of a global Offering and Nasdaq listing  which was followed by an additional global offering worth $102 million. The collaboration agreement with Pfizer has been adapted in June 2022  with Pfizer taking an equity investment in Valneva of 8.4% for a total of $90.5 million  and with parties agreeing a slightly different royalty split. Finally  a financing arrangement with US healthcare funds Deerfield and Orbimed led to the availability of an additional $40 million in April 2022.A fair value for Valneva’s business potentialAs mentioned above  given its pipeline  I am looking at Valneva as an ongoing business with an even bigger pipeline.With a €1.15 billion market cap and about €300 million in cash  its enterprise value would be €850 million. I would expect yearly revenues from the currently travelers health portfolio to pick to where they were in pre-Covid levels  i.e. at around €120 million or more.For me  Covid sales are unclear at this stage. With the company being in remediation talks with the EU  I can’t expect it to sit on the sidelines with such a perfect vaccine once routine immunization will become more normal. The vaccine  the only of its kind in Europe  can be used as a booster shot leading to hybrid immunity  with persistent efficacy across different variants. The company’s €430 million to €590 million total revenue for the year was largely based on Covid-sales  and that number will have to be revised downward. But I believe the market has discounted that.The company’s R&D expenses should go down as they soon won’t be related from the chikungunya vaccine candidate anymore. Pfizer is in part providing funding for the Lyme disease candidate.Approval of the chikungunya vaccine may be on the company’s doorstep  with risk-adjusted peak sales of €260 million being possible in some years' time  which means this vaccine candidate has the potential of tripling the current sales revenue of around $100 million over time. This vaccine would be included in the travelers health portfolio  for which Valneva already has a commercial team in operation  so I assume that will not lead to disproportionate additional costs.Finally  I have made an estimate above of revenues that could be derived from the world’s only Lyme vaccine backed by Pfizer at $216 million for the US and €108 million for the EU. This asset  too  is largely de-risked in my eyes  as there is no other vaccine candidate in clinical trials.One sees that the company holds the biggest potential in its two late-stage assets  with immediate catalysts around the corner.RisksThe major short-term risk I see is the market’s interpretation of possibly revised sales guidance for the year 2022. I believe Valneva has communicated well about the EU’s wish to terminate the contract for the Covid-vaccine. The company is in remediation talks  as mentioned above  but it is impossible to say at this time what will come out of that. I am  for the short-term future  not giving the Covid vaccine much value.Furthermore  if either the chikungunya vaccine candidate does not get approved  or the Lyme disease candidate would for some reason yield less positive results or show side effects in a Phase 3 trial  then the narrative here would need to be changed. I consider both risks to be low  as we are dealing with far-advanced assets which have been tested abundantly in large-scale trials.A further risk includes delayed uptake of the traveler’s health portfolio  despite a Covid-unwinding world.ConclusionValneva has an ongoing travelers health business which I assume will have done well for the past quarter  with possibly reduced R&D costs. Quarterly earnings will be reported on August 11  2022  so we will know at that time whether that’s correct. On the other hand  I assume the company’s guidance on its Covid-vaccine is off the table in light of an oversupply of Covid-vaccines and the company being in contract remediation talks with the EU.More importantly  two major catalysts are around the corner: a biologics license application for chikungunya vaccine and a Phase 3 trial for the world’s only Lyme vaccine candidate. I explain above why I see both as possibly strong catalysts for the company. Valneva  apparently still quite unknown to the greater public although it has a market cap of more than 1 billion  is trading near the low end of its 52-week range.Looking at the price volatility in June  I assume that the market has taken into account the company’s recent guidance on contract remediation talks with the EU. The caveat is that the market has not fully discounted this yet. I am rating this company as a buy in light of the upcoming catalysts  and in light of the tremendous potential coming from both the chikungunya and Lyme vaccine business as set out above. Pfizer recently took an equity investment of 8.1% and has shown repeated and ever stronger interest in the company’s Lyme vaccine candidate.,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.03,mixed,0.29,0.07,0.64,True,English,"['Valneva Stock', 'Vaccine Business', 'Lyme Love', 'Catalysts', 'Pfizer', 'NASDAQ', 'enterotoxigenic E.

Additional information concerning the acceptance procedure for the Exchange Offer is included in the Offer Document.The time until which notification of acceptance to the account holding institution may be given will depend upon the respective Maersk Drilling Shareholder's agreement with  and the rules and procedures of  the relevant account holding institution and may be earlier than the last day of the Offer Period.The use of interim acceptance shares in the Exchange OfferIn order to allow the Maersk Drilling Shareholders to continue to trade their interests in their Maersk Drilling Shares after tendering their Maersk Drilling Shares in the Exchange Offer  and to facilitate the technical aspects of settlement of the Exchange Offer  Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance Shares  as applicable  will be issued and allocated to tendering Maersk Drilling Shareholders.Upon acceptance of the Exchange Offer  all Maersk Drilling Shares validly tendered in the Exchange Offer will be transferred to a separate securities account with Euronext Securities Copenhagen in the name of Danske Bank A/S and a specific transfer restriction with respect to such tendered Maersk Drilling Shares will be entered into the book-entry account system.Simultaneously  a number of interim acceptance shares corresponding to such number of Maersk Drilling Shares tendered in the Exchange Offer will be recorded on each respective Maersk Drilling Shareholder's account with Euronext Securities Copenhagen and issued in the interim ISIN code DK0061803103 (the ""Acceptance Shares""). Each Acceptance Share received by Maersk Drilling Shareholders represents the right to receive 1.6137 Topco Offer Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole number) upon completion of the Exchange Offer.Following expiration of the Offer Period  the holders of Acceptance Shares (the ""Acceptance Share Holders"")  may  during a period commencing on 12 September 2022 and ending on 26 September 2022 at 11:59 p.m. CEST  based on an offer period expiring on 8 September 2022 and subject to any potential extensions of the Offer Period  choose to exercise the Cash Election in the Exchange Offer  whereby the Acceptance Share Holder's Acceptance Shares will be exchanged for interim cash acceptance shares issued in the separate interim ISIN code  DK0061803293  and representing a right to receive Cash Consideration (the ""Cash Acceptance Shares""). For further information on the exercise of the Cash Election reference is made to the Offer Document.The Acceptance Shares have been approved for trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen in the interim ISIN code DK0061803103 under the symbol ""DC accept shares"" during the period commencing on 10 August 2022 at 9:00 a.m. CEST and ending on 28 September 2022 at 5:00 p.m. CEST. Similarly  the Cash Acceptance Shares have been conditionally approved for trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen in the interim ISIN code DK0061803293 under the symbol ""DC accept cash"" during the period commencing on 12 September 2022 at 9:00 a.m. CEST and ending on 28 September 2022 at 5:00 p.m. CEST. In case the Offer Period is extended  the period for which the Acceptance Shares are admitted to trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen will be extended accordingly and the first day of trading of the Cash Acceptance Shares will be postponed.On the date of settlement of the Exchange Offer  the Acceptance Shares will automatically be exchanged for A ordinary shares of Topco (in the form of share entitlements) at the Exchange Ratio in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer and the Cash Acceptance Shares will be automatically exchanged for Cash Consideration. In connection with the Acceptance Shares being automatically exchanged for A ordinary shares of Topco (in the form of share entitlements) and the Cash Acceptance Shares being automatically exchanged for Cash Consideration  the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares will cease to exist.In case of fractions of A ordinary shares of Topco (in the form of share entitlements)  the number of A ordinary shares (in the form of share entitlements) such Acceptance Share Holder shall receive under the Exchange Offer will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of A ordinary shares (in the form of share entitlements)  and any entitlement to fractional A ordinary shares of Topco (in the form of share entitlements) will be settled in cash.The A ordinary shares of Topco to be delivered as Share Consideration in the Exchange Offer will be delivered in the form of share entitlements book-entered in the Euronext Securities Copenhagen securities system  representing A ordinary shares in Topco  credited to the account of Computershare Trust Company  N.A. in the name of Euronext Securities Copenhagen (as further described in the Exemption Document and the Offer Document). Maersk Drilling Shareholders should be advised that the legal nature of such share entitlements and how shareholder rights are exercised are different from what otherwise applies to ordinary shares in Danish companies with shares admitted to trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen.As the Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance Shares are admitted to trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen  acceptances tendered early in the Offer Period will not restrict Maersk Drilling Shareholders from trading their interests in their Maersk Drilling Shares (in the form of trading Acceptance Shares or Cash Acceptance Shares  as applicable).The issuance of Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance Shares and the process for exercising the Cash Election is a technical procedure required to facilitate settlement of the Exchange Offer and is part of the settlement of the Exchange Offer. At the time when the Acceptance Share Holders are afforded the opportunity to exercise the Cash Election as described herein  the Offer Period will have ended  and all Acceptance Share Holders will be bound by their acceptance of the Exchange Offer.Until settlement of the Exchange Offer  the liquidity and market prices of the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares under the interim ISIN codes may be substantially different from the liquidity and market price of the Maersk Drilling shares. All dealings in the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares prior to settlement of the Exchange Offer will be for the account of  and at the sole risk of  the parties involved.If Topco does not complete the Exchange Offer  any Acceptance Shares and/or Cash Acceptance Shares held will be exchanged back into a corresponding number of Maersk Drilling Shares in the individual holders of Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptances Shares' book-entry securities accounts with Euronext Securities Copenhagen as soon as technically possible after a notification by Topco that it will not complete the Exchange Offer. In such case  no compensation will be paid to holders of Acceptance Shares or Cash Acceptance Shares.The value of the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares depends on the market price of the Maersk Drilling Shares and the expected market price of the Topco Shares  and  with respect to the Cash Acceptance Shares  the Cash Consideration expected to be payable in the Exchange Offer. Ultimately  the market price of the Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance will be dependent on the price attributed to the Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance Shares by the market and no stabilisation will be conducted in connection with the Exchange Offer. A decline in the market price of the Maersk Drilling shares could have an adverse effect on the value and market price of the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares.The market for the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares may be limited and may only offer limited liquidity  and if a trading market develops  the price of the Acceptance Shares and the Cash Acceptance Shares may be subject to greater or lower volatility. This could make it difficult for individual holders to sell their Acceptance Shares and/or the Cash Acceptance Shares.Admission to trading and official listing of the shares of TopcoTopco intends to take the steps necessary for all shares of Topco (which for the purpose of the admission to trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S (""Nasdaq Copenhagen"") shall be in the form of share entitlements) to be admitted to trading and official listing on the regulated market Nasdaq Copenhagen. To effect such admission to trading and official listing  Topco will prior to completion of the Exchange Offer submit an application to Nasdaq Copenhagen for the admission to trading and official listing of the shares of Topco as well as prepare and publish a prospectus to be approved in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation (the ""Listing Prospectus""). The first day of trading is expected to be 3 October 2022.In addition  Topco also intends to take the steps necessary for all shares of Topco to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the ""NYSE""). The listing on NYSE is expected to take place on or about 30 September 2022. Upon closing of the Exchange Offer  Topco expects that the shares of Topco will be dually-listed and tradable on both NYSE and Nasdaq Copenhagen.Compulsory purchaseUpon the consummation of the Exchange Offer  if more than 90% of the issued and outstanding Maersk Drilling Shares  including the attaching voting rights  are acquired by Topco  Topco will redeem any Maersk Drilling Shares not exchanged in the Exchange Offer by Topco for  at the election of the holder  either Topco Shares or cash (or  for those holders that do not make an election  only cash) under Danish law by way of a compulsory purchase.DelistingTopco intends to delist the Maersk Drilling Shares from Nasdaq Copenhagen at an appropriate time (including  to the extent permitted by Nasdaq Copenhagen  if upon completion of the Exchange Offer  Topco holds less than 90% of all Maersk Drilling Shares and voting rights of Maersk Drilling  excluding any treasury shares held by Maersk Drilling). If delisting is achieved  Topco will in due course initiate amendments to the articles of association of Maersk Drilling to reflect that Maersk Drilling is no longer listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen.Timetable for the Exchange OfferThe following timetable sets forth certain key dates relating to the Exchange Offer  provided that the Offer Period has not been extended in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer:10 August 2022 Commencement of Offer Period 10 August 2022 First day of trading of the Acceptance Shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen 8 September 2022at 11:59 p.m. CEST Expected expiration of the Offer Period (subject to extension of the Offer Period) 8 September 2022 Expected publication of the Listing Prospectus 9 September 2022before 5:59 p.m. CEST Latest expected announcement of an extension  withdrawal or satisfaction of theconditions to completion of the Exchange Offer and  in the case of satisfaction of theconditions to completion  the preliminary result of the Exchange Offer 12 September 2022 Commencement of the period for holders of Acceptance Shares to make Cash Elections 12 September 2022 First day of trading of the Cash Acceptance Shares 13 September 2022 Announcement of the final result of the Exchange Offer 26 September 2022at 11:59 p.m. CEST Expiration of the period for holders of Acceptance Share to make Cash Elections 28 September 2022 Last day of trading of Acceptance Shares and Cash Acceptance Shares 3 October 2022 Completion of the Exchange Offer by the issuance by Euronext Securities Copenhagenof the Topco Offer Shares in the form of share entitlements and the exchange of(i) Acceptance Shares for Topco Offer Shares in the form of share entitlements issued byEuronext Securities Copenhagen (with any fractional shares being settled in cash) and(ii) Cash Acceptance Shares for cash 3 October 2022 First day of trading of the shares of Topco in the form of share entitlements on Nasdaq CopenhagenThe timetable above is subject to change  including in the event that the Offer Period is extended in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer.

The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy  and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Story continuesPetri Helsky  President & CEO:“The first half of 2022 was difficult for Suominen. In the second quarter we did not see an improvement in demand for the hard surface disinfectant products which has been suffering from the high inventory levels in the US supply chains. Overall our sales volumes improved slightly from the previous quarter but remained well below the corresponding period last year. What comes to raw materials  energy and transportation  there was another steep hike in these costs in the second quarter. Due to the lag in our sales pricing mechanisms our sales prices did not fully reflect the cost increases. Especially in Europe  the cost inflation was made worse by the war in Ukraine.Our net sales were EUR 118.0 million (113.6) in the second quarter with currencies impacting the sales positively by EUR 8.0 million. Sales volumes decreased from Q2/2021 which marked the last quarter of the COVID-19 boom while sales prices increased following the higher raw material prices. Our quarterly EBITDA declined to EUR 1.9 million (15.3) due to the lower sales volumes and lower margins as our raw material  energy and freight costs increased more than the sales prices. Fixed costs saving actions had a small positive impact on the result.We are continuing to identify and implement actions to improve our financial performance. As described in our previous interim report  we implemented an energy surcharge to all our products sold in Europe in mid-March which took effect in Q2. We have also progressed in our work on widening our product portfolio in the US at the production lines suffering from the inventory imbalance and we expect demand improvement for these lines in the second half of 2022 based on new contracted volumes. On the operations side we have launched a development program to further improve our raw material efficiency.Safety is a key priority both in our strategy and our daily operations and our long-term target is zero lost-time accidents (LTA). During the first half of the year there has not been any LTAs at our sites and a great example of our successful safety work is our Paulinia site in Brazil which achieved a decade of no LTAs in June 2022.We are continuously developing our sustainable product offering. To support our product development in nonwovens biodegradability we have built our own compostability test center Green Lab in Nakkila  Finland and the first tests have already started.During the second quarter we announced an investment to enhance and upgrade one of our lines in Nakkila  Finland. This investment strengthens our capabilities in sustainable products and is made in line with our strategy and vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens.In June 2022 we agreed to extend our EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement by one year. The maturity of the facility is now extended to July 2025.In the first half of the year our financial performance has clearly been weak. We are  however  seeing signs of improvement in both US product demand and the general raw material markets. These together with our improvement actions are expected to contribute positively to our financial results in Q3 and especially in Q4.”NET SALESApril–June 2022In April–June 2022  Suominen’s net sales increased by 4% from the comparison period to EUR 118.0 million (113.6). Sales volumes decreased from the very high level of Q2/2021  but sales prices increased following higher raw material prices. The impact of currencies on net sales was EUR 8.0 million.Suominen’s business areas are Americas and Europe. The net sales of the Americas business area were EUR 64.2 million (67.4) and of the Europe business area EUR 53.8 million (46.3).January–June 2022In January–June 2022  Suominen’s net sales were in line with the previous year and amounted to EUR 228.3 million (229.0). Sales volumes decreased from H1/2021 while sales prices were higher. The impact of currencies on net sales was positive EUR 12.6 million.The net sales of the Americas business area were EUR 126.0 million (139.3) and of the Europe business area EUR 102.3 million (89.7).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTApril–June 2022EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) declined to EUR 1.9 million (15.3). The decrease was driven by lower sales and production volumes as well as higher raw material  energy and logistics costs even though these were partially compensated by higher sales prices. The impact of currencies on EBITDA was EUR -0.6 million.Operating profit decreased from the comparison period and amounted to EUR -2.9 million (10.3).Profit before income taxes was EUR -2.2 million (8.7)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -2.3 million (6.1).January–June 2022EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) declined to EUR 5.2 million (33.8). The decrease was driven especially by lower sales and production volumes. Higher raw material  energy and logistics costs also impacted the result negatively even though these were partially compensated by higher sales prices. The impact of currencies on EBITDA was EUR 0.0 million.Operating profit decreased to EUR -4.2 million (23.9).Profit before income taxes was EUR -4.4 million (25.6)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -4.7 million (19.9). In the comparison period  the sale of Amerplast impacted the result positively by EUR 3.7 million.FINANCINGThe Group’s net interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value amounted to EUR 53.6 million (35.7) at the end of the review period. The gearing ratio was 33.9% (22.4%) and the equity ratio 39.0% (40.6%).In January–June  net financial expenses were EUR -0.2 million (+1.7)  or -0.1% (+0.7%) of net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial expenses by EUR 3.0 million (decreased by EUR 0.5 million).Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021. The transaction impacted Suominen’s net financial expenses positively in the comparison period by EUR 3.7 million. The effect on the cash flow in 2021 was EUR 11.6 million.Cash flow from operations in April–June was EUR 11.9 million (1.2) and in January–June EUR 9.2 million (17.1)  representing a cash flow per share of EUR 0.16 (0.30) and EUR 0.21 (0.02) for the quarter.In the second quarter the change in working capital was EUR 10.9 million (-9.7).The decrease in the cash flow from operations in the first half of the year was mainly due to lower profit. The change in net working capital was EUR 6.6 million (-11.8).In June 2022  Suominen announced that it has extended by one year the maturity of the EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement signed in July 2020. The maturity of the facility is now extended to July 2025.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn January–June  the gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 4.0 million (10.7). The investments were mainly for maintenance.Suominen announced in June that it strengthens its capabilities in sustainable products by enhancing and upgrading one of its production lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment is made in line with Suominen’s strategy and supports company’s vision to be the frontrunner in sustainability. The total value of the investment is approximately EUR 6 million and the investment project will be completed in the second half of 2023.Depreciation and amortization for the review period amounted to EUR 9.3 million (9.9).PROGRESS IN SUSTAINABILITYDuring the first half of 2022  we have made steady progress with the actions defined in our sustainability agenda.We have strong focus on safety and accident prevention  and our long-term target is to have zero lost-time accidents. In the first half of the year there was no LTA’s at Suominen sites. As a concrete example of our successful safety work our Paulinia site in Brazil achieved a decade of no LTAs during the second quarter.We systematically measure our employee engagement by conducting our engagement survey  Suominen Vibe  every year. During the first half of 2022  we continued our development actions based on the results from the survey conducted late last year. We also actively communicate the actions taken to the whole organization. The next Vibe survey is set for autumn 2022.We are committed to continuously improving our production efficiency and the efficient utilization of natural resources. In the first quarter we continued our active measures towards our targets to reduce energy consumption  greenhouse gas emissions  water consumption and waste to landfill by 20% per ton of product by 2025 compared to the base year of 2019. As an example of our concrete actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we installed solar panels to our Alicante plant during the first half of the year and the start up is planned for early August 2022.We offer a comprehensive portfolio of sustainable nonwovens to our customers and continuously develop new and innovative solutions with a reduced environmental impact. Our target is a 50% increase in sales of sustainable nonwovens by 2025 compared to 2019  and to have at least 10 sustainable product launches per year. To support our product development in nonwovens biodegradability  we have built our own compostability test center Green Lab in Nakkila  Finland and the first tests have already started.Suominen reports progress in its key sustainability KPIs annually.As part of our Annual Report 2021 published on March 2  2022 we reported on the progress of our sustainability performance.

This can impact Suominen’s financial performance depending on how the markets develop.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation mentioned above.Also the COVID-19 pandemic can still cause uncertainty in Suominen’s business environment. The key risks related to the virus concern the health and safety of Suominen personnel and customers  possible shortages of raw materials and issues linked to logistics  as well as potential closures of customers’ or our own plants due to virus infections. Our customers have generally performed well financially even during the pandemic and thus our customer credit risks have not materially increased.Suominen’s other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen’s Annual Report 2021 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  the pandemic-caused demand spike followed by moderation of said demand has led to an inventory imbalance in the whole supply chain especially in the US which still partially persists.The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. However  we are seeing signs of the raw material cost inflation moderating from the third and especially fourth quarter onwards and we also expect normalization of the US inventory levels going forward.OUTLOOK FOR 2022Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease clearly from 2021. The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION REPORTSuominen has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2021  which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies. The statements also cover other central areas of corporate governance. The statements have been published on Suominen's website  separately from the Report of the Board of Directors  at www.suominen.fi.AUDIOCAST AND CONFERENCE CALLPetri Helsky  President & CEO  and Toni Tamminen  CFO  will present the result in English in an audiocast for analysts  investors and media on August 9 at 11:00 a.m. (EEST).

MEASURESKey ratios per share are either IFRS key ratios (earnings per share) or required by Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio  which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2021. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen’s Annual Report for 2021.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury sharesDiluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -4 655 19 896 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 397 821 57 592 913 57 579 440 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 484 599 57 981 212 58 023 347 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.08 0.35 0.36 Diluted -0.08 0.34 0.36Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand 9 235 17 129 11 088 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 615 206 57 293 235 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR 0.16 0.30 0.19Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity attributable to owners of the parent = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 158 098 159 386 163 199 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 615 206 57 293 235 Equity per share  EUR 2.75 2.77 2.85Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 480 727 57 615 206 57 293 235 Share price at end of the period  EUR 2.99 5.57 5.18 Market capitalization  EUR million 171.9 320.9 296.8Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares traded during the period 9 397 268 11 967 176 17 714 203 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 397 821 57 592 913 57 579 440 Share turnover  % 16.4 20.8 30.8Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2022 or 2021.EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses Comparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Operating profit -4 171 23 909 26 941 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 9 331 9 902 20 092 EBITDA 5 160 33 811 47 033Gross capital expenditureEUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Increases in intangible assets 346 70 162 Increases in property  plant and equipment 3 645 10 604 17 609 Gross capital expenditure 3 991 10 673 17 771Interest-bearing net debtIt is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 577 149 229 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 1 112 2 440 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -97 114 -115 964 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 53 575 35 705 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 577 149 229 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 1 112 2 440 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 150 689 151 669 150 927Return on equity (ROE)  %Return on equity (ROE)  % = Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) x 100 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent (quarterly average)EUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) -3 817 38 067 20 734 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.6.2021 / 30.6.2020 / 31.12.2020 159 386 138 551 145 882 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.9.2021 / 30.9.2020 / 31.3.2021 159 682 144 074 152 227 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.12.2021 / 31.12.2020 / 30.6.2021 163 199 145 882 159 386 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.3.2022 / 31.3.2021 / 30.9.2021 153 504 152 227 159 682 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.6.2022 / 30.6.2021 / 31.12.2021 158 098 159 386 163 199 Average 158 774 148 024 156 075 Return on equity (ROE)  % -2.4 25.7 13.3Invested capitalInvested capital = Total equity attributable to owners of the parent + interest-bearing liabilitiesEUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 158 098 159 386 163 199 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 577 149 229 149 134 Cash and cash equivalents -97 114 -115 964 -101 357 Invested capital 210 561 192 651 210 975The calculation formula for invested capital has been changed.

As a reminder  our three key strategic priorities for this year are: completing the U.S.DREAM pivotal trial  accelerating commercial execution in Germany and commencing of Access U.S. IDE study for complete concentric collapse  or CCC  patients before year-end. Before I go in details  let's start with a fact-based summary on Q2 achievements. To this end  I'm pleased to report that we have completed enrollment in DREAM  and 91 patients have made it through the funnel to implantation.The remaining implants are being scheduled  and we expect to report 12-month clinical data in the fall of 2023 with regulatory approval expected in the first half of 2024. We achieved sales of EUR 935 000  which represents 450% growth year over year and 42% growth quarter over quarter. We also activated 11 new commercial sites in Germany during this quarter  which has begun implanting as of the third quarter  bringing the total to 26 active sites in Germany. From a clinical perspective  we are thrilled that the FDA  after previously granting us breakthrough designation  has approved our IDE to commence the ACCESS study.We expect to implant our first patients in the trial before year-end. From an innovative leadership perspective  we are core to have our next-generation Genio 2.1 approved by the FDA for use in the DREAM-ID study and received CE Mark approval in Europe for clinical and commercial use. I would  once again  like to recognize our growing team for their commitment to strong execution as we advance the Nyxoah story on numerous fronts. Let me start with our commercial  focused primarily on Germany.Germany is the largest and most competitive HGNS  hypoglossal nerve stimulation  market outside of the United States. Nyxoah has dedicated German salespeople and similar DRG and reimbursement level as other hypoglossal nerve stimulation technologies. We have defined our commercial success by achieving significant market share gains each quarter  culminating in market leadership by the end of 2022. For the second quarter  we generated EUR 935 000 in total revenue  representing growth of more than five times versus the second quarter of 2021 and 42% growth versus the first quarter of 2022.We estimate  based on our knowledge of the German market  we increased our German market share by 4 to 5 percentage points versus Q1  which brings us close to 30% market share in Germany. During the quarter  we activated 11 new sites in Germany  which have begun implanting as of the third quarter  bringing our total to 26 active implanting accounts in Germany. We expect to be at least in 35 standards by the end of 2022. This rapid growth has been driven by inbound interest from ENT surgeons and sleep specialists eager to work with us.Physicians and patients are embracing our unique approach centered around to the patient with a scalable technology platform  a single incision procedure  as well as the only full body 1.5 and 3.0 Tesla MRI compatible hypoglossal nerve stimulation solution. From a reimbursement perspective  we continue to make great progress implanting patients in Switzerland and Finland  and we continue our discussions with local healthcare authorities in Belgium  the Netherlands  Italy and the U.K. We are also pleased to see the growth in complete concentric collapse patients now receiving Genio implants since these patients previously had no suitable treatment option other than major pallet surgery and were contraindicated to commercially available hypoglossal nerve stimulation therapy. The first CCC patients that have been implanted for up to six months are showing extremely strong results.As an illustration  one CCC patients who presented with a baseline AHI of 58 suffering from severe OSA had an AHI of understand at six months post-implant. These results encourage more physicians to recommend Genio for their CCC patients. In addition  we are the only company offering solutions for both CCC and noncomplete concentric collapse patients without the need for an extra dice examination. This simplifies and shortens the patient's journey from initial diagnosis to hypoglossal nerve stimulation treatment.Taking all of these factors together  we reiterate our guidance of achieving market status leader status -- market leadership status in Germany in Q4. Moving now to our DREAM study. I'm pleased to report that we have completed enrollment in the trial  with 91 patients having made it to the Funnel 2 implantation  the remaining implants are being scheduled in our U.S. implant sites.We anticipate having 12-month clinical data from the study in the fall of 2023  and we will pursue a model of PMA submission. To that end  we are currently preparing the first modules for submission  which are product technical dossier  including preclinical data  and we are getting ready for manufacturing validation. We anticipate submitting the final DREAM clinical data module in the fourth quarter of 2023 and launching Genio in the second quarter of 2024. The investment in our U.S.market access organization have already begun. As for CCC  our IDE submission for the ACCESS study was approved by the FDA  and we are beginning work to initiate the study with the first patients to be implanted before year-end. We will implant up to 106 patients across 40 clinical sites in the U.S. and file with 12-month data  putting us on course for regulatory approval in early 2025.Our patient-centric focus on innovation was further illustrated by the regulatory approvals of Genio 2.1 next generation system  which is an upgrade to the external components of Genio for use in our DREAM trial and for clinical and commercial use in Europe. Genio 2.1 improves patients' comfort and compliance with a new smartphone application. Patients receive daily feedback on their therapy usage and has ownership to adjust stimulation amplitude within predefined boundaries by their physician. For patients more sensitive to neuro stimulation  clinicians will now have a solution to fine-tune stimulation amplitude to determine the optimal level of comfort.Genio 2.1 is also equipped with embedded sensors to allow physicians to further scale of therapy stimulation parameters based on patient position and throughout the night. Importantly  all of these new features are available to Genio patients without the need for a surgical procedure to replace the implantable component  as Genio is the only scalable hypoglossal nerve stimulation implant as it allows patients to always have the most advanced features with their existing implant. As a reminder  Genio is also the only system with both full-body 1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla MRI compatibility to ensure that patients always feel safe and do not have to worry about explanting their device to undergo an MRI. 3.0 Tesla currently represents up to 40% of all MRIs and is expected to become the standard in the near future.We also continue to advance our development of a next-generation neuro stimulation technology focused on the ansa cervicalis nerve as part of our exclusive licensing agreement with the Vanderbilt University in the U.S. We are progressing toward the prototype device and expect to commence a feasibility study in 2023. These efforts embody our mission to build a product pipeline that will enable us to offer solutions to current non-responding hypoglossal nerve stimulation patients and non-eligible to treat patients. We look forward to providing more updates as this project progresses.To further illustrate Nyxoah's approach of putting patients first  we are thrilled to partner with Acurable to offer AcuPebble home sleep test. Nyxoah is developing a complete obstructive sleep apnea ecosystem in order to best serve and support patients all the way through their OSA journey. AcuPebble is next-generation home sleep test that uses acoustic signals to diagnose OSA. The signals are uploaded to a smartphone application and processed to report an accurate OSA diagnosis  providing high specificity and sensitivity for both the AHI  apnea-hypopnea index  and the oxygen desaturation index  or ODI.AcuPebble is clinically validated through a randomized study published in the BMJ Open  and AcuPebble us CE Marked and also has FDA clearance. AcuPebble breaks down many of the barriers to receiving an accurate OSA diagnosis in a timely manner. With AcuPebble and Genio  Nyxoah can now offer patients and clinicians the most cutting-edge OSA diagnosis and treatment solutions. We look forward to launching AcuPebble in Germany in the fourth quarter of this year 2022.With that  I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO  Loic Moreau  who will provide a financial update.Loic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Olivier. Good day to everyone  and thank you for joining us today. Revenue for the second quarter ended June 30  2022 was EUR 935 000  compared to EUR 170 000 for the second quarter of 2021. The increase of 450% was primarily attributable to sales of the Genio system in Germany.Total cost of goods sold for the second quarter of 2022 was EUR 334 000  implying a gross margin of 64.2%. This represents a significant increase versus the 56.2% posted in the first quarter of 2022. As a reminder  first quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by a one-off flooding incident in our manufacturing site in Tel Aviv that was remediated in short order. We continue to expect gross margin to expand over time  in line with other neuro stimulation companies as we achieve greater commercial scale.Total Q2 operating expenses were in line with our plan as we continue to focus on research and development and our clinical programs. R&D increased to $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2022 from $2.4 million in Q2 2021  mostly due to the development of Genio 2.1 and future generations. Selling  general and administrative expenses rose to EUR 4.5 million for the second quarter of 2022 from EUR 3.9 million in the year-ago quarter due primarily to increased commercial efforts in Germany and other European markets. We also added headcount to our corporate infrastructure and expect to continue investing in human capital as we further scale up our organization  particularly our U.S.commercial team. Total operating loss for the second quarter of 2022 was EUR 7.4 million versus EUR 6.3 million in the second quarter of 2021  driven by the acceleration in our R&D spending  as well as our commercial and clinical activities. We realized a net loss of EUR 5 million for the quarter ended June 30  2022  versus a net loss of EUR 6.7 million for the second quarter of 2021. As of June 30  2022  cash and financial assets totaled EUR 123.3 million  compared to EUR 135.5 million on December 31  2021.Total cash burn was EUR 2 million per month during the first half  but we note there was a EUR 6 million foreign exchange tailwind  so monthly cash burn was closer to EUR 3 million  excluding FX. We continue to expect monthly cash burn increase slightly in the second half of 2022 as we commence the ACCESS trial in the U.S. and invest in our direct-to-patient marketing efforts in Germany. We continue to have ample liquidity to get through U.S.commercialization in the first half of 2024. Finally  I'm extremely proud that Nyxoah has been included in the newly formed Euronext sector leaders initiatives  which is an index composed of 100 of the most innovative tech companies listed on Euronext. With that  I will turn the call back to Olivier.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Loic. With the first half of 2022 complete  we entered the second half with confidence and excitement that we will achieve our key strategic goals for the year. With DREAM enrollment complete  we turn our focus to the 12-month follow-up period. We will continue to accelerate our market share gains in Germany as we attain market leadership status.And we look forward to implanting our first ACCESS patients before year-end as we work to provide a solution for complete concentric collapse patients whose only other treatment option is major pallet surgery. This concludes the formal part of our presentation. Operator  I will turn the call over to you  beginning our Q&A session.Questions & Answers:OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Osborn from Cantor Fitzgerald.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerHi  Ross.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystHi. Congrats on the quarter and the progress made. I guess  two questions for me. I'll go and ask both upfront.How many CCC patients were implanted during the quarter? And then my second question  on AcuPebble  are you able to  I guess  disclose the financial relationship there  and then  how we should think about the impact to your top line? Thank you.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so let me start by answering the first question on how many CCC patients were implanted. As you know  Ross  since we now have in Europe  the label expansion for CCC  we are no longer doing a dice examination. So to that point  we cannot no longer exclude or know precisely how many of are CCC or how many are non-CCC. So we don't know precise how many that we have.What we do see  however  is that we're also getting CCC patients after the dice examination that were identified to be implanted with the unilateral stimulation  and that is definitely also accelerating and helping us further growing our business in Germany. So I'm sorry that I cannot go more into that on this. And when it comes to AcuPebble and the financial combination  so we start collaborating with the distribution agreement with AcuPebble. We have Germany identified as a pilot country.So the investment  in fact  it's a minimum investment. But as you can also understand the financial impact of the details  this is something that we would not -- that we also are not -- no further commenting on. But the financial impacts will be immaterial as we will initially be launching and to select centers of excellence in Q4 to gain experience with the system before we do a broader whole load.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystOK. Understood. Thanks for taking my questions  and congrats on the progress.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Ross.OperatorOur next question comes from Adam Maeder from Piper Sandler.Simran Kaur -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystGreat. Hi  everyone. This is Simran  on for Adam. Congrats on the progress this quarter.I wanted to start on DREAM. It sounds like there are still some patients that need to be implanted about 24 by my math. Maybe just talk a little bit about when we should be pulled through these patients. I mean  it does sound like it is imminent  but just higher level the trends you're seeing in the trial in recent weeks in terms of baseline PSG  securing OR time  staffing shortages  just any of the -- those kind of headwinds that you may be facing.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerOK. Well  a very interesting question  and thank you for your question. So let me maybe first start by explaining again what the definition of enrolled means. It means that the patient has a signed consent  and they will be entering the screening funnel leading to an implant.As a reminder  once a patient provides content and passes the initial screening criteria of age and BMI  the process is to undergo a forked PSG to determine baseline AHI level. If the patient does  indeed  have moderate to severe OSA  the next step will be to undergo advice to exclude or to determine CCC. If non-CCC  the patient undergoes a baseline PSG and will then move into implant. To date  we have already implanted 91 patients  and 38 are already very advanced in the screening process as a significant portion of these have already passed their PSG and dice.So in a conservative scenario  40% of these should make it to implant leading to 150 implants. But if you are more into a realistic scenario  with the patients that we have enrolled today  we would already be good to implant over 125 patients. So that's where we are. Now from a timing perspective  I'm sure that you remember very well during our last earning call that we were at 66 implants.So in fact  we implanted 25 patients during the last three months. We still need and implant 24 more. We feel strong and we have strong confidence that we can do it in two months. For the reason I just disclosed  we have identified the patients.We have enrolled the patients. We know in every site where they are. And that's why we think it will take another  let's say  six to maximum eight weeks to fully finish all implants.Simran Kaur -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystPerfect. Thank you. And just a real quick follow-up there. I think the last time we talked  there was a mention about the sample size having been reduced from 134 to 115.Can you remind me if this affects the statistical powering of the study? Are there any parameters in the design that need or needed to be adjusted due to the smaller population?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerNo  it does not affect any statistical program study for the simple reason that we stay with a 65% respond rate on AHI. So nothing has changed on this. The only thing we did based on the better sleep data is we looked at the ODI reduction  and there  we also aligned with the 65% respond rate  which was resulting into the reduction to 115 implants. But there is no change in statistical power.There is no change in primary endpoints  no nothing. Everything stays the same.Simran Kaur -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystOK. Perfect. And if I could just squeeze one last one. You guys saw great momentum and nice improvement in the commercial business in Q2.I know you don't have financial guidance  but can you talk about how you think about the business here over the near term and remainder of 2022 in Germany? Any puts and takes there would be helpful.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. I will hand this question over to Loic  to our CFO.Loic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Thank you  Olivier. So as you know  we're not providing formal revenue guidance  but I can say that we are encouraged by the positive feedback we are receiving on and strong progress we are making in our key markets  particularly in Germany  and we do expect revenue to increase each quarter this year. Given this positive momentum  we are generally comfortable with current analyst consensus for this year.Simran Kaur -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystPerfect. Thank you  guys.OperatorAll right. Our next question comes from Suraj Kalia from OpCo.Suraj Kalia -- Oppenheimer and Company -- AnalystGood afternoon  everyone. Olivier  can you hear me all right?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYes  I can. Hello  Suraj.Simran Kaur -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystSo Olivier  in Germany  what percent of the patients implanted in the quarter were CCC? And if you could just give us some metrics in terms of the sites where Nyxoah patients were implanted. What was the decision matrix versus Inspire?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerSo first of all  when it comes to CCC patients  it's very difficult now to put a precise number on what is the percentage CCC versus non-CCC for the simple reason that  in Germany  the businesses are no longer doing a dice examination to define whether the patient is CCC or non-CCC. As I mentioned  we have in our label boat. So this disposure is gone. So I don't know precisely anymore how much is CCC or non-CCC.That's one thing. What we do know is that based on literature  it goes up to 30% of patients having or showing CCC. So that's the first question. The second one  when you say how do sites where we implant and we must to be very precise  we had patients implanted in Q2 coming from 15 sites.In those sites  the key decision criteria for the physician are  one  the bilateral stimulation. So it seems and also based on recent public article comparing unilateral and bilateral stimulation that a lot of physicians who really prefer the bilateral stimulation talk to their patients. Next  it is the single incision.So that makes the procedure growing fast  that makes the procedure also decreasing the risk for [Inaudible] and that also for payments makes it more acceptable  only having one incision that is very discrete under the skin compared to multiple incisions. Those are the two main components that we are getting from physicians when they are making their criteria to choose for Genio.Suraj Kalia -- Oppenheimer and Company -- AnalystGot it. Two other questions  Olivier. First  just following up on the no dice procedure. Obviously  Inspire is also running down a clinical trial with no dice requirements.Do you envision a point in time  maybe not in the distant future  where both companies are -- do not require dice  and therefore  the whole notion of CCC or non-CCC gets somewhat muddled up? And a follow-up and my final question  Olivier  if I could just throw it in there. For the U.S. commercial launch  as you'll plan for it  walk us through how your view the right market approach  the type of reps  do they have to have OSC experience or just neuro modulation? And also  any thoughts on the DTC approach  would be greatly appreciated. Folks  thank you for taking my questions.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So let me start with the first one  where I would like to comment on Inspire running a trial to eliminate diagnose CCC. So first of all  let me remind you again that Genio already has the CCC label in Europe  and therefore  there is no need to diagnose CCC any longer when using -- choosing for Nyxoah. Now regardless of the outcome of the Inspire study  and I think it's called predictors.Unless Inspire gains a CCC label  patients will still need to undergo an evaluation to determine if they have CCC prior to getting an Inspire implant. So I don't really see the difference besides gaining the CCC label expansion like we did already in Europe and like we all know  also building the first clinical evidence in the U.S. using our ACCESS study that was part of the breakthrough designation. The second question on how a business model would look like in the U.S.I think what we are learning in Germany is that the ENT surgeon will stay crucial to do a high-quality implant also in the U.S. But if you look at the patient journey  the role of the sleep physician is so important because sleep physicians are the ones who are seeing patients that are diagnosing patients and that will also choose what kind of treatment option they will advise to their patients. Now to that extent  the way we have built our team in Germany and what we're also thinking of using as a commercial approach when we will be able to enter the U.S. commercially is that we will make sure that there is the high-quality field clinical engineers supporting the ENT surgeons when doing an implant and when activating patients.But next on this that we will also have real sleep experts who speak language of sleep physicians  meaning they can help in the phenotyping and identification of patients. And next  when a patient is implanted  they can also help and guide in a perfect follow-up  so that the patient can benefit from the optimal stimulation settings. So that's where we see it a little bit different compared to what competition is doing. We will focus more on sleep physicians  and we will also work with dedicated people who are really sleep experts in identifying patients and in ensuring that they get the best potential stimulation parameters in the follow-up.When it comes to DTC  of course  I also see the great work that has been done so far on DTC  that is really resulting in an increase of awareness for hypoglossal nerve stimulation in general. But as we will be the second company that will be coming into the U.S. market  it's clear that we do not have the same power to invest the amount in DTC. And again  in line with our commercial approach  we will focus on fleet physicians  and then we will selectively invest in DTC to study further referral parts to those sleep physicians and ENT surgeons that are very expertise with hypoglossal nerve stimulation and an excellent implant device.I'm sorry that my answer was a little bit longer  but I hope it was clear. And if not  please ask  and I will try to clarify.Suraj Kalia -- Oppenheimer and Company -- AnalystNo  that's great. Thank you.OperatorAll right. At this time  I'd like to turn it back to Nyxoah for any closing remarks.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much  again  for joining us today. And of course  we look forward to updating you again very soon. Thank you for your time. And thanks for joining us.Operator[Operator signoff]Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Jeremy Feffer -- Vice President  Investor RelationsOlivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerLoic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerRoss Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystSimran Kaur -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystSuraj Kalia -- Oppenheimer and Company -- AnalystMore NYXH analysisAll earnings call transcripts,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.66,0.16,0.17,True,English,"['Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript', 'Nyxoah S.A.', 'NYXH', 'other hypoglossal nerve stimulation technologies', 'Access U.S. IDE study', 'three key strategic priorities', 'significant market share gains', ""Nyxoah second quarter '22 conference call"", 'second quarter financial results', 'key strategic objectives', 'chief financial officer', 'chief executive officer', 'complete concentric collapse', '4 to 5 percentage points', 'Nyxoah S.A.', 'risk factors section', 'CE Mark approval', '26 active implanting accounts', '12-month clinical data', 'innovative leadership perspective', 'investor relations section', 'German market share', 'Q2 2022 Earnings Call', 'investor relations website', 'DREAM pivotal trial', '11 new commercial sites', 'ACCESS study', '30% market share', 'DREAM-ID study', '26 active sites', '11 new sites', 'market leadership', 'second quarter 2022', 'Nyxoah story', 'second half', 'Q2 achievements', 'regulatory approval', 'clinical perspective', 'actual results', 'German salespeople', 'events section', 'market trends', 'third quarter', 'first quarter', 'Prepared Remarks', 'Call Participants', 'Good day', 'vice president', 'Loic Moreau', 'operating activities', 'answer session', 'press release', 'current estimates', 'various assumptions', 'available information', 'undue reliance', 'Form 20-F', 'Exchange Commission', 'good evening', 'excellent progress', 'commercial execution', 'fact-based summary', 'remaining implants', 'first half', 'breakthrough designation', 'next-generation Genio', 'growing team', 'strong execution', 'numerous fronts', 'competitive HGNS', 'United States', 'similar DRG', 'reimbursement level', 'commercial success', 'five times', 'Jeremy Feffer', 'Olivier Taelman', 'future events', 'looking statements', 'material risks', 'Good afternoon', 'commercial use', '42% growth quarter', 'first patients', 'total revenue', '91 patients', '450% growth', 'NYXH', 'Contents', 'Questions', 'Answers', 'Operator', 'speaker', 'James', 'everyone', 'company', 'markets', 'expectations', 'predictions', 'performance', 'forward', 'uncertainties', 'obligation', 'list', 'description', 'business', 'Securities', 'March', 'reminder', 'year', 'Germany', 'CCC', 'details', 'enrollment', 'funnel', 'implantation', 'fall', 'FDA', 'Europe', 'commitment', 'largest', 'knowledge', '35 standards', '4:30']",2022-08-08,2022-08-09,fool.com

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announced the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of their investigational Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15.“With increasing global rates of Lyme disease  providing a new option for people to help protect themselves from the disease is more important than ever ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. “We hope that the data generated from the Phase 3 study will further support the positive evidence for VLA15 to date  and we are looking forward to collaborating with the research sites across the U.S. and Europe on this important trial.""Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are extremely pleased to reach this important milestone in the development of VLA15. Lyme disease continues to spread  representing a high unmet medical need that impacts the lives of many in the Northern Hemisphere. We look forward to further investigating the VLA15 candidate in Phase 3  which will take us a step closer to potentially bringing this vaccine to both adults and children who would benefit from it.”The randomized  placebo-controlled  Phase 3 VALOR study is planned to enroll approximately 6 000 participants 5 years of age and older. The study is being conducted at up to 50 sites located in areas where Lyme disease is highly endemic  including Finland  Germany  the Netherlands  Poland  Sweden and the United States. Participants will receive three doses of VLA15 180 µg or saline placebo as a primary vaccination series followed by one booster dose of VLA15 or saline placebo (1:1 ratio).Story continuesData from the Phase 2 studies continue to demonstrate strong immunogenicity in adults as well as in children  with acceptable safety and tolerability profiles in both study populations.1 2 Pending successful completion of the Phase 3 study  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.As per the terms of the collaboration agreement between Pfizer and Valneva  Pfizer will make a $25 million milestone payment to Valneva upon initiation of the Phase 3 study.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.3 4 The terms of the collaboration agreement include a $25 million milestone payment made to Valneva upon Pfizer’s initiation of the Phase 3 study. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.5About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States and 130 000 people in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.8About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Asia-Pacific dominates the global plastic pallet market and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.7% by 2030.New York  United States  Aug. 09  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plastic pallets are rigid structures that hold goods in place during transportation or storage. They play an essential role in the supply chain and logistics industries. Plastic pallets have numerous advantages over other types of pallets. Today around 90% of pallets are manufactured with recycled plastic. The most used recycled plastic is high-density polyethylene. On the other hand  some manufacturers used post-industrial scrap  including rubber  silicates  and polypropylene.Get a Free Sample Copy of This Report @ https://straitsresearch.com/report/plastic-pallet-market/request-sampleGrowing Need to Reduce the Overall Weight of Bulk Packaging Drives the Market for Plastic PalletsThe need to reduce the weight of overall bulk packaging is growing day by day. The importance of the consignment or shipment during transportation is an essential factor in determining the cost of the finished product. It is common for the transportation cost of a product to exceed its production cost  reducing the overall profit margin. Plastic pallets are significantly lighter than wooden or metal pallets  which is expected to entice end-user companies to use them.The deadweight of a company is the weight of a container or packaging used to transport materials or products. More packaging weight means higher transportation costs  which limits manufacturers' options. This is expected to increase demand for low-weight packaging materials capable of reducing deadweight while improving material handling and transportation efficiency.Expanding End-Use Industries to Create New Market Opportunities for Plastic PalletsThe primary end-use industries for plastic pallets are food and pharmaceutical. Plastic pallets are increasingly replacing wooden pallets because sanitation and safety are top priorities in both sectors. Large volumes of raw materials are handled  stored  and transported daily in the processed food industry. Plastic pallets are widely used for material handling throughout manufacturing and transportation.Story continuesAs a result of an increasingly hectic lifestyle and an expanding middle-class population  the global processed food industry has grown significantly. Furthermore  the rapid introduction of new food and beverage products  combined with rising e-commerce and organized retail penetration  has resulted in the growth of the processed food industry. Key food manufacturers are rapidly expanding their manufacturing capacity and distribution networks.Report ScopeReport Metric Details Market Size USD 18.20 Billion by 2030 CAGR 5.8% (2022-2030) Historical Data 2019-2020 Base Year 2021 Forecast Period 2022-2030 Forecast Units Value (USD Billion ) Report Coverage Revenue Forecast  Competitive Landscape  Growth Factors  and Trends Segments Covered Materials  Type and End-User Geographies Covered North America  Europe  Asia-Pacific  LAME and Rest of the World Key Companies Profiled/Vendors Orbis Corporation  Rehrig Pacific Company  Monoflo International  CABKA Group  Perfect Pallets Inc.

The robust manufacturing industry  particularly in the United States  contributed to the region's significant share.Europe is expected to witness substantial growth during the forecast period. Through E.U. treaties  the European Union has supported sustainable development by recognizing the environmental  economic  and social dimensions. The European Commission published a new roadmap for sustainability in the E.U.'s economy in December 2019  significantly impacting end-use industries because the objectives pushed them to adopt green packaging  including reusable plastic pallets.Key HighlightsThe global plastic pallets market size was estimated at USD 7 165 million in 2021  and it is expected to reach USD 18 207 million by 2030  growing at a CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period (2022–2030).Based on materials   the global plastic pallet market is segmented into High-Density Polyethylene  Low-Density Polyethylene  Polypropylene  and Others. High-density polypropylene (HDPE) accounts for the largest share and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.9% by 2030. Since HDPE is exceptionally durable and has high impact resistance  HDPE pallets sustain little or no damage from rough handling by forklifts and other material handling equipment.Based on type  the global plastic pallet market is segmented into Nestable  Rackable  Stackable  and Others. Nestable Pallets account for the largest share and are expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% by 2030. Nestable pallets are less expensive than rackable and stackable pallets  making them an excellent plastic pallet option for export or open-loop supply chain applications. In the coming years  the growing need to reduce the weight of bulk transportation is expected to favor the growth of nestable pallets.Based on end-user   the global plastic pallet market is segmented into Food & Beverages  Chemicals  Pharmaceuticals  Petroleum & Lubricants  and Others. Food and Beverages dominate the global plastic pallet market and are expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.9% by 2030.

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announced the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical s…,"Approximately 6 000 participants 5 years of age and older will be enrolled in Lyme disease-endemic regions in Europe and the U.S.NEW YORK & SAINT-HERBLAIN  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announced the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical study  Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of their investigational Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220808005463/en/“With increasing global rates of Lyme disease  providing a new option for people to help protect themselves from the disease is more important than ever ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer. “We hope that the data generated from the Phase 3 study will further support the positive evidence for VLA15 to date  and we are looking forward to collaborating with the research sites across the U.S. and Europe on this important trial.""Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “We are extremely pleased to reach this important milestone in the development of VLA15. Lyme disease continues to spread  representing a high unmet medical need that impacts the lives of many in the Northern Hemisphere. We look forward to further investigating the VLA15 candidate in Phase 3  which will take us a step closer to potentially bringing this vaccine to both adults and children who would benefit from it.”The randomized  placebo-controlled  Phase 3 VALOR study is planned to enroll approximately 6 000 participants 5 years of age and older. The study is being conducted at up to 50 sites located in areas where Lyme disease is highly endemic  including Finland  Germany  the Netherlands  Poland  Sweden and the United States. Participants will receive three doses of VLA15 180 µg or saline placebo as a primary vaccination series followed by one booster dose of VLA15 or saline placebo (1:1 ratio).Data from the Phase 2 studies continue to demonstrate strong immunogenicity in adults as well as in children  with acceptable safety and tolerability profiles in both study populations.1 2 Pending successful completion of the Phase 3 study  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.As per the terms of the collaboration agreement between Pfizer and Valneva  Pfizer will make a $25 million milestone payment to Valneva upon initiation of the Phase 3 study.About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferisensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immune response and satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.3 4 The terms of the collaboration agreement include a $25 million milestone payment made to Valneva upon Pfizer’s initiation of the Phase 3 study. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. FDA in July 2017.5About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States and 130 000 people in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.8About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

December wheat BL2Z2 on Paris-based Euronext settled down 0.,"PARIS  Aug 9 (Reuters) - European wheat futures ended little changed on Tuesday as traders continued to assess the resumption of maritime grain exports from Ukraine and adverse weather for maize crops.December wheat BL2Z2 on Paris-based Euronext settled down 0.3% at 324.75 euros ($331.93) a tonne  holding above Monday's near two-week low of 320.25 euros.Progress in releasing vessels stuck at Ukrainian ports  as well as expectations of a record Russian harvest  continued to curb prices by easing global supply concerns.Two more grain ships left Ukraine's Black Sea ports on Tuesday  bringing the total to depart from the war-torn country under a safe passage deal to 12.The arrival of two incoming vessels in recent days has also raised expectations that Ukraine may start loading new vessels.""With the two inbound vessels that came through the corridor  that's not been supportive for prices "" a dealer said.""But the market is pretty quiet with the USDA report Friday and people on holiday.""A decline in weekly crop ratings for U.S. corn  soybeans and spring wheat supported Chicago futures and added interest in Friday's monthly supply and demand forecasts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. GRA/USDA/ESTMore hot  dry weather in Europe this week was also underscoring the prospect of yield losses for maize (corn)  although showers forecast for next week may bring late relief.In a sign of the poor harvest outlook  November maize on Euronext EMAX2 ended above December wheat at 327.50 euros  reversing its usual discount to wheat.After the hot  dry summer led to an early end to the French harvest  field work was progressing rapidly in northern Germany.“New crop volumes are good and quality is also reasonable although we often have protein levels down about 1% ” one German trader said.“But here in the north we certainly do not have a feed wheat harvest and we often have new crop protein levels of 11% to 12.5%.”Export sentiment remained positive in Europe  with demand expected to stay brisk for at least the rest of summer while Ukrainian and also Russian shipments remained below their usual pace.EU data showed that the bloc had exported 2.49 million tonnes so far in 2022/23  slightly more than a year ago  although the European Commission warned the data was incomplete.($1 = 0.9784 euros)(Reporting by Gus Trompiz in Paris and Michael Hogan in Hamburg Editing by Matthew Lewis)((gus.trompiz@thomsonreuters.com; +33 1 49 49 52 18; Reuters Messaging: gus.trompiz.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq  Inc.",neutral,0.03,0.81,0.16,mixed,0.09,0.2,0.71,True,English,"['Paris wheat', 'Ukraine exports', 'maize weather', 'More hot, dry weather', 'new crop protein levels', 'weekly crop ratings', 'New crop volumes', 'safe passage deal', 'U.S. Department', 'hot, dry summer', 'one German trader', 'poor harvest outlook', 'maritime grain exports', 'global supply concerns', 'Black Sea ports', 'record Russian harvest', 'feed wheat harvest', 'U.S. corn', 'December wheat BL2Z2', 'two incoming vessels', 'two inbound vessels', 'European wheat futures', 'new vessels', 'adverse weather', 'French harvest', 'grain ships', 'Chicago futures', 'monthly supply', 'Russian shipments', 'European Commission', 'spring wheat', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'Ukrainian ports', 'war-torn country', 'recent days', 'yield losses', 'late relief', 'Euronext EMAX2', 'usual discount', 'early end', 'field work', 'northern Germany', 'Export sentiment', 'usual pace', '2.49 million tonnes', 'Michael Hogan', 'Matthew Lewis', 'maize crops', 'November maize', 'USDA report', 'demand forecasts', 'next week', 'EU data', 'Gus Trompiz', 'Reuters Messaging', 'Aug', 'Tuesday', 'traders', 'resumption', 'Ukraine', '324.75 euros', 'Monday', '320.25 euros', 'Progress', 'expectations', 'prices', 'total', 'arrival', 'corridor', 'dealer', 'market', 'people', 'holiday', 'decline', 'soybeans', 'interest', 'Friday', 'Agriculture', 'prospect', 'showers', 'sign', '327.50 euros', 'quality', 'bloc', '0.9784 euros', 'Hamburg', 'thomsonreuters', 'views', 'opinions', 'author', 'Nasdaq', '1']",2022-08-09,2022-08-09,nasdaq.com
