The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy  and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Story continuesPetri Helsky  President & CEO:“The first half of 2022 was difficult for Suominen. In the second quarter we did not see an improvement in demand for the hard surface disinfectant products which has been suffering from the high inventory levels in the US supply chains. Overall our sales volumes improved slightly from the previous quarter but remained well below the corresponding period last year. What comes to raw materials  energy and transportation  there was another steep hike in these costs in the second quarter. Due to the lag in our sales pricing mechanisms our sales prices did not fully reflect the cost increases. Especially in Europe  the cost inflation was made worse by the war in Ukraine.Our net sales were EUR 118.0 million (113.6) in the second quarter with currencies impacting the sales positively by EUR 8.0 million. Sales volumes decreased from Q2/2021 which marked the last quarter of the COVID-19 boom while sales prices increased following the higher raw material prices. Our quarterly EBITDA declined to EUR 1.9 million (15.3) due to the lower sales volumes and lower margins as our raw material  energy and freight costs increased more than the sales prices. Fixed costs saving actions had a small positive impact on the result.We are continuing to identify and implement actions to improve our financial performance. As described in our previous interim report  we implemented an energy surcharge to all our products sold in Europe in mid-March which took effect in Q2. We have also progressed in our work on widening our product portfolio in the US at the production lines suffering from the inventory imbalance and we expect demand improvement for these lines in the second half of 2022 based on new contracted volumes. On the operations side we have launched a development program to further improve our raw material efficiency.Safety is a key priority both in our strategy and our daily operations and our long-term target is zero lost-time accidents (LTA). During the first half of the year there has not been any LTAs at our sites and a great example of our successful safety work is our Paulinia site in Brazil which achieved a decade of no LTAs in June 2022.We are continuously developing our sustainable product offering. To support our product development in nonwovens biodegradability we have built our own compostability test center Green Lab in Nakkila  Finland and the first tests have already started.During the second quarter we announced an investment to enhance and upgrade one of our lines in Nakkila  Finland. This investment strengthens our capabilities in sustainable products and is made in line with our strategy and vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens.In June 2022 we agreed to extend our EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement by one year. The maturity of the facility is now extended to July 2025.In the first half of the year our financial performance has clearly been weak. We are  however  seeing signs of improvement in both US product demand and the general raw material markets. These together with our improvement actions are expected to contribute positively to our financial results in Q3 and especially in Q4.”NET SALESApril–June 2022In April–June 2022  Suominen’s net sales increased by 4% from the comparison period to EUR 118.0 million (113.6). Sales volumes decreased from the very high level of Q2/2021  but sales prices increased following higher raw material prices. The impact of currencies on net sales was EUR 8.0 million.Suominen’s business areas are Americas and Europe. The net sales of the Americas business area were EUR 64.2 million (67.4) and of the Europe business area EUR 53.8 million (46.3).January–June 2022In January–June 2022  Suominen’s net sales were in line with the previous year and amounted to EUR 228.3 million (229.0). Sales volumes decreased from H1/2021 while sales prices were higher. The impact of currencies on net sales was positive EUR 12.6 million.The net sales of the Americas business area were EUR 126.0 million (139.3) and of the Europe business area EUR 102.3 million (89.7).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTApril–June 2022EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) declined to EUR 1.9 million (15.3). The decrease was driven by lower sales and production volumes as well as higher raw material  energy and logistics costs even though these were partially compensated by higher sales prices. The impact of currencies on EBITDA was EUR -0.6 million.Operating profit decreased from the comparison period and amounted to EUR -2.9 million (10.3).Profit before income taxes was EUR -2.2 million (8.7)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -2.3 million (6.1).January–June 2022EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) declined to EUR 5.2 million (33.8). The decrease was driven especially by lower sales and production volumes. Higher raw material  energy and logistics costs also impacted the result negatively even though these were partially compensated by higher sales prices. The impact of currencies on EBITDA was EUR 0.0 million.Operating profit decreased to EUR -4.2 million (23.9).Profit before income taxes was EUR -4.4 million (25.6)  and profit for the reporting period was EUR -4.7 million (19.9). In the comparison period  the sale of Amerplast impacted the result positively by EUR 3.7 million.FINANCINGThe Group’s net interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value amounted to EUR 53.6 million (35.7) at the end of the review period. The gearing ratio was 33.9% (22.4%) and the equity ratio 39.0% (40.6%).In January–June  net financial expenses were EUR -0.2 million (+1.7)  or -0.1% (+0.7%) of net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial expenses by EUR 3.0 million (decreased by EUR 0.5 million).Suominen sold its minority share in Amerplast (Bright Maze Oy) in March 2021. The transaction impacted Suominen’s net financial expenses positively in the comparison period by EUR 3.7 million. The effect on the cash flow in 2021 was EUR 11.6 million.Cash flow from operations in April–June was EUR 11.9 million (1.2) and in January–June EUR 9.2 million (17.1)  representing a cash flow per share of EUR 0.16 (0.30) and EUR 0.21 (0.02) for the quarter.In the second quarter the change in working capital was EUR 10.9 million (-9.7).The decrease in the cash flow from operations in the first half of the year was mainly due to lower profit. The change in net working capital was EUR 6.6 million (-11.8).In June 2022  Suominen announced that it has extended by one year the maturity of the EUR 100 million syndicated revolving credit facility agreement signed in July 2020. The maturity of the facility is now extended to July 2025.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn January–June  the gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 4.0 million (10.7). The investments were mainly for maintenance.Suominen announced in June that it strengthens its capabilities in sustainable products by enhancing and upgrading one of its production lines in Nakkila  Finland. The investment is made in line with Suominen’s strategy and supports company’s vision to be the frontrunner in sustainability. The total value of the investment is approximately EUR 6 million and the investment project will be completed in the second half of 2023.Depreciation and amortization for the review period amounted to EUR 9.3 million (9.9).PROGRESS IN SUSTAINABILITYDuring the first half of 2022  we have made steady progress with the actions defined in our sustainability agenda.We have strong focus on safety and accident prevention  and our long-term target is to have zero lost-time accidents. In the first half of the year there was no LTA’s at Suominen sites. As a concrete example of our successful safety work our Paulinia site in Brazil achieved a decade of no LTAs during the second quarter.We systematically measure our employee engagement by conducting our engagement survey  Suominen Vibe  every year. During the first half of 2022  we continued our development actions based on the results from the survey conducted late last year. We also actively communicate the actions taken to the whole organization. The next Vibe survey is set for autumn 2022.We are committed to continuously improving our production efficiency and the efficient utilization of natural resources. In the first quarter we continued our active measures towards our targets to reduce energy consumption  greenhouse gas emissions  water consumption and waste to landfill by 20% per ton of product by 2025 compared to the base year of 2019. As an example of our concrete actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we installed solar panels to our Alicante plant during the first half of the year and the start up is planned for early August 2022.We offer a comprehensive portfolio of sustainable nonwovens to our customers and continuously develop new and innovative solutions with a reduced environmental impact. Our target is a 50% increase in sales of sustainable nonwovens by 2025 compared to 2019  and to have at least 10 sustainable product launches per year. To support our product development in nonwovens biodegradability  we have built our own compostability test center Green Lab in Nakkila  Finland and the first tests have already started.Suominen reports progress in its key sustainability KPIs annually.As part of our Annual Report 2021 published on March 2  2022 we reported on the progress of our sustainability performance.

This can impact Suominen’s financial performance depending on how the markets develop.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation mentioned above.Also the COVID-19 pandemic can still cause uncertainty in Suominen’s business environment. The key risks related to the virus concern the health and safety of Suominen personnel and customers  possible shortages of raw materials and issues linked to logistics  as well as potential closures of customers’ or our own plants due to virus infections. Our customers have generally performed well financially even during the pandemic and thus our customer credit risks have not materially increased.Suominen’s other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen’s Annual Report 2021 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  the pandemic-caused demand spike followed by moderation of said demand has led to an inventory imbalance in the whole supply chain especially in the US which still partially persists.The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. However  we are seeing signs of the raw material cost inflation moderating from the third and especially fourth quarter onwards and we also expect normalization of the US inventory levels going forward.OUTLOOK FOR 2022Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease clearly from 2021. The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION REPORTSuominen has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2021  which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies. The statements also cover other central areas of corporate governance. The statements have been published on Suominen's website  separately from the Report of the Board of Directors  at www.suominen.fi.AUDIOCAST AND CONFERENCE CALLPetri Helsky  President & CEO  and Toni Tamminen  CFO  will present the result in English in an audiocast for analysts  investors and media on August 9 at 11:00 a.m. (EEST).

MEASURESKey ratios per share are either IFRS key ratios (earnings per share) or required by Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio  which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2021. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen’s Annual Report for 2021.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury sharesDiluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -4 655 19 896 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 397 821 57 592 913 57 579 440 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 484 599 57 981 212 58 023 347 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.08 0.35 0.36 Diluted -0.08 0.34 0.36Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand 9 235 17 129 11 088 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 615 206 57 293 235 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR 0.16 0.30 0.19Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity attributable to owners of the parent = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 158 098 159 386 163 199 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 480 727 57 615 206 57 293 235 Equity per share  EUR 2.75 2.77 2.85Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 480 727 57 615 206 57 293 235 Share price at end of the period  EUR 2.99 5.57 5.18 Market capitalization  EUR million 171.9 320.9 296.8Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares traded during the period 9 397 268 11 967 176 17 714 203 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 397 821 57 592 913 57 579 440 Share turnover  % 16.4 20.8 30.8Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods  Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2022 or 2021.EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses Comparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Operating profit -4 171 23 909 26 941 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 9 331 9 902 20 092 EBITDA 5 160 33 811 47 033Gross capital expenditureEUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Increases in intangible assets 346 70 162 Increases in property  plant and equipment 3 645 10 604 17 609 Gross capital expenditure 3 991 10 673 17 771Interest-bearing net debtIt is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 577 149 229 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 1 112 2 440 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -97 114 -115 964 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 53 575 35 705 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 577 149 229 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 1 112 2 440 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 150 689 151 669 150 927Return on equity (ROE)  %Return on equity (ROE)  % = Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) x 100 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent (quarterly average)EUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) -3 817 38 067 20 734 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.6.2021 / 30.6.2020 / 31.12.2020 159 386 138 551 145 882 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.9.2021 / 30.9.2020 / 31.3.2021 159 682 144 074 152 227 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.12.2021 / 31.12.2020 / 30.6.2021 163 199 145 882 159 386 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.3.2022 / 31.3.2021 / 30.9.2021 153 504 152 227 159 682 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.6.2022 / 30.6.2021 / 31.12.2021 158 098 159 386 163 199 Average 158 774 148 024 156 075 Return on equity (ROE)  % -2.4 25.7 13.3Invested capitalInvested capital = Total equity attributable to owners of the parent + interest-bearing liabilitiesEUR thousand 30.6.2022 30.6.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 158 098 159 386 163 199 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 577 149 229 149 134 Cash and cash equivalents -97 114 -115 964 -101 357 Invested capital 210 561 192 651 210 975The calculation formula for invested capital has been changed.

Good afternoon  and good evening  everyone  and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earning call. We continued to make excellent progress toward our key strategic objectives during the second quarter  and we are extremely well-positioned as we move into the second half of 2022. As a reminder  our three key strategic priorities for this year are: completing the U.S.DREAM pivotal trial  accelerating commercial execution in Germany and commencing of Access U.S. IDE study for complete concentric collapse  or CCC  patients before year-end. Before I go in details  let's start with a fact-based summary on Q2 achievements. To this end  I'm pleased to report that we have completed enrollment in DREAM  and 91 patients have made it through the funnel to implantation.The remaining implants are being scheduled  and we expect to report 12-month clinical data in the fall of 2023 with regulatory approval expected in the first half of 2024. We achieved sales of EUR 935 000  which represents 450% growth year over year and 42% growth quarter over quarter. We also activated 11 new commercial sites in Germany during this quarter  which has begun implanting as of the third quarter  bringing the total to 26 active sites in Germany. From a clinical perspective  we are thrilled that the FDA  after previously granting us breakthrough designation  has approved our IDE to commence the ACCESS study.We expect to implant our first patients in the trial before year-end. From an innovative leadership perspective  we are core to have our next-generation Genio 2.1 approved by the FDA for use in the DREAM-ID study and received CE Mark approval in Europe for clinical and commercial use. I would  once again  like to recognize our growing team for their commitment to strong execution as we advance the Nyxoah story on numerous fronts. Let me start with our commercial  focused primarily on Germany.Germany is the largest and most competitive HGNS  hypoglossal nerve stimulation  market outside of the United States. Nyxoah has dedicated German salespeople and similar DRG and reimbursement level as other hypoglossal nerve stimulation technologies. We have defined our commercial success by achieving significant market share gains each quarter  culminating in market leadership by the end of 2022. For the second quarter  we generated EUR 935 000 in total revenue  representing growth of more than five times versus the second quarter of 2021 and 42% growth versus the first quarter of 2022.We estimate  based on our knowledge of the German market  we increased our German market share by 4 to 5 percentage points versus Q1  which brings us close to 30% market share in Germany. During the quarter  we activated 11 new sites in Germany  which have begun implanting as of the third quarter  bringing our total to 26 active implanting accounts in Germany. We expect to be at least in 35 standards by the end of 2022. This rapid growth has been driven by inbound interest from ENT surgeons and sleep specialists eager to work with us.Physicians and patients are embracing our unique approach centered around to the patient with a scalable technology platform  a single incision procedure  as well as the only full body 1.5 and 3.0 Tesla MRI compatible hypoglossal nerve stimulation solution. From a reimbursement perspective  we continue to make great progress implanting patients in Switzerland and Finland  and we continue our discussions with local healthcare authorities in Belgium  the Netherlands  Italy and the U.K. We are also pleased to see the growth in complete concentric collapse patients now receiving Genio implants since these patients previously had no suitable treatment option other than major pallet surgery and were contraindicated to commercially available hypoglossal nerve stimulation therapy. The first CCC patients that have been implanted for up to six months are showing extremely strong results.As an illustration  one CCC patients who presented with a baseline AHI of 58 suffering from severe OSA had an AHI of understand at six months post-implant. These results encourage more physicians to recommend Genio for their CCC patients. In addition  we are the only company offering solutions for both CCC and noncomplete concentric collapse patients without the need for an extra dice examination. This simplifies and shortens the patient's journey from initial diagnosis to hypoglossal nerve stimulation treatment.Taking all of these factors together  we reiterate our guidance of achieving market status leader status -- market leadership status in Germany in Q4. Moving now to our DREAM study. I'm pleased to report that we have completed enrollment in the trial  with 91 patients having made it to the Funnel 2 implantation  the remaining implants are being scheduled in our U.S. implant sites.We anticipate having 12-month clinical data from the study in the fall of 2023  and we will pursue a model of PMA submission. To that end  we are currently preparing the first modules for submission  which are product technical dossier  including preclinical data  and we are getting ready for manufacturing validation. We anticipate submitting the final DREAM clinical data module in the fourth quarter of 2023 and launching Genio in the second quarter of 2024. The investment in our U.S.market access organization have already begun. As for CCC  our IDE submission for the ACCESS study was approved by the FDA  and we are beginning work to initiate the study with the first patients to be implanted before year-end. We will implant up to 106 patients across 40 clinical sites in the U.S. and file with 12-month data  putting us on course for regulatory approval in early 2025.Our patient-centric focus on innovation was further illustrated by the regulatory approvals of Genio 2.1 next generation system  which is an upgrade to the external components of Genio for use in our DREAM trial and for clinical and commercial use in Europe. Genio 2.1 improves patients' comfort and compliance with a new smartphone application. Patients receive daily feedback on their therapy usage and has ownership to adjust stimulation amplitude within predefined boundaries by their physician. For patients more sensitive to neuro stimulation  clinicians will now have a solution to fine-tune stimulation amplitude to determine the optimal level of comfort.Genio 2.1 is also equipped with embedded sensors to allow physicians to further scale of therapy stimulation parameters based on patient position and throughout the night. Importantly  all of these new features are available to Genio patients without the need for a surgical procedure to replace the implantable component  as Genio is the only scalable hypoglossal nerve stimulation implant as it allows patients to always have the most advanced features with their existing implant. As a reminder  Genio is also the only system with both full-body 1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla MRI compatibility to ensure that patients always feel safe and do not have to worry about explanting their device to undergo an MRI. 3.0 Tesla currently represents up to 40% of all MRIs and is expected to become the standard in the near future.We also continue to advance our development of a next-generation neuro stimulation technology focused on the ansa cervicalis nerve as part of our exclusive licensing agreement with the Vanderbilt University in the U.S. We are progressing toward the prototype device and expect to commence a feasibility study in 2023. These efforts embody our mission to build a product pipeline that will enable us to offer solutions to current non-responding hypoglossal nerve stimulation patients and non-eligible to treat patients. We look forward to providing more updates as this project progresses.To further illustrate Nyxoah's approach of putting patients first  we are thrilled to partner with Acurable to offer AcuPebble home sleep test. Nyxoah is developing a complete obstructive sleep apnea ecosystem in order to best serve and support patients all the way through their OSA journey. AcuPebble is next-generation home sleep test that uses acoustic signals to diagnose OSA. The signals are uploaded to a smartphone application and processed to report an accurate OSA diagnosis  providing high specificity and sensitivity for both the AHI  apnea-hypopnea index  and the oxygen desaturation index  or ODI.AcuPebble is clinically validated through a randomized study published in the BMJ Open  and AcuPebble us CE Marked and also has FDA clearance. AcuPebble breaks down many of the barriers to receiving an accurate OSA diagnosis in a timely manner. With AcuPebble and Genio  Nyxoah can now offer patients and clinicians the most cutting-edge OSA diagnosis and treatment solutions. We look forward to launching AcuPebble in Germany in the fourth quarter of this year 2022.With that  I'm pleased to turn the call over to our CFO  Loic Moreau  who will provide a financial update.Loic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Olivier. Good day to everyone  and thank you for joining us today. Revenue for the second quarter ended June 30  2022 was EUR 935 000  compared to EUR 170 000 for the second quarter of 2021. The increase of 450% was primarily attributable to sales of the Genio system in Germany.Total cost of goods sold for the second quarter of 2022 was EUR 334 000  implying a gross margin of 64.2%. This represents a significant increase versus the 56.2% posted in the first quarter of 2022. As a reminder  first quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by a one-off flooding incident in our manufacturing site in Tel Aviv that was remediated in short order. We continue to expect gross margin to expand over time  in line with other neuro stimulation companies as we achieve greater commercial scale.Total Q2 operating expenses were in line with our plan as we continue to focus on research and development and our clinical programs. R&D increased to $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2022 from $2.4 million in Q2 2021  mostly due to the development of Genio 2.1 and future generations. Selling  general and administrative expenses rose to EUR 4.5 million for the second quarter of 2022 from EUR 3.9 million in the year-ago quarter due primarily to increased commercial efforts in Germany and other European markets. We also added headcount to our corporate infrastructure and expect to continue investing in human capital as we further scale up our organization  particularly our U.S.commercial team. Total operating loss for the second quarter of 2022 was EUR 7.4 million versus EUR 6.3 million in the second quarter of 2021  driven by the acceleration in our R&D spending  as well as our commercial and clinical activities. We realized a net loss of EUR 5 million for the quarter ended June 30  2022  versus a net loss of EUR 6.7 million for the second quarter of 2021. As of June 30  2022  cash and financial assets totaled EUR 123.3 million  compared to EUR 135.5 million on December 31  2021.Total cash burn was EUR 2 million per month during the first half  but we note there was a EUR 6 million foreign exchange tailwind  so monthly cash burn was closer to EUR 3 million  excluding FX. We continue to expect monthly cash burn increase slightly in the second half of 2022 as we commence the ACCESS trial in the U.S. and invest in our direct-to-patient marketing efforts in Germany. We continue to have ample liquidity to get through U.S.commercialization in the first half of 2024. Finally  I'm extremely proud that Nyxoah has been included in the newly formed Euronext sector leaders initiatives  which is an index composed of 100 of the most innovative tech companies listed on Euronext. With that  I will turn the call back to Olivier.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Loic. With the first half of 2022 complete  we entered the second half with confidence and excitement that we will achieve our key strategic goals for the year. With DREAM enrollment complete  we turn our focus to the 12-month follow-up period. We will continue to accelerate our market share gains in Germany as we attain market leadership status.And we look forward to implanting our first ACCESS patients before year-end as we work to provide a solution for complete concentric collapse patients whose only other treatment option is major pallet surgery. This concludes the formal part of our presentation. Operator  I will turn the call over to you  beginning our Q&A session.Questions & Answers:OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Osborn from Cantor Fitzgerald.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerHi  Ross.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystHi. Congrats on the quarter and the progress made. I guess  two questions for me. I'll go and ask both upfront.How many CCC patients were implanted during the quarter? And then my second question  on AcuPebble  are you able to  I guess  disclose the financial relationship there  and then  how we should think about the impact to your top line? Thank you.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah  so let me start by answering the first question on how many CCC patients were implanted. As you know  Ross  since we now have in Europe  the label expansion for CCC  we are no longer doing a dice examination. So to that point  we cannot no longer exclude or know precisely how many of are CCC or how many are non-CCC. So we don't know precise how many that we have.What we do see  however  is that we're also getting CCC patients after the dice examination that were identified to be implanted with the unilateral stimulation  and that is definitely also accelerating and helping us further growing our business in Germany. So I'm sorry that I cannot go more into that on this. And when it comes to AcuPebble and the financial combination  so we start collaborating with the distribution agreement with AcuPebble. We have Germany identified as a pilot country.So the investment  in fact  it's a minimum investment. But as you can also understand the financial impact of the details  this is something that we would not -- that we also are not -- no further commenting on. But the financial impacts will be immaterial as we will initially be launching and to select centers of excellence in Q4 to gain experience with the system before we do a broader whole load.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystOK. Understood. Thanks for taking my questions  and congrats on the progress.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Ross.OperatorOur next question comes from Adam Maeder from Piper Sandler.Simran Kaur -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystGreat. Hi  everyone. This is Simran  on for Adam. Congrats on the progress this quarter.I wanted to start on DREAM. It sounds like there are still some patients that need to be implanted about 24 by my math. Maybe just talk a little bit about when we should be pulled through these patients. I mean  it does sound like it is imminent  but just higher level the trends you're seeing in the trial in recent weeks in terms of baseline PSG  securing OR time  staffing shortages  just any of the -- those kind of headwinds that you may be facing.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerOK. Well  a very interesting question  and thank you for your question. So let me maybe first start by explaining again what the definition of enrolled means. It means that the patient has a signed consent  and they will be entering the screening funnel leading to an implant.As a reminder  once a patient provides content and passes the initial screening criteria of age and BMI  the process is to undergo a forked PSG to determine baseline AHI level. If the patient does  indeed  have moderate to severe OSA  the next step will be to undergo advice to exclude or to determine CCC. If non-CCC  the patient undergoes a baseline PSG and will then move into implant. To date  we have already implanted 91 patients  and 38 are already very advanced in the screening process as a significant portion of these have already passed their PSG and dice.So in a conservative scenario  40% of these should make it to implant leading to 150 implants. But if you are more into a realistic scenario  with the patients that we have enrolled today  we would already be good to implant over 125 patients. So that's where we are. Now from a timing perspective  I'm sure that you remember very well during our last earning call that we were at 66 implants.So in fact  we implanted 25 patients during the last three months. We still need and implant 24 more. We feel strong and we have strong confidence that we can do it in two months. For the reason I just disclosed  we have identified the patients.We have enrolled the patients. We know in every site where they are. And that's why we think it will take another  let's say  six to maximum eight weeks to fully finish all implants.Simran Kaur -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystPerfect. Thank you. And just a real quick follow-up there. I think the last time we talked  there was a mention about the sample size having been reduced from 134 to 115.Can you remind me if this affects the statistical powering of the study? Are there any parameters in the design that need or needed to be adjusted due to the smaller population?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerNo  it does not affect any statistical program study for the simple reason that we stay with a 65% respond rate on AHI. So nothing has changed on this. The only thing we did based on the better sleep data is we looked at the ODI reduction  and there  we also aligned with the 65% respond rate  which was resulting into the reduction to 115 implants. But there is no change in statistical power.There is no change in primary endpoints  no nothing. Everything stays the same.Simran Kaur -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystOK. Perfect. And if I could just squeeze one last one. You guys saw great momentum and nice improvement in the commercial business in Q2.I know you don't have financial guidance  but can you talk about how you think about the business here over the near term and remainder of 2022 in Germany? Any puts and takes there would be helpful.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. I will hand this question over to Loic  to our CFO.Loic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Thank you  Olivier. So as you know  we're not providing formal revenue guidance  but I can say that we are encouraged by the positive feedback we are receiving on and strong progress we are making in our key markets  particularly in Germany  and we do expect revenue to increase each quarter this year. Given this positive momentum  we are generally comfortable with current analyst consensus for this year.Simran Kaur -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystPerfect. Thank you  guys.OperatorAll right. Our next question comes from Suraj Kalia from OpCo.Suraj Kalia -- Oppenheimer and Company -- AnalystGood afternoon  everyone. Olivier  can you hear me all right?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYes  I can. Hello  Suraj.Simran Kaur -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystSo Olivier  in Germany  what percent of the patients implanted in the quarter were CCC? And if you could just give us some metrics in terms of the sites where Nyxoah patients were implanted. What was the decision matrix versus Inspire?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerSo first of all  when it comes to CCC patients  it's very difficult now to put a precise number on what is the percentage CCC versus non-CCC for the simple reason that  in Germany  the businesses are no longer doing a dice examination to define whether the patient is CCC or non-CCC. As I mentioned  we have in our label boat. So this disposure is gone. So I don't know precisely anymore how much is CCC or non-CCC.That's one thing. What we do know is that based on literature  it goes up to 30% of patients having or showing CCC. So that's the first question. The second one  when you say how do sites where we implant and we must to be very precise  we had patients implanted in Q2 coming from 15 sites.In those sites  the key decision criteria for the physician are  one  the bilateral stimulation. So it seems and also based on recent public article comparing unilateral and bilateral stimulation that a lot of physicians who really prefer the bilateral stimulation talk to their patients. Next  it is the single incision.So that makes the procedure growing fast  that makes the procedure also decreasing the risk for [Inaudible] and that also for payments makes it more acceptable  only having one incision that is very discrete under the skin compared to multiple incisions. Those are the two main components that we are getting from physicians when they are making their criteria to choose for Genio.Suraj Kalia -- Oppenheimer and Company -- AnalystGot it. Two other questions  Olivier. First  just following up on the no dice procedure. Obviously  Inspire is also running down a clinical trial with no dice requirements.Do you envision a point in time  maybe not in the distant future  where both companies are -- do not require dice  and therefore  the whole notion of CCC or non-CCC gets somewhat muddled up? And a follow-up and my final question  Olivier  if I could just throw it in there. For the U.S. commercial launch  as you'll plan for it  walk us through how your view the right market approach  the type of reps  do they have to have OSC experience or just neuro modulation? And also  any thoughts on the DTC approach  would be greatly appreciated. Folks  thank you for taking my questions.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So let me start with the first one  where I would like to comment on Inspire running a trial to eliminate diagnose CCC. So first of all  let me remind you again that Genio already has the CCC label in Europe  and therefore  there is no need to diagnose CCC any longer when using -- choosing for Nyxoah. Now regardless of the outcome of the Inspire study  and I think it's called predictors.Unless Inspire gains a CCC label  patients will still need to undergo an evaluation to determine if they have CCC prior to getting an Inspire implant. So I don't really see the difference besides gaining the CCC label expansion like we did already in Europe and like we all know  also building the first clinical evidence in the U.S. using our ACCESS study that was part of the breakthrough designation. The second question on how a business model would look like in the U.S.I think what we are learning in Germany is that the ENT surgeon will stay crucial to do a high-quality implant also in the U.S. But if you look at the patient journey  the role of the sleep physician is so important because sleep physicians are the ones who are seeing patients that are diagnosing patients and that will also choose what kind of treatment option they will advise to their patients. Now to that extent  the way we have built our team in Germany and what we're also thinking of using as a commercial approach when we will be able to enter the U.S. commercially is that we will make sure that there is the high-quality field clinical engineers supporting the ENT surgeons when doing an implant and when activating patients.But next on this that we will also have real sleep experts who speak language of sleep physicians  meaning they can help in the phenotyping and identification of patients. And next  when a patient is implanted  they can also help and guide in a perfect follow-up  so that the patient can benefit from the optimal stimulation settings. So that's where we see it a little bit different compared to what competition is doing. We will focus more on sleep physicians  and we will also work with dedicated people who are really sleep experts in identifying patients and in ensuring that they get the best potential stimulation parameters in the follow-up.When it comes to DTC  of course  I also see the great work that has been done so far on DTC  that is really resulting in an increase of awareness for hypoglossal nerve stimulation in general. But as we will be the second company that will be coming into the U.S. market  it's clear that we do not have the same power to invest the amount in DTC. And again  in line with our commercial approach  we will focus on fleet physicians  and then we will selectively invest in DTC to study further referral parts to those sleep physicians and ENT surgeons that are very expertise with hypoglossal nerve stimulation and an excellent implant device.I'm sorry that my answer was a little bit longer  but I hope it was clear. And if not  please ask  and I will try to clarify.Suraj Kalia -- Oppenheimer and Company -- AnalystNo  that's great. Thank you.OperatorAll right. At this time  I'd like to turn it back to Nyxoah for any closing remarks.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much  again  for joining us today. And of course  we look forward to updating you again very soon. Thank you for your time.

Asia-Pacific dominates the global plastic pallet market and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.7% by 2030.New York  United States  Aug. 09  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plastic pallets are rigid structures that hold goods in place during transportation or storage. They play an essential role in the supply chain and logistics industries. Plastic pallets have numerous advantages over other types of pallets. Today around 90% of pallets are manufactured with recycled plastic. The most used recycled plastic is high-density polyethylene. On the other hand  some manufacturers used post-industrial scrap  including rubber  silicates  and polypropylene.Get a Free Sample Copy of This Report @ https://straitsresearch.com/report/plastic-pallet-market/request-sampleGrowing Need to Reduce the Overall Weight of Bulk Packaging Drives the Market for Plastic PalletsThe need to reduce the weight of overall bulk packaging is growing day by day. The importance of the consignment or shipment during transportation is an essential factor in determining the cost of the finished product. It is common for the transportation cost of a product to exceed its production cost  reducing the overall profit margin. Plastic pallets are significantly lighter than wooden or metal pallets  which is expected to entice end-user companies to use them.The deadweight of a company is the weight of a container or packaging used to transport materials or products. More packaging weight means higher transportation costs  which limits manufacturers' options. This is expected to increase demand for low-weight packaging materials capable of reducing deadweight while improving material handling and transportation efficiency.Expanding End-Use Industries to Create New Market Opportunities for Plastic PalletsThe primary end-use industries for plastic pallets are food and pharmaceutical. Plastic pallets are increasingly replacing wooden pallets because sanitation and safety are top priorities in both sectors. Large volumes of raw materials are handled  stored  and transported daily in the processed food industry. Plastic pallets are widely used for material handling throughout manufacturing and transportation.Story continuesAs a result of an increasingly hectic lifestyle and an expanding middle-class population  the global processed food industry has grown significantly. Furthermore  the rapid introduction of new food and beverage products  combined with rising e-commerce and organized retail penetration  has resulted in the growth of the processed food industry. Key food manufacturers are rapidly expanding their manufacturing capacity and distribution networks.Report ScopeReport Metric Details Market Size USD 18.20 Billion by 2030 CAGR 5.8% (2022-2030) Historical Data 2019-2020 Base Year 2021 Forecast Period 2022-2030 Forecast Units Value (USD Billion ) Report Coverage Revenue Forecast  Competitive Landscape  Growth Factors  and Trends Segments Covered Materials  Type and End-User Geographies Covered North America  Europe  Asia-Pacific  LAME and Rest of the World Key Companies Profiled/Vendors Orbis Corporation  Rehrig Pacific Company  Monoflo International  CABKA Group  Perfect Pallets Inc.

Asia-Pacific has become a manufacturing hub (TPP) because of the countries participating in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. TPP is a free trade agreement that has strengthened the region's trade and manufacturing sectors  driving demand for plastic pallets over the yearsNorth America holds the second-largest share in the global plastic pallet market. It is expected to reach USD 3 333 million by 2030  growing at a CAGR of 5.5%. This is due to increased demand for plastic pallets from end-user industries  particularly domestic supply chains. The robust manufacturing industry  particularly in the United States  contributed to the region's significant share.Europe is expected to witness substantial growth during the forecast period. Through E.U. treaties  the European Union has supported sustainable development by recognizing the environmental  economic  and social dimensions. The European Commission published a new roadmap for sustainability in the E.U.'s economy in December 2019  significantly impacting end-use industries because the objectives pushed them to adopt green packaging  including reusable plastic pallets.Key HighlightsThe global plastic pallets market size was estimated at USD 7 165 million in 2021  and it is expected to reach USD 18 207 million by 2030  growing at a CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period (2022–2030).Based on materials   the global plastic pallet market is segmented into High-Density Polyethylene  Low-Density Polyethylene  Polypropylene  and Others. High-density polypropylene (HDPE) accounts for the largest share and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.9% by 2030. Since HDPE is exceptionally durable and has high impact resistance  HDPE pallets sustain little or no damage from rough handling by forklifts and other material handling equipment.Based on type  the global plastic pallet market is segmented into Nestable  Rackable  Stackable  and Others. Nestable Pallets account for the largest share and are expected to grow at a CAGR of 6% by 2030. Nestable pallets are less expensive than rackable and stackable pallets  making them an excellent plastic pallet option for export or open-loop supply chain applications. In the coming years  the growing need to reduce the weight of bulk transportation is expected to favor the growth of nestable pallets.Based on end-user   the global plastic pallet market is segmented into Food & Beverages  Chemicals  Pharmaceuticals  Petroleum & Lubricants  and Others. Food and Beverages dominate the global plastic pallet market and are expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.9% by 2030.

The positive margin improvement development trend of Leipurin also continued. Our comparable operating profit for the quarter increased to EUR 16.0 million  marking Q2 2022 as the most profitable quarter in Aspo Group’s history. We were able to further improve our comparable operating profit rate to 9.7% for the quarter  well above the long-term target of 8%  and in parallel net sales increased to EUR 165.3 million. All in all  an excellent second quarter and that is thanks to our entire staff in all our businesses.Russia’s reprehensible military action on Ukraine has caused significant human suffering and has dramatically upset the geopolitical status quo. Along with numerous international companies  Aspo has also taken action to adjust its operations in Russia  with the aim to ultimately exit the market. By end of Q2 2022  all of ESL Shipping's operations in Russia had been suspended and the ship capacity has been transferred to other traffic areas. As previously announced  Telko is exploring options to exit its Russian and Belarusian operations during this year. Leipurin has also decided to withdraw from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. We see these actions as necessary for the sustainability of our operations and long-term value creation.While we are reducing our presence in East  we have focused on our strategy execution and targeted growth in Western markets. In May  Leipurin announced that it will acquire the Swedish bakery industry distributor Kobia and expand its geographical presence into Scandinavia. This is a transformative action for Leipurin’s business and a major milestone for the whole Group as one of the first concrete actions of our renewed compounder strategy. In line with the renewed strategy  Leipurin also completed the sale of its manufacturing business Vulganus on June 30th. ESL Shipping is finalizing a long-term pooling partnership together with a group of institutional and private investors. This is a major strategic action  reducing our capital requirements and improving returns  while reshaping the business model of ESL Shipping. Telko has over the past months actively screened for suitable acquisition opportunities with the aim to pursue its compounding strategy. On the Group level  we successfully issued a new hybrid bond of EUR 30 million in June to support and accelerate our strategy execution.In mid-June  we upgraded our financial guidance for full-year 2022 especially due to the better-than-estimated development of ESL Shipping and Telko and their outlook for the remainder of the year. According to our current guidance  Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit will improve from previous year (EUR 42.4 million). As previously communicated  items affecting comparability caused by the war in Ukraine and the decisions regarding business operations in Russia will cause an estimated total expense of EUR 15–20 million. A withdrawal from the Russian businesses would also trigger the reclassification of translation differences from equity to the statement of comprehensive income. The recognition does not reduce the equity of the Group as the translation differences have been recognized as a reduction of equity when incurred.While macroeconomic uncertainty is increasing and we are beginning to witness the partly deliberate drop in the financial performance of our operations in Eastern markets  we feel very confident about Aspo’s full-year performance in 2022. Financial impact from exiting the selected Eastern markets as well as macroeconomic development impacting demand  price and cost levels and availability of raw materials for the specific businesses create uncertainty going forward. Despite this  we are in a good position to continue our strategy execution during the coming years and aim to offset any negative impact from the business environment through own strategy implementation actions.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsOn December 1  2021  Aspo published new long-term financial targets:Operating profit of 8%Net sales growth 5–10% per yearReturn on equity of over 20%Gearing less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%.We excelled in Q2 2022 against all financial targets. Aspo’s net sales increased by 16% during the second quarter of 2022. The comparable operating profit rate was 9.7% (6.7%)  well above the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained high at 23.4% (24.5%). Gearing decreased to 92.6% (129.4%).Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit from continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit excludes items affecting comparability  which are defined as significant  rare and deviate from normal business operations. These include for example impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by the war in Ukraine.Aspo announced in December 2021 that the Kauko business segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  have been defined as businesses outside Aspo’s core operations. The Kauko business segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS  and its results are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. With regards to the income statement  comparative periods’ figures have been restated to correspond to the same presentation method. Vulganus has been divested on June 30th. The results of Vulganus  including the divestment loss and related transaction costs are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.Net sales and operating profit margin  Group total 4-6/2022 4-6/2021 1-6/2022 1-6/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 165.3 142.8 327.9 275.2 586.4 Net sales  continuing operations 161.4 139.3 321.8 268.7 573.3 Net sales  discontinued operations 3.9 3.5 6.1 6.5 13.1 Operating profit  Group total 13.6 9.6 23.7 17.4 33.9 Operating profit  Group total  % 8.2 6.7 7.2 6.3 5.8 Items affecting comparability*) -2.4 -7.3 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 16.0 9.6 31.0 17.4 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 9.7 6.7 9.5 6.3 7.2Comparable operating profit  Group total 4-6/2022 4-6/2021 1-6/2022 1-6/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 9.0 5.4 18.2 9.9 26.8 Telko  operating profit 6.8 5.5 10.8 10.1 20.4 Leipurin  operating profit 0.4 0.3 0.0 0.6 -2.4 Other operations  operating profit -1.4 -1.6 -3.9 -3.2 -7.9 Operating profit from continuing operations 14.8 9.6 25.1 17.4 36.9 Operating profit from discontinued operations -1.2 0.0 -1.4 0.0 -3.0 Operating profit  Group total 13.6 9.6 23.7 17.4 33.9 Items affecting comparability*) -2.4 -7.3 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 16.0 9.6 31.0 17.4 42.4*) The items affecting comparability of the second quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -2.4 million include the costs related to restructuring Russia-related operations of EUR -0.2 million for ESL Shipping  EUR -0.4 million for Telko  EUR -0.1 million for Leipurin  the impact of the divestment of Vulganus of EUR -0.4 million for Leipurin  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million on Kauko’s goodwill  which is reported as part of the results of the discontinued operations.The items affecting comparability of the first quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -4.9 million  consist of EUR 1.5 million in sales gains from ESL Shipping barge Espa  ESL Shipping’s cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the war in Ukraine  EUR -2.6 million in losses from the destruction of Telko’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -2.0 million associated with Telko’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  EUR -0.7 million in losses from the destruction of Leipurin’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with Leipurin’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  and EUR -0.2 million in Leipurin’s other business adaptation expenses in Russia.

Aspo’s businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) targets for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce the emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30.During the past 12 months  the emission intensity continued to improve  driven by net sales growth in combination with operational efficiency  and it was 0.37 (12/2021: 0.42). Another key target is to improve the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIF). During the past 12 months  TRI (Total Recordable Injury Frequency) was 7.1 (12/2021: 8.8)  while the target for 2022 is 7.0. The long-term goal is zero occupational accidents.Operating environment and the impact of the war in Ukraine on Aspo’s operationsAspo’s operating environment has changed dramatically due to Russia’s armed invasion of Ukraine. The invasion has caused a lot of uncertainty in the market as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates.Suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The war drastically weakens operating conditions in Eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  but particularly based on values.As announced earlier  Telko is exploring options to exit its Russian and Belarusian operations during this year. Leipurin has decided to withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. The process is proceeding as planned and more details on the timetable and methods of implementation will be announced in due course. Telko’s and Leipurin’s combined net sales in these countries accounted for approximately 16% of Aspo Group's net sales in 2021.The net sales of Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan amounted to EUR 26.3 million in year 2021 which accounted for 23% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2021 and 4% of the net sales of Aspo Group. The net sales of Telko Russia and Belarus amounted to EUR 69.9 million in year 2021 which accounted for 26% of Telko’s total net sales in 2021 and 12% of the net sales of Aspo Group. Furthermore  by the end of Q2 2022  all of ESL Shipping's operations in Russia had been suspended and the ship capacity has been transferred to other traffic areas.The sanctions imposed by Western countries and Russia’s legislative measures prevent transportation of goods and transfer of payments  rapidly reducing net sales and profitability. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight.The equity of Russian Group companies is EUR 26.6 million  corresponding to 17.0% of Aspo Group’s total equity. Aspo’s assets in Russia are mainly related to cash  inventories and trade receivables. The financial significance of small-scale production operations is very minor for the Group. The number of employees working for Aspo companies in Russia is decreasing  amounting to 135 employees at the end of June (12/2021: 193).In media  the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion  but its impact is still present in the operating environment. For example  global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on Aspo’s businesses  decelerating trading and the completion of orders. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations and especially among crew members of ESL Shipping’s vessels.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 4-6/2022 4-6/2021 Change 1-6/2022 1-6/2021 Change in share in share MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % Finland 55.5 42.7 3.8 108.8 85.2 2.1 Scandinavia 32.3 27.7 0.1 60.9 52.4 -0.6 Baltic countries 17.7 13.5 1.3 33.2 25.4 0.9 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 31.7 36.7 -6.7 72.0 71.7 -4.3 Other countries 24.2 18.8 1.5 46.9 34.0 1.9 Total 161.4 139.4 321.8 268.7The Group’s main market areas are Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and Eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The relative share of net sales in Eastern markets continued to decrease during the second quarter of 2022  mainly due to the war in Ukraine and the decision to reduce operations in Russia and ultimately exit the market. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at Western markets.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s cash flow from operating activities in January–June was EUR 34.3 (22.2) million. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR 2.3 (-7.2) million. Free cash flow during January-June was EUR 27.6 (16.2) million. Investments of EUR -8.2(-6.1) million mainly consisted of docking of ESL Shipping’s vessels.6/2022 6/2021 12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 192.4 188.1 185.1 Cash and cash equivalents 47.5 21.1 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 144.9 167.0 167.4Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 144.9 million  and gearing fell to 92.6% (6/2021: 141.8%; 12/2021: 129.4%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the period was 35.6% (6/2021: 30.5%; 12/2021: 32.0%). The balance sheet strengthened as a result of improved profitability and a new hybrid bond issued in June.Net financial expenses in January–June totaled EUR -4.9 (-1.9) million. The impact of exchange rate fluctuations  particularly strengthening of the Russian rouble  on the increase in financial expenses was EUR -3.6 million. The average rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 1.4% (1.6%).The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents were EUR 47.5 million at the end of the review period (12/2021: EUR 17.7 million). Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40.0 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. EUR 7 million of Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program were in use (6/2021: EUR 6 million; 12/2021: EUR 5 million).On June 7  2022  Aspo issued a new hybrid bond of EUR 30 million. The coupon rate of the bond is 8.75% per annum. The bond has no maturity  but the company is entitled to redeem it in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo’s previous hybrid bond of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.On June 21  Aspo’s subsidiary ESL Shipping signed EUR 20 million loan agreement with Nordic Investment Bank. The maturity of the loan is 10 years. The loan is a part of financing of ESL Shipping’s investment in a series of six new  highly energy-efficient electric hybrid 5 350 dwt vessels  a project first announced in September 2021.Dividends of EUR 0.23 per share  totaling EUR 7.2 million  were paid during the second quarter.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its businesses are exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties which include but are not limited to the risks stated below.There is an increasing level of geopolitical uncertainty relating to Russia's war in Ukraine. This is expected to affect the general economic environment  e.g. via inflation  interest rates  energy prices and prices of raw materials. Disturbances related to running infrastructure may also occur as part of current uncertainties relating to Russia  for example due to cyber incidents or disruptions in information systems.This ongoing process of exiting Russia and other selected Eastern markets is changing the structure of the Group significantly and will affect the earnings model of each Aspo business in the long run. There is a risk that the withdrawal of the businesses will cause additional costs and repatriation of funds will not success fully as planned.Economic activity and current geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components  and logistics services to increase rapidly  and increased uncertainties concerning functioning logistics in certain market situations. Aspo may temporarily benefit from the price increases  while the prices of purchased raw materials or leased capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes in different market situations  are also increasing risks.International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. Geopolitical tensions can escalate and cause direct damage to business  payments and even suspend business operations in a crisis area or in areas affected by it.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its earnings via acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial investments and consequently may reduce solvency.The impact of coronavirus on Aspo’s business has been limited on group level  although the impact on Leipurin has been significant. Current and any new variants of coronavirus and their rapid spread may lead to various interruptions and financial losses.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and informational setting  they include significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading carrier of dry bulk cargo in the Baltic Sea region. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 48 vessels with a total capacity of 456 000 deadweight tons (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (75% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 23 vessels (23%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean carriers at sea as a special service.4-6/2022 4-6/2021 Change % 1-6/2022 1-6/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 60.3 46.0 31 117.1 89.4 31 Operating profit  MEUR 9.0 5.4 67 18.2 9.9 84 Operating profit  % 14.9 11.7 15.5 11.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.2 1.1 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 9.2 5.4 70 17.1 9.9 73 Comparable operating profit  % 15.3 11.7 14.6 11.1The second quarter of 2022 displayed the strongest second quarter operating result in ESL Shipping’s history. Net sales increased with 31% from last year to EUR 60.3 (46.0) million. During the quarter  the comparable operating profit increased to a record-high level of EUR 9.2 (5.4) million. The operating profit increased to EUR 9.0 (5.4) million and includes cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the closure of Russia-related contracts.The strong result was driven by the shipping company’s partnership strategy  favorable market conditions and the operational success delivered by the entire personnel  evident for example in reduction in ballast voyages. The comparable operating profit rate of 15.3% (11.7%) achieved during the second quarter was excellent  especially considering the historical change of abandoning cargo flows from Russia as a consequence of the war in Ukraine and resulted sanctions. The target level of 14.0% operating profit was clearly exceeded. During the second quarter  prices of diesel and LNG used as a ship fuel were almost three times higher than in the comparative period last year. The current level of very high fuel surcharges will increase net sales and reduce the operating profit percentage rate  used as an indicator of relative profitability  even though no actual changes would take place in the absolute operating profit.During Q2  the volume of cargo transported by the shipping company decreased  as expected  from the comparative period to 3.3 (3.7) million tons. The main drivers behind the volume development were re-routing of raw material supply out of Russia  which resulted in increased transportation distances  and heavy congestion in certain major contract traffic ports.At the end of the second quarter  ESL Shipping had no remaining transport obligations related to cargo operations from Russian ports or with customers and cargo closely related to Russia. The released vessel capacity has been successfully transferred to other operating areas. ESL Shipping has also suspended the start-up of its previously established Russian company and will eventually wind it down in accordance with local regulations.The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories remained strong during the second quarter. In contract traffic  demand for ton miles remained strong throughout the review period despite realized lower volumes  and spot market freight rates were at a high level in all customer segments and vessel categories. Ports have continued to be heavily congested in ESL Shipping’s main transportation areas because of poor availability of stevedores. Despite this  profitability was historically strong.As announced earlier  AtoBatC Shipping declared at the end of the second quarter an option and order for the first additional vessel from the Indian shipyard Chowgule & Company Private Limited  from which the shipping company has previously ordered six identical electric hybrid vessels. The first two of the new generation of energy-efficient hybrid electric vessels are already under construction  and the planned delivery of the first vessel is scheduled for the third quarter of 2023.The scheduled drydockings of the current fleet continued with 45 (72) docking days during the second quarter. Available ship capacity in the smaller ship segment was heavily constrained by a bigger than usual number of docking offhire days of the time-chartered tonnage.ESL Shipping’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The shipping company aims to halve its carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During the second quarter  ESL Shipping took an important step together with Neste to become the world's first shipping company to start utilizing new low-emission Neste Marine™ 0.1 Co-processed marine fuel in its vessels in Finland and Sweden. The ISCC PLUS certified marine fuel enables up to 80% reduced greenhouse gas emissions over the life cycle compared to fossil fuels without compromising the product quality and performance.During the reporting period  the emission intensity of ESL Shipping’s transportation resulted in 15.4 grams of carbon dioxide per ton mile  an increase of 6.9% from the previous year. At the same time  emissions per transported cargo ton decreased by 6.8%.The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–June increased by 31% from the comparative period  amounting to EUR 117.1 (89.4) million. The comparable operating profit increased to EUR 17.1 (9.9) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 14.6% (11.1%).ESL Shipping outlook for 2022Most of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements  which will continue to support ESL Shipping’s performance during the second half of 2022. After deliveries of Russian raw materials stopped  some of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers were forced to seek new suppliers in new geographical areas for part of their required production input. This is expected to lengthen transportation distances and increase demand for sea transportation per ton mile for ESL Shipping’s largest vessels. Temporarily the share of energy coal is expected to increase in terms of ton miles  mainly due to longer transportation distance.Macroeconomic uncertainty is increasing within ESL Shipping’s main geographical market area. High rate of inflation  mainly driven by high energy prices caused by supply constraints owing to the war in Ukraine  is increasing the pressure on supply chain efficiency also among the shipping company’s main customers. ESL Shipping’s investments in energy efficient vessels will further strengthen its market position going forward. Demand for transportation and the price level of sea freights in the company’s main market area in Northern Europe are still at a satisfactorily level in all vessel categories. Despite the overall uncertainty  ESL Shipping’s main clients are forecasted to continue with fairly good production volumes and access to key raw materials.The impact of energy price increases on ESL Shipping’s costs are effectively offset through long-term fuel clauses in transportation agreements. The shipping company is moderately increasing the fuel stock level onboard its ships in anticipation for eventual supply shortages during autumn 2022.In the coaster vessel category  transportation demand in contract traffic is expected to remain at a satisfactory level despite that some customers’ supply chains may face challenges regarding in availability of raw materials  that may also impact realized product transportation volumes. Vessel timecharter hires that have partly increased to an unhealthy level are expected to start to decline. Measures will continue to protect the personnel’s health security during the re-emergence of the coronavirus.In Northern Europe  there continues to be considerable growth in interest among customers for environmentally friendly maritime transport that produces as low carbon emissions as possible. In addition to ESL Shipping’s investments in new highly environmentally friendly vessels  the shipping company is in long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide sea transportation with even lower carbon emissions  and even fossil-free transportation  in the future.In connection with the forthcoming series of new-generation electric hybrid vessels and remaining additional vessel options  ESL Shipping is finalizing a long-term pooling partnership together with a group of institutional and private investors. The pooling structure is a model commonly used in the international shipping business for the ownership and operation of vessels  and it is introduced to accelerate the growth  profitability and return on capital of ESL Shipping's business.During the third quarter  two larger and one smaller vessel units will be drydocked for a total of approximately 75 (116) days. In total  there will be approximately 130 (229) dockage days in 2022. After these drydockings  all vessels owned by ESL Shipping will be equipped with ballast water treatment systems that meet new environmental regulations.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service both in the East and the West. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.4-6/2022 4-6/2021 Change % 1-6/2022 1-6/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 71.8 67.6 6 147.7 125.6 18 Operating profit  MEUR 6.8 5.5 24 10.8 10.1 7 Operating profit  % 9.5 8.1 7.3 8.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.4 -5.0 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 7.2 5.5 31 15.8 10.1 56 Comparable operating profit  % 10.0 8.1 10.7 8.0In the second quarter of 2022  Telko’s net sales grew to EUR 71.8 (67.6) million and its comparable operating profit increased to EUR 7.2 (5.5) million. Telko’s comparable operating profit rate remained strong at 10.0% (8.1%). The comparable operating profit for the second quarter excludes items affecting comparability of EUR -0.4 million including the restructuring costs of operations in Russia totaling EUR -0.9 million and the decrease in the credit loss provision related to accounts receivables in Ukraine of EUR 0.5 million. Telko’s reported operating profit for the second quarter grew to EUR 6.8 (5.5) million.Telko’s sales growth was driven by global price increases and the systematic implementation of strategic growth plans with a positive volume effect especially in the Western market. Operating profit was higher than expected mainly because of a positive sales margin level trend. In Russia  Telko continued to focus on selling the existing inventory. Price levels remained high.Net sales of the plastics business increased by 2% during the second quarter  amounting to EUR 37.5 (36.8) million. Demand of plastic polymers remained in general on a normal level but in the last weeks of the quarter  the market became resistant to high price levels  which negatively affected demand and slowed down activity. Towards the end of the quarter  stock levels in value chain increased and price pressure started to grow. Prices peaked in volume plastics during the second quarter due to strong increases in crude oil and monomer prices. Many products reached all time high market price levels. Prices in Engineering Plastics further increased and remained high. Overall availability of products is improving but still in some specific product groups availability remains restricted. Automotive sector component issues are not solved  and production and sales are lower than typically. In Russia  Telko has been able to sell the remaining stock with better than normal conditions due to low product availability in the market. Business in Ukraine has restarted and in June already reaching 50% of June 2021 volumes.Net sales of the chemicals business increased by 1% to EUR 21.8 (21.5) million. Price levels are generally high and continued to rise  except for some commodity chemicals. The main drivers for the price increases were high crude oil price and energy costs. Also  vegetable oil-based products became more expensive. The logistics costs for overseas transportation remained high. Demand of some customer segments started to decline following export restrictions to Russia  impacting especially Finland and Latvia. Sales in Ukraine started to recover in spring reaching a 50-60% level in June  compared to previous year’s levels.Net sales of the lubricants business increased by 34% to EUR 12.5 (9.3) million. High price levels combined with the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021 were the most significant growth drivers. High demand especially for Industrial lubricants resulted in sales volume growth. Prices continued to increase during the quarter in all product groups. There were significant cost increases for raw materials  transportation  and product manufacturing. Imbalance in the supply and demand caused availability issues in several product groups.Telko’s net sales increased by 18% during January–June to EUR 147.7 (125.6) million. Telko’s comparable operating profit for the first half of the year was EUR 15.8 (10.1) million  and its comparable operating profit rate was 10.7% (8.0%). Telko’s reported operating profit stood at EUR 10.8 (10.1) million for January-June 2022 and the reported operating profit rate was 7.3% (8.0%).Telko outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and its consequences have a significant impact on Telko’s outlook for the rest of the year. Telko’s short-term outlook is associated with uncertainties.Telko´s sales are expected to decrease during the second half of the year due to the significantly decreasing sales in Russia. Telko has already reduced its Russian inventory significantly. In June  Aspo announced that Telko is exploring options to exit its Russian and Belarusian operations during 2022.In the Western markets  sales are expected to remain on a relatively stable level  but the risk for rapid changes in demand and price level is relatively high because of uncertainties in global economic development. Recovery in Ukraine is expected to continue. The devaluation of the Ukrainian hryvnia will have a negative impact on Telko’s result of the third quarter but will reduce costs longer term.In volume plastics  Telko expects rapid turn down in prices caused by high inventory levels in the value chain and lowering monomer prices. In engineering plastics  we will see more stable prices  but price pressure may grow towards end of the year. We expect low sales from the Eastern market but a steadily recovering business in Ukraine.In chemicals  the energy crisis will keep price levels high and for some segments we expect further price increases. On the other hand  modest demand keeps price level under pressure for many commodity products. High overseas freight rates limit low-cost competition from Asia  supporting European price levels. Recovery in Ukraine is expected to continue as long as the war is limited to the Eastern part of the country. Strong growth is expected to continue in Central Asia.In lubricants  it is expected that prices will stabilize towards the end of year. Inflation and geopolitical instability may have negative impact on demand for lubricants. On the other hand  estimated lower demand will solve availability issues.According to its strategy  Telko will seek not only organic growth in the Western markets  but also accelerated growth through acquisitions to achieve the strategic goals set for Telko.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in eight countries that have been grouped into three regional organizations  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  East  and the Baltic region. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. Leipurin’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. Leipurin uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.Vulganus Oy manufactures and maintains refrigeration and freezing solutions for the food industry through its spiral products.

There was no significant impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the first half of 2022.Leipurin’s net sales increased to EUR 29.3 (25.8) million in the second quarter. Net sales in Finland grew by 25% and stood at EUR 11.7 (9.4) million. Net sales in the Baltic countries increased by 27% and were EUR 9.4 (7.4) million. In the market area East  net sales were down 14% due to the scaled-down assortment including only local sourcing  and stood at EUR 6.4 (7.4) million. Sales to bakeries was up 8% in the second quarter at EUR 18.6 (17.3) million. Sales to food industry increased by 42% and were EUR 3.7 (2.6) million. Leipurin’s second quarter sales were significantly impacted by strong growth in global market prices of raw materials  whereas sales measured in kilograms showed a small growth in Finland and the Baltic countries combined  whereas East clearly declined. The cost of living increased significantly in Finland and the Baltic region  strengthening the shift in consumer demand towards more affordable products. Despite this  positive margin development continued.Leipurin’s comparable operating profit for Q2 was EUR 0.9 (0.3) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.1% (1.2%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit excluding Vulganus was EUR 1.3 million (0.3) and comparable operating profit rate 4.9% (1.1%).Leipurin’s reported operating profit for Q2 was EUR 0.4 million (0.3). Items reducing Leipurin’s operating profit and affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.5 million for Q2 which included the impact from divesting Vulganus of EUR -0.4 million and costs related to the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan totaling EUR -0.1 million.The profitability of Leipurin’s own machine manufacturing operations  Vulganus Oy  was still significantly undermined by rising market prices of steel raw materials  slow progress in after sales during the first part of the year and cost overruns in certain projects. Net sales of Vulganus in Q2 were EUR 1.8 (1.6) million and the operating result was EUR -0.5 (0.0) million. Vulganus was divested at the end of the second quarter.In January-June  Leipurin’s net sales increased and were EUR 57.0 (53.7) million. Q1 2021 comparison figures include significant machinery sales in Russia  and the year-on-year growth in raw materials is very strong. Net sales in Finland grew by 20% and stood at EUR 22.1 (18.4) million. Net sales in the Baltic region increased by 23% and were EUR 17.4 (14.1) million. In the market area East  net sales decreased by 6% and were EUR 13.2 (14.0) million. Sales to bakeries increased by 10% in January-June and were EUR 36.8 (33.5) million. Sales to the food industry increased by 21% and stood at EUR 6.3 (5.2) million. The euro-denominated increase in sales was significantly impacted by strong growth in global market prices of raw materials. In Finland and Baltics  . the volumes were above the pre-pandemic 2019 levels. n Q2 2022 volumes were above 2019 levels.Leipurin’s comparable operating profit for January-June 2022 was EUR 1.6 (0.6) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.8% (1.1%). Net sales of Vulganus were EUR 4.3 (3.0) million and the operating result was EUR -0.8 (-0.1) million. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit excluding Vulganus was EUR 2.3 (0.7) million and comparable operating profit rate 4.4% (1.4%).The profit management program launched during the second quarter of 2021 will develop the organization’s capability of knowledge management and particularly help to improve the commercial performance. Key tools include Group-wide category management and the improved efficiency in supply chain and logistics. The revised management model already increased financial performance during 2021. The implementation of the program was particularly reflected on the positive development of results in Finland and the Baltic countries.Availability challenges still persisted in various product categories. In Finland and the Baltic region  Leipurin has succeeded in using the post-pandemic recovery in demand.In Q2  Leipurin announced an acquisition where it agreed to purchase the entire share capital of the Swedish bakery industry distributor Kobia Ab from the Swedish Abdon Group. The acquisition will expand Leipurin’s geographical presence in the Northern European market. In 2021  Kobia’s net sales amounted to approximately EUR 50 million and its operating profit margin was approximately 3%. The transaction also includes the properties owned by Kobia. The acquisition is not expected to generate significant goodwill. Through the acquisition  Leipurin further strengthens its position as a leading player in the Baltic Sea region  with increased size and profitability. The new entity provides suppliers with a compelling gateway to the region’s market. Customers in the bakery and food industry will benefit from a strong partner in the global raw material market. The Swedish competition authority has approved the acquisition and Kobia AB’s operations are planned to become a part of Leipurin as of September 1  2022.In June  Leipurin published its first ever sustainability report reflecting on the performance of 2021. ESG targets have been integrated into management’s target setting and remuneration for the first time for 2022.Heli Arantola  Managing Director of Leipurin  resigned in June to join another company. Arantola will leave the company in December at the latest  and the process of selecting her successor has begun.Leipurin outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and financial results. The net sales of Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan amounted to EUR 26.3 million in year 2021 which accounted for 23 percent of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2021.Increased energy prices will have a negative impact on demand for more premium products  at least in the Baltic region. They will also cause profitability challenges for the bakery segment’s customers.World wheat prices turned to a decline in response to the possible start of grain shipments from Ukraine. However  the situation is not stable  and the future price level of cereals will be affected by both the success of the harvest season and the success of transportation in the future  as well.The impact of the war in Ukraine  the coronavirus pandemic  and extreme weather conditions on global supply chains will be emphasized  affecting the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times.The weakening of purchasing power can have a negative effect on the demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers direct their purchases to more affordable products in Finland as well.The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration  the financial and ICT service center  and a small number of other functions not covered by business units. The operating result for other operations was EUR -1.4 (-1.6) million in the second quarter. Costs decreased as a result of stabilized personnel costs and decreasing expenditure of short-term projects  which increased the loss of the comparative period.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

Following questions raised by the FDA in August 2021 on this application in a clinical hold letter  the Company had previously submitted a request for a Type A meeting  as well as detailed responses to the Agency’s questions.A response letter was received in the evening on August 8th  2022  Central European Time (CET). It indicates that the Agency maintains the clinical hold on MaaT013 in the U.S. and details the FDA’s position on the clinical trial. The Agency acknowledged that it received satisfactory answers from the Company on multiple clinical and manufacturing-related questions that the Agency had initially raised. However  the Agency requires additional information  notably regarding the safety and efficacy of the Company’s “pooling” approach (i.e. mixing donations from multiple donors to achieve higher richness  diversity and better standardization of the product). The Company is also evaluating additional recommendations made by the Agency regarding the trial design.“We value the FDA’s continued engagement as we seek to extend the Phase 3 clinical trial of MaaT013 to the U.S. and we intend to work with the Agency to resolve the issues raised in the communication  while implementing a defined strategic plan to continue to deliver on our key milestones ” said Hervé Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. “To date  data gathered from more than 120 patients with aGvHD who received MaaT013 in Europe as part of our early access program in France and our completed Phase 2 trial in Europe  indicated a positive safety and efficacy profile for MaaT013. We remain focused on bringing innovative and safe microbiome therapies to patients with refractory aGvHD.”MaaT Pharma is now in the process of preparing the next steps in the interaction with the FDA  potentially including a Type A meeting dedicated to discussing the remaining questions. In parallel and in line with its goal to reach patients globally  the Company will continue the development of MaaT013 in Europe and expand European recruitment for its ongoing Phase 3 trial evaluating MaaT013 in 75 patients. There are currently 19 active clinical sites in France  Germany  and Spain and the Company has submitted clinical trial applications in three additional European countries. The overall expected timelines for the Phase 3 trial and  if approved  commercialization of MaaT013 in Europe remain unchanged.In parallel  the Company continues to prepare for the initiation of a Phase 2/3 trial in Europe to evaluate its second native (donor-derived) asset  MaaT033  in patients with blood cancers receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). This clinical study is expected to start in Q4 2022.The Company also continues to prepare a first-in-human trial of its first co-fermented MaaT03X candidate in both Europe and the U.S. This new class of drug candidates aims to improve the anti-cancer efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with a yet undisclosed solid tumor having a high unmet need.About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology. Committed to treating cancer and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)  a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation  MaaT Pharma has launched  in March 2022 in Europe  a Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with acute GvHD  following the achievement of its proof of concept in a Phase 2 trial.

It previously only expected to match 2021 growth levels. Ahold also raised its free cash flow guidance and said it still expects its adjusted operating margin to be at least 4% this year.Shares rose as much as 6%  the biggest gain since Aug. 5 2020  and were trading up 5% as of 9.03 a.m. local time.Although the retailer has pulled the initial public offering of its online Bol.com unit it could pursue the plan at a later date “when equity market conditions are more conducive ” according to comments published with its Wednesday earnings report.Bol.com was founded in 1999 as Europe’s first online bookstore. Ahold bought it in 2012 and it is now the largest online retail platform in the Benelux region and has expanded to selling general merchandise products.Ahold proposed a sub-IPO last year that would have offered a small stake in Bol.com on Euronext Amsterdam with the grocer retaining significant control in the long-term.Tough market conditions recently led to file-sharing platform WeTransfer withdrawing plans to float in Amsterdam and Dutch consumer-electronics retailer Coolblue NV also scrapped a planned listing in the Dutch capital  citing uncertainty among investors.Story continues“We’re absolutely convinced in Bol as a strong future-focused brand for us ” said Chief Financial Officer Natalie Knight in an interview. “We’ve got market share gains again in the quarter and we’re firmly committed to crystallizing the value of the brand but right now the market conditions just don’t support it.”She added the company has identified a “more flexible” investment plan to support Bol’s future growth and the unit will continue to grow faster than the market going forward.For the group  Ahold reported adjusted operating profit for the second-quarter of 880 million euros  which was better than expected. Revenue from online orders rose to just over 2 billion euros in the quarter from 1.81 billion euros at the same time last year.Like many grocers battling the worst inflation in decades  Ahold has raised prices this year but according to Knight  price hikes across all of Ahold’s markets are lower than overall inflation rates.The company’s margin was more “resilient” than expected  according to Bernstein analyst William Woods. Bernstein said the “strong set of results” and pulled IPO should be received positively  given the lower valuation as well as the grocer’s need to prioritize free cash flow along with buybacks.(Updates with shares in the third paragraph and further details throughout)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.03,0.61,0.35,mixed,0.25,0.1,0.65,True,English,"['Ahold Delhaize Postpones', 'Dutch Online Unit', 'IPO', 'Chief Financial Officer Natalie Knight', 'free cash flow guidance', 'Bernstein analyst William Woods', 'largest online retail platform', 'volatile equity market conditions', 'Royal Ahold Delhaize NV', 'online Bol.com unit', 'first online bookstore', 'initial public offering', 'general merchandise products', 'Tough market conditions', 'Wednesday earnings report', 'overall inflation rates', 'Dutch e-commerce unit', 'flexible” investment plan', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Dutch consumer-electronics retailer', 'market share gains', 'strong future-focused brand', 'online orders', 'sharing platform', 'Coolblue NV', 'Dutch capital', 'underlying earnings', 'strong set', 'soaring inflation', 'worst inflation', 'The Stop', 'Shop owner', 'mid-single-digit rate', '2021 growth levels', 'biggest gain', 'local time', 'Benelux region', 'small stake', 'significant control', 'planned listing', 'future growth', 'operating profit', '880 million euros', '2 billion euros', '1.81 billion euros', 'same time', 'many grocers', 'price hikes', 'lower valuation', 'third paragraph', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'rising prices', 'operating margin', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'forecast', 'year', 'plans', 'customers', 'stores', 'Shares', 'Aug.', 'comments', 'Europe', 'sub-IPO', 'long-term', 'WeTransfer', 'uncertainty', 'investors', 'Story', 'interview', 'quarter', 'value', 'company', 'group', 'Revenue', 'decades', 'markets', 'results', 'need', 'buybacks', 'Updates', 'details', '9.03']",2022-08-10,2022-08-10,finance.yahoo.com

Both companies currently are running several mid to advanced stage clinical trials ongoing in lupus  chronic graft-versus-host disease  tibial fractures and other indications. As a result  there would be a number of economic  financial and operational benefits and synergies in combining the clinical development programs within one organization.The existing pipeline from both organizations would continue as planned. The Phase IIb trial of Bone Therapeutics’ ALLOB  a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  is still ongoing and set to report interim results in the first half of 2023. The Medsenic Phase II clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD (chronic GvH) is still ongoing  and a phase IIa clinical trial for Lupus has established proof of concept of safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease. A Phase 2b clinical trial for severe Lupus is in the planning stage. A Phase III study of cGvHD is also currently anticipated to start in the first half of 2023. The new laboratory facilities in Mont-Saint-Guibert  will become the scientific centre of the combined entity.Story continues""The addition of Medsenic  particularly with its dedicated best-in-class autoimmune disease platform  allows the respective teams of both companies to develop an expanded product portfolio across multiple therapeutic indications and thus limit shareholder risk  offer multiple treatments to patients  and increase the potential for growth and value creation for all shareholders "" said Jean Stéphenne  President of Bone Therapeutics. ""The acquisition of Medsenic fits well with our strategic priorities and offers substantial financial growth potential and therapeutic solutions to significantly improve patient experiences and outcomes for emerging and established therapies. Bone Therapeutics is well positioned to leverage Medsenic's value proposition with a strong technology portfolio and business development experience. It is an honor and I am delighted to welcome Francois Rieger  a renowned scientist and investor  as the future President and CEO of the newly created company as a result of the acquisition  BioSenic. His experience and talent will undoubtedly enable BioSenic and our talented teams to embark on our next chapter of accelerating financial growth  maximizing patient benefits and enhancing value.""""This agreement with Bone Therapeutics highlights the value of Medsenic's highly complementary businesses  provides our shareholders with attractive and certain value  and brings together leading expertise and drug delivery platforms to accelerate growth and create new opportunities ” said François Rieger  President and CEO of Medsenic. “As we remain committed to continuing to serve our stakeholders  I would like to thank the employees of both organizations for their hard work and dedication to this mission. I am very proud as the new President and CEO to work with the Bone Therapeutics team to successfully complete the transaction and deliver best-in-class drug therapies and therapeutic solutions under the new name: ‘BioSenic.’”Terms of the combinationFurther to the signed contribution agreement  the majority of Medsenic' shareholders have committed to contribute fifty-one percent (51%) of the total outstanding share capital of Medsenic  valued at EUR 40 800 207  at a subscription price per share of EUR 0.45  which values Bone Therapeutics at EUR 10 million. In exchange for the in-kind contribution of 51% of Medsenic' shares  around 90 668 594 shares would be issued by Bone Therapeutics to Medsenic shareholders (the ""Business Combination""). The parties have relied on the valuation carried out by an independent expert in order to determine the exchange ratio of one for four.On closing of the Business Combination  Bone Therapeutics would also issue and automatically allot one subscription right to each outstanding share of Bone Therapeutics  allowing the existing shareholders to subscribe for one new share of Bone Therapeutics in case of statistically positive interim results of the ALLOB Phase IIb trial  at a subscription price per share of EUR 0.45.The transaction is subject to the approval of the contribution by Bone Therapeutics' shareholders at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting (‘ESM’) to be convened by the Board of Bone Therapeutics in the course of September 2022. The transaction is also subject to certain other customary conditions including the confirmation that the proposed Business Combination would not lead to the necessity  for any subscriber involved to launch a mandatory takeover bid on Bone Therapeutics.The Medsenic shareholders have agreed that the Bone Therapeutics shares to be issued to them in the contribution will be subject to an initial lock-up of nine months as from the date of the ESM  provided that on the last day of the four first calendar month following the month in which the ESM occurs  2% of the new shares held by each of Véronique Pomi-Schneiter and François Rieger shall be released from the lock-up.If the customary conditions precedent are met and the shareholders of Bone Therapeutics vote in favor of the Business Combination  Bone Therapeutics would maintain its status as a Belgian listed company  and significantly broaden its diverse therapeutic portfolio.In the contribution agreement  the existing shareholders of Medsenic have agreed to contribute in kind the totality of the remaining Medsenic shares held by within the next 36 months from the completion of the Business Combination  meaning that  in the medium to long run  all existing pipeline from both organizations would be directly or indirectly held by Bone Therapeutics.Name and Board ChangesAt the ESM  Bone Therapeutics shareholders will also be asked to approve the name change of the Company into ‘BioSenic’ and the appointment  with effect as of the completion of the contribution  of a new board of directors consisting of a total of up to seven directors including the current chairman Jean Stéphenne and Jean-Luc Vandebroek at least until the ALLOB Phase IIb trial results.

The Company plans to raise funds in the form of a private placement of new shares at the end of 2022 in order to finance the combined activities of Medsenic and the Company.

They discuss UKHospitality’s role championing the hospitality s…,“Hospitality is the light and life of our communities. It's our job to make people's everyday lives and we're a unique industry in that we touch every single person's everyday life  sometimes on a daily basis ” - Kate Nichols  OBE  speaking on the Heart of Hospitality Podcast.In the latest episode of the new season of Accor’s industry leading podcast  Heart of Hospitality  Duncan O’Rourke  host and CEO Accor Northern Europe  speaks to Kate Nicholls  CEO UKHospitality. They discuss UKHospitality’s role championing the hospitality sector in the UK and lobbying the Government for positive action and change  including the impact a VAT cut and greater training flexibility would have on the sector.They explore Kate’s passion for education  opportunity and development and why it’s important to offer hands-on lived experience to Generation Z to nurture the seed of passion in the younger generation at an early age.Through her role as CEO UKHospitality  Kate Nicholls has become the leading voice representing the UK hospitality sector  advocating and lobbying for over 740 companies operating around 100 000 venues across the UK  including accommodation  F&B  events  and attraction & leisure sectors. In 2021 her efforts were recognised in the New Year Honours list and she was awarded an OBE for services to the hospitality sector  especially during the pandemic.“Like so many people in the sector  I'd never thought about a career in hospitality  and I fell into it. It's such a fantastic place to work ” said Kate. “There's so much camaraderie and it's such a collaborative industry. In other sectors businesses don't collaborate. We are hugely supportive  collaborative and cooperative as a sector  and I think that's what got us through COVID - we came together to be able to support each other through it and have nobody left behind.”She added: “COVID gave us a very literal demonstration of what happens when you don't support Hospitality and Tourism  when you don't look at it sensibly. Because literally the light and life turned off from our town and city centres. The economy went backwards. And you could see that throughout the two years of COVID every time hospitality switched back on and started up again  the economy grew.”The hospitality leaders discuss the incredible impact of hospitality sector  which in the UK accounts for approximately 4.5m people  or 1 in 10 working people. “We bring people together like no other industry. All of our hospitality businesses within the UK are at the heart of their communities. Fundamentally  we're a people business  so people are at the heart of what we do. We’re about experience and giving customers great experience  and giving the communities in which we exist  great experience.”The leaders exchanged on the global staffing crisis  the recently launched UKH Workforce Strategy  the creativity and resilience of hospitality and the opportunities it affords the emerging workforce of Gen Z. “There's no other sector of the economy which will allow you to have delegated authority at such a young age and allow you to expand your horizons and grow to be a manager within less than two years. The sky's the limit  but also  no other sector of the economy gives you that camaraderie and fun while you're at work.”Duncan and Kate celebrate the rising salaries and greater opportunities to work for your passion but call for greater support for hospitality as a job of choice in schools and amongst parents  citing the tale of a 16 year-old passionate about baking and a fan of Bake-Off and Master Chef who was discouraged from entering hospitality where she could have earned £60 000 a year as a pastry chef in London and work for her passion.As the conversation turns to government  Duncan references the global under-representation of the hospitality and tourism sector in government and asks Kate what the UK Government could do to have the most significant impact on the sector: “On the workforce point  I think at the moment  it is about giving us greater flexibility on the Apprenticeship Levy  that's a tax on jobs at the moment  and it's a tax on training  and we can't use it in the way that we know we need to really boost or upskill our people.”She adds “My biggest ask of government would be to tackle the perfect storm of the cost of doing business increase and cost of living squeeze and the need for business to invest in recruitment and training. So the biggest thing they could do is to cut VAT. That would help business have the headroom  it would boost demand  and it would help our sector as a whole.”Kate champions the power skills of hospitality  citing her core hospitality skills as the core strength of lobbying and political acumen: “Essentially  lobbying is about human relationships  it’s about people. These are natural hospitality skills. It's why I always think hospitality is a great place to start in your career because they are transferable skills.”The importance of collaboration  support and representation drives Kate. Commenting on her position as not only the CEO of UKH but a female CEO  Kate said: “I always like to think of myself as just a CEO  however  I am conscious of using my position as a female CEO to be a role model. I do believe fundamentally  you can't be what you can't see  so I strive to be visible for the sector as a whole and women in the sector specifically. My motto  given to me years ago by a former colleague  is lift as you climb. So as we go further up  we don't pull up the ladder behind us  we increase the number of areas for people to climb up behind us.”Commenting on the episode  Duncan O’Rourke  Heart of Hospitality host and CEO Accor Northern Europe said: “The representation of hospitality and tourism within government is crucial. Hospitality accounts for 10% of global GDP and 1 in 10 jobs and it is the beating heart of local and global communities. Unlikely many sectors  hospitality is a meritocracy and social elevator  a place for the emotionally intelligent and the business-minded. Hospitality positively impacts every person in the world and offers those that work in it the chance to explore the world and its people – what other sector can say all this? Governmental support is disproportionate to the economic and social impact of the sector.”The Heart of Hospitality podcast is part of a pan-European industry platform of the same name  built to tell stories of the sector and its people. Accor is inviting stories from across the industry to be shared via #HeartOfHospitality.For more information and more stories from hospitality  visit https://heart-of-hospitality.com/.BIOGRAPHY: KATE NICHOLLS OBEKate Nicholls OBE has been CEO of UKHospitality  the powerful voice representing the broad hospitality sector  since its inception in 2018  having previously worked as CEO and Strategic Affairs Director of the ALMR  the trade body for eating and drinking out businesses.Kate is Chair of the Tourism Alliance and co-Chair of the London Tourism Recovery Board  representing the needs of the wider tourism sector in discussions with Government and the Mayor of London.

These statements include  but are not limited to  statements about EQB's objectives  strategies and initiatives  financial performance expectations and other statements made herein  whether with respect to EQB's businesses or the Canadian economy. Generally  forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as ""plans""  ""expects"" or ""does not expect""  ""is expected""  ""budget""  ""scheduled""  ""planned""  ""estimates""  ""forecasts""  ""intends""  ""anticipates"" or ""does not anticipate""  or ""believes""  or variations of such words and phrases which state that certain actions  events or results ""may""  ""could""  ""would""  ""might"" or ""will be taken""  ""occur"" or ""be achieved""  or other similar expressions of future or conditional verbs. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  level of activity  closing of transactions  performance or achievements of EQB to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements  including but not limited to risks related to capital markets and additional funding requirements  fluctuating interest rates and general economic conditions  legislative and regulatory developments  changes in accounting standards  the nature of our customers and rates of default  and competition as well as those factors discussed under the heading ""Risk Management"" in the MD&A and in EQB's documents filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. All material assumptions used in making forward-looking statements are based on management's knowledge of current business conditions and expectations of future business conditions and trends  including their knowledge of the current credit  interest rate and liquidity conditions affecting EQB and the Canadian economy. Although EQB believes the assumptions used to make such statements are reasonable at this time and has attempted to identify in its continuous disclosure documents important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements  there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated  estimated or intended. Certain material assumptions are applied by EQB in making forward-looking statements  including without limitation  assumptions regarding its continued ability to fund its mortgage business  a continuation of the current level of economic uncertainty that affects real estate market conditions  continued acceptance of its products in the marketplace  as well as no material changes in its operating cost structure and the current tax regime. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate  as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly  readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. EQB does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that are contained herein  except in accordance with applicable securities laws.Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) Financial Measures and RatiosIn addition to GAAP prescribed measures  this news release references certain non-GAAP measures  including adjusted financial results  that we believe provide useful information to investors regarding EQB's financial condition and results of operations. Readers are cautioned that non-GAAP measures often do not have any standardized meaning  and therefore  are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.Adjusted financial resultsOn February 7  2022  Equitable Bank announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a majority interest in Concentra Bank (Concentra)  subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals  and is expected to close later in 2022. As a result of the announced agreement  Equitable Bank has incurred certain acquisition costs beginning in Q4 2021. To enhance comparability between reporting periods  increase consistency with other financial institutions  and provide the reader with a better understanding of EQB's performance  adjusted results were introduced starting in Q1 2022. Adjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures.Adjustments impacting current and prior periods:Concentra acquisition/integration costs  pre-tax:Q2 2022 – $2.7 million of acquisition and integration related costs and $0.9 million of interest expenses paid to subscription receipt holders 1 ; andof acquisition and integration related costs and of interest expenses paid to subscription receipt holders ; and Q1 2022 – $5.1 million of acquisition and integration related costs and $0.9 million of interest expenses paid to subscription receipt holders.The following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP reported financial results to non-GAAP adjusted financial results.___________________________ 1. The interest expense refers to the dividend equivalent amount paid to subscription receipt holders. The subscription receipt holders are entitled to receive a payment equal to the common share dividend declared multiplied by the number of subscription receipts held on the common share dividend payment date.
