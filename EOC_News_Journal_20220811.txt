The positive margin improvement development trend of Leipurin also continued. Our comparable operating profit for the quarter increased to EUR 16.0 million  marking Q2 2022 as the most profitable quarter in Aspo Group’s history. We were able to further improve our comparable operating profit rate to 9.7% for the quarter  well above the long-term target of 8%  and in parallel net sales increased to EUR 165.3 million. All in all  an excellent second quarter and that is thanks to our entire staff in all our businesses.Russia’s reprehensible military action on Ukraine has caused significant human suffering and has dramatically upset the geopolitical status quo. Along with numerous international companies  Aspo has also taken action to adjust its operations in Russia  with the aim to ultimately exit the market. By end of Q2 2022  all of ESL Shipping's operations in Russia had been suspended and the ship capacity has been transferred to other traffic areas. As previously announced  Telko is exploring options to exit its Russian and Belarusian operations during this year. Leipurin has also decided to withdraw from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. We see these actions as necessary for the sustainability of our operations and long-term value creation.While we are reducing our presence in East  we have focused on our strategy execution and targeted growth in Western markets. In May  Leipurin announced that it will acquire the Swedish bakery industry distributor Kobia and expand its geographical presence into Scandinavia. This is a transformative action for Leipurin’s business and a major milestone for the whole Group as one of the first concrete actions of our renewed compounder strategy. In line with the renewed strategy  Leipurin also completed the sale of its manufacturing business Vulganus on June 30th. ESL Shipping is finalizing a long-term pooling partnership together with a group of institutional and private investors. This is a major strategic action  reducing our capital requirements and improving returns  while reshaping the business model of ESL Shipping. Telko has over the past months actively screened for suitable acquisition opportunities with the aim to pursue its compounding strategy. On the Group level  we successfully issued a new hybrid bond of EUR 30 million in June to support and accelerate our strategy execution.In mid-June  we upgraded our financial guidance for full-year 2022 especially due to the better-than-estimated development of ESL Shipping and Telko and their outlook for the remainder of the year. According to our current guidance  Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit will improve from previous year (EUR 42.4 million). As previously communicated  items affecting comparability caused by the war in Ukraine and the decisions regarding business operations in Russia will cause an estimated total expense of EUR 15–20 million. A withdrawal from the Russian businesses would also trigger the reclassification of translation differences from equity to the statement of comprehensive income. The recognition does not reduce the equity of the Group as the translation differences have been recognized as a reduction of equity when incurred.While macroeconomic uncertainty is increasing and we are beginning to witness the partly deliberate drop in the financial performance of our operations in Eastern markets  we feel very confident about Aspo’s full-year performance in 2022. Financial impact from exiting the selected Eastern markets as well as macroeconomic development impacting demand  price and cost levels and availability of raw materials for the specific businesses create uncertainty going forward. Despite this  we are in a good position to continue our strategy execution during the coming years and aim to offset any negative impact from the business environment through own strategy implementation actions.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsOn December 1  2021  Aspo published new long-term financial targets:Operating profit of 8%Net sales growth 5–10% per yearReturn on equity of over 20%Gearing less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%.We excelled in Q2 2022 against all financial targets. Aspo’s net sales increased by 16% during the second quarter of 2022. The comparable operating profit rate was 9.7% (6.7%)  well above the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained high at 23.4% (24.5%). Gearing decreased to 92.6% (129.4%).Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit from continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit excludes items affecting comparability  which are defined as significant  rare and deviate from normal business operations. These include for example impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by the war in Ukraine.Aspo announced in December 2021 that the Kauko business segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  have been defined as businesses outside Aspo’s core operations. The Kauko business segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS  and its results are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. With regards to the income statement  comparative periods’ figures have been restated to correspond to the same presentation method. Vulganus has been divested on June 30th. The results of Vulganus  including the divestment loss and related transaction costs are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.Net sales and operating profit margin  Group total 4-6/2022 4-6/2021 1-6/2022 1-6/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 165.3 142.8 327.9 275.2 586.4 Net sales  continuing operations 161.4 139.3 321.8 268.7 573.3 Net sales  discontinued operations 3.9 3.5 6.1 6.5 13.1 Operating profit  Group total 13.6 9.6 23.7 17.4 33.9 Operating profit  Group total  % 8.2 6.7 7.2 6.3 5.8 Items affecting comparability*) -2.4 -7.3 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 16.0 9.6 31.0 17.4 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 9.7 6.7 9.5 6.3 7.2Comparable operating profit  Group total 4-6/2022 4-6/2021 1-6/2022 1-6/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 9.0 5.4 18.2 9.9 26.8 Telko  operating profit 6.8 5.5 10.8 10.1 20.4 Leipurin  operating profit 0.4 0.3 0.0 0.6 -2.4 Other operations  operating profit -1.4 -1.6 -3.9 -3.2 -7.9 Operating profit from continuing operations 14.8 9.6 25.1 17.4 36.9 Operating profit from discontinued operations -1.2 0.0 -1.4 0.0 -3.0 Operating profit  Group total 13.6 9.6 23.7 17.4 33.9 Items affecting comparability*) -2.4 -7.3 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 16.0 9.6 31.0 17.4 42.4*) The items affecting comparability of the second quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -2.4 million include the costs related to restructuring Russia-related operations of EUR -0.2 million for ESL Shipping  EUR -0.4 million for Telko  EUR -0.1 million for Leipurin  the impact of the divestment of Vulganus of EUR -0.4 million for Leipurin  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -1.3 million on Kauko’s goodwill  which is reported as part of the results of the discontinued operations.The items affecting comparability of the first quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -4.9 million  consist of EUR 1.5 million in sales gains from ESL Shipping barge Espa  ESL Shipping’s cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the war in Ukraine  EUR -2.6 million in losses from the destruction of Telko’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -2.0 million associated with Telko’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  EUR -0.7 million in losses from the destruction of Leipurin’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with Leipurin’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  and EUR -0.2 million in Leipurin’s other business adaptation expenses in Russia. The operating result of other operations included the share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo’s previous CEO.The items affecting comparability of 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of the discontinued operations.SustainabilitySustainability is a key factor in guiding Aspo’s management system and the process of investigating new investment objects. Aspo’s businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) targets for the Group and its businesses in December 2021. The key goal is to reduce the emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30.During the past 12 months  the emission intensity continued to improve  driven by net sales growth in combination with operational efficiency  and it was 0.37 (12/2021: 0.42). Another key target is to improve the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIF). During the past 12 months  TRI (Total Recordable Injury Frequency) was 7.1 (12/2021: 8.8)  while the target for 2022 is 7.0. The long-term goal is zero occupational accidents.Operating environment and the impact of the war in Ukraine on Aspo’s operationsAspo’s operating environment has changed dramatically due to Russia’s armed invasion of Ukraine. The invasion has caused a lot of uncertainty in the market as well as significant volatility in prices and exchange rates.Suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The war drastically weakens operating conditions in Eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  but particularly based on values.As announced earlier  Telko is exploring options to exit its Russian and Belarusian operations during this year. Leipurin has decided to withdraw from its operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. The process is proceeding as planned and more details on the timetable and methods of implementation will be announced in due course. Telko’s and Leipurin’s combined net sales in these countries accounted for approximately 16% of Aspo Group's net sales in 2021.The net sales of Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan amounted to EUR 26.3 million in year 2021 which accounted for 23% of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2021 and 4% of the net sales of Aspo Group. The net sales of Telko Russia and Belarus amounted to EUR 69.9 million in year 2021 which accounted for 26% of Telko’s total net sales in 2021 and 12% of the net sales of Aspo Group. Furthermore  by the end of Q2 2022  all of ESL Shipping's operations in Russia had been suspended and the ship capacity has been transferred to other traffic areas.The sanctions imposed by Western countries and Russia’s legislative measures prevent transportation of goods and transfer of payments  rapidly reducing net sales and profitability. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight.The equity of Russian Group companies is EUR 26.6 million  corresponding to 17.0% of Aspo Group’s total equity. Aspo’s assets in Russia are mainly related to cash  inventories and trade receivables. The financial significance of small-scale production operations is very minor for the Group. The number of employees working for Aspo companies in Russia is decreasing  amounting to 135 employees at the end of June (12/2021: 193).In media  the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion  but its impact is still present in the operating environment. For example  global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on Aspo’s businesses  decelerating trading and the completion of orders. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations and especially among crew members of ESL Shipping’s vessels.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 4-6/2022 4-6/2021 Change 1-6/2022 1-6/2021 Change in share in share MEUR MEUR % MEUR MEUR % Finland 55.5 42.7 3.8 108.8 85.2 2.1 Scandinavia 32.3 27.7 0.1 60.9 52.4 -0.6 Baltic countries 17.7 13.5 1.3 33.2 25.4 0.9 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 31.7 36.7 -6.7 72.0 71.7 -4.3 Other countries 24.2 18.8 1.5 46.9 34.0 1.9 Total 161.4 139.4 321.8 268.7The Group’s main market areas are Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and Eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The relative share of net sales in Eastern markets continued to decrease during the second quarter of 2022  mainly due to the war in Ukraine and the decision to reduce operations in Russia and ultimately exit the market. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at Western markets.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s cash flow from operating activities in January–June was EUR 34.3 (22.2) million. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR 2.3 (-7.2) million. Free cash flow during January-June was EUR 27.6 (16.2) million. Investments of EUR -8.2(-6.1) million mainly consisted of docking of ESL Shipping’s vessels.6/2022 6/2021 12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 192.4 188.1 185.1 Cash and cash equivalents 47.5 21.1 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 144.9 167.0 167.4Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 144.9 million  and gearing fell to 92.6% (6/2021: 141.8%; 12/2021: 129.4%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the period was 35.6% (6/2021: 30.5%; 12/2021: 32.0%). The balance sheet strengthened as a result of improved profitability and a new hybrid bond issued in June.Net financial expenses in January–June totaled EUR -4.9 (-1.9) million. The impact of exchange rate fluctuations  particularly strengthening of the Russian rouble  on the increase in financial expenses was EUR -3.6 million. The average rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 1.4% (1.6%).The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents were EUR 47.5 million at the end of the review period (12/2021: EUR 17.7 million). Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40.0 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. EUR 7 million of Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program were in use (6/2021: EUR 6 million; 12/2021: EUR 5 million).On June 7  2022  Aspo issued a new hybrid bond of EUR 30 million. The coupon rate of the bond is 8.75% per annum. The bond has no maturity  but the company is entitled to redeem it in June 2025 at the earliest. Aspo’s previous hybrid bond of EUR 20 million was redeemed on May 2  2022.On June 21  Aspo’s subsidiary ESL Shipping signed EUR 20 million loan agreement with Nordic Investment Bank. The maturity of the loan is 10 years. The loan is a part of financing of ESL Shipping’s investment in a series of six new  highly energy-efficient electric hybrid 5 350 dwt vessels  a project first announced in September 2021.Dividends of EUR 0.23 per share  totaling EUR 7.2 million  were paid during the second quarter.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its businesses are exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties which include but are not limited to the risks stated below.There is an increasing level of geopolitical uncertainty relating to Russia's war in Ukraine. This is expected to affect the general economic environment  e.g. via inflation  interest rates  energy prices and prices of raw materials. Disturbances related to running infrastructure may also occur as part of current uncertainties relating to Russia  for example due to cyber incidents or disruptions in information systems.This ongoing process of exiting Russia and other selected Eastern markets is changing the structure of the Group significantly and will affect the earnings model of each Aspo business in the long run. There is a risk that the withdrawal of the businesses will cause additional costs and repatriation of funds will not success fully as planned.Economic activity and current geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components  and logistics services to increase rapidly  and increased uncertainties concerning functioning logistics in certain market situations. Aspo may temporarily benefit from the price increases  while the prices of purchased raw materials or leased capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes in different market situations  are also increasing risks.International sanctions and countersanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. Geopolitical tensions can escalate and cause direct damage to business  payments and even suspend business operations in a crisis area or in areas affected by it.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its earnings via acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial investments and consequently may reduce solvency.The impact of coronavirus on Aspo’s business has been limited on group level  although the impact on Leipurin has been significant. Current and any new variants of coronavirus and their rapid spread may lead to various interruptions and financial losses.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and informational setting  they include significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading carrier of dry bulk cargo in the Baltic Sea region. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 48 vessels with a total capacity of 456 000 deadweight tons (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (75% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 23 vessels (23%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean carriers at sea as a special service.4-6/2022 4-6/2021 Change % 1-6/2022 1-6/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 60.3 46.0 31 117.1 89.4 31 Operating profit  MEUR 9.0 5.4 67 18.2 9.9 84 Operating profit  % 14.9 11.7 15.5 11.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.2 1.1 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 9.2 5.4 70 17.1 9.9 73 Comparable operating profit  % 15.3 11.7 14.6 11.1The second quarter of 2022 displayed the strongest second quarter operating result in ESL Shipping’s history. Net sales increased with 31% from last year to EUR 60.3 (46.0) million. During the quarter  the comparable operating profit increased to a record-high level of EUR 9.2 (5.4) million. The operating profit increased to EUR 9.0 (5.4) million and includes cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the closure of Russia-related contracts.The strong result was driven by the shipping company’s partnership strategy  favorable market conditions and the operational success delivered by the entire personnel  evident for example in reduction in ballast voyages. The comparable operating profit rate of 15.3% (11.7%) achieved during the second quarter was excellent  especially considering the historical change of abandoning cargo flows from Russia as a consequence of the war in Ukraine and resulted sanctions. The target level of 14.0% operating profit was clearly exceeded. During the second quarter  prices of diesel and LNG used as a ship fuel were almost three times higher than in the comparative period last year. The current level of very high fuel surcharges will increase net sales and reduce the operating profit percentage rate  used as an indicator of relative profitability  even though no actual changes would take place in the absolute operating profit.During Q2  the volume of cargo transported by the shipping company decreased  as expected  from the comparative period to 3.3 (3.7) million tons. The main drivers behind the volume development were re-routing of raw material supply out of Russia  which resulted in increased transportation distances  and heavy congestion in certain major contract traffic ports.At the end of the second quarter  ESL Shipping had no remaining transport obligations related to cargo operations from Russian ports or with customers and cargo closely related to Russia. The released vessel capacity has been successfully transferred to other operating areas. ESL Shipping has also suspended the start-up of its previously established Russian company and will eventually wind it down in accordance with local regulations.The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories remained strong during the second quarter. In contract traffic  demand for ton miles remained strong throughout the review period despite realized lower volumes  and spot market freight rates were at a high level in all customer segments and vessel categories. Ports have continued to be heavily congested in ESL Shipping’s main transportation areas because of poor availability of stevedores. Despite this  profitability was historically strong.As announced earlier  AtoBatC Shipping declared at the end of the second quarter an option and order for the first additional vessel from the Indian shipyard Chowgule & Company Private Limited  from which the shipping company has previously ordered six identical electric hybrid vessels. The first two of the new generation of energy-efficient hybrid electric vessels are already under construction  and the planned delivery of the first vessel is scheduled for the third quarter of 2023.The scheduled drydockings of the current fleet continued with 45 (72) docking days during the second quarter. Available ship capacity in the smaller ship segment was heavily constrained by a bigger than usual number of docking offhire days of the time-chartered tonnage.ESL Shipping’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The shipping company aims to halve its carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During the second quarter  ESL Shipping took an important step together with Neste to become the world's first shipping company to start utilizing new low-emission Neste Marine™ 0.1 Co-processed marine fuel in its vessels in Finland and Sweden. The ISCC PLUS certified marine fuel enables up to 80% reduced greenhouse gas emissions over the life cycle compared to fossil fuels without compromising the product quality and performance.During the reporting period  the emission intensity of ESL Shipping’s transportation resulted in 15.4 grams of carbon dioxide per ton mile  an increase of 6.9% from the previous year. At the same time  emissions per transported cargo ton decreased by 6.8%.The net sales of ESL Shipping in January–June increased by 31% from the comparative period  amounting to EUR 117.1 (89.4) million. The comparable operating profit increased to EUR 17.1 (9.9) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 14.6% (11.1%).ESL Shipping outlook for 2022Most of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements  which will continue to support ESL Shipping’s performance during the second half of 2022. After deliveries of Russian raw materials stopped  some of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers were forced to seek new suppliers in new geographical areas for part of their required production input. This is expected to lengthen transportation distances and increase demand for sea transportation per ton mile for ESL Shipping’s largest vessels. Temporarily the share of energy coal is expected to increase in terms of ton miles  mainly due to longer transportation distance.Macroeconomic uncertainty is increasing within ESL Shipping’s main geographical market area. High rate of inflation  mainly driven by high energy prices caused by supply constraints owing to the war in Ukraine  is increasing the pressure on supply chain efficiency also among the shipping company’s main customers. ESL Shipping’s investments in energy efficient vessels will further strengthen its market position going forward. Demand for transportation and the price level of sea freights in the company’s main market area in Northern Europe are still at a satisfactorily level in all vessel categories. Despite the overall uncertainty  ESL Shipping’s main clients are forecasted to continue with fairly good production volumes and access to key raw materials.The impact of energy price increases on ESL Shipping’s costs are effectively offset through long-term fuel clauses in transportation agreements. The shipping company is moderately increasing the fuel stock level onboard its ships in anticipation for eventual supply shortages during autumn 2022.In the coaster vessel category  transportation demand in contract traffic is expected to remain at a satisfactory level despite that some customers’ supply chains may face challenges regarding in availability of raw materials  that may also impact realized product transportation volumes. Vessel timecharter hires that have partly increased to an unhealthy level are expected to start to decline. Measures will continue to protect the personnel’s health security during the re-emergence of the coronavirus.In Northern Europe  there continues to be considerable growth in interest among customers for environmentally friendly maritime transport that produces as low carbon emissions as possible. In addition to ESL Shipping’s investments in new highly environmentally friendly vessels  the shipping company is in long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide sea transportation with even lower carbon emissions  and even fossil-free transportation  in the future.In connection with the forthcoming series of new-generation electric hybrid vessels and remaining additional vessel options  ESL Shipping is finalizing a long-term pooling partnership together with a group of institutional and private investors. The pooling structure is a model commonly used in the international shipping business for the ownership and operation of vessels  and it is introduced to accelerate the growth  profitability and return on capital of ESL Shipping's business.During the third quarter  two larger and one smaller vessel units will be drydocked for a total of approximately 75 (116) days. In total  there will be approximately 130 (229) dockage days in 2022. After these drydockings  all vessels owned by ESL Shipping will be equipped with ballast water treatment systems that meet new environmental regulations.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service both in the East and the West. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.4-6/2022 4-6/2021 Change % 1-6/2022 1-6/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 71.8 67.6 6 147.7 125.6 18 Operating profit  MEUR 6.8 5.5 24 10.8 10.1 7 Operating profit  % 9.5 8.1 7.3 8.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -0.4 -5.0 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 7.2 5.5 31 15.8 10.1 56 Comparable operating profit  % 10.0 8.1 10.7 8.0In the second quarter of 2022  Telko’s net sales grew to EUR 71.8 (67.6) million and its comparable operating profit increased to EUR 7.2 (5.5) million. Telko’s comparable operating profit rate remained strong at 10.0% (8.1%). The comparable operating profit for the second quarter excludes items affecting comparability of EUR -0.4 million including the restructuring costs of operations in Russia totaling EUR -0.9 million and the decrease in the credit loss provision related to accounts receivables in Ukraine of EUR 0.5 million. Telko’s reported operating profit for the second quarter grew to EUR 6.8 (5.5) million.Telko’s sales growth was driven by global price increases and the systematic implementation of strategic growth plans with a positive volume effect especially in the Western market. Operating profit was higher than expected mainly because of a positive sales margin level trend. In Russia  Telko continued to focus on selling the existing inventory. Price levels remained high.Net sales of the plastics business increased by 2% during the second quarter  amounting to EUR 37.5 (36.8) million. Demand of plastic polymers remained in general on a normal level but in the last weeks of the quarter  the market became resistant to high price levels  which negatively affected demand and slowed down activity. Towards the end of the quarter  stock levels in value chain increased and price pressure started to grow. Prices peaked in volume plastics during the second quarter due to strong increases in crude oil and monomer prices. Many products reached all time high market price levels. Prices in Engineering Plastics further increased and remained high. Overall availability of products is improving but still in some specific product groups availability remains restricted. Automotive sector component issues are not solved  and production and sales are lower than typically. In Russia  Telko has been able to sell the remaining stock with better than normal conditions due to low product availability in the market. Business in Ukraine has restarted and in June already reaching 50% of June 2021 volumes.Net sales of the chemicals business increased by 1% to EUR 21.8 (21.5) million. Price levels are generally high and continued to rise  except for some commodity chemicals. The main drivers for the price increases were high crude oil price and energy costs. Also  vegetable oil-based products became more expensive. The logistics costs for overseas transportation remained high. Demand of some customer segments started to decline following export restrictions to Russia  impacting especially Finland and Latvia. Sales in Ukraine started to recover in spring reaching a 50-60% level in June  compared to previous year’s levels.Net sales of the lubricants business increased by 34% to EUR 12.5 (9.3) million. High price levels combined with the acquisition of Mentum AS at the end of 2021 were the most significant growth drivers. High demand especially for Industrial lubricants resulted in sales volume growth. Prices continued to increase during the quarter in all product groups. There were significant cost increases for raw materials  transportation  and product manufacturing. Imbalance in the supply and demand caused availability issues in several product groups.Telko’s net sales increased by 18% during January–June to EUR 147.7 (125.6) million. Telko’s comparable operating profit for the first half of the year was EUR 15.8 (10.1) million  and its comparable operating profit rate was 10.7% (8.0%). Telko’s reported operating profit stood at EUR 10.8 (10.1) million for January-June 2022 and the reported operating profit rate was 7.3% (8.0%).Telko outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and its consequences have a significant impact on Telko’s outlook for the rest of the year. Telko’s short-term outlook is associated with uncertainties.Telko´s sales are expected to decrease during the second half of the year due to the significantly decreasing sales in Russia. Telko has already reduced its Russian inventory significantly. In June  Aspo announced that Telko is exploring options to exit its Russian and Belarusian operations during 2022.In the Western markets  sales are expected to remain on a relatively stable level  but the risk for rapid changes in demand and price level is relatively high because of uncertainties in global economic development. Recovery in Ukraine is expected to continue. The devaluation of the Ukrainian hryvnia will have a negative impact on Telko’s result of the third quarter but will reduce costs longer term.In volume plastics  Telko expects rapid turn down in prices caused by high inventory levels in the value chain and lowering monomer prices. In engineering plastics  we will see more stable prices  but price pressure may grow towards end of the year. We expect low sales from the Eastern market but a steadily recovering business in Ukraine.In chemicals  the energy crisis will keep price levels high and for some segments we expect further price increases. On the other hand  modest demand keeps price level under pressure for many commodity products. High overseas freight rates limit low-cost competition from Asia  supporting European price levels. Recovery in Ukraine is expected to continue as long as the war is limited to the Eastern part of the country. Strong growth is expected to continue in Central Asia.In lubricants  it is expected that prices will stabilize towards the end of year. Inflation and geopolitical instability may have negative impact on demand for lubricants. On the other hand  estimated lower demand will solve availability issues.According to its strategy  Telko will seek not only organic growth in the Western markets  but also accelerated growth through acquisitions to achieve the strategic goals set for Telko.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in eight countries that have been grouped into three regional organizations  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  East  and the Baltic region. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. Leipurin’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. Leipurin uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.Vulganus Oy manufactures and maintains refrigeration and freezing solutions for the food industry through its spiral products.

There was no significant impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the first half of 2022.Leipurin’s net sales increased to EUR 29.3 (25.8) million in the second quarter. Net sales in Finland grew by 25% and stood at EUR 11.7 (9.4) million. Net sales in the Baltic countries increased by 27% and were EUR 9.4 (7.4) million. In the market area East  net sales were down 14% due to the scaled-down assortment including only local sourcing  and stood at EUR 6.4 (7.4) million. Sales to bakeries was up 8% in the second quarter at EUR 18.6 (17.3) million. Sales to food industry increased by 42% and were EUR 3.7 (2.6) million. Leipurin’s second quarter sales were significantly impacted by strong growth in global market prices of raw materials  whereas sales measured in kilograms showed a small growth in Finland and the Baltic countries combined  whereas East clearly declined. The cost of living increased significantly in Finland and the Baltic region  strengthening the shift in consumer demand towards more affordable products. Despite this  positive margin development continued.Leipurin’s comparable operating profit for Q2 was EUR 0.9 (0.3) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 3.1% (1.2%). Leipurin’s comparable operating profit excluding Vulganus was EUR 1.3 million (0.3) and comparable operating profit rate 4.9% (1.1%).Leipurin’s reported operating profit for Q2 was EUR 0.4 million (0.3). Items reducing Leipurin’s operating profit and affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.5 million for Q2 which included the impact from divesting Vulganus of EUR -0.4 million and costs related to the withdrawal from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan totaling EUR -0.1 million.The profitability of Leipurin’s own machine manufacturing operations  Vulganus Oy  was still significantly undermined by rising market prices of steel raw materials  slow progress in after sales during the first part of the year and cost overruns in certain projects. Net sales of Vulganus in Q2 were EUR 1.8 (1.6) million and the operating result was EUR -0.5 (0.0) million. Vulganus was divested at the end of the second quarter.In January-June  Leipurin’s net sales increased and were EUR 57.0 (53.7) million. Q1 2021 comparison figures include significant machinery sales in Russia  and the year-on-year growth in raw materials is very strong. Net sales in Finland grew by 20% and stood at EUR 22.1 (18.4) million. Net sales in the Baltic region increased by 23% and were EUR 17.4 (14.1) million. In the market area East  net sales decreased by 6% and were EUR 13.2 (14.0) million. Sales to bakeries increased by 10% in January-June and were EUR 36.8 (33.5) million. Sales to the food industry increased by 21% and stood at EUR 6.3 (5.2) million. The euro-denominated increase in sales was significantly impacted by strong growth in global market prices of raw materials. In Finland and Baltics  . the volumes were above the pre-pandemic 2019 levels. n Q2 2022 volumes were above 2019 levels.Leipurin’s comparable operating profit for January-June 2022 was EUR 1.6 (0.6) million and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.8% (1.1%). Net sales of Vulganus were EUR 4.3 (3.0) million and the operating result was EUR -0.8 (-0.1) million. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit excluding Vulganus was EUR 2.3 (0.7) million and comparable operating profit rate 4.4% (1.4%).The profit management program launched during the second quarter of 2021 will develop the organization’s capability of knowledge management and particularly help to improve the commercial performance. Key tools include Group-wide category management and the improved efficiency in supply chain and logistics. The revised management model already increased financial performance during 2021. The implementation of the program was particularly reflected on the positive development of results in Finland and the Baltic countries.Availability challenges still persisted in various product categories. In Finland and the Baltic region  Leipurin has succeeded in using the post-pandemic recovery in demand.In Q2  Leipurin announced an acquisition where it agreed to purchase the entire share capital of the Swedish bakery industry distributor Kobia Ab from the Swedish Abdon Group. The acquisition will expand Leipurin’s geographical presence in the Northern European market. In 2021  Kobia’s net sales amounted to approximately EUR 50 million and its operating profit margin was approximately 3%. The transaction also includes the properties owned by Kobia. The acquisition is not expected to generate significant goodwill. Through the acquisition  Leipurin further strengthens its position as a leading player in the Baltic Sea region  with increased size and profitability. The new entity provides suppliers with a compelling gateway to the region’s market. Customers in the bakery and food industry will benefit from a strong partner in the global raw material market. The Swedish competition authority has approved the acquisition and Kobia AB’s operations are planned to become a part of Leipurin as of September 1  2022.In June  Leipurin published its first ever sustainability report reflecting on the performance of 2021. ESG targets have been integrated into management’s target setting and remuneration for the first time for 2022.Heli Arantola  Managing Director of Leipurin  resigned in June to join another company. Arantola will leave the company in December at the latest  and the process of selecting her successor has begun.Leipurin outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and financial results. The net sales of Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan amounted to EUR 26.3 million in year 2021 which accounted for 23 percent of Leipurin’s total net sales in 2021.Increased energy prices will have a negative impact on demand for more premium products  at least in the Baltic region. They will also cause profitability challenges for the bakery segment’s customers.World wheat prices turned to a decline in response to the possible start of grain shipments from Ukraine. However  the situation is not stable  and the future price level of cereals will be affected by both the success of the harvest season and the success of transportation in the future  as well.The impact of the war in Ukraine  the coronavirus pandemic  and extreme weather conditions on global supply chains will be emphasized  affecting the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times.The weakening of purchasing power can have a negative effect on the demand for artisanal bakeries  as consumers direct their purchases to more affordable products in Finland as well.The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration  the financial and ICT service center  and a small number of other functions not covered by business units. The operating result for other operations was EUR -1.4 (-1.6) million in the second quarter. Costs decreased as a result of stabilized personnel costs and decreasing expenditure of short-term projects  which increased the loss of the comparative period.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

Vulganus was sold on 30 June 2022 to a leading Austrian bakery machine manufacturer KÖNIG Maschinen GmbH. The results of Vulganus  including the divestment loss of EUR -0.4 million are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.The Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in group reporting in accordance with IFRS 5 standard  and its results and balance sheet items are reported separately from the continuing operations of Aspo Group. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. On the balance sheet  the assets of the Kauko operating segment are reported under “Assets held for sale” and liabilities under “Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale”. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the figures of the comparative period of June 2021 have not been restated.Profit from discontinued operations 4-6/2022 4-6/2021 1-6/2022 1-6/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales 3.9 3.5 6.1 6.5 13.1 Materials and services -2.9 -2.6 -4.5 -4.8 -9.6 Employee benefit expenses -0.5 -0.5 -1.0 -0.9 -1.7 Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses -1.3 0.0 -1.3 0.0 -3.5 Depreciation  leased assets 0.0 -0.1 0.0 -0.1 -0.1 Other operating expenses -0.4 -0.3 -0.7 -0.6 -1.2 Operating profit -1.2 0.0 -1.4 0.1 -3.0 Profit before taxes -1.2 0.0 -1.4 0.1 -3.0 Income taxes -0.1 Profit for the period -1.2 0.0 -1.5 0.1 -3.0Profit from discontinued operations includes the income and expenses of Kauko operating segment  insofar as they are considered to transfer outside Aspo Group in conjunction with the divestment.

Following questions raised by the FDA in August 2021 on this application in a clinical hold letter  the Company had previously submitted a request for a Type A meeting  as well as detailed responses to the Agency’s questions.A response letter was received in the evening on August 8th  2022  Central European Time (CET). It indicates that the Agency maintains the clinical hold on MaaT013 in the U.S. and details the FDA’s position on the clinical trial. The Agency acknowledged that it received satisfactory answers from the Company on multiple clinical and manufacturing-related questions that the Agency had initially raised. However  the Agency requires additional information  notably regarding the safety and efficacy of the Company’s “pooling” approach (i.e. mixing donations from multiple donors to achieve higher richness  diversity and better standardization of the product). The Company is also evaluating additional recommendations made by the Agency regarding the trial design.“We value the FDA’s continued engagement as we seek to extend the Phase 3 clinical trial of MaaT013 to the U.S. and we intend to work with the Agency to resolve the issues raised in the communication  while implementing a defined strategic plan to continue to deliver on our key milestones ” said Hervé Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. “To date  data gathered from more than 120 patients with aGvHD who received MaaT013 in Europe as part of our early access program in France and our completed Phase 2 trial in Europe  indicated a positive safety and efficacy profile for MaaT013. We remain focused on bringing innovative and safe microbiome therapies to patients with refractory aGvHD.”MaaT Pharma is now in the process of preparing the next steps in the interaction with the FDA  potentially including a Type A meeting dedicated to discussing the remaining questions. In parallel and in line with its goal to reach patients globally  the Company will continue the development of MaaT013 in Europe and expand European recruitment for its ongoing Phase 3 trial evaluating MaaT013 in 75 patients. There are currently 19 active clinical sites in France  Germany  and Spain and the Company has submitted clinical trial applications in three additional European countries. The overall expected timelines for the Phase 3 trial and  if approved  commercialization of MaaT013 in Europe remain unchanged.In parallel  the Company continues to prepare for the initiation of a Phase 2/3 trial in Europe to evaluate its second native (donor-derived) asset  MaaT033  in patients with blood cancers receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). This clinical study is expected to start in Q4 2022.The Company also continues to prepare a first-in-human trial of its first co-fermented MaaT03X candidate in both Europe and the U.S. This new class of drug candidates aims to improve the anti-cancer efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with a yet undisclosed solid tumor having a high unmet need.About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology. Committed to treating cancer and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)  a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation  MaaT Pharma has launched  in March 2022 in Europe  a Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with acute GvHD  following the achievement of its proof of concept in a Phase 2 trial.

It previously only expected to match 2021 growth levels. Ahold also raised its free cash flow guidance and said it still expects its adjusted operating margin to be at least 4% this year.Shares rose as much as 6%  the biggest gain since Aug. 5 2020  and were trading up 5% as of 9.03 a.m. local time.Although the retailer has pulled the initial public offering of its online Bol.com unit it could pursue the plan at a later date “when equity market conditions are more conducive ” according to comments published with its Wednesday earnings report.Bol.com was founded in 1999 as Europe’s first online bookstore. Ahold bought it in 2012 and it is now the largest online retail platform in the Benelux region and has expanded to selling general merchandise products.Ahold proposed a sub-IPO last year that would have offered a small stake in Bol.com on Euronext Amsterdam with the grocer retaining significant control in the long-term.Tough market conditions recently led to file-sharing platform WeTransfer withdrawing plans to float in Amsterdam and Dutch consumer-electronics retailer Coolblue NV also scrapped a planned listing in the Dutch capital  citing uncertainty among investors.Story continues“We’re absolutely convinced in Bol as a strong future-focused brand for us ” said Chief Financial Officer Natalie Knight in an interview. “We’ve got market share gains again in the quarter and we’re firmly committed to crystallizing the value of the brand but right now the market conditions just don’t support it.”She added the company has identified a “more flexible” investment plan to support Bol’s future growth and the unit will continue to grow faster than the market going forward.For the group  Ahold reported adjusted operating profit for the second-quarter of 880 million euros  which was better than expected. Revenue from online orders rose to just over 2 billion euros in the quarter from 1.81 billion euros at the same time last year.Like many grocers battling the worst inflation in decades  Ahold has raised prices this year but according to Knight  price hikes across all of Ahold’s markets are lower than overall inflation rates.The company’s margin was more “resilient” than expected  according to Bernstein analyst William Woods. Bernstein said the “strong set of results” and pulled IPO should be received positively  given the lower valuation as well as the grocer’s need to prioritize free cash flow along with buybacks.(Updates with shares in the third paragraph and further details throughout)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.03,0.61,0.35,mixed,0.25,0.1,0.65,True,English,"['Ahold Delhaize Postpones', 'Dutch Online Unit', 'IPO', 'Chief Financial Officer Natalie Knight', 'free cash flow guidance', 'Bernstein analyst William Woods', 'largest online retail platform', 'volatile equity market conditions', 'Royal Ahold Delhaize NV', 'online Bol.com unit', 'first online bookstore', 'initial public offering', 'general merchandise products', 'Tough market conditions', 'Wednesday earnings report', 'overall inflation rates', 'Dutch e-commerce unit', 'flexible” investment plan', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Dutch consumer-electronics retailer', 'market share gains', 'strong future-focused brand', 'online orders', 'sharing platform', 'Coolblue NV', 'Dutch capital', 'underlying earnings', 'strong set', 'soaring inflation', 'worst inflation', 'The Stop', 'Shop owner', 'mid-single-digit rate', '2021 growth levels', 'biggest gain', 'local time', 'Benelux region', 'small stake', 'significant control', 'planned listing', 'future growth', 'operating profit', '880 million euros', '2 billion euros', '1.81 billion euros', 'same time', 'many grocers', 'price hikes', 'lower valuation', 'third paragraph', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'rising prices', 'operating margin', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'forecast', 'year', 'plans', 'customers', 'stores', 'Shares', 'Aug.', 'comments', 'Europe', 'sub-IPO', 'long-term', 'WeTransfer', 'uncertainty', 'investors', 'Story', 'interview', 'quarter', 'value', 'company', 'group', 'Revenue', 'decades', 'markets', 'results', 'need', 'buybacks', 'Updates', 'details', '9.03']",2022-08-10,2022-08-11,finance.yahoo.com

They discuss UKHospitality’s role championing the hospitality s…,“Hospitality is the light and life of our communities. It's our job to make people's everyday lives and we're a unique industry in that we touch every single person's everyday life  sometimes on a daily basis ” - Kate Nichols  OBE  speaking on the Heart of Hospitality Podcast.In the latest episode of the new season of Accor’s industry leading podcast  Heart of Hospitality  Duncan O’Rourke  host and CEO Accor Northern Europe  speaks to Kate Nicholls  CEO UKHospitality. They discuss UKHospitality’s role championing the hospitality sector in the UK and lobbying the Government for positive action and change  including the impact a VAT cut and greater training flexibility would have on the sector.They explore Kate’s passion for education  opportunity and development and why it’s important to offer hands-on lived experience to Generation Z to nurture the seed of passion in the younger generation at an early age.Through her role as CEO UKHospitality  Kate Nicholls has become the leading voice representing the UK hospitality sector  advocating and lobbying for over 740 companies operating around 100 000 venues across the UK  including accommodation  F&B  events  and attraction & leisure sectors. In 2021 her efforts were recognised in the New Year Honours list and she was awarded an OBE for services to the hospitality sector  especially during the pandemic.“Like so many people in the sector  I'd never thought about a career in hospitality  and I fell into it. It's such a fantastic place to work ” said Kate. “There's so much camaraderie and it's such a collaborative industry. In other sectors businesses don't collaborate. We are hugely supportive  collaborative and cooperative as a sector  and I think that's what got us through COVID - we came together to be able to support each other through it and have nobody left behind.”She added: “COVID gave us a very literal demonstration of what happens when you don't support Hospitality and Tourism  when you don't look at it sensibly. Because literally the light and life turned off from our town and city centres. The economy went backwards. And you could see that throughout the two years of COVID every time hospitality switched back on and started up again  the economy grew.”The hospitality leaders discuss the incredible impact of hospitality sector  which in the UK accounts for approximately 4.5m people  or 1 in 10 working people. “We bring people together like no other industry. All of our hospitality businesses within the UK are at the heart of their communities. Fundamentally  we're a people business  so people are at the heart of what we do. We’re about experience and giving customers great experience  and giving the communities in which we exist  great experience.”The leaders exchanged on the global staffing crisis  the recently launched UKH Workforce Strategy  the creativity and resilience of hospitality and the opportunities it affords the emerging workforce of Gen Z. “There's no other sector of the economy which will allow you to have delegated authority at such a young age and allow you to expand your horizons and grow to be a manager within less than two years. The sky's the limit  but also  no other sector of the economy gives you that camaraderie and fun while you're at work.”Duncan and Kate celebrate the rising salaries and greater opportunities to work for your passion but call for greater support for hospitality as a job of choice in schools and amongst parents  citing the tale of a 16 year-old passionate about baking and a fan of Bake-Off and Master Chef who was discouraged from entering hospitality where she could have earned £60 000 a year as a pastry chef in London and work for her passion.As the conversation turns to government  Duncan references the global under-representation of the hospitality and tourism sector in government and asks Kate what the UK Government could do to have the most significant impact on the sector: “On the workforce point  I think at the moment  it is about giving us greater flexibility on the Apprenticeship Levy  that's a tax on jobs at the moment  and it's a tax on training  and we can't use it in the way that we know we need to really boost or upskill our people.”She adds “My biggest ask of government would be to tackle the perfect storm of the cost of doing business increase and cost of living squeeze and the need for business to invest in recruitment and training. So the biggest thing they could do is to cut VAT. That would help business have the headroom  it would boost demand  and it would help our sector as a whole.”Kate champions the power skills of hospitality  citing her core hospitality skills as the core strength of lobbying and political acumen: “Essentially  lobbying is about human relationships  it’s about people. These are natural hospitality skills. It's why I always think hospitality is a great place to start in your career because they are transferable skills.”The importance of collaboration  support and representation drives Kate. Commenting on her position as not only the CEO of UKH but a female CEO  Kate said: “I always like to think of myself as just a CEO  however  I am conscious of using my position as a female CEO to be a role model. I do believe fundamentally  you can't be what you can't see  so I strive to be visible for the sector as a whole and women in the sector specifically. My motto  given to me years ago by a former colleague  is lift as you climb. So as we go further up  we don't pull up the ladder behind us  we increase the number of areas for people to climb up behind us.”Commenting on the episode  Duncan O’Rourke  Heart of Hospitality host and CEO Accor Northern Europe said: “The representation of hospitality and tourism within government is crucial. Hospitality accounts for 10% of global GDP and 1 in 10 jobs and it is the beating heart of local and global communities. Unlikely many sectors  hospitality is a meritocracy and social elevator  a place for the emotionally intelligent and the business-minded. Hospitality positively impacts every person in the world and offers those that work in it the chance to explore the world and its people – what other sector can say all this? Governmental support is disproportionate to the economic and social impact of the sector.”The Heart of Hospitality podcast is part of a pan-European industry platform of the same name  built to tell stories of the sector and its people. Accor is inviting stories from across the industry to be shared via #HeartOfHospitality.For more information and more stories from hospitality  visit https://heart-of-hospitality.com/.BIOGRAPHY: KATE NICHOLLS OBEKate Nicholls OBE has been CEO of UKHospitality  the powerful voice representing the broad hospitality sector  since its inception in 2018  having previously worked as CEO and Strategic Affairs Director of the ALMR  the trade body for eating and drinking out businesses.Kate is Chair of the Tourism Alliance and co-Chair of the London Tourism Recovery Board  representing the needs of the wider tourism sector in discussions with Government and the Mayor of London.

After three months of intensive work  we believe that our position is now developed.""Frozen funds' assessments vary. Euroclear said last month its bank's balance sheet increased by 72 billion euro ($74.2 billion) year-on-year in the first half of 2022 thanks to blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulated because of sanctions.RGD has a dozen major investors among its clients  including Russian business owners and top managers along with Western investment companies  Rybalkin said. The firm is constantly in talks on new clients  while also preparing presentations for leading Russian banks that service wealthy customers.""There is a particular trend when citizenship or nationality in today's world become an argument for not fulfilling certain obligations. Our clients  individuals and companies are not sanctioned "" Rybalkin said  stopping short of revealing their names.The asset freeze affects not only wealthy investors but more than five million people who bought foreign shares in a retail investment boom during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic  according to central bank data.Moscow Exchange (MOEX.MM)  Russia's largest bourse  has said it planned to legally challenge EU sanctions on the NSD  Russia's equivalent to Euroclear  and would seek to protect the interests of Russian investors.Euroclear did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.Sanctions against NSD led to what the United States claims is Russia's default on its international bonds for the first time in more than a century.

This means that the safekeeping and trading of Baltic Horizon Fund units („Units“) held by Swedish investors and traded on Nasdaq Stockholm continues also after 31 August 2022 (the date previously announced by Euroclear Sweden to de-register the Units in its book entry system as a consequent of Nordea Bank Abp ceasing to offer its services in relation to the Swedish traded Units).

8848,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/russian-law-firm-seeks-to-unfreeze-funds-tied-up-with-euroclear-1093240,Russian law firm seeks to unfreeze funds tied up with Euroclear,MOSCOW (Reuters) -   Russian law firm Rybalkin  Gortsunyan  Dyakin & Partners (RGD) plans to appeal to Euroclear clearing house to help unfreeze funds of investors in foreign securities that were tied up by Western sanctions against Russia  a RGD partner said.,In May  Russia restricted trading in foreign shares that have been blocked by Belgium-based Euroclear  citing the need to protect investors and effectively freezing a part of foreign securities held by investors in Russia.Ilya Rybalkin  a founding partner of RGD  said the law firm developed an institutional solution for the return of funds and securities of foreign issuers blocked by Euroclear to Russian and other investors.“We would like to see an agreement on the implementation of a common asset unlocking scheme this year ” Rybalkin said in an interview cleared for publication on Thursday.RGD intends to apply to Euroclear and the relevant European authorities in September for a general licence that allows transactions in blocked securities  having collected clients’ claims for around $500 million  Rybalkin said.“We want to create a universal platform  to find an institutional solution that is accessible to a wide range of investors … After three months of intensive work  we believe that our position is now developed.”Frozen funds’ assessments vary. Euroclear said last month its bank’s balance sheet increased by 72 billion euro ($74.2 billion) year-on-year in the first half of 2022 thanks to blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulated because of sanctions.RGD has a dozen major investors among its clients  including Russian business owners and top managers along with Western investment companies  Rybalkin said. The firm is constantly in talks on new clients  while also preparing presentations for leading Russian banks that service wealthy customers.“There is a particular trend when citizenship or nationality in today’s world become an argument for not fulfilling certain obligations. Our clients  individuals and companies are not sanctioned ” Rybalkin said  stopping short of revealing their names.The asset freeze affects not only wealthy investors but more than five million people who bought foreign shares in a retail investment boom during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic  according to central bank data.Moscow Exchange  Russia’s largest bourse  has said it planned to legally challenge EU sanctions on the NSD  Russia’s equivalent to Euroclear  and would seek to protect the interests of Russian investors.Euroclear did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.Sanctions against NSD led to what the United States claims is Russia’s default on its international bonds for the first time in more than a century. But the Kremlin blamed the situation on the West without admitting the default.Rybalkin said it was wise to avoid a protracted legal process with Europe  adding that the basis for a constructive discussion with Euroclear was in place.“If we realise that Euroclear or the regulator are not prepared to move in a constructive direction  then perhaps legal proceedings will be initiated.”($1 = 0.9708 euros)(Reporting by Reuters; editing by Grant McCool),negative,0.03,0.44,0.53,mixed,0.06,0.17,0.77,True,English,"['Russian law firm', 'funds', 'Euroclear', 'common asset unlocking scheme', 'relevant European authorities', 'five million people', 'retail investment boom', 'protracted legal process', 'Russian business owners', 'leading Russian banks', 'Frozen funds’ assessments', 'Western investment companies', 'central bank data', 'dozen major investors', 'asset freeze', 'legal proceedings', 'foreign shares', 'founding partner', 'institutional solution', 'foreign issuers', 'general licence', 'universal platform', 'wide range', 'three months', 'intensive work', 'balance sheet', '72 billion euro', 'first half', 'coupon payments', 'top managers', 'wealthy customers', 'particular trend', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Moscow Exchange', 'largest bourse', 'United States', 'international bonds', 'first time', 'a century', 'constructive discussion', 'constructive direction', 'Grant McCool', 'Russian investors', 'other investors', 'wealthy investors', 'law firm', 'clients’ claims', 'new clients', 'Reuters request', 'foreign securities', 'EU sanctions', 'Ilya Rybalkin', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'May', 'trading', 'need', 'RGD', 'return', 'agreement', 'implementation', 'interview', 'publication', 'Thursday', 'September', 'transactions', 'position', 'year', 'redemptions', 'talks', 'presentations', 'citizenship', 'nationality', 'today', 'world', 'argument', 'obligations', 'individuals', 'names', 'height', 'NSD', 'interests', 'comment', 'default', 'Kremlin', 'situation', 'basis', 'place', 'regulator', '0.9708 euros']",2022-08-11,2022-08-11,fxempire.com

The Company's consolidated financial statements  notes to the financial statements  management's discussion and analysis for the three and six months ended June 30  2022  and 2021  and the 2021 Report to Shareholders and Annual Information Form have been filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and are available on the Company's website (www.africaoilcorp.com).FINANCIAL POSITION AND EARNINGSThe Company recognized a total operating income of $13.3 million and net income of $5.7 million during the second quarter of 2022. The operating income primarily relates to the Company's share of profit from its investments in Prime amounting to $14.4 million.The Company ended first quarter 2022 with cash of $191.0 million in comparison to cash of $58.9 million at the end of 2021. The Company has no outstanding debt. During second quarter 2022  Prime paid two dividends for aggregate distribution of $125.0 million with net payment to Africa Oil of $62.5 million  related to its 50% shareholding interest. Since the acquisition of a 50% shareholding in Prime in January 2020 for $519.5 million  the Company has received 13 dividends from Prime for a total amount of $562.5 million  representing 108% of the closing purchase price.On January 31  2022  the Company announced that all lenders to its Corporate Facility had approved increasing the available amount to $100.0 million from the then unutilized amount of $62.0 million  and extending the availability period to December 31  2022  from May 13  2022. The Corporate Facility maturity date of May 13  2024 and interest margins were unchanged.On February 28  2022  the Company announced that its Board of Directors had declared an initial aggregate annual dividend of $0.05 per share (approximately $24.0 million) to be paid semi-annually  with the first payment payable on March 31  2022  to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17  2022.PRIME'S SECOND QUARTER 2022 PERFORMANCEPrime's second quarter 2022 average daily working interest (""W.I."") production was 25 300 boepd and economic entitlement production was 27 350 boepd (82% light and medium crude oil and 18% conventional natural gas)  net to Africa Oil's 50% shareholding in Prime. These compare to second quarter 20215 average daily W.I. production of 28 000 boepd and economic entitlement production of 30 300 boepd (84% light and medium crude oil and 16% conventional natural gas)  net to Africa Oil's 50% shareholding in Prime. Year to date field performance has been at the higher end of expectation and the full year production outlook remains within the management guidance range for both W.I. production (22 500 – 25 500 boepd) and economic entitlement production (23 000 – 27 000 boepd).During the second quarter 2022  Prime was allocated 3 oil liftings with total sales volume of approximately 3.0 million barrels or 1.5 million barrels net to Africa Oil's 50% shareholding.Prime achieved an average realized oil price of $77.1/bbl in Q2 2022 (Q2 2021: $58.4/bbl) including premium adjustments. Two additional cargos were sold in July 2022 for an average price of $103/bbl including premium demonstrating the upside price exposure under the revised hedging policy.Prime achieved second quarter 2022 sales revenue of $176.4 million (Q2 2021: $125.0 million9); EBITDAX of $127.1 million (Q2 2021: $155.6 million) and cash flow generated from operating activities of $130.0 million (Q2 2021: $245.4 million8  including $152.5 million relating to the receipt of the Agbami Security deposit)  in each case net to Africa Oil's 50% shareholding.As at June 30  2022  net to the Company's 50% shareholding  Prime had $330.6 million of cash and debt of $501.0 million (at December 31  2021: $258.9 million of cash and debt of $508.4 million).The debt outstanding has decreased slightly following gross repayments on the RBL Facility of $164.8 million which net off a drawdown on the PXF Facility of $150.0 million. Net to the Company's 50% shareholding  the overall debt has reduced by $7.4 million during H1 2022. The next repayment under the RBL facility will not occur until September 2022. The PXF repayments will also begin in September 2022.At June 30  2022  Prime has a Net Debt of $340.8 million (at December 31  2021 – Net Debt of $498.9 million) and a Net Debt/EBITDAX of 0.3x for the twelve months ended June 30  2022  (0.4x for the twelve months ended December 31  2021). The strength of this ratio demonstrates the low leverage within Prime compared with industry peers. This strong Net Debt/EBITDAX ratio  combined with the full repayment of the Company's Corporate Facility in 2021 means the Company and Prime are well placed to raise more debt in the future if required. Net Debt/EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation is performed on page 13 of the MD&A.Prime's Supervisory Board have approved a new hedging strategy with a 50% - 70% coverage target for the next 12-month scheduled cargoes on a rolling basis. Under this new strategy  Prime gives an irrevocable instruction to an offtaker to fix the Dated Brent component of a cargo when the forward curve price goes below a trigger of circa 80% of the Brent forward curve (at the time when the instruction was given) for the month of the expected lifting. Otherwise  the cargo is sold on a spot basis. For instance  the most recent forward sale (in Aug-22) was set with a trigger of $85.0/bbl. This means that if the forward curve drops to $85.0/bbl for the month of the forecast cargo  the forward sale price would be locked in. If the forward curve does not drop to $85.0/bbl up to 31 days before the cargo is lifted  then Prime would sell on a spot basis. This policy allows Prime to retain price upside  while securing a minimum oil price for 50% to 70% of its oil entitlement.DIVIDENDSThe Company is committed to a sustainable dividend policy over the future years. The second dividend distribution for 2022 of $0.025 per share is payable on September 30  2022  to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 9  2022. This dividend qualifies as an 'eligible dividend' for Canadian income tax purposes.Dividends on shares traded on TSX will be paid in Canadian dollars on September 30  2022. Dividends on shares traded on Nasdaq Stockholm will be paid in Swedish kroner in accordance with Euroclear principles on October 4  2022. To execute the payment of the dividend  a temporary administrative cross-border transfer closure will be applied by Euroclear from September 8  2022  up to and including September 9  2022 during which period shares of the Company cannot be transferred between the TSX and Nasdaq Stockholm.OUTLOOKThe Company's debt-free balance sheet  its share of Prime's cash flows and access to debt funding on competitive terms  supports a range of opportunities for the Company to achieve accretive growth and create shareholder value. The Company's valuation is underpinned by its 50% shareholding in Prime  which accounts for all of the Company's reserves and production interests.The Company will work to maximize Prime's dividends by distributing its excess cash  whilst maintaining a prudent treasury management policy at Prime. The near-term priority is to extend Prime's debt tenor with the primary objective of refinancing Prime's RBL facility  possibly facilitated by the early conversion of Prime's licenses in Nigeria to the new Petroleum Industry Act (""PIA"") terms. The Company's management will also work with Prime to assess other financing options that could extend Prime's debt maturity profile on competitive costs  such as the PXF Facility that was arranged by Prime in 2021.Prime and its upstream partners are currently working on the early renewal of OML 127 and OML 130 licenses and consequent conversions to the PIA terms. It is expected that OML 130 conversion and renewal  which accounts for most of the reserves  production and value in Prime's portfolio can be delivered by end of 2022  although a successful outcome on this timeline can't be guaranteed. It is further expected that a successful early conversion and renewal of OML 130 could provide the basis for concurrent refinancing of Prime's RBL debt.Furthermore  a conversion and renewal of OML 130 could facilitate the final investment decision for the Preowei oil discovery. Preowei oil field is to the north of Egina FPSO and is a low-risk development opportunity through a satellite subsea tie-back project to the Egina FPSO.Fast track processing of the data from the 4D seismic survey completed over Egina in Q4 2021 is now complete and infill drilling targets have been confirmed. Infill drilling was initially expected to commence mid-year 2022  however this has been delayed until late in Q4 2022 due to the late arrival of the rig. First production from the infill drilling campaign is now not expected until Q1 2023. To offset the impact of the delayed drilling campaign  the operator has identified 4 well intervention opportunities in OML130 which are expected to be executed during Q3 2022.In 2021  the Company and its partners initiated a farm-out process for Project Oil Kenya. Advanced discussions are on-going with the interested parties. A successful farm-out is viewed by the Company as a critical step towards the FID for Project Oil Kenya being achieved over the course of the next year. There is no guarantee that the Company can successfully conclude a farm-out to new strategic partner(s) on favorable terms.In Q1 2022  the Company's investee company  Impact  made a major light oil discovery with the Venus 1-X exploration well on Block 2913B  offshore Namibia.The Venus discovery is a light oil and associated gas field  sitting approximately 290 kms off the Namibian coast. The Venus-1X discovery well was drilled by TotalEnergies on behalf of the joint venture group comprising TotalEnergies (40%)  QatarEnergy (30%)  Impact (20%) and state owned NAMCOR (10%).An appraisal well and a re-entry into Venus-1X is being planned  with spud expected in Q3 2022. The operator plans to conduct flow tests on both wells.Venus  together with the nearby Graff-1 discovery on the adjacent Block 2913A (the Company has no interest in this block)  herald the opening of a major petroleum province in the Orange Basin with significant upside potential for the Company. As well as the immediate significance of Venus for the Company  both Venus and Graff discoveries also bode well for the Company's exploration efforts on Block 3B/4B  which it operates with a 20% WI and Impact's Orange Basin Deep Block  both located on trend in the Orange Basin  South Africa.The Company has filed an application to extend Block 3B/4B license and to move into the first extension period. The Company is also continuing its technical studies on Block 3B/4B with the aim of maturing exploration prospects for possible future drilling. The Company and JV Partners are working together to collectively farmout up to 50% gross WI in Block 3B/4B.The Company  through its shareholdings in Africa Energy and Eco  has indirect effective interest in the Gazania-1 exploration well on Block 2B  offshore South Africa  which is expected to spud in September 2022. The block has significant contingent and prospective resources in relatively shallow water and contains the A-J1 discovery that flowed light sweet crude oil to surface. Gazania-1 will target two large prospects seven kilometers up-dip from A-J1.Africa Energy has a 27.5% participating interest in Block 2B offshore South Africa. The block is operated by a subsidiary of Eco Atlantic  which holds a 50% participating interest. Africa Oil has a 19.78% shareholding in Africa Energy and a 16.2% shareholding in Eco and a resulting 13.6% participating interest in Block 2B.The Company has been actively working on the acquisition of strategic producing assets that are accretive on per share valuation and cashflow metrics. The Company's focus remains on buying producing assets offshore West Africa and the management will consider both operated and non-operated opportunities as well as oil and natural gas assets. There is no guarantee that the Company can complete such transactions.NOTESPrime does not pay dividends to its shareholders  including Africa Oil  on a fixed pre-determined schedule. Previous number of dividends and their amounts should not be taken as a guide for future dividends to be received by Africa Oil. Any dividends received by Africa Oil from Prime's operating cash flows will be subject to Prime's capital investment and financing cashflows  including payments of Prime's RBL principal amortization  which are subject to semi-annual RBL redeterminations. The 50% shareholding in Prime is accounted for using the equity method and presented as an investment in joint venture in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Africa Oil's 50% share of Prime's net profit or loss will be shown in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income and Comprehensive Income. Any dividends received by Africa Oil from Prime are recorded as cash flow from investing activities. The guidance presented here is for information only.

These production rates only include sold gas volumes and not those volumes used for fuel  reinjected or flared. Net entitlement production is calculated using the economic interest methodology and includes cost recovery oil  tax oil and profit oil and is different from working interest production that is calculated based on project volumes multiplied by Prime's effective working interest in each license. Q2 2021 comparative figures have been revised from those previously reported to ensure comparability and consistency of calculation as a result of a change in the conversion factor (to 6.0 Mcf:1bbl from 5.8 Mcf:1bbl) used in converting gas production to barrels oil equivalent.

This is used by management as a performance measure to understand the financial performance from Prime's business operations without including the effects of the capital structure  tax rates  DD&A  impairment and exploration expenses. Non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. A reconciliation from total profit (a GAAP measure) to EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) can be found on page 13 of the MD&A.

This conversion ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1  utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.Forward Looking InformationCertain statements and information contained herein constitute ""forward-looking information"" (within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation).

After three months of intensive work  we believe that our position is now developed.""Frozen funds' assessments vary. Euroclear said last month its bank's balance sheet increased by 72 billion euro ($74.2 billion) year-on-year in the first half of 2022 thanks to blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulated because of sanctions.RGD has a dozen major investors among its clients  including Russian business owners and top managers along with Western investment companies  Rybalkin said. The firm is constantly in talks on new clients  while also preparing presentations for leading Russian banks that service wealthy customers.""There is a particular trend when citizenship or nationality in today's world become an argument for not fulfilling certain obligations. Our clients  individuals and companies are not sanctioned "" Rybalkin said  stopping short of revealing their names.The asset freeze affects not only wealthy investors but more than five million people who bought foreign shares in a retail investment boom during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic  according to central bank data.Moscow Exchange (MOEX.MM)  Russia's largest bourse  has said it planned to legally challenge EU sanctions on the NSD  Russia's equivalent to Euroclear  and would seek to protect the interests of Russian investors.Euroclear did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.Sanctions against NSD led to what the United States claims is Russia's default on its international bonds for the first time in more than a century. But the Kremlin blamed the situation on the West without admitting the default. read moreRybalkin said it was wise to avoid a protracted legal process with Europe  adding that the basis for a constructive discussion with Euroclear was in place.""If we realise that Euroclear or the regulator are not prepared to move in a constructive direction  then perhaps legal proceedings will be initiated.""($1 = 0.9708 euros)Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterReporting by Reuters; editing by Grant McCoolOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",negative,0.03,0.44,0.53,mixed,0.05,0.16,0.79,True,English,"['Russian law firm', 'funds', 'Euroclear', 'The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles', 'common asset unlocking scheme', 'FREE unlimited access', 'five million people', 'retail investment boom', 'Reuters.com Register', 'relevant European authorities', 'protracted legal process', 'Russian military operations', 'Russian business owners', 'leading Russian banks', 'central bank data', ""Frozen funds' assessments"", 'dozen major investors', 'Western investment companies', 'Euroclear clearing house', 'Russian law firm', 'asset freeze', 'European Union', 'Reuters request', 'legal proceedings', 'Russian customers', 'Russian investors', 'Western sanctions', 'financial system', 'foreign shares', 'founding partner', 'institutional solution', 'foreign issuers', 'general licence', 'universal platform', 'wide range', 'three months', 'intensive work', 'balance sheet', '72 billion euro', 'first half', 'coupon payments', 'top managers', 'wealthy customers', 'particular trend', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'largest bourse', 'United States', 'international bonds', 'first time', 'a century', 'constructive discussion', 'constructive direction', 'Grant McCool', 'other investors', 'wealthy investors', 'Summary Companies', 'foreign securities', ""clients' claims"", 'new clients', 'Moscow Exchange', 'EU sanctions', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'RGD partner', 'Ilya Rybalkin', 'content', 'coverage', 'Ukraine', 'Gortsunyan', 'Dyakin', 'Partners', 'move', 'thousands', 'troops', 'Feb.', 'country', 'May', 'trading', 'need', 'return', 'agreement', 'implementation', 'interview', 'publication', 'Thursday', 'September', 'transactions', 'position', 'year', 'redemptions', 'talks', 'presentations', 'citizenship', 'nationality', 'today', 'world', 'argument', 'obligations', 'individuals', 'names', 'height', 'MOEX', 'NSD', 'interests', 'comment', 'default', 'Kremlin', 'situation', 'basis', 'place', 'regulator', '0.9708 euros', 'Reporting', 'editing', 'Standards']",2022-08-11,2022-08-11,reuters.com

This is a great achievement by the team amid challenging market conditions due to the war in Ukraine and the consequential further increase in raw material and energy prices. Our total volumes fell  mainly due to a decline in the pig sector in Netherlands/Belgium and the United Kingdom  whereas poultry volumes in Poland grew. The cost increases could only be passed on in the chain in the course of the second quarter. This explains the result improvement versus the first quarter. Finally  the absolute rise in gross profit in the first half-year was higher than the absolute increase in operating expenses. Underlying EBITDA consequently was higher than originally expectedStory continuesIn the Netherlands  the approach taken in handling the nitrogen crisis is leading to a polarised public debate as well as widespread unrest among livestock farmers. We call on politicians to be more open to a meeting in which everything is open for discussion. Cooperation and innovation are more effective and better than just restructuring. Moreover  prospects are prerequisites for sustainable business practices  in any sector. The agricultural sector has always proven itself in terms of innovation and solution-based thinking. Our cooperation with customers and other partners in the chain is invaluable. In all the conversations I have held in the past few months I have experienced the huge knowledge and pride in the sector in general and this great company in particular.The tightening of the strategy in light of all the aforementioned developments is in full swing and underpins our confidence in the future. We will make further announcements about this in the fourth quarter.We are also pleased about the recently announced joint venture between ForFarmers UK and the poultry feed company 2Agriculture in the United Kingdom. The proposed joint venture is subject to regulatory approval in the United Kingdom.Looking ahead  there are still many uncertainties at present  especially due to the war in Ukraine. In addition  we need to consider a possible new Covid wave and the low water levels in the rivers in the Netherlands. In view of this we consider it unwise to provide any guidance about the expected development of the results in the second half of 2022 or a possible resumption of the share buy-back programme.”Read the full press release on www.forfarmersgroup.eu.This press release contains information that qualifies as inside information in the sense of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.Note to the editor / For additional information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director Investor RelationsT: 0031 573 288 000 M: 0031 6 10 94 91 61E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euAbout ForFarmers N.V.ForFarmers N.V. is an international organisation that provides complete innovative feed solutions to the livestock farming industry.

No more dealing via brokers or other financiers – you might soon be able to get hands-on access.“It’s not a revolution  but it's seeing that politicians in Europe and authorities in Europe are aware of their needs and are trying to do something about it ” João Vieira dos Santos  a law professor at the Universidade Lusófona in Lisbon  said. “It’s a very good thing for the European market.”The EU agreed to this new pilot regime temporarily allowing DLT-based stock and bond trading earlier this year  and it takes effect in March 2023. Compared with MiCA – which introduces greater control over previously unregulated assets like stablecoins – the pilot seeks the exact opposite: streamlining the rules that apply to crypto tokens that resemble stocks or bonds  and so already fall under financial market law.In the EU  just as elsewhere  financial trading is an alphabet soup of entities and regulations in which brokers  clearinghouses and trading venues of multiple kinds all play a part. Laws such as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR) are designed to safeguard stability and prevent clients getting scammed.Story continuesBoth crypto fans and conventional financiers wonder whether DLT could step in to simplify how stock trades get processed and registered  cutting out some of the intermediaries without compromising on safety. After all  blockchain is all about getting rid of centralized gatekeepers and giving people better  more direct access to finance.Read more: FTX’s Bankman-Fried Pitches CFTC on Directly Clearing Customers’ Crypto SwapsAcross the pond  FTX.US’s Sam-Bankman Fried is seeking permission to be able to clear derivative contracts directly  rather than referring them to separate clearinghouses. His pitch to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to be allowed to short-circuit financial market rules in the name of efficiency is  perhaps predictably  being fiercely resisted by market incumbents like Chicago’s CME Group.But in the EU  so far  attempts to get this off the ground have largely failed. The Luxembourg Stock Exchange allows security tokens – crypto versions of financial instruments such as bonds – to be included on its official list. But innovative assets can’t be admitted for trading on the exchange itself due to EU law.In 2018  France’s ID2S sought to use DLT to disrupt the relatively staid market of securities depositories  the financial infrastructure that records when securities change hands. But by March of this year  the company had given up and asked regulators to withdraw its authorization.“Though the financial sector got interested early on in this distributed ledger technology via experiments  those embarking on the industrial phase are a rarity ” said a 2021 report by the French central bank.Read more: EU Set to Experiment With Blockchain-Based Stock  Bond and Fund TradingThe new pilot regime streamlines existing arrangements in two ways. It allows securities traders  including regular retail investors  to interact directly with the market – as  under current laws intended to halt mis-selling and malpractice  they have to do so via regulated intermediaries such as brokers.It also allows exchanges to register the tokens themselves  rather than storing them in a separately regulated securities depository  something that helps realize Web3 ambitions  CoinDesk was told.“Only one entity being responsible for all the market: This could be one step in the direction of the DeFi [Decentralized Finance] objectives ” said Vieira dos Santos  who serves as an adviser to the Portuguese Securities Market Commission and has written extensively about the plans.CautionDespite the good intentions of cutting red tape  in some areas the rules may achieve the opposite  Vieira dos Santos worries.Retail investors trying to use the pilot without a broker will be subjected to a test set by the regulator to ensure they are knowledgeable about the products they buy. In practice  that could prove even more burdensome than existing procedures  which the slicker financial-trading apps like Robinhood can carry out swiftly and automatically.Read more: Here's What Still Needs to Happen Before the EU's MiCA Bill Becomes Law“Each national authority will assess in their own way ” Vieira dos Santos said. “It’s maybe too careful a step.”Lawmakers’ caution might also mean that they miss out on another regulatory goal – allowing innovative DLT-based new entrants into the market. Innovative newcomers are given some legal shortcuts to help them get set up – but not many  and hefty capital requirements could prove too costly for smaller companies  he said. That could mean only established players like Nasdaq and Euronext can benefit  and only in larger EU jurisdictions such as France and Germany.“There are a lot of blockchain companies that are interested … but it's going to be very difficult for them ” he said. “Maybe the only big entities will enter.”Read more: U.K. Aims to Become Global Crypto Hub  Exchequer SaysRigidThose problems may be compounded by the rigidity of the law. The experiment is limited to particular technologies  and to crypto versions of conventional financial instruments like securities and derivatives. That means it can’t adapt to new ideas like non-fungible tokens (NFTs)  Ian Gauci  managing partner at law firm GTG Advocates and member of the Maltese Blockchain Task Force  told CoinDesk.In “the normal exchange … that settles only securities  there is no space for other tokenized assets that do not conform to the existing financial services ” Gauci said. “NFTs would become captured only here if they are financial instruments.”“What if  during this six year timeframe … even the concept of DLT… changes?” he said  adding that markets may in the future decide the Next Big Thing isn’t Web3  but instead some other innovation. “I’ve seen the hype … today it’s DLT  tomorrow it might be AI [Artificial Intelligence].”Worse still  because it’s just a pilot – lasting for three years with an option to extend by another three – it could throttle the business case. Trading venues may not see returns repaid over that period  especially as they might have to keep their conventional system running in parallel.“If you’re going to settle securities … using a particular DLT platform  would you invest in something like that for a mere three to six years?” Gauci said. “From the investment point of view  it leaves a lot of questions.”For the time being  we still don’t know the exact details of the EU’s legal regime. The European Securities and Markets Authority is still consulting on its finer points  like how to apply for permission to run a pilot. (Guidance setting out exactly how carve-outs from current laws will work won’t be out until 2025.)CompetitionIn the meantime  observers are looking at how the EU compares to the global competition. A June bill proposed by U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) included some text in this area  but it’s “not so organized and so comprehensible as the European proposals ” Vieira dos Santos said.Gauci  meanwhile  is watching the U.K. – which has a new regulatory freedom post-Brexit and is committed to becoming a crypto hub.The U.K. “has already issued an intention to issue a sandbox as well within this sector ” Gauci said. “It's already moving away from the EU regarding AI regulation … they can do it because they're out of the EU.”,neutral,0.03,0.81,0.16,mixed,0.16,0.18,0.66,True,English,"['Stock Trading', 'Web3 Way', 'bye Brokers', 'EU', 'U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission', 'João Vieira dos Santos', 'DeFi [Decentralized Finance] objectives', 'Portuguese Securities Market Commission', 'The Luxembourg Stock Exchange', 'Central Securities Depository Regulation', 'French central bank', 'flagship licensing regime', 'controversial money-laundering controls', 'Universidade Lusófona', 'Bankman-Fried Pitches CFTC', 'The European Union', 'ordinary retail trader', 'financial-market incumbent behemoths', 'Customers’ Crypto Swaps', 'lower-profile, temporary law', 'distributed ledger technology', 'new pilot regime', 'Financial Instruments Directive', 'regular retail investors', 'financial market activities', 'financial market law', 'financial market rules', 'financial trading', 'European market', 'trading venues', 'Fund Trading', 'incumbent players', 'securities depositories', 'securities traders', 'financial infrastructure', 'financial sector', 'market incumbents', 'staid market', 'bond trading', 'DLT-based stock', 'Blockchain-Based Stock', 'Crypto Assets', 'crypto fans', 'crypto versions', 'political deals', 'efficient way', 'financial-trading companies', 'Web 3 fans', 'other financiers', 'law professor', 'good thing', 'greater control', 'unregulated assets', 'alphabet soup', 'multiple kinds', 'conventional financiers', 'centralized gatekeepers', 'Sam-Bankman Fried', 'derivative contracts', 'CME Group', 'official list', 'innovative assets', 'industrial phase', 'existing arrangements', 'two ways', 'Web3 ambitions', 'one entity', 'one step', 'good intentions', 'red tape', 'financial markets', 'crypto tokens', 'stock trades', 'security tokens', 'crypto regulations', 'traditional markets', 'exact opposite', 'separate clearinghouses', 'current laws', 'EU law', 'DLT tools', 'direct access', 'busy', 'months', 'MiCA', 'innovations', 'intermediary', 'time', 'practice', 'advantage', 'possibility', 'middleman', 'CoinDesk', 'dealing', 'brokers', 'revolution', 'politicians', 'authorities', 'needs', 'something', 'Lisbon', 'effect', 'March', 'stablecoins', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'entities', 'part', 'MiFID', 'CSDR', 'stability', 'clients', 'Story', 'intermediaries', 'safety', 'people', 'FTX', 'pond', 'permission', 'name', 'efficiency', 'Chicago', 'attempts', 'ground', 'France', 'ID2S', 'hands', 'year', 'company', 'regulators', 'authorization', 'experiments', 'rarity', '2021 report', 'mis-selling', 'exchanges', 'direction', 'adviser', 'plans', 'Caution', 'areas', 'test']",2022-08-10,2022-08-11,finance.yahoo.com

The Hague  August 11  2022 - Steady progress on transformation allows Aegon to increase...,Aegon N.V.Please click here to access all 2Q 2022 results related documents.The Hague  August 11  2022 - Steady progress on transformation allows Aegon to increase its free cash flow outlookNet loss of EUR 348 million due to one-time charges and a non-economic loss on interest rate hedges in the USOperating result of EUR 538 million; a decrease of 11% on a constant currency basis compared with the second quarter of 2021. Benefits from expense savings  growth initiatives and favorable claims experience are more than offset by lower fees due to adverse market movements and lower investment incomeThe capital ratios of all three main units remain above their respective operating levels. Group Solvency II ratio increases to 214% driven by management actions and the benefit from model updatesCash Capital at the Holding decreases only slightly to EUR 1.7 billion at June 30  2022  despite the impact of the previously announced deleveraging and share buyback; third tranche buyback to commence in October 20222022 interim dividend increases by EUR 0.03 to EUR 0.11 per common share reflecting sustainable free cash flow growthAegon raises its 2022 guidance for operating capital generation from the units from around EUR 1.2 billion to around EUR 1.4 billion. Aegon also expects to achieve cumulative free cash flow over the period 2021 to 2023 of at least EUR 2.2 billion  well ahead of the EUR 1.4 to 1.6 billion target set at the 2020 Capital Markets DayStatement of Lard Friese  CEO“The first half year of 2022 was one of the most challenging periods for investors with equity markets experiencing their worst start of the year in over five decades. Volatility remained as central banks increased interest rates to curb rising inflation and the war in Ukraine continued. Against this challenging backdrop we performed well  a testament to the strength of our strategy.Our second quarter operating result of EUR 538 million was strong  reflecting the receding impact of COVID-19 and the progress we are making on our operational improvement plan that helped offset the impact from lower equity markets. We have now executed 1 058 out of more than 1 200 initiatives as part of this plan. Expense initiatives resulted in a EUR 250 million reduction of annual addressable expenses. Across our three core markets  our Workplace Solutions businesses generated positive net deposits  supported by various growth initiatives and favorable labor market conditions. We also achieved growth in new life sales in the US  supported by a 12% increase in licensed life agents at WFG over the last year. Mortgage origination volumes in the Netherlands  net deposits in the Retail channel in the UK  and third-party net deposits in our asset management business were down versus last year  reflecting a challenging macro-economic outlook and rising interest rates.Story continuesOur net result was impacted by a one-time charge related to reinsurance rate increases in the US  contributing to the net loss of EUR 348 million for the quarter. Nonetheless  we remain on course to deliver on our objective of growing returns to shareholders. The actions we have taken to strengthen our capital position and improve our risk profile are paying off in the current market circumstances  with the capital position of our three main units remaining above their respective operating levels. The strength of our balance sheet and the sustainable growth in free cash flow are a solid basis to raise the interim dividend by 3 eurocents compared with last year to 11 eurocents per common share.In the second quarter we also continued to make progress in our approach on sustainability. In the United States we introduced the Emergency Savings Account product enabling employers to help their employees save for unexpected events and improve their financial wellbeing. As part of our commitment to contribute to a climate neutral world  Aegon Asset Management partnered in the launch of a USD 600 million venture in the US to acquire value-add multifamily dwellings and transition them to low-carbon  energy efficient buildings. In the UK  we moved over GBP 3 billion of customers’ assets into strategies that consider ESG credentials  as part of the commitment to make our default pension funds in the UK carbon net-zero by 2050.Looking ahead  considering the active management of our balance sheet and our overall transformation progress  we are comfortable increasing our expectations for cumulative free cash flow over the period 2021 to 2023 from EUR 1.4 to 1.6 billion to at least EUR 2.2 billion. We also raise our 2022 guidance for operating capital generation from the units from around EUR 1.2 billion to around EUR 1.4 billion.While uncertainty in financial markets and economic outlook is expected to remain  we will continue to stand by our customers and help them navigate through challenging economic circumstances with our expertise and high level of service. I want to thank our colleagues for their continued dedication and I am confident that together we will deliver on our 2023 strategic and financial commitments.”Note: All comparisons in this release are against 2Q 2021  unless stated otherwise.

These non-EU-IFRS measures  except for addressable expenses  are calculated by consolidating on a proportionate basis Aegon’s joint ventures and associated companies. The reconciliation of these measures  except for market consistent value of new business and return on equity  to the most comparable EU-IFRS measure is provided in the notes to this press release. Market consistent value of new business is not based on EU-IFRS  which are used to report Aegon’s primary financial statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for EU-IFRS financial measures. Aegon may define and calculate market consistent value of new business differently than other companies. Return on equity is a ratio using a non-EU-IFRS measure and is calculated by dividing the operating result after tax less cost of leverage by the average shareholders’ equity excluding the revaluation reserve. Operating expenses are all expenses associated with selling and administrative activities (excluding commissions) after reallocation of claim handling expenses to benefits paid. This includes certain expenses recorded in other charges  including restructuring charges. Addressable expenses are expenses reflected in the operating result  excluding deferrable acquisition expenses  expenses in joint ventures and associates and expenses related to operations in CEE countries. Aegon believes that these non-EU-IFRS measures  together with the EU-IFRS information  provide meaningful supplemental information about the operating results of Aegon’s business including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing the business.Local currencies and constant currency exchange ratesThis document contains certain information about Aegon’s results  financial condition and revenue generating investments presented in USD for the Americas and in GBP for the United Kingdom  because those businesses operate and are managed primarily in those currencies.

COVID-19 related Other Revenues will have no cash impact in 2022 and relate to revenues recognized in relation to the UK and EC Advance Purchase Agreements.Valneva expects R&D expenses of €120 million to €135 million in 2022. The Company will continue investing in progressing its two leading  late-stage investigational vaccines against Lyme disease and chikungunya in the second half of 2022. Valneva will invest in further development of its current or any potential second-generation COVID-19 vaccine only if it receives the necessary funding or commitments to such funding during the third quarter of 2022. The Company also remains committed to further expanding its R&D pipeline  including through the advancement of some of the Company´s pre-clinical candidates towards clinical entry.Story continuesFinancial Information(unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS)€ in million 6 months ending June 30 2022 2021 Total revenues 93.2 47.5 Product sales 33.3 31.8 Net loss (171.5) (86.4) Adjusted EBITDA loss (136.0) (80.1) Cash (at end of period) 336.2 346.7Saint-Herblain (France)  August 11  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported consolidated financial results for the first half of the year  ended June 30  2022.

Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gpxqaierThomas Lingelbach  Valneva’s Chief Executive Officer  commented  “Valneva continued to achieve significant R&D milestones in the first half of the year. Our updated Lyme disease collaboration agreement with Pfizer included a substantial equity investment which we see as a strong sign of confidence and recognition of our vaccine expertise  and the recent Phase 3 initiation brings us a step closer to a potential vaccine solution against Lyme disease. Our chikungunya vaccine program successfully met all Phase 3 clinical endpoints  readying us for BLA submission. Our COVID-19 vaccine became the first to receive full marketing authorization in Europe  and we look forward to delivering the first doses in Europe in the coming weeks. However  given the revised volume of orders from the EU Member States  we are evaluating how to re-shape our operations. Looking at our other commercial products  we are seeing a faster recovery than expected in the travel vaccine market and demand may even exceed our current supply capacity in the later part of the year. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders  partners and employees for their ongoing support and contribution.”Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 study initiatedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The vaccine candidate covers the six OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe.In August 2022  Valneva and Pfizer announced the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical study  “Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR)” (NCT NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in approximately 6 000 participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States and Europe. As per the terms of the collaboration agreement between the two companies  Valneva will receive a $25 million milestone payment from Pfizer within 60 days following initiation of the Phase 3 study.Pending successful Phase 3 completion  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA1510. In June 2022  the terms of this collaboration were updated  and Pfizer invested €90.5 ($95) million in Valneva as part of an Equity Subscription Agreement11. If approved  Pfizer will commercialize VLA15 and Valneva will be eligible to receive substantial milestone and royalty payments.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553Initiation of BLA rolling submission with U.S. FDA imminentVLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to more than 100 countries with the potential to rapidly expand further. There are currently no preventive vaccines or effective treatments for the chikungunya virus available and VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate that successfully completed primary analysis in a pivotal Phase 3 study.Valneva reported final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 202212 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202213  enabling BLA submission with the FDA. Valneva expects initiation of the rolling submission for approval of VLA1553 in persons aged 18 years and above imminently. This rolling BLA submission will be part of the accelerated approval pathway agreed upon with the FDA in 202014.Valneva is currently targeting the end of 2022 for completion of the BLA submission. Once all portions of the application have been submitted and if the FDA has accepted the filing  the FDA will determine priority review eligibility and the action date upon which the FDA will complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva currently plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the first half of 2023.A clinical trial of VLA1553 in adolescents is currently ongoing in Brazil15  which may support future regulatory submissions and label extensions following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults in the US. Conducted by Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  the trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic region.Pre-Clinical Vaccine CandidatesThe Company plans to advance research and development activities relating to two of its pre-clinical assets  VLA1554 and VLA2112. VLA1554 is a vaccine candidate targeting the human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  which is a major worldwide respiratory pathogen that causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection in children and is also a common cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients and older adults. VLA1554 is currently in pre-clinical proof of concept studies. VLA2112 is a vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr virus  which is one of the most common human viruses and can cause infectious mononucleosis and other illnesses. VLA2112 is currently in a late-stage evaluation phase.Marketed VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the U.S.  Canada and Europe.In the first half of 2022  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €12.3 million compared to €25.4 million in the first half of 2021  as a result of the planned delivery schedule to the U.S. Department of Defense. This decrease was partly offset by the private travel markets  which showed significant recovery with IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales reaching €11.3 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €3.1 million in the first half of 2021.CHOLERA / ETEC16-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC17  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera  and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.In the first half of 2022  DUKORAL® sales increased to €5.8 million compared to €0.4 million in the first half of 2021  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets.SARS-CoV-2 INACTIVATED WHOLE-VIRUS VACCINEValneva’s COVID-19 vaccine is the only inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe18 and the only COVID-19 vaccine to receive a full marketing authorization in Europe. It is produced using Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for the Company’s commercial Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®.During the first half of the year  Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom19 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates20 and Kingdom of Bahrain21. The vaccine generated sales of €3.8 million during the first six months of 2022.In July 2022  Valneva announced an amendment to the APA it signed with the EC in November 202122. The amended APA includes orders of 1.25 million doses of the vaccine  with the option to purchase an equivalent quantity later this year for delivery in 2022. This amendment followed remediation discussions based on the EC’s notice of intent23 to terminate the initial APA for doses in 2022 and optional doses for 2023.First vaccine doses are currently expected to be delivered to participating EU Member States (Germany  Austria  Denmark  Finland  and Bulgaria) in August 2022. Valneva will retain inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase and  in parallel  Valneva will continue discussions on potential additional supply and financing agreements with various other governments around the world. Valneva will aim to deploy approximately eight to ten million doses of remaining inventory into international markets. Given that the vaccine’s shelf life is expected to be gradually extended from the current 15 months to at least 24 months over time  the Company will seek to deploy its inventory doses in the next six to twelve months.In light of the reduced order volume from EU Member States  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and recognized write-downs of €100.6 million as of June 30  2022 relating to existing inventory acquired to produce and supply volumes under the original EC APA. Valneva is also evaluating its COVID-19 program and associated activities and will re-shape its operations accordingly. In addition  Valneva and IDT Biologika (IDT) are discussing potential ways of terminating their drug substance manufacturing agreement in light of the suspended manufacturing of Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine. Valneva will continue certain ongoing clinical trials  in particular on the potential use of the vaccine as a booster. Valneva will invest in further development of the vaccine or second-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate only if it receives the necessary funding or commitments to such funding during the third quarter of 2022.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In June 2020  the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic  pursuant to which it agreed to commercialize Bavarian Nordic’s marketed vaccines for rabies (Rabipur®/RabAvert®) and tick-borne encephalitis  leveraging its commercial infrastructure in Canada  the United Kingdom  France and Austria.In the first half of 2022  third party product sales increased by 93.5% to €11.5 million from €5.9 million in the first half of 2021.First Half 2022 Financial Review24(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €93.2 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €47.5 million in the first half of 2021  an increase of 96.3%.Product sales  including COVID-19 vaccine sales  increased by 5.0% to €33.3 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €31.8 million in the first half of 2021. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed positively to €2.6 million of the change in product sales. Product sales from our commercial products amounted to €29.5 million in the first half of 2022  a decrease of 7.0% compared to the first half of 2021. Product sales related to COVID-19 amounted to €3.8 million.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales decreased by 51.7% to €12.3 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €25.4 million in the first half of 2021  primarily as a result of the planned delivery schedule to the DoD during the period. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed positively to €2.4 million of the change in IXIARO® product sales. This was partly offset by the private travel markets  which showed significant recovery with IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales reaching €11.3 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €3.1 million in the first half of 2021. DUKORAL® also benefited from this recovery as sales increased significantly to €5.8 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €0.4 million in the first half of 2021. COVID-19 vaccine sales amounted to €3.8 million resulting from shipments of the vaccine to Bahrain. Third Party product sales increased by 93.5% to €11.5 million in the first half of 2022 from €5.9 million in the first half of 2021  driven by growth related to Valneva’s distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic for the sales of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur®.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services  amounted to €59.9 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €15.7 million in the first half of 2021. This increase is attributable to €89.4 million released from the refund liability as a result of the settlement with the UK government achieved in the second quarter of 2022  partially offset by €36.1 million of negative revenue resulting from an increase in the refund liability linked to the amendment to the VLA15 collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €171.5 million in the first half of 2022. The gross margin on commercial product sales amounted to 58.3% compared to 39.2% in the first half of 2021. COGS of €3.6 million were related to IXIARO® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 70.4%. COGS of €1.3 million were related to DUKORAL® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 77.8%  which was positively impacted by provision releases resulting from reduced expiry risks on inventory. Of the remaining COGS in the first half of 2022  €7.4 million were related to the Third Party products distribution business  €154.9 million to the COVID-19 vaccine business and €4.3 million to cost of services. COGS of the COVID-19 vaccine program included effects from the significant reduction of sales volumes to EC Member States. In the first half of 2021  overall COGS were €34.8 million  of which €23.5 million related to cost of goods and €11.3 million related to cost of services.Research and development expenses amounted to €51.9 million in the first half of 2022  compared to €78.7 million in the first half of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by lower clinical trials costs for Valneva’s chikungunya and COVID-19 vaccine program as those advanced towards licensure. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first half of 2022 amounted to €7.8 million compared to €9.6 million in the first half of 2021. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first half of 2022 notably included €2.2 million of expenses related to the launch preparation costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  compared to €2.0 million in the first half of 2021. In the first half of 2022  general and administrative expenses declined to €16.0 million from €20.9 million in the first half of 2021. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited from a non-cash accrual adjustment to income of €17.8 million related to the positive effect of the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs. This income compares to a cost of €7.3 million in the first half of 2021.Other income  net of other expenses  reduced to €3.6 million in the first half of 2022 from €10.4 million in the first half of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by reduced R&D tax credits directly resulting from lower R&D spending and an increase of expenses related to the provision for the ongoing merger litigation proceedings.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €150.4 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €86.2 million in the first half of 2021  of which the COVID-19 operating loss represented €110.7 million and €55.5 million as of June 30  2022 and 2021 respectively and the other segments represented €39.7 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €30.7 million in the first half of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) loss in the first half of 2022 was €136.0 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of €80.1 million in the first half of 2021.Net ResultIn the first half of 2022  Valneva generated a net loss of €171.5 million compared to a net loss of €86.4 million in the first half of 2021.Finance expense and currency effects in the first half of 2022 resulted in a net finance expense of €18.8 million  compared to a net finance income of €0.5 million in the first half of 2021. This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange loss amounting to €10.7 million in the first half of 2022  primarily driven by revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €8.7 million in the first half of 2021. Interest expenses net of interest income were €8.2 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €8.2 million in the first half of 2021.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €100.2 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €84.2 million of cash generated by operating activities in the first half of 2021. Cash outflows in the first half of 2022 were mainly related to the operating loss generated in the period  while during the first half of 2021 cash inflows mainly resulted from pre-payments received related to the vaccine supply agreement signed with the UK government.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €16.0 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €39.9 million in the first half of 2021  both mainly a result of COVID-19-related construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  as well as equipment purchases.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €105.0 million in the first half of 2022  which was mainly a result of proceeds from the equity subscription agreement with Pfizer as well as disbursements from the credit facility provided by Deerfield & Orbimed. Cash inflows in the first half of 2021 amounted to €78.7 million which was mainly a result of proceeds from issuance of new shares in the U.S. initial public offering and European private placement (Global Offering).Cash and cash equivalents decreased to €336.2 million as of June 30  2022  compared to €346.7 million as of December 31  2021. The cash decrease mainly resulted from ongoing COVID-19-related investments into fixed assets and R&D expenses.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange gain/(loss)  results from investments in associates  amortization  depreciation  and impairment.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the period  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million 6 months ending June 30 (unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS) 2022 2021 Loss for the period (171.5) (86.4) Add: Income tax expense 2.3 0.7 Total Finance income (0.0) (0.2) Total Finance expense 8.2 8.4 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) – net 10.7 (8.7) Result from investments in associates (0.0) 0.1 Amortization 3.5 3.1 Depreciation 7.7 3.0 Impairment 3.3 - Adjusted EBITDA (136.0) (80.1)About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.
