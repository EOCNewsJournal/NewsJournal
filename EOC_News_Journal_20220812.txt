The Company's consolidated financial statements  notes to the financial statements  management's discussion and analysis for the three and six months ended June 30  2022  and 2021  and the 2021 Report to Shareholders and Annual Information Form have been filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and are available on the Company's website (www.africaoilcorp.com).FINANCIAL POSITION AND EARNINGSThe Company recognized a total operating income of $13.3 million and net income of $5.7 million during the second quarter of 2022. The operating income primarily relates to the Company's share of profit from its investments in Prime amounting to $14.4 million.The Company ended first quarter 2022 with cash of $191.0 million in comparison to cash of $58.9 million at the end of 2021. The Company has no outstanding debt. During second quarter 2022  Prime paid two dividends for aggregate distribution of $125.0 million with net payment to Africa Oil of $62.5 million  related to its 50% shareholding interest. Since the acquisition of a 50% shareholding in Prime in January 2020 for $519.5 million  the Company has received 13 dividends from Prime for a total amount of $562.5 million  representing 108% of the closing purchase price.On January 31  2022  the Company announced that all lenders to its Corporate Facility had approved increasing the available amount to $100.0 million from the then unutilized amount of $62.0 million  and extending the availability period to December 31  2022  from May 13  2022. The Corporate Facility maturity date of May 13  2024 and interest margins were unchanged.On February 28  2022  the Company announced that its Board of Directors had declared an initial aggregate annual dividend of $0.05 per share (approximately $24.0 million) to be paid semi-annually  with the first payment payable on March 31  2022  to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17  2022.PRIME'S SECOND QUARTER 2022 PERFORMANCEPrime's second quarter 2022 average daily working interest (""W.I."") production was 25 300 boepd and economic entitlement production was 27 350 boepd (82% light and medium crude oil and 18% conventional natural gas)  net to Africa Oil's 50% shareholding in Prime. These compare to second quarter 20215 average daily W.I. production of 28 000 boepd and economic entitlement production of 30 300 boepd (84% light and medium crude oil and 16% conventional natural gas)  net to Africa Oil's 50% shareholding in Prime. Year to date field performance has been at the higher end of expectation and the full year production outlook remains within the management guidance range for both W.I. production (22 500 – 25 500 boepd) and economic entitlement production (23 000 – 27 000 boepd).During the second quarter 2022  Prime was allocated 3 oil liftings with total sales volume of approximately 3.0 million barrels or 1.5 million barrels net to Africa Oil's 50% shareholding.Prime achieved an average realized oil price of $77.1/bbl in Q2 2022 (Q2 2021: $58.4/bbl) including premium adjustments. Two additional cargos were sold in July 2022 for an average price of $103/bbl including premium demonstrating the upside price exposure under the revised hedging policy.Prime achieved second quarter 2022 sales revenue of $176.4 million (Q2 2021: $125.0 million9); EBITDAX of $127.1 million (Q2 2021: $155.6 million) and cash flow generated from operating activities of $130.0 million (Q2 2021: $245.4 million8  including $152.5 million relating to the receipt of the Agbami Security deposit)  in each case net to Africa Oil's 50% shareholding.As at June 30  2022  net to the Company's 50% shareholding  Prime had $330.6 million of cash and debt of $501.0 million (at December 31  2021: $258.9 million of cash and debt of $508.4 million).The debt outstanding has decreased slightly following gross repayments on the RBL Facility of $164.8 million which net off a drawdown on the PXF Facility of $150.0 million. Net to the Company's 50% shareholding  the overall debt has reduced by $7.4 million during H1 2022. The next repayment under the RBL facility will not occur until September 2022. The PXF repayments will also begin in September 2022.At June 30  2022  Prime has a Net Debt of $340.8 million (at December 31  2021 – Net Debt of $498.9 million) and a Net Debt/EBITDAX of 0.3x for the twelve months ended June 30  2022  (0.4x for the twelve months ended December 31  2021). The strength of this ratio demonstrates the low leverage within Prime compared with industry peers. This strong Net Debt/EBITDAX ratio  combined with the full repayment of the Company's Corporate Facility in 2021 means the Company and Prime are well placed to raise more debt in the future if required. Net Debt/EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation is performed on page 13 of the MD&A.Prime's Supervisory Board have approved a new hedging strategy with a 50% - 70% coverage target for the next 12-month scheduled cargoes on a rolling basis. Under this new strategy  Prime gives an irrevocable instruction to an offtaker to fix the Dated Brent component of a cargo when the forward curve price goes below a trigger of circa 80% of the Brent forward curve (at the time when the instruction was given) for the month of the expected lifting. Otherwise  the cargo is sold on a spot basis. For instance  the most recent forward sale (in Aug-22) was set with a trigger of $85.0/bbl. This means that if the forward curve drops to $85.0/bbl for the month of the forecast cargo  the forward sale price would be locked in. If the forward curve does not drop to $85.0/bbl up to 31 days before the cargo is lifted  then Prime would sell on a spot basis. This policy allows Prime to retain price upside  while securing a minimum oil price for 50% to 70% of its oil entitlement.DIVIDENDSThe Company is committed to a sustainable dividend policy over the future years. The second dividend distribution for 2022 of $0.025 per share is payable on September 30  2022  to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 9  2022. This dividend qualifies as an 'eligible dividend' for Canadian income tax purposes.Dividends on shares traded on TSX will be paid in Canadian dollars on September 30  2022. Dividends on shares traded on Nasdaq Stockholm will be paid in Swedish kroner in accordance with Euroclear principles on October 4  2022. To execute the payment of the dividend  a temporary administrative cross-border transfer closure will be applied by Euroclear from September 8  2022  up to and including September 9  2022 during which period shares of the Company cannot be transferred between the TSX and Nasdaq Stockholm.OUTLOOKThe Company's debt-free balance sheet  its share of Prime's cash flows and access to debt funding on competitive terms  supports a range of opportunities for the Company to achieve accretive growth and create shareholder value. The Company's valuation is underpinned by its 50% shareholding in Prime  which accounts for all of the Company's reserves and production interests.The Company will work to maximize Prime's dividends by distributing its excess cash  whilst maintaining a prudent treasury management policy at Prime. The near-term priority is to extend Prime's debt tenor with the primary objective of refinancing Prime's RBL facility  possibly facilitated by the early conversion of Prime's licenses in Nigeria to the new Petroleum Industry Act (""PIA"") terms. The Company's management will also work with Prime to assess other financing options that could extend Prime's debt maturity profile on competitive costs  such as the PXF Facility that was arranged by Prime in 2021.Prime and its upstream partners are currently working on the early renewal of OML 127 and OML 130 licenses and consequent conversions to the PIA terms. It is expected that OML 130 conversion and renewal  which accounts for most of the reserves  production and value in Prime's portfolio can be delivered by end of 2022  although a successful outcome on this timeline can't be guaranteed. It is further expected that a successful early conversion and renewal of OML 130 could provide the basis for concurrent refinancing of Prime's RBL debt.Furthermore  a conversion and renewal of OML 130 could facilitate the final investment decision for the Preowei oil discovery. Preowei oil field is to the north of Egina FPSO and is a low-risk development opportunity through a satellite subsea tie-back project to the Egina FPSO.Fast track processing of the data from the 4D seismic survey completed over Egina in Q4 2021 is now complete and infill drilling targets have been confirmed. Infill drilling was initially expected to commence mid-year 2022  however this has been delayed until late in Q4 2022 due to the late arrival of the rig. First production from the infill drilling campaign is now not expected until Q1 2023. To offset the impact of the delayed drilling campaign  the operator has identified 4 well intervention opportunities in OML130 which are expected to be executed during Q3 2022.In 2021  the Company and its partners initiated a farm-out process for Project Oil Kenya. Advanced discussions are on-going with the interested parties. A successful farm-out is viewed by the Company as a critical step towards the FID for Project Oil Kenya being achieved over the course of the next year. There is no guarantee that the Company can successfully conclude a farm-out to new strategic partner(s) on favorable terms.In Q1 2022  the Company's investee company  Impact  made a major light oil discovery with the Venus 1-X exploration well on Block 2913B  offshore Namibia.The Venus discovery is a light oil and associated gas field  sitting approximately 290 kms off the Namibian coast. The Venus-1X discovery well was drilled by TotalEnergies on behalf of the joint venture group comprising TotalEnergies (40%)  QatarEnergy (30%)  Impact (20%) and state owned NAMCOR (10%).An appraisal well and a re-entry into Venus-1X is being planned  with spud expected in Q3 2022. The operator plans to conduct flow tests on both wells.Venus  together with the nearby Graff-1 discovery on the adjacent Block 2913A (the Company has no interest in this block)  herald the opening of a major petroleum province in the Orange Basin with significant upside potential for the Company. As well as the immediate significance of Venus for the Company  both Venus and Graff discoveries also bode well for the Company's exploration efforts on Block 3B/4B  which it operates with a 20% WI and Impact's Orange Basin Deep Block  both located on trend in the Orange Basin  South Africa.The Company has filed an application to extend Block 3B/4B license and to move into the first extension period. The Company is also continuing its technical studies on Block 3B/4B with the aim of maturing exploration prospects for possible future drilling. The Company and JV Partners are working together to collectively farmout up to 50% gross WI in Block 3B/4B.The Company  through its shareholdings in Africa Energy and Eco  has indirect effective interest in the Gazania-1 exploration well on Block 2B  offshore South Africa  which is expected to spud in September 2022. The block has significant contingent and prospective resources in relatively shallow water and contains the A-J1 discovery that flowed light sweet crude oil to surface. Gazania-1 will target two large prospects seven kilometers up-dip from A-J1.Africa Energy has a 27.5% participating interest in Block 2B offshore South Africa. The block is operated by a subsidiary of Eco Atlantic  which holds a 50% participating interest. Africa Oil has a 19.78% shareholding in Africa Energy and a 16.2% shareholding in Eco and a resulting 13.6% participating interest in Block 2B.The Company has been actively working on the acquisition of strategic producing assets that are accretive on per share valuation and cashflow metrics. The Company's focus remains on buying producing assets offshore West Africa and the management will consider both operated and non-operated opportunities as well as oil and natural gas assets. There is no guarantee that the Company can complete such transactions.NOTESPrime does not pay dividends to its shareholders  including Africa Oil  on a fixed pre-determined schedule. Previous number of dividends and their amounts should not be taken as a guide for future dividends to be received by Africa Oil. Any dividends received by Africa Oil from Prime's operating cash flows will be subject to Prime's capital investment and financing cashflows  including payments of Prime's RBL principal amortization  which are subject to semi-annual RBL redeterminations. The 50% shareholding in Prime is accounted for using the equity method and presented as an investment in joint venture in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Africa Oil's 50% share of Prime's net profit or loss will be shown in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income and Comprehensive Income. Any dividends received by Africa Oil from Prime are recorded as cash flow from investing activities. The guidance presented here is for information only. Aggregate oil equivalent production data comprised of light and medium crude oil and conventional natural gas production net to Prime's W.I. in Agbami  Akpo and Egina fields. These production rates only include sold gas volumes and not those volumes used for fuel  reinjected or flared. Net entitlement production is calculated using the economic interest methodology and includes cost recovery oil  tax oil and profit oil and is different from working interest production that is calculated based on project volumes multiplied by Prime's effective working interest in each license. Q2 2021 comparative figures have been revised from those previously reported to ensure comparability and consistency of calculation as a result of a change in the conversion factor (to 6.0 Mcf:1bbl from 5.8 Mcf:1bbl) used in converting gas production to barrels oil equivalent. Definitions and reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures are provided on page 11 of the MD&A. Earnings Before Interest  Tax  Impairment  Depreciation  Amortization and Exploration Expenses (""EBITDAX"") is not a generally accepted accounting measure under International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") and does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and  therefore  may not be comparable with definitions of EBITDAX that may be used by other public companies. This is used by management as a performance measure to understand the financial performance from Prime's business operations without including the effects of the capital structure  tax rates  DD&A  impairment and exploration expenses. Non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. A reconciliation from total profit (a GAAP measure) to EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) can be found on page 13 of the MD&A. Q2 2021 comparative figures have been revised to ensure compatibility and consistency of calculation as a result of a change in the classification of items between cash generated from operating activities  cash used in investing activities and cash used in financing activities. Q2 2021 comparative figures have been revised to ensure compatibility and consistency of calculation. Royalties were previously recognized net in Prime's income statement and are now presented gross in both revenue and cost of sales. All dollar amounts are in United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.Management Conference CallSenior management will hold a conference call to discuss the results on Thursday  August 11  2022 at 07:00 (ET) / 13:00 (CET).

The Company is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and on Nasdaq Stockholm under the symbol ""AOI"".Additional InformationThis information is information that Africa Oil is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Swedish Financial Instruments Trading Act. The information was submitted for publication  through the agency of the contact persons set out above  at 8:00 p.m. ET on August 10  2022.Advisory Regarding Oil and Gas InformationThe terms boe (barrel of oil equivalent) is used throughout this press release. Such terms may be misleading  particularly if used in isolation. Production data are based on a conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel (6 Mcf: 1bbl). This conversion ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1  utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.Forward Looking InformationCertain statements and information contained herein constitute ""forward-looking information"" (within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation).

This is a great achievement by the team amid challenging market conditions due to the war in Ukraine and the consequential further increase in raw material and energy prices. Our total volumes fell  mainly due to a decline in the pig sector in Netherlands/Belgium and the United Kingdom  whereas poultry volumes in Poland grew. The cost increases could only be passed on in the chain in the course of the second quarter. This explains the result improvement versus the first quarter. Finally  the absolute rise in gross profit in the first half-year was higher than the absolute increase in operating expenses. Underlying EBITDA consequently was higher than originally expectedStory continuesIn the Netherlands  the approach taken in handling the nitrogen crisis is leading to a polarised public debate as well as widespread unrest among livestock farmers. We call on politicians to be more open to a meeting in which everything is open for discussion. Cooperation and innovation are more effective and better than just restructuring. Moreover  prospects are prerequisites for sustainable business practices  in any sector. The agricultural sector has always proven itself in terms of innovation and solution-based thinking. Our cooperation with customers and other partners in the chain is invaluable. In all the conversations I have held in the past few months I have experienced the huge knowledge and pride in the sector in general and this great company in particular.The tightening of the strategy in light of all the aforementioned developments is in full swing and underpins our confidence in the future. We will make further announcements about this in the fourth quarter.We are also pleased about the recently announced joint venture between ForFarmers UK and the poultry feed company 2Agriculture in the United Kingdom. The proposed joint venture is subject to regulatory approval in the United Kingdom.Looking ahead  there are still many uncertainties at present  especially due to the war in Ukraine. In addition  we need to consider a possible new Covid wave and the low water levels in the rivers in the Netherlands. In view of this we consider it unwise to provide any guidance about the expected development of the results in the second half of 2022 or a possible resumption of the share buy-back programme.”Read the full press release on www.forfarmersgroup.eu.This press release contains information that qualifies as inside information in the sense of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.Note to the editor / For additional information:Caroline Vogelzang  Director Investor RelationsT: 0031 573 288 000 M: 0031 6 10 94 91 61E: caroline.vogelzang@forfarmers.euAbout ForFarmers N.V.ForFarmers N.V. is an international organisation that provides complete innovative feed solutions to the livestock farming industry.

Benefits from expense savings  growth initiatives and favorable claims experience are more than offset by lower fees due to adverse market movements and lower investment incomeThe capital ratios of all three main units remain above their respective operating levels. Group Solvency II ratio increases to 214% driven by management actions and the benefit from model updatesCash Capital at the Holding decreases only slightly to EUR 1.7 billion at June 30  2022  despite the impact of the previously announced deleveraging and share buyback; third tranche buyback to commence in October 20222022 interim dividend increases by EUR 0.03 to EUR 0.11 per common share reflecting sustainable free cash flow growthAegon raises its 2022 guidance for operating capital generation from the units from around EUR 1.2 billion to around EUR 1.4 billion. Aegon also expects to achieve cumulative free cash flow over the period 2021 to 2023 of at least EUR 2.2 billion  well ahead of the EUR 1.4 to 1.6 billion target set at the 2020 Capital Markets DayStatement of Lard Friese  CEO“The first half year of 2022 was one of the most challenging periods for investors with equity markets experiencing their worst start of the year in over five decades. Volatility remained as central banks increased interest rates to curb rising inflation and the war in Ukraine continued. Against this challenging backdrop we performed well  a testament to the strength of our strategy.Our second quarter operating result of EUR 538 million was strong  reflecting the receding impact of COVID-19 and the progress we are making on our operational improvement plan that helped offset the impact from lower equity markets. We have now executed 1 058 out of more than 1 200 initiatives as part of this plan. Expense initiatives resulted in a EUR 250 million reduction of annual addressable expenses. Across our three core markets  our Workplace Solutions businesses generated positive net deposits  supported by various growth initiatives and favorable labor market conditions. We also achieved growth in new life sales in the US  supported by a 12% increase in licensed life agents at WFG over the last year. Mortgage origination volumes in the Netherlands  net deposits in the Retail channel in the UK  and third-party net deposits in our asset management business were down versus last year  reflecting a challenging macro-economic outlook and rising interest rates.Story continuesOur net result was impacted by a one-time charge related to reinsurance rate increases in the US  contributing to the net loss of EUR 348 million for the quarter. Nonetheless  we remain on course to deliver on our objective of growing returns to shareholders. The actions we have taken to strengthen our capital position and improve our risk profile are paying off in the current market circumstances  with the capital position of our three main units remaining above their respective operating levels. The strength of our balance sheet and the sustainable growth in free cash flow are a solid basis to raise the interim dividend by 3 eurocents compared with last year to 11 eurocents per common share.In the second quarter we also continued to make progress in our approach on sustainability.

These non-EU-IFRS measures  except for addressable expenses  are calculated by consolidating on a proportionate basis Aegon’s joint ventures and associated companies. The reconciliation of these measures  except for market consistent value of new business and return on equity  to the most comparable EU-IFRS measure is provided in the notes to this press release. Market consistent value of new business is not based on EU-IFRS  which are used to report Aegon’s primary financial statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for EU-IFRS financial measures. Aegon may define and calculate market consistent value of new business differently than other companies. Return on equity is a ratio using a non-EU-IFRS measure and is calculated by dividing the operating result after tax less cost of leverage by the average shareholders’ equity excluding the revaluation reserve. Operating expenses are all expenses associated with selling and administrative activities (excluding commissions) after reallocation of claim handling expenses to benefits paid. This includes certain expenses recorded in other charges  including restructuring charges. Addressable expenses are expenses reflected in the operating result  excluding deferrable acquisition expenses  expenses in joint ventures and associates and expenses related to operations in CEE countries. Aegon believes that these non-EU-IFRS measures  together with the EU-IFRS information  provide meaningful supplemental information about the operating results of Aegon’s business including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing the business.Local currencies and constant currency exchange ratesThis document contains certain information about Aegon’s results  financial condition and revenue generating investments presented in USD for the Americas and in GBP for the United Kingdom  because those businesses operate and are managed primarily in those currencies.

Other non-COVID-19 related revenues will be negative in 2022 due to the increased refund liability linked to the amendment of the VLA15 collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer. COVID-19 related Other Revenues will have no cash impact in 2022 and relate to revenues recognized in relation to the UK and EC Advance Purchase Agreements.Valneva expects R&D expenses of €120 million to €135 million in 2022. The Company will continue investing in progressing its two leading  late-stage investigational vaccines against Lyme disease and chikungunya in the second half of 2022. Valneva will invest in further development of its current or any potential second-generation COVID-19 vaccine only if it receives the necessary funding or commitments to such funding during the third quarter of 2022. The Company also remains committed to further expanding its R&D pipeline  including through the advancement of some of the Company´s pre-clinical candidates towards clinical entry.Story continuesFinancial Information(unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS)€ in million 6 months ending June 30 2022 2021 Total revenues 93.2 47.5 Product sales 33.3 31.8 Net loss (171.5) (86.4) Adjusted EBITDA loss (136.0) (80.1) Cash (at end of period) 336.2 346.7Saint-Herblain (France)  August 11  2022 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  today reported consolidated financial results for the first half of the year  ended June 30  2022. The half year financial report  including the condensed consolidated interim financial report and the half year management report  is available on the Company’s website (Financial Reports – Valneva).Valneva will provide a live webcast of its half year financial results conference call beginning at3 p.m. CEST or 9 a.m. EDT today. This webcast will also be available on the Company’s website. Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gpxqaierThomas Lingelbach  Valneva’s Chief Executive Officer  commented  “Valneva continued to achieve significant R&D milestones in the first half of the year. Our updated Lyme disease collaboration agreement with Pfizer included a substantial equity investment which we see as a strong sign of confidence and recognition of our vaccine expertise  and the recent Phase 3 initiation brings us a step closer to a potential vaccine solution against Lyme disease. Our chikungunya vaccine program successfully met all Phase 3 clinical endpoints  readying us for BLA submission. Our COVID-19 vaccine became the first to receive full marketing authorization in Europe  and we look forward to delivering the first doses in Europe in the coming weeks. However  given the revised volume of orders from the EU Member States  we are evaluating how to re-shape our operations. Looking at our other commercial products  we are seeing a faster recovery than expected in the travel vaccine market and demand may even exceed our current supply capacity in the later part of the year. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders  partners and employees for their ongoing support and contribution.”Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 study initiatedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The vaccine candidate covers the six OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe.In August 2022  Valneva and Pfizer announced the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical study  “Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR)” (NCT NCT05477524)  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in approximately 6 000 participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States and Europe. As per the terms of the collaboration agreement between the two companies  Valneva will receive a $25 million milestone payment from Pfizer within 60 days following initiation of the Phase 3 study.Pending successful Phase 3 completion  Pfizer could potentially submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2025.Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA1510. In June 2022  the terms of this collaboration were updated  and Pfizer invested €90.5 ($95) million in Valneva as part of an Equity Subscription Agreement11. If approved  Pfizer will commercialize VLA15 and Valneva will be eligible to receive substantial milestone and royalty payments.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553Initiation of BLA rolling submission with U.S. FDA imminentVLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to more than 100 countries with the potential to rapidly expand further. There are currently no preventive vaccines or effective treatments for the chikungunya virus available and VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate that successfully completed primary analysis in a pivotal Phase 3 study.Valneva reported final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 202212 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202213  enabling BLA submission with the FDA. Valneva expects initiation of the rolling submission for approval of VLA1553 in persons aged 18 years and above imminently. This rolling BLA submission will be part of the accelerated approval pathway agreed upon with the FDA in 202014.Valneva is currently targeting the end of 2022 for completion of the BLA submission. Once all portions of the application have been submitted and if the FDA has accepted the filing  the FDA will determine priority review eligibility and the action date upon which the FDA will complete its evaluation. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva currently plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the first half of 2023.A clinical trial of VLA1553 in adolescents is currently ongoing in Brazil15  which may support future regulatory submissions and label extensions following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults in the US. Conducted by Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  the trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic region.Pre-Clinical Vaccine CandidatesThe Company plans to advance research and development activities relating to two of its pre-clinical assets  VLA1554 and VLA2112. VLA1554 is a vaccine candidate targeting the human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  which is a major worldwide respiratory pathogen that causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection in children and is also a common cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients and older adults. VLA1554 is currently in pre-clinical proof of concept studies. VLA2112 is a vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr virus  which is one of the most common human viruses and can cause infectious mononucleosis and other illnesses. VLA2112 is currently in a late-stage evaluation phase.Marketed VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the U.S.  Canada and Europe.In the first half of 2022  IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €12.3 million compared to €25.4 million in the first half of 2021  as a result of the planned delivery schedule to the U.S. Department of Defense. This decrease was partly offset by the private travel markets  which showed significant recovery with IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales reaching €11.3 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €3.1 million in the first half of 2021.CHOLERA / ETEC16-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC17  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera  and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.In the first half of 2022  DUKORAL® sales increased to €5.8 million compared to €0.4 million in the first half of 2021  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets.SARS-CoV-2 INACTIVATED WHOLE-VIRUS VACCINEValneva’s COVID-19 vaccine is the only inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe18 and the only COVID-19 vaccine to receive a full marketing authorization in Europe. It is produced using Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for the Company’s commercial Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®.During the first half of the year  Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom19 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates20 and Kingdom of Bahrain21. The vaccine generated sales of €3.8 million during the first six months of 2022.In July 2022  Valneva announced an amendment to the APA it signed with the EC in November 202122. The amended APA includes orders of 1.25 million doses of the vaccine  with the option to purchase an equivalent quantity later this year for delivery in 2022. This amendment followed remediation discussions based on the EC’s notice of intent23 to terminate the initial APA for doses in 2022 and optional doses for 2023.First vaccine doses are currently expected to be delivered to participating EU Member States (Germany  Austria  Denmark  Finland  and Bulgaria) in August 2022. Valneva will retain inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase and  in parallel  Valneva will continue discussions on potential additional supply and financing agreements with various other governments around the world. Valneva will aim to deploy approximately eight to ten million doses of remaining inventory into international markets. Given that the vaccine’s shelf life is expected to be gradually extended from the current 15 months to at least 24 months over time  the Company will seek to deploy its inventory doses in the next six to twelve months.In light of the reduced order volume from EU Member States  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine and recognized write-downs of €100.6 million as of June 30  2022 relating to existing inventory acquired to produce and supply volumes under the original EC APA. Valneva is also evaluating its COVID-19 program and associated activities and will re-shape its operations accordingly. In addition  Valneva and IDT Biologika (IDT) are discussing potential ways of terminating their drug substance manufacturing agreement in light of the suspended manufacturing of Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine. Valneva will continue certain ongoing clinical trials  in particular on the potential use of the vaccine as a booster. Valneva will invest in further development of the vaccine or second-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate only if it receives the necessary funding or commitments to such funding during the third quarter of 2022.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In June 2020  the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic  pursuant to which it agreed to commercialize Bavarian Nordic’s marketed vaccines for rabies (Rabipur®/RabAvert®) and tick-borne encephalitis  leveraging its commercial infrastructure in Canada  the United Kingdom  France and Austria.In the first half of 2022  third party product sales increased by 93.5% to €11.5 million from €5.9 million in the first half of 2021.First Half 2022 Financial Review24(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €93.2 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €47.5 million in the first half of 2021  an increase of 96.3%.Product sales  including COVID-19 vaccine sales  increased by 5.0% to €33.3 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €31.8 million in the first half of 2021. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed positively to €2.6 million of the change in product sales. Product sales from our commercial products amounted to €29.5 million in the first half of 2022  a decrease of 7.0% compared to the first half of 2021. Product sales related to COVID-19 amounted to €3.8 million.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales decreased by 51.7% to €12.3 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €25.4 million in the first half of 2021  primarily as a result of the planned delivery schedule to the DoD during the period. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed positively to €2.4 million of the change in IXIARO® product sales. This was partly offset by the private travel markets  which showed significant recovery with IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales reaching €11.3 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €3.1 million in the first half of 2021. DUKORAL® also benefited from this recovery as sales increased significantly to €5.8 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €0.4 million in the first half of 2021. COVID-19 vaccine sales amounted to €3.8 million resulting from shipments of the vaccine to Bahrain. Third Party product sales increased by 93.5% to €11.5 million in the first half of 2022 from €5.9 million in the first half of 2021  driven by growth related to Valneva’s distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic for the sales of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur®.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services  amounted to €59.9 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €15.7 million in the first half of 2021. This increase is attributable to €89.4 million released from the refund liability as a result of the settlement with the UK government achieved in the second quarter of 2022  partially offset by €36.1 million of negative revenue resulting from an increase in the refund liability linked to the amendment to the VLA15 collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €171.5 million in the first half of 2022. The gross margin on commercial product sales amounted to 58.3% compared to 39.2% in the first half of 2021. COGS of €3.6 million were related to IXIARO® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 70.4%. COGS of €1.3 million were related to DUKORAL® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 77.8%  which was positively impacted by provision releases resulting from reduced expiry risks on inventory. Of the remaining COGS in the first half of 2022  €7.4 million were related to the Third Party products distribution business  €154.9 million to the COVID-19 vaccine business and €4.3 million to cost of services. COGS of the COVID-19 vaccine program included effects from the significant reduction of sales volumes to EC Member States. In the first half of 2021  overall COGS were €34.8 million  of which €23.5 million related to cost of goods and €11.3 million related to cost of services.Research and development expenses amounted to €51.9 million in the first half of 2022  compared to €78.7 million in the first half of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by lower clinical trials costs for Valneva’s chikungunya and COVID-19 vaccine program as those advanced towards licensure. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first half of 2022 amounted to €7.8 million compared to €9.6 million in the first half of 2021. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first half of 2022 notably included €2.2 million of expenses related to the launch preparation costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  compared to €2.0 million in the first half of 2021. In the first half of 2022  general and administrative expenses declined to €16.0 million from €20.9 million in the first half of 2021. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited from a non-cash accrual adjustment to income of €17.8 million related to the positive effect of the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs. This income compares to a cost of €7.3 million in the first half of 2021.Other income  net of other expenses  reduced to €3.6 million in the first half of 2022 from €10.4 million in the first half of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by reduced R&D tax credits directly resulting from lower R&D spending and an increase of expenses related to the provision for the ongoing merger litigation proceedings.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €150.4 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €86.2 million in the first half of 2021  of which the COVID-19 operating loss represented €110.7 million and €55.5 million as of June 30  2022 and 2021 respectively and the other segments represented €39.7 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €30.7 million in the first half of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) loss in the first half of 2022 was €136.0 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of €80.1 million in the first half of 2021.Net ResultIn the first half of 2022  Valneva generated a net loss of €171.5 million compared to a net loss of €86.4 million in the first half of 2021.Finance expense and currency effects in the first half of 2022 resulted in a net finance expense of €18.8 million  compared to a net finance income of €0.5 million in the first half of 2021. This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange loss amounting to €10.7 million in the first half of 2022  primarily driven by revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €8.7 million in the first half of 2021. Interest expenses net of interest income were €8.2 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €8.2 million in the first half of 2021.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €100.2 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €84.2 million of cash generated by operating activities in the first half of 2021. Cash outflows in the first half of 2022 were mainly related to the operating loss generated in the period  while during the first half of 2021 cash inflows mainly resulted from pre-payments received related to the vaccine supply agreement signed with the UK government.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €16.0 million in the first half of 2022 compared to €39.9 million in the first half of 2021  both mainly a result of COVID-19-related construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  as well as equipment purchases.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €105.0 million in the first half of 2022  which was mainly a result of proceeds from the equity subscription agreement with Pfizer as well as disbursements from the credit facility provided by Deerfield & Orbimed. Cash inflows in the first half of 2021 amounted to €78.7 million which was mainly a result of proceeds from issuance of new shares in the U.S. initial public offering and European private placement (Global Offering).Cash and cash equivalents decreased to €336.2 million as of June 30  2022  compared to €346.7 million as of December 31  2021. The cash decrease mainly resulted from ongoing COVID-19-related investments into fixed assets and R&D expenses.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange gain/(loss)  results from investments in associates  amortization  depreciation  and impairment.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the period  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million 6 months ending June 30 (unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS) 2022 2021 Loss for the period (171.5) (86.4) Add: Income tax expense 2.3 0.7 Total Finance income (0.0) (0.2) Total Finance expense 8.2 8.4 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) – net 10.7 (8.7) Result from investments in associates (0.0) 0.1 Amortization 3.5 3.1 Depreciation 7.7 3.0 Impairment 3.3 - Adjusted EBITDA (136.0) (80.1)About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

The deliberations are ongoing and subject to change  the people said.Domestic rival China International Capital Corp. announced last month that the bank had become a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.German regulator BaFin  the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  Citic  CICC and Haitong declined to comment.Aided by an expanded cross-border listing program  Europe is becoming something of a magnet for Chinese companies seeking overseas financing. Growing geopolitical tensions are increasing the likelihood of a potential exodus of US-listed Chinese firms with three of China’s largest state-owned companies announcing plans to delist from US exchanges on Friday.Read More: China State-Owned Giants Plan to Delist From US Amid Audit SpatLast month  four Chinese companies including Gotion High-tech Co. raised a total of $1.6 billion after issuing global depositary receipts on Switzerland’s Six Swiss Exchange. At least six other Chinese firms have said they plan to list in the country in future.Having tasted success in Switzerland  Chinese banks are eyeing Germany in anticipation of demand for Frankfurt listings via the so-called stock connect program. The mechanism  which initially allow listed firms in Shanghai and London to sell shares on each other’s venues  was expanded to include Germany  Switzerland and Shenzhen by Chinese regulators in February. No company has used the Frankfurt connect so far.Germany has looked to attract Chinese listings in the past with a 2015 joint venture between Deutsche Boerse  Shanghai Stock Exchange and China Financial Futures Exchange creating the China Europe International Exchange.

SETD2 methylates histone as well as non-histone proteins  and this activity is involved in several key biological processes including transcriptional regulation  RNA splicing  and DNA damage repair. Based on the preclinical data on SETD2 inhibition by EZM0414 in multiple settings  including high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma (MM) and in other B-cell malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  the Company is conducting SET-101  a Phase 1/1b study of EZM0414  for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM and DLBCL.About follicular lymphoma2 3Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) which is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Follicular lymphoma develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally helps fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in the lymph nodes or other body organs. Follicular lymphoma is generally slow growing. Each year  15-20 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Most affected individuals are diagnosed with advanced disease.About epithelioid sarcoma4Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare  slow-growing type of soft tissue cancer. Most cases begin in the soft tissue under the skin of a finger  hand  forearm  lower leg or foot  though it can start in other areas of the body. Typically  epithelioid sarcoma starts as a small firm growth or lump that is painless. It usually starts out as a single growth  but multiple growths may occur by the time a person seeks medical help. Sometimes this sarcoma appears as ulcers that don't heal  looking like open wounds over the growths. It is estimated that 13 040 individuals received a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas in the U.S. in 2018 with a corresponding 5 150 deaths.5About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma6Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of NHL. NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally help to fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes or other body organs. DLBCL grows quickly and treatment starts soon after diagnosis. DLBCL is the most common type of NHL in the U.S. and worldwide  accounting for about 22 percent of newly diagnosed cases of B-cell NHL in the U.S. More than 18 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with DLBCL each year.7About multiple myeloma8Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer characterized by excessive production (proliferation) and improper function of certain cells (plasma cells) found in the bone marrow. Excessive plasma cells may eventually mass together to form a tumor or tumors in various sites of the body  especially the bone marrow. When multiple tumors are present or the bone marrow has greater than 10% plasma cells  the term multiple myeloma is used. In 2019  over 32 000 individuals in the U.S. were diagnosed with this disease. It is believed that approximately 100 000 Americans currently have the disease.About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.comReferences1 US Food and Drug Administration.

This substantial increase was mainly driven by the double-digit underlying growth in recurring digital revenue (+21.7%)  which is at the core of the business of the Company. Unifiedpost expects further double-digit growth due to the accelerated adoption of e-invoicing throughout Europe.HighlightsGroup revenue grew by 13.6% y/y to €91.7 million for H1 2022Recurring digital processing revenue up by 21.7% y/y in H1 2022Including project and license business  total digital processing revenue grew +17.7% y/y in H1 2022Strong growth of customer base with 14.9% in H1 compared to end 2021Reaching cash flow break-even point by H2 2023 is the predominant priority for the CompanyPromising new business opportunity for the Group with government portalsCommenting on the business update  Hans Leybaert  CEO and founder stated: “We show a solid organic growth  in line with budget  in the first half of 2022. Unifiedpost’s business remains strongly dependent on local e-invoicing regulations. We have monitored a positive evolution in the market in the sense that even more European countries have committed themselves to making e-invoicing mandatory in the near future. Some committed countries postponed the implementation in the short term but are still on the road towards obliging regulatory e-invoicing. Consequently  potential growth is currently concentrated in the countries where we see that due to regulatory tailwinds  companies tend to implement e-invoicing rather sooner. Looking forward to the coming quarters  we have a well-stocked pipeline of some large license deals. To pave the way for our long-term business development  we are currently also building several important partnerships. Next to that  our focus is on becoming cashflow break-even.”Story continuesKey financial figures(EUR million) H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) Digital processing revenue 59.3 50.4 +17.7%21 8%-24 4%6 9%13 6% Recurring 55.9 45.9 +21.7%-24 4%Project & licenses 3.4 4.5 -24.3%6 9%Postage & parcel optimisation revenue 32.4 30.3 +6.9%Group revenue 91.7 80.7 +13.6%Key business KPI’s(#) End H1 2022 End 2021 Change (%) Customers 910 845 792 594 +14.9% Direct paying customers 430 524 368 277 +16.9% Indirect paying customers (third party) 480 321 424 317 +13.2% Companies in business network 1 745 401 1 504 895 +16.0% Banqup customers68 645 35 408 +93.9% Organic growth (new subscriptions) 10 726 4 855 +120.9% Migrated 22 511 - - Banqup customers Belgium (Billtobox)35 382 28 864 +22.6% Banqup customers France (JeFacture)3 591 2 072 +73.3%Recurring digital processing revenue grew significantly by 21.7% in H1 2022Consolidated Group revenue in first semester of 2022 increased by 13.6% to €91.7 million  mainly driven by organic growth from digital processing revenue1. This core business of Unifiedpost contributed €59.3 million  an increase of 17.7% y/y  of which 13.7% was organic. Recurring digital revenue  i.e.  digital platform revenue excluding the project and license business  showed a strong growth rate of 21.7% y/y. The project and license business  which is non-recurring  contributed €3.4 million. Postage & parcel optimisation revenue showed a sound growth rate of 6.9% y/y. Group-wide recurring revenue remains high at 96.3% of total Group revenue for the first half of 2022.Customer base grew substantially by 14.9% in H1 2022In H1 2022 Unifiedpost grew its customer base to 910 845 customers (+14.9% compared to FY 2021). The consolidated business network expanded to over 1.75 million companies  representing an estimated share of 6% of SME businesses in Europe.The total number of Banqup customers grew to 68 645 (+93.9% compared end YE 2021). The customer growth includes migration effects  mainly from legacy platforms in the Baltics. Adjusting for such migrated users  the number of Banqup users increased by 10 726 in the first six months of 2022  supported by a very pleasing organic growth in markets like France  Serbia and in the Benelux.In the French market  Unifiedpost sees the number of JeFacture customers increasing steadily. Management expects exponential customer growth rates when the deadline for mandatory B2B e-invoicing is nearing.Overall average revenue per user (ARPU) in digital processing business amounts to €23 for Q2 2022. This reflects some decline compared to Q1 (€24.5). This decrease is as expected by the management. It is important to emphasize that this effect results from the significantly higher contribution from Unifiedpost’s SME business in terms of new customers  which have a significantly lower ARPU. This leads to a structural dilution of the overall ARPU figure  in line with expectations based on the Company’s strategy.Platform scalability and new ecosystems show promising resultsUnifiedpost Group continued to successfully launch its Banqup platform in 2022. Given the accelerated adoption of e-invoicing throughout Europe  the growth of the platform is expected to continue based on the implementation of regulation on country level2. Unifiedpost has been speeding up the roll-out of its payment services by further connecting major European banks to the platform. Today the Company has 686 banking connections (PSD2) in 19 countries. As of today  the payment functionality is live in 8 countries and is expected to reach 14 by year end 2022.Impact of macro-economic and geopolitical situationUnifiedpost has not been directly impacted by the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The Group has no business in Ukraine  nor in Russia. It also has no development centres in these countries. All countries where the Group is active are however experiencing levels of inflation that have not been observed in decades.MarketThe world has changed. The uncertain geo-political environment and the supply chain disruptions are persisting. This creates a challenging business context impacting businesses worldwide with international sanctions against Russia  rising energy prices  unprecedented inflation and increasing interest rates. As businesses seek in these circumstances for cost efficiency measures  the need for digital solutions like e-invoicing is more relevant than ever. Governments are largely impacted today by an increasing deficit and debt. To reduce their deficit  governments are accelerating the fight against VAT fraud by declaring e-invoicing mandatory. Within the EU the program ‘VAT in Digital Age’ is a new legislative package to adapt the way value-added tax shall be reported and collected. This should lead to a significant boost for the (B2B) e-invoicing once the laws are in force. The boost is expected in the period 2023-2028. The year 2022 is for most of the countries a preparation year. Countries who had already released a timetable for making B2B e-invoicing mandatory are experiencing some execution delays. This is the case in Poland and France. Additionally  market trends show that the increased adoption of B2B-invoicing is closely linked to the deadline of mandatory e-invoicing. The growth in markets is back end loaded. With the increasing legislation on mandatory e-invoicing there is an increasing demand from governments for e-invoice portals. Governments aim to offer a basic free e-invoicing portal to businesses.Management guidanceUnifiedpost’s organic growth has been supported by a growing number of SME and corporate customers  and an increasing usage of the platform. The growth is steady double-digit. A further acceleration is linked to the deadlines of governments making e-invoicing mandatory. These ground-breaking movements are challenging for governments.New business opportunities have emerged for Unifiedpost: government portals. A basic version of the Unifiedpost platform is a perfect solution for government e-invoice portals and gateways to VAT-compliance validation. Unifiedpost has sold platform licenses to governments in the past. Today  with the regulatory tailwinds becoming stronger and stronger  more business can be generated. With the transitional year 2022 for the B2B e-invoicing market the Group will generate substantial additional revenue from this business in Q3/Q4 with license deals. The pipeline for license sale is well stocked. These deals  if timely materialised in 2022  will support the organic growth of 25%.Due to the changed business conditions  the Company has decided to make the target to become cashflow break-even its predominant priority. The target is to be cashflow break-even by the second semester of 2023. All costs and investments will further be aligned to B2B e-invoice market developments and market growth. The costs of the Group are meanwhile impacted directly and indirectly by inflation. To counter that impact the Group plans to increase sales prices.Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.

The large European interventional clinical study is investigating protection against Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants. HARMONIE is an open label trial that will evaluate the use of nirsevimab  a passive immunisation  in a broad population. RSV is the leading cause of hospitalisation in all infants worldwidei and affects 90% of children before the age of two.iiThe study has been developed as a collaboration between NIHR  investigators  Sanofi and its clinical research organisation partner  Labcorp. More than 20 000 infants across 3 countries (United Kingdom  France  Germany) will be enrolled from August 2022 to March 2023  of which the majority (up to 12 000) will be UK infants.The first patient visit took place at Cripps Health Centre at the University of Nottingham  United Kingdom on August 8  2022. The study will take place across approximately 280 sites  of which around 110 are in the UK. HARMONIE is Sanofi’s first hybrid digital study  and requires only one patient visit.Dr Simon RoyalPrimary Investigator  Honorary Assistant Professor at the University of Nottingham Medical School and GP at the University of Nottingham Health Service  said:“The HARMONIE study will expand our understanding of how well a one-off injection protects babies from RSV. RSV is a major cause of death and illness in children across the world and it is the most common reason for admission to hospital in children aged under one year in the UK. Nearly 80% of the children admitted to hospital with RSV are previously healthy and at certain times of the year  children’s wards are full of babies with disease caused by this virus.”Professor Andrew Ustianowski National Specialty Lead for Infection at NIHR Clinical Research Network  said:“This study  supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research across over 100 sites  provides the UK with the opportunity to lead the way in a disease which impacts infants globally.“By carrying out this widespread study  we can help discover how babies can be protected from such a common  yet potentially debilitating virus.”Dr Bogdana CoudsyGlobal Head of Medical for Vaccines at Sanofi  said:“Given RSV is a leading cause of hospitalisation in all infants  we are excited to start this research that put the needs of participants  carers  and investigators at the heart of its development. This is an innovative study in design and execution  a model for the future  thanks to a hybrid digital design and close collaborative work.”RSV places a significant burden on families and health servicesGlobally  in 2015  there were approximately 30 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections. This led to more than 3 million hospitalisations  and it was estimated that there were 60 000 in-hospital deaths of children younger than 5 years.iii-iv In recent months  there has been a resurgence of RSV following the easing of COVID-19 public health measures.v-viA peer-reviewed RAND and University of Cambridge report on the burden of RSV estimated that RSV costs the UK £80 million in healthcare costs and productivity losses each year.vii In 2017  RSV-related direct medical costs—including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care—were estimated at €4.82 billion globally.viiiA survey of 1 500 UK parents commissioned by Sanofi in 2021 revealed that 83% of parents said infant respiratory infections impacted their mental health  with 4 in 10 (41%) experiencing significant emotional distress.ixNirsevimab is being developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca.More information about the trial can be found at http://rsvharmoniestudy.comENDSAbout HARMONIEHospitalised RSV Monoclonal Antibody Prevention (HARMONIE) is a phase 3b randomised open-label study of nirsevimab in preventing hospitalisations due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants under 12 months.This study will include newborn babies to babies 12 months old who are in  or are approaching  their first RSV season. It will last approximately 12 months.HARMONIE is an open label interventional study which builds on successful results in phase 2b/3 trials of nirsevimab across all infants.x Regulatory submissions for nirsevimab are already underway.HARMONIE has been designed and developed as a result of close collaboration between Sanofi  investigators and Labcorp  with the purpose of minimising burden on participants  caregivers and parents and as such is based around a single in person visit with entirely virtual follow up.For more information visit http://rsvharmoniestudy.com.About NirsevimabNirsevimab is an investigational long-acting antibody aiming to protect all infants from birth entering their first RSV season with a single dose.x xi xiiNirsevimab is an immunisation designed to provide direct RSV protection to all infants via an antibody to help prevent LRTI caused by RSV.In March 2017  Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialise nirsevimab. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi will lead commercialisation activities and record revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m  has paid a development milestone of €30m and will pay up to a further €465m upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. The two companies share all costs and profits. Revenue from the agreement is reported as Collaboration Revenue in the Company’s financial statements.Nirsevimab has been granted regulatory designations to facilitate expedited development by several regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation by The China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines scheme; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and named “a medicine for prioritised development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). Nirsevimab has seen successful results in phase 2b/3 trials across all infants.x The safety and efficacy of nirsevimab is currently being evaluated under an accelerated assessment procedure by the EMA.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYJuly saw a recovery from the losses faced the previous two months. The fund gained +4.5%  mainly driven by EUR CLO equity holdings (+2 7% contribution in NAV performance).Through asset classes  the monthly performances** were: -2.8% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +5% for CLO equity tranches; +2.3% for CLO debt; -5% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (together representing 2.3% of NAV).In the footsteps of most markets (July was one of the best months for the High Yield bonds market since years)  the loan markets rallied and therefore CLO followed.Across CLO market  USD CLO equity received cashflows below expected due to the loss of the Libor floor  in contrast with EUR deals that received higher cashflows than expected. In addition to the EUR CLO equity prices rally (after two tough months)  it leads to a double digit performance for this asset class in July.During the last month  the fund sold 2 USD CLO tranches rated BB and B  and acquired 2 EUR tranches (of the same deal) rated BB and B too. The purchases were based on the following assumptions : 18 months to call  15% and 22% IRR respectively.For the coming weeks  Volta will participate in two CLO warehouses  one short USD warehouse and an EUR warehouse thereafter  both investments will be rolled in the CLO equity issuance. Under the current assumptions  the target IRR is around 15% for both deal  with limited risk for the USD warehouse as the fund is investing after CLO pricing. More details will be communicated in the next report.Story continuesIn July  Volta received the equivalent of €9.8m in terms of interest and coupons. For the 6 months ended July 2022  Volta received €24.3m interest and coupons representing a 21.4% annualized cash flow to NAV.As already stated in the past  Volta didn’t suffer from any diversion of cash flows from its CLO Equity positions  we think that it would continue for the coming quarters.As at the end of July 2022  Volta’s NAV was €227.7m or €6.22 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 7.0% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 6.4% as at 30 June 2022 and 0.6% as at 31 March 2022..** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas Securities Services S.C.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Aug. 12  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Amid signs that a more severe influenza season is approaching in the US  a panel of public health leaders today urged that people get vaccinated in preparation for the upcoming influenza season and warned that patients in high-risk populations tend to suffer significant flu-related health disparities.3The conversation focused on how to increase protection for people over 65 and those with weakened immune systems  including those with chronic conditions such as diabetes  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease. Experts also considered how inequities translate to higher rates of hospitalizations due to the flu among Black Americans and other under-represented communities.1The virtual discussion  hosted by Sanofi with invited media in attendance  was moderated by Michael Greenberg  MD  MPH  North America Medical Head of Vaccines at Sanofi.Michael Greenberg  MD  MPHNorth America Medical Head of Vaccines at Sanofi""We have the tools to help reduce the burden of disease in populations most severely affected by flu  especially among those over age 65. By partnering with organizations and healthcare providers  we can combat complacency among those who may be fatigued by vaccine news  and who may not understand the severe complications of a flu infection that vaccines can help prevent. As a leader in flu vaccines  Sanofi aims to help protect high-risk populations from flu and its related complications. We have a responsibility to help prevent as much flu as possible through vaccination.""Story continuesExperts anticipate a rise in flu cases in the Northern Hemisphere this flu season compared with last year based on the steep rise in cases in the Southern Hemisphere this season.4 Today's panel  composed of chief medical officers of the American Heart Association  the American Diabetes Association  the American Lung Association and the President and CEO of the National Minority Quality Forum  provided insights on the impact of flu in light of a decline in vaccination rates during the 2021-2022 flu season.Gary A. Puckrein  PhDPresident & CEO  National Minority Quality Forum""The economic and health burden of vaccine-preventable influenza on communities of color is clear and access to effective vaccines is essential. The level of disparity in vaccine uptake  particularly among patients of color  points to structural deficits systematically hampering access to influenza vaccination.5""Age can be a factor when it comes to flu-related complications and flu vaccinations can help reduce the burden of disease.6 In a study of influenza vaccine effectiveness in 3 135 adults over 18 during 2012-2015  of adults hospitalized as a result of the flu  vaccinated patients were 59% less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit than those who had not been vaccinated.7 Importantly  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  an advisory body to the CDC  has recognized that certain flu vaccines are potentially more effective for people over 65.8Comorbidities present the risk for added complications  according to the experts. Among adults hospitalized with influenza during recent flu seasons  about half had heart disease.9 In recent seasons  about 30% of adult flu hospitalizations had diabetes and during the 2021-22 flu season  30.6% of flu-related hospitalizations were among adults with chronic lung disease.10 11Eduardo Sanchez  MD  MPH  FAHA  FAAFPChief Medical Officer for Prevention  American Heart Association""Hands down  your best protection from the flu this year comes from the flu shot  which is proven to be practical and cost-effective. Virtually everyone can benefit from the flu shot and that's especially true for people with heart disease and seniors who are more likely to be hospitalized with flu and flu-related complications.2 9 If you're over 65  you should ask about getting the specific flu vaccines this year which may potentially be more effective.""Robert Gabbay  MDChief Science & Medical Officer  American Diabetes Association""People with diabetes are at high risk of serious flu complications  even when well-managed  which can result in flu-related hospitalization and sometimes even flu-related death.10 Preventing flu and its serious complications should be a global public health priority and we aim to encourage vaccinations as we approach the upcoming flu season.""Albert Rizzo  MDChief Medical Officer  American Lung Association""While anyone can get the flu  certain people are at increased risk for developing serious flu complications such as those living with chronic medical conditions including asthma  COPD and other chronic lung diseases.3 The flu can be deadly  which is why we urge all eligible people six months or older to get the flu shot annually.""Participating organizations did not receive compensation for this discussion.

Aug. 12  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Amid signs that a more severe influenza season is approaching in the US  a panel of public health leaders today urged that people get vaccinated in preparation for the upcoming influenza season and warned that patients in high-risk populations tend to suffer significant flu-related health disparities.3The conversation focused on how to increase protection for people over 65 and those with weakened immune systems  including those with chronic conditions such as diabetes  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease. Experts also considered how inequities translate to higher rates of hospitalizations due to the flu among Black Americans and other under-represented communities.1The virtual discussion  hosted by Sanofi with invited media in attendance  was moderated by Michael Greenberg  MD  MPH  North America Medical Head of Vaccines at Sanofi.Michael Greenberg  MD  MPHNorth America Medical Head of Vaccines at Sanofi""We have the tools to help reduce the burden of disease in populations most severely affected by flu  especially among those over age 65. By partnering with organizations and healthcare providers  we can combat complacency among those who may be fatigued by vaccine news  and who may not understand the severe complications of a flu infection that vaccines can help prevent. As a leader in flu vaccines  Sanofi aims to help protect high-risk populations from flu and its related complications. We have a responsibility to help prevent as much flu as possible through vaccination.""Experts anticipate a rise in flu cases in the Northern Hemisphere this flu season compared with last year based on the steep rise in cases in the Southern Hemisphere this season.4 Today's panel  composed of chief medical officers of the American Heart Association  the American Diabetes Association  the American Lung Association and the President and CEO of the National Minority Quality Forum  provided insights on the impact of flu in light of a decline in vaccination rates during the 2021-2022 flu season.Gary A. Puckrein  PhDPresident & CEO  National Minority Quality Forum""The economic and health burden of vaccine-preventable influenza on communities of color is clear and access to effective vaccines is essential. The level of disparity in vaccine uptake  particularly among patients of color  points to structural deficits systematically hampering access to influenza vaccination.5""Age can be a factor when it comes to flu-related complications and flu vaccinations can help reduce the burden of disease.6 In a study of influenza vaccine effectiveness in 3 135 adults over 18 during 2012-2015  of adults hospitalized as a result of the flu  vaccinated patients were 59% less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit than those who had not been vaccinated.7 Importantly  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  an advisory body to the CDC  has recognized that certain flu vaccines are potentially more effective for people over 65.8Comorbidities present the risk for added complications  according to the experts. Among adults hospitalized with influenza during recent flu seasons  about half had heart disease.9 In recent seasons  about 30% of adult flu hospitalizations had diabetes and during the 2021-22 flu season  30.6% of flu-related hospitalizations were among adults with chronic lung disease.10 11Eduardo Sanchez  MD  MPH  FAHA  FAAFPChief Medical Officer for Prevention  American Heart Association""Hands down  your best protection from the flu this year comes from the flu shot  which is proven to be practical and cost-effective. Virtually everyone can benefit from the flu shot and that's especially true for people with heart disease and seniors who are more likely to be hospitalized with flu and flu-related complications.2 9 If you're over 65  you should ask about getting the specific flu vaccines this year which may potentially be more effective.""Robert Gabbay  MDChief Science & Medical Officer  American Diabetes Association""People with diabetes are at high risk of serious flu complications  even when well-managed  which can result in flu-related hospitalization and sometimes even flu-related death.10 Preventing flu and its serious complications should be a global public health priority and we aim to encourage vaccinations as we approach the upcoming flu season.""Albert Rizzo  MDChief Medical Officer  American Lung Association""While anyone can get the flu  certain people are at increased risk for developing serious flu complications such as those living with chronic medical conditions including asthma  COPD and other chronic lung diseases.3 The flu can be deadly  which is why we urge all eligible people six months or older to get the flu shot annually.""Participating organizations did not receive compensation for this discussion.

SETD2 methylates histone as well as non-histone proteins  and this activity is involved in several key biological processes including transcriptional regulation  RNA splicing  and DNA damage repair. Based on the preclinical data on SETD2 inhibition by EZM0414 in multiple settings  including high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma (MM) and in other B-cell malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  the Company is conducting SET-101  a Phase 1/1b study of EZM0414  for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM and DLBCL.ADVERTISEMENTAbout follicular lymphoma 2   3Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) which is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Follicular lymphoma develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally helps fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in the lymph nodes or other body organs. Follicular lymphoma is generally slow growing. Each year  15-20 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Most affected individuals are diagnosed with advanced disease.About epithelioid sarcoma 4Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare  slow-growing type of soft tissue cancer. Most cases begin in the soft tissue under the skin of a finger  hand  forearm  lower leg or foot  though it can start in other areas of the body. Typically  epithelioid sarcoma starts as a small firm growth or lump that is painless. It usually starts out as a single growth  but multiple growths may occur by the time a person seeks medical help. Sometimes this sarcoma appears as ulcers that don’t heal  looking like open wounds over the growths. It is estimated that 13 040 individuals received a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas in the U.S. in 2018 with a corresponding 5 150 deaths. 5ADVERTISEMENTAbout diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 6Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of NHL. NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally help to fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes or other body organs. DLBCL grows quickly and treatment starts soon after diagnosis. DLBCL is the most common type of NHL in the U.S. and worldwide  accounting for about 22 percent of newly diagnosed cases of B-cell NHL in the U.S. More than 18 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with DLBCL each year. 7About multiple myeloma 8Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer characterized by excessive production (proliferation) and improper function of certain cells (plasma cells) found in the bone marrow. Excessive plasma cells may eventually mass together to form a tumor or tumors in various sites of the body  especially the bone marrow. When multiple tumors are present or the bone marrow has greater than 10% plasma cells  the term multiple myeloma is used. In 2019  over 32 000 individuals in the U.S. were diagnosed with this disease. It is believed that approximately 100 000 Americans currently have the disease.About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.comReferences1 US Food and Drug Administration.
