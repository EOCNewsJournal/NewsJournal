Essentially based on increased generation capacities  higher wind and solar performance as well as currently high market prices. Taking into account the increased revenue and earnings figures in the first seven months of 2022  the Management Board of Encavis AG decided already early (compare ad-hoc-news of Aug. 3  2022) to raise the outlook of the operating Key Performance Indicators for the full-year 2022.The Group increased electricity production from Renewable Energy by +17% to around 1 694 gigawatt hours (GWh/previous year: 1 443 GWh) during the first six months of fiscal year 2022. Revenue grew by 40% to EUR 226.4 million (previous year: EUR 162.2 million). This strong growth of more than EUR 64 million has to be split to a good two thirds of to the Groups portfolio to solar parks (a good +43 mln euro) and almost to one third (around +21 mln euro) of wind farms. Revenue increase of the solar parks was mainly driven by the 22% higher electricity production due to capacity increases and the improved weather conditions. Revenue growth of the wind farm portfolio by around 58% is based on the 8% increased production volume of electricity and to the larger extend on the significantly higher electricity prices in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021.Operating earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (operating EBITDA) also increased by 40% to EUR 170.6 million (previous year: EUR 122.3 million) in the first six months of the 2021 financial year. Resulting in an increase of operating earnings before interest and taxes (operating EBIT) of 60% to EUR 109.8 million (previous year: EUR 68.7 million) after six months. Considering the high level of prices for electricity the Group invests into a comprehensive technical optimisation to increase the productivity of its PV asset portfolio. These investments may causes expenses that result in earnings figures which doesnt reflect the additional revenue completely.This ultimately resulted in significantly improved operating earnings per share (EPS) of EUR 0.33 in the first-half of 2022  an increase of 83% compared to the EUR 0.18 operating earnings per share in the same period in 2021.The cash flow from operating activities increased by around 46% to EUR 160.2 million (previous year: EUR 109.4 million).Taking into account the very high volatilty of the prices for electricity the guidance is based on the long- and short-term fixed electricity prices as well as for the smallest part of the revenue on the planning assumptions of end of 2021.

North America is the second largest region. It is estimated to reach an expected value of USD 387 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 6.6%.New York  United States  Aug. 15  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stadium lighting comprises mainly LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) that emit floodlights and are positioned at great heights with narrow beam angles. Due to the increased light intensities produced by these lower beam angles  brilliant light can reach the ground from elevated positions. Using this technology  players can react quickly to the tiny  rapidly moving balls  and the LEDs can withstand thunderstorms and other adverse weather conditions. Stadium lighting is utilized in various indoor and outdoor situations  including parking lots  walkways  football  hockey  and rugby stadiums  high definition television  and ultra-slow-motion technology.As a result of their better energy economy  LED lighting is becoming increasingly popular in stadiums worldwide. The transition from traditional to LED stadium lighting is one of the key growth drivers for the industry. In addition  the declining cost of LED lights is a significant factor driving their growing adoption in stadiums  influencing the growth of the stadium lighting market.Get a Free Sample Copy of This Report https://straitsresearch.com/report/stadium-lighting-market/request-sampleIncreasing Investments in Developing Sports Infrastructure to Drive the Global Stadium Lighting MarketAsia-Pacific governments are boosting their sports infrastructure investments and stadium expansion. The Board of Control hosts international and domestic events for Cricket in India (BCCI)  Indian Premier League (IPL)  New Zealand Cricket  Melbourne Cricket Association  and Sahara Force India using intelligent technologies. In 2017  the government of New South Wales announced the reconstruction of football and Olympic stadiums at approximately $1.53 billion. In addition  stadium administrators are required to regularly examine their existing lighting systems and report their findings to the relevant governing bodies. Consequently  government initiatives in the sports industry also contribute to the growth of the Asia-Pacific stadium lighting market.Story continuesRising Adoption of IoT  Big Data  and Analytics to Provide Opportunities for the Global Stadium Lighting MarketStadium lighting is one of the numerous industries in which IoT is currently finding expanding applications. Even though several wealthy nations have begun adopting this stadium lighting technology  it is uncommon in emerging economies. Therefore  it is anticipated that IoT would generate enormous prospects for the global market for stadium lighting. In addition  integrating IoT with stadium lighting systems is expected to improve stadium infrastructure. This makes lighting systems more autonomous and intelligent concerning data sharing with building automation systems and the cloud. Using embedded sensors and data  for instance  IoT enables stadium-wide automatic lighting modifications based on seat occupancy  conserving energy and reducing operational costs. The use of IoT for stadium lighting is still in its infancy  but the potential presented by the proposed solution is encouraging.Report ScopeReport Metric Details Market Size USD 1.41 Billion by 2030 CAGR 8.7% (2020-2030) Historical Data 2019-2020 Base Year 2021 Forecast Period 2022-2030 Forecast Units Value (USD Billion) Report Coverage Revenue Forecast  Competitive Landscape  Growth Factors  and Trends Segments Covered Light Source  Application  Sport Type and Region Geographies Covered North America  Europe  Asia-Pacific  LAME and Rest of the World Key Companies Profiled/Vendors Signify Holding  Musco Sports Lighting LLC.

The market expansion is attributable to the government's rising spending on efficient lighting services. In addition  nations such as Germany  Russia  the United Kingdom  and Denmark are focused on deploying energy-efficient lighting to improve illumination quality and lower overall operational costs  which is predicted to increase demand for LED lighting products and solutions. The UEFA European Football Championship is held every four years throughout Europe. The goal of stadium owners is to immerse football spectators in the atmosphere of the sporting event. To accomplish the same  stadium owners cannot ignore the benefits that high-performance and realistic lighting may provide. LEDs are replacing high-intensity discharge lamps  traditionally used in stadium lighting  with more inventive and adaptable lighting systems. Therefore  increasing sports activities in Europe are anticipated to promote the market expansion for stadium lighting.North America is the second largest region. It is estimated to reach an expected value of USD 387 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 6.6%. North American consumers' growing embrace of technical advances is the key factor driving market expansion. According to estimates  there are now roughly 244 stadiums in the United States. The U.S. industry constructs  modify  and renovates sports stadiums and arenas to enhance audience hospitality. This region's demand is mainly driven by educational institutions and commercial sports organizations  such as leagues and sports franchises. The lighting system attracts spectators  compelling stadium owners to implement innovative lighting techniques. These factors lead to the expansion of the market.The Asia Pacific Is the fastest growing region. India hosted several international athletic events  including the cricket world cup  the Asian games  the commonwealth games  and the FIFA under-17 world cup.
