North America is the second largest region. It is estimated to reach an expected value of USD 387 million by 2030 at a CAGR of 6.6%.New York  United States  Aug. 15  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stadium lighting comprises mainly LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) that emit floodlights and are positioned at great heights with narrow beam angles. Due to the increased light intensities produced by these lower beam angles  brilliant light can reach the ground from elevated positions. Using this technology  players can react quickly to the tiny  rapidly moving balls  and the LEDs can withstand thunderstorms and other adverse weather conditions. Stadium lighting is utilized in various indoor and outdoor situations  including parking lots  walkways  football  hockey  and rugby stadiums  high definition television  and ultra-slow-motion technology.As a result of their better energy economy  LED lighting is becoming increasingly popular in stadiums worldwide. The transition from traditional to LED stadium lighting is one of the key growth drivers for the industry. In addition  the declining cost of LED lights is a significant factor driving their growing adoption in stadiums  influencing the growth of the stadium lighting market.Get a Free Sample Copy of This Report https://straitsresearch.com/report/stadium-lighting-market/request-sampleIncreasing Investments in Developing Sports Infrastructure to Drive the Global Stadium Lighting MarketAsia-Pacific governments are boosting their sports infrastructure investments and stadium expansion. The Board of Control hosts international and domestic events for Cricket in India (BCCI)  Indian Premier League (IPL)  New Zealand Cricket  Melbourne Cricket Association  and Sahara Force India using intelligent technologies. In 2017  the government of New South Wales announced the reconstruction of football and Olympic stadiums at approximately $1.53 billion. In addition  stadium administrators are required to regularly examine their existing lighting systems and report their findings to the relevant governing bodies. Consequently  government initiatives in the sports industry also contribute to the growth of the Asia-Pacific stadium lighting market.Story continuesRising Adoption of IoT  Big Data  and Analytics to Provide Opportunities for the Global Stadium Lighting MarketStadium lighting is one of the numerous industries in which IoT is currently finding expanding applications. Even though several wealthy nations have begun adopting this stadium lighting technology  it is uncommon in emerging economies. Therefore  it is anticipated that IoT would generate enormous prospects for the global market for stadium lighting. In addition  integrating IoT with stadium lighting systems is expected to improve stadium infrastructure. This makes lighting systems more autonomous and intelligent concerning data sharing with building automation systems and the cloud. Using embedded sensors and data  for instance  IoT enables stadium-wide automatic lighting modifications based on seat occupancy  conserving energy and reducing operational costs. The use of IoT for stadium lighting is still in its infancy  but the potential presented by the proposed solution is encouraging.Report ScopeReport Metric Details Market Size USD 1.41 Billion by 2030 CAGR 8.7% (2020-2030) Historical Data 2019-2020 Base Year 2021 Forecast Period 2022-2030 Forecast Units Value (USD Billion) Report Coverage Revenue Forecast  Competitive Landscape  Growth Factors  and Trends Segments Covered Light Source  Application  Sport Type and Region Geographies Covered North America  Europe  Asia-Pacific  LAME and Rest of the World Key Companies Profiled/Vendors Signify Holding  Musco Sports Lighting LLC.

This strategic rapprochement ope…,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Phytocann Group  a vertically integrated company and European CBD pioneer  is proud to announce a partnership with Pharmasimple  a company listed on Euronext Growth Paris and industry leader in Belgium. This strategic rapprochement opens up a new era for the distribution of cannabic products in pharmacies.Phytocann Group is delighted to acquire a 5% stake in Pharmasimple for the sum of 5 million euros. Beyond the additional skills and expertise  this increase in capital lays the foundations for a medium-term IPO.The research and development component is also particularly important. New ranges and the launch of new products are already being explored by the two entities. As a long-standing online pharmacy leader  Pharmasimple has been undergoing a business transformation for several months by diversifying its network of physical pharmacies. Having set itself the goal of 200 by 2025  14 are already open and 15 are scheduled to open in 2022.This strategic partnership will lead to the introduction of a range of unique products dedicated to Pharmasimple  including CBD oils and cosmetics. It should be noted that the brands belonging to Phytocann Group (Harvest Laboratoires  Ivory  Easy Weed  Herboristerie Alexandra etc.) will be distributed both in shops and on the Pharmasimple website.As online sales of CBD are of crucial importance to Phytocann Group  this partnership will enable us to create shared synergies and thus to step up and expand our online presence. Always striving to create and offer outstanding products  research and tests are being carried out on new product innovations based on CBD and other non-psychotropic cannabinoids.This capital acquisition takes advantage of the best possible timing regarding the expansion of Phytocann Group and the opening up of the medicinal cannabis market in Europe  a sign of real added value for Pharmasimple.Distribution in pharmacies and drugstores was a major challenge. This also strengthens the positioning and the DNA of a 100% vertically integrated group  from production to sales.If you would like any further information or an interview with a leader of Phytocann Group  don’t hesitate to contact the press office: sbotton@stepconseil.comThe original source-language text of this announcement is the official  authoritative version.
