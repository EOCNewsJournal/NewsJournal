This strategic rapprochement opens up a new era for the distribution of cannabic products in pharmacies.Pharmasimple is delighted to acquire a 5% equity stake in Phytocann Group for the sum of 5 million euros. Beyond the additional skills and expertise  this increase in capital lays the foundations for a medium-term IPO.The research and development component is also particularly important. New ranges and the launch of new products are already being explored by the two entities. As a long-standing online pharmacy leader  Pharmasimple has been undergoing a business transformation for several months by diversifying its network of physical pharmacies. Having set itself the goal of 200 by 2025  14 are already open and 15 are scheduled to open in 2022.This strategic partnership will lead to the introduction of a range of unique products dedicated to Pharmasimple  including CBD oils and cosmetics. It should be noted that the brands belonging to Phytocann Group (Harvest Laboratoires  Ivory  Easy Weed  Herboristerie Alexandra etc.) will be distributed both in shops and on the Pharmasimple website.As online sales of CBD are of crucial importance to Phytocann Group  this partnership will enable us to create shared synergies and thus to step up and expand our online presence.

Payment will be made entirely in cash  financed with the Group's cash and partially through a bank loan for a total of 90 million euros. Completion of this operation is subject to the finalization of the bank financing contract.One of the world leaders in HLA typing for graft compatibilityFounded in 2005 in Utrecht  the Netherlands  GenDx specializes in the molecular diagnostics of transplants by HLA typing of organs or patients as part of the evaluation of compatibility between donors and recipients. Among others  it is one of the pioneers of typing based on genomic sequencing (SBT or Sequencing Based Typing) for which it currently offers high-resolution solutions based on the most recent NGS2 technologies.Story continuesGenDx develops and markets a complete family of products which includes:- reagents for performing HLA typing by sequencing;- software for analyzing sequencing results  customized for different sequencing techniques and platforms;- training modules  facilitating the adoption of its solutions by its customers.The company has more than 80 employees  mainly based in the Netherlands  including a sales force present in Benelux  Germany and the USA. In 2021  GenDx generated €17 million in revenue  for €6.9 million in EBITDA. During the first half of 2022  GenDx's revenue is estimated at €11.2 million  for €5.4 million of EBITDA3.An acquisition with strong potential for growth and value creationIn 2021  transplantation diagnostics accounted for 23.8% of Eurobio Scientific Group's (the “Group”) non-COVID revenue  i.e. 20 million euros. The acquisition of GenDx should enable the consolidation of the Group's presence in this specialty and generate new international development synergies.The main synergies linked to this acquisition are:- a strong complementarity of transplantation activities: Eurobio Scientific is currently only a distributor in France where GenDx has no direct presence;- R&D complementarity: GenDx supplements the Group's scientific and technical expertise with significant know-how in HLA and NGS within teams operating in a center of excellence in Utrecht;- GenDx's technological advance in the digitization of diagnostics  through algorithms and software developed by its bioinformatics specialists;- an extension of the international commercial presence by the direct presence of GenDx in the Netherlands  Germany and North America where it will supplement the local capacities of Eurobio Scientific  and by its distributors in the rest of Europe  Asia and the rest of the world.Given the characteristics of GenDx  the strong complementarity between the two groups  and the many synergies identified  the valuation of this transaction is in line with those of recent acquisitions involving similar assets in the field of medical diagnostics.Better access to care and advances in medicine are resulting in a growing demand for transplants. However  this is hampered by the availability of organs to be transplanted. A precise and rapid diagnosis  making it possible to increase the success rate of these surgeries  promotes a better balance between supply and demand. The transplant diagnostics market is therefore growing rapidly  and the technological and commercial strength of the new entity resulting from the merger of Eurobio Scientific and GenDx  should make it a leading player.Denis Fortier  Deputy Managing Director and co-CEO of Eurobio Scientific  Chairman of EurobioNext  declares: ""This operation is transformative for Eurobio Scientific and is fully in line with the development strategy that we have been successfully pursuing for several years and which is based on a direct presence in Europe and an increase in the share of proprietary products. The strong complementarity between our two groups should make it possible to increase the advance of our Group both technologically  geographically and commercially”.Hervé Duchesne de Lamotte  Deputy Managing Director and CFO of Eurobio Scientific  adds: ""This merger  which has the support of our financial partners  will allow Eurobio Scientific to significantly increase the share of proprietary products in its turnover and therefore its profitability. The size of the financing associated with this transaction also gives Eurobio Scientific the means to steadily pursue the development of the Group”.“We are particularly proud of this acquisition of GenDx which will further strengthen the added value of Eurobio Scientific's innovation. It is the fruit of historical relations between Denis Fortier and Wietse Mulder  two entrepreneurs who share the same vision of the development of their business. We are convinced that GenDx will play an important role in the development of Eurobio Scientific around NGS technology as well as on the two challenges of the future which are preventive medicine and smart health”  comments Arthur Vigneras  Investment Director with NextStage AM.Wietse Mulder  CEO and co-founder of GenDx  adds “For GenDx it was important to get closer to a group led by entrepreneurs. Eurobio Scientific  through its demonstrated agility during the COVID crisis and its complementarity with our activities  quickly appeared to us as the best partner to ensure the continued development of transplantation activities  while strengthening the technological base of our new Group. On a more personal note  I am delighted to join this new group and enable the creation of a leading player in the field of molecular diagnostics in Europe ”.Cash and bank loan financingThe acquisition will be financed in part by the Group's own cash and in part by a loan from a syndicate bringing together the Group's banks  in particular LCL  BNP  Crédit Agricole Ile de France  BRED and CIC. The loan will be for a total amount of 90 million euros. It will be amortized half-yearly over a period of six years for 63 million euros  and will be repayable in fine at the end of the seventh year for 27 million euros. The interest rate will be EURIBOR4 plus a margin varying according to certain financial ratios and ranging between 0.9 and 1.6% for the amortized tranche  and between 1.75 and 2.45% for the in fine tranche. A portion of this loan will be used to repay the outstanding balance of the March 2020 syndicated loan  for approximately €4.5 million.The final completion of the acquisition is subject to the legal finalization of the agreement with the banks  which will include the usual covenants for this type of transaction  the respective committees having already given their agreements. It should take place by mid-October.List of participants in the transactionEurobio Scientific: Denis Fortier (Deputy Managing Director  co-CEO) and Hervé Duchesne de Lamotte (Deputy Managing Director  CFO)  Jean-Michel Carle (President and CEO)NextStage AM: Grégoire Sentilhes (Co-founder  Chairman and CEO)  Arthur Vignéras (Investment Director) and Emilio Johnston (Associate)M&A Buyside Advisor: Rothschild & Co.

Sanofi is discontinuing the global clinical development program...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeSanofi provides update on amcenestrant clinical development programPARIS  August 17  2022. Sanofi is discontinuing the global clinical development program of amcenestrant  an investigational oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). The decision is based on the outcome of a prespecified interim analysis of the Phase 3 AMEERA-5 trial evaluating amcenestrant in combination with palbociclib compared with letrozole in combination with palbociclib in patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer.An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) found that amcenestrant in combination with palbociclib did not meet the prespecified boundary for continuation in comparison with the control arm and recommended stopping the trial. No new safety signals were observed. Trial participants will be transitioned to letrozole in combination with palbociclib or another appropriate standard of care therapy  as determined by their physician.The company will continue to review the data and plans to share the results with the scientific community in the future. All other studies of amcenestrant  including in early-stage breast cancer (AMEERA-6)  will be discontinued.John Reed  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Research and Development at Sanofi“While we are disappointed by this outcome  our research will further the scientific understanding of endocrine therapies in people with breast cancer. Our sincere gratitude goes to the patients  families and healthcare professionals involved in the amcenestrant clinical development program. Oncology remains a priority area for Sanofi  and we will continue to pursue transformative research to develop new medicines for people living with cancer.”In March  Sanofi announced that the Phase 2 AMEERA-3 trial had not met the primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Story continuesAbout AMEERA-5AMEERA-5 is a randomized  double-blind Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of amcenestrant in combination with palbociclib  a CDK4/6 inhibitor  in the first-line treatment of patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. A total of 1068 patients who had not received any prior systemic anticancer therapies for advanced disease were randomized 1:1 to receive either amcenestrant or letrozole in combination with palbociclib.About AMEERA-6AMEERA-6 is a randomized  double-blind Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of amcenestrant compared with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer who have discontinued adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy due to treatment related toxicity. The trial was initiated in partnership with the Breast International Group (BIG)  the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)  and the Alliance Foundation Trials (AFT).About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

EBITDA increased 28%  resulting in a 30% increase in profit after tax  and giving us confidence to increase our interim dividend to USc10.98 per share. This represents a 51% increase compared to last year’s interim dividend  benefitting from the share buy-back completed in December 2021.After a challenging first five months of the year  production improved in late May and this has continued for the 12 weeks since then. At this run rate  we remain on track to achieve guidance  albeit at the bottom of the range.We ended the first half of the year with a robust balance sheet  having reduced net debt by $17.3 million.

Listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Euronext Dublin  Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine in Mozambique. Moma’s production accounts for approximately 8% of global titanium feedstocks and the Group supplies to customers in more than 15 countries. Kenmare produces raw materials that are ultimately consumed in everyday quality-of life items such as paints  plastics and ceramic tiles.All monetary amounts refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.Forward Looking StatementsThis announcement contains some forward-looking statements that represent Kenmare's expectations for its business  based on current expectations about future events  which by their nature involve risks and uncertainties. Kenmare believes that its expectations and assumptions with respect to these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However  because they involve risk and uncertainty  which are in some cases beyond Kenmare's control  actual results or performance may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information.INTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORTGroup resultsOperational and financial results for H1 2022 were as follows:H12022 H12021 % Change Production (tonnes) HMC produced 738 300 798 500 -8% HMC processed 740 600 814 400 -9% Finished products production Ilmenite 499 700 559 000 -11% Primary zircon 26 500 28 200 -6% Rutile 4 000 4 200 -5% Concentrates2 20 500 20 700 -1% Total finished products 550 700 612 100 -10% Financials Revenue ($ million) 197.3 178.2 11% Freight ($ million) 15.2 10.4 46% Revenue FOB ($ million)1 182.1 167.8 9% Finished products shipped (tonnes)1 424 300 594 100 -29% Average price received (FOB) per tonne ($/t) 429 282 52% Total operating costs ($ million)3 122.3 119.5 2% Total cash operating costs ($ million)4 101.2 87.3 16% Cash operating cost per tonne of finished product ($/t)1 184 143 29% Cash operating cost per tonne of ilmenite (net of co-products) ($/t)1 105 113 -7% EBITDA ($ million)1 105.5 82.3 28% Profit before tax ($ million) 68.6 50.6 36% Profit after tax ($ million) 62.5 48.0 30%NotesAdditional information in relation to Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”) is disclosed in the Glossary. Concentrates includes secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate. Total operating costs consists of cost of sales and other operating costs as reported in the income statement. Included in operating costs are depreciation and amortisation. Total cash costs consists of total operating costs less freight and non-cash costs  including inventory movements.OperationsKenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR was 0.00 per 200 000 hours worked to 30 June 2022 (30 June 2021: 0.14)  with zero Lost Time Injuries recorded during the first half of the year. The Company is focused on maintaining its strongest ever safety performance  with more than 18 months since the last Lost Time Injury.During H1 2022  Kenmare mined 19.5 million tonnes of ore at an average ore grade of 4.35%. Excavated ore tonnes decreased by 2% compared to H1 2021 (19.9 million tonnes) and ore grades decreased by 7% (H1 2021: 4.67%).HMC production in H1 2022 was impacted by increased slimes levels during Q2  most significantly at WCP A  and compounded by two tropical storms passing close to Moma in Q1.A tight turn in WCP A’s mine path in 2021 led to reduced space for the plant’s slimes settling paddocks  which are necessary for slimes management. To increase paddock settling capacity  Kenmare reduced high grade supplemental dry mining in H1 2022 and increased dredge mining  therefore negatively impacting ore grades. Normal dry mining operations resumed in June as pond slimes levels had been stabilised  resulting in increased HMC production  and these production improvements have been maintained in the first six weeks of Q3 2022.As stated in the Q2 and H1 2022 Production Update  as part of the PFS  WCP A is expected to have a desliming circuit installed to more efficiently mine the Nataka ore zone. A cost-benefit analysis is being conducted to investigate the acceleration of the installation of the desliming circuit ahead of the move. This has the potential to increase the effective capacity of WCP A and better mitigate against the slimes levels at the end of the Namalope mine path.Production of all finished products decreased by 10% to 550 700 tonnes in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021 (612 100 tonnes)  broadly in line with the 9% reduction in HMC processed.Ilmenite production was 499 700 tonnes  an 11% decrease compared to H1 2021 (559 000 tonnes)  due primarily to the reduction in HMC processed and slightly exacerbated by reduced HMC quality. Primary zircon production was 26 500 tonnes  a 6% decrease compared to H1 2021 (28 200 tonnes) and rutile production was 4 000 tonnes  a decrease of 4% compared to H1 2021 (4 200 tonnes). Concentrates production was 20 500 tonnes  a 1% decrease compared to H1 2021 (20 700 tonnes). For primary zircon and rutile  the reduction in HMC processed was partially offset by improved recoveries. Concentrates production was less impacted by reduced HMC processed due to the draw of intermediate stockpiles.Following robust production between late May and mid-August  the Company is still expected to achieve the bottom of 2022 production guidance for all finished products.Kenmare shipped 424 300 tonnes of finished products during the period  a 29% decrease compared to H1 2021 (594 100 tonnes). This was due primarily to poorer weather conditions and reduced shipping capacity in Q2  as the Bronagh J transshipment vessel left site in early May 2022 for its five-yearly dry dock maintenance work. This reduction will continue during Q3 until the Bronagh J returns to service  which is expected in August. However  there will be sufficient capacity to catch up when both transshipment vessels are operating  with finished product inventories expected to return to normal levels during H1 2023.In H1 2022 shipments comprised 382 200 tonnes of ilmenite  20 500 tonnes of primary zircon  4 800 tonnes of rutile and 16 800 tonnes of concentrates.Closing stock of HMC at the end of H1 2022 was 9 200 tonnes  compared with 11 600 tonnes at the end of 2021  due to a drawdown of HMC stockpiles during the period to compensate for reduced HMC production. Closing stock of finished products at the end of H1 2022 was 214 900 tonnes  compared to 88 700 tonnes at the end of 2021  reflecting the lower shipping capacity.Capital projectsIn May 2022  the Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply project completed its commissioning phase and began operation. The objective of the RUPS is to improve power stability at the Mineral Separation Plant and make a significant contribution to Kenmare’s goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 12% by 2024. Since becoming operational  the RUPS has proved successful at mitigating electrical supply disruptions in accordance with this objective. The capital cost of the RUPS is estimated to be $20 million  up slightly from the previous estimate of approximately $18 million.Work is continuing on the PFS for the Nataka ore zone  where WCP A is expected to commence mining in 2025. Some elements of the PFS are significantly advanced so work towards the Definitive Feasibility Study has commenced in those areas. Other results have led Kenmare to continue to conduct further investigations at PFS level and some important capital decisions  like mining method  are yet to be finalised. The hydromining trial conducted in Namalope and Nataka was successful and is contributing to the work to optimise mining at Nataka. The PFS is expected to be completed later in 2022  with an update provided in early 2023. Initial estimates suggest that the capital cost of the move is not likely to be less than $225 million.Market updateDemand for titanium feedstocks and zircon strengthened throughout H1 2022  which allowed Kenmare to achieve consecutive prices increases in Q1 and Q2 and a record average received price of $429 per tonne for H1. Positive market fundamentals have continued into Q3 2022.Global demand for ilmenite grew further during the half year due to robust downstream demand for titanium pigment  with pigment producers continuing to operate at high utilisation rates  particularly outside of China. In Q2  economic activity in China was impacted by several city-wide COVID-19 related lockdowns  which reduced demand for titanium pigment and therefore ilmenite. Despite this  chloride pigment production continued to increase in China  resulting in growing demand for ilmenite of Kenmare’s quality.Global production of titanium feedstocks expanded in H1  although it remained insufficient to meet demand. Pigment production was therefore constrained by feedstock availability and low inventories. Despite the tight supply of titanium feedstocks  major new projects are making limited progress  which may constrain ilmenite supply over the medium term.Notwithstanding recent uncertainty regarding the outlook for global growth  demand from our customers remains robust and inventories remain below normal levels in the supply chain. As a result  pricing momentum for ilmenite has continued into Q3 and Kenmare’s order book for H2 is strong. However  demand for ilmenite is linked to global economic growth and market forecasts for world GDP have been reducing.The zircon market tightened further in H1 2022 as inventories in the global supply chain were largely drawn down in 2021. Demand has been strong in all major regions except China  which was also impacted by severe COVID-19-related lockdowns. With no significant new supply entering the market  zircon remains in short supply and prices increased throughout H1 2022. Tight market conditions for zircon have continued into Q3 2022.Financial reviewIn H1 2022  Kenmare delivered a strong financial performance  generating a 9% increase in revenue (FOB) to $182.1 million (H1 2021: $167.8 million) and a 28% increase in EBITDA to $105.5 million (H1 2021: $82.3 million). Record first half revenues and profits were supported by robust markets for all finished products.Kenmare’s balance sheet strengthened during the period  with net debt reducing by $17.3 million to $65.5 million (31 December 2021: $82.8 million)  after paying the $24.1 million 2021 final dividend. The Company is targeting a full year dividend payout ratio of 25% of profit after tax for 2022  subject to prevailing product market and other conditions  and is pleased to announce a 2022 interim dividend of USc10.98 (H1 2021: USc7.29) per share. This represents a 51% increase compared to the 2021 interim dividend  benefitting from the share buy-back completed in December 2021.RevenueRevenue (FOB) increased by 9% in H1 2022 to $182.1 million (H1 2021: $167.8 million)  driven by a 52% increase in the average received price (FOB) to $429 per tonne (H1 2021: $282 per tonne). This average received price (FOB) represents a new half-yearly company record. It was due to both price increases for individual products and a change in product mix  with an increased proportion of higher value products (primary zircon and rutile) sold relative to H1 2021. The increase in revenue was despite a 29% reduction in shipments.Freight costs in H1 2022 increased to $15.2 million (H1 2021: $10.4 million)  reflecting a tighter freight market due to strong global demand for commodities.Ilmenite revenue (FOB) decreased by 7% to $133.5 million in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $143.9 million)  as a result of a 32% decrease in ilmenite shipment volumes  offset by a 36% price increase to $349 per tonne (H1 2021: $256 per tonne). Primary zircon revenue (FOB) increased by 69% to $32.5 million (H1 2021: $19.2 million) due to an 11% increase in primary zircon shipment volumes and a 52% price increase.Operating costsTotal operating costs in H1 2022 were $122.3 million  a 2% increase compared to H1 2021 ($119.5 million). Costs reflect increased depreciation of $30.5 million  up 30% (H1 2021: $23.5 million)  due to asset additions in the 12 month period to the end of June 2022  and amended depreciation rates on certain assets  offset by reduced depreciation on assets depreciated on a unit of production basis  as a result of lower HMC production in the period. However  a $27.8 million increase of finished product inventory  due to reduced shipping capacity  decreased total operating costs for the period. The increased finished product inventory is expected to unwind as product shipments normalise in H1 2023.Total cash operating costs were $101.2 million  a 16% increase compared to H1 2021 ($87.3 million). This was due primarily to general inflationary increases and higher mining royalties and processing taxes due to increased sales and pricing. Combined with a 10% decrease in production of finished products  this resulted in a 29% increase in cash operating costs per tonne of finished product to $184 per tonne in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $143 per tonne). Cash operating cost per tonne of ilmenite decreased by 7% to $105 per tonne as a result of higher co-product revenues and a favourable product mix.Finance income and costsKenmare recognised finance income of $0.08 million in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $0.04 million)  consisting of interest on bank deposits. Finance costs were $5.7 million in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $6.1 million)  including loan interest of $4.4 million (H1 2021: $4.9 million). The decrease in loan interest year-on-year reflects the lower principal outstanding following the commencement of principal repayments in H1 2022  offset by higher US LIBOR interest rates. Factoring and other fees were $0.7 million in the period (H1 2021: $0.8 million) and the unwinding of the mine closure provision amounted to $0.4 million (H1 2021: $0.4 million). Commitment fees under the debt facilities were $0.2 million ($0.02 million) and lease interest was $0.1 million (H1 2021: $0.1 million).TaxThe tax charge for H1 2022 amounted to $6.1 million (H1 2021: $2.6 million). Kenmare’s subsidiary  Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited  had taxable profits of $16.1 million (H1 2021: $6.6 million)  resulting in an income tax charge of $5.6 million (H1 2021: $2.3 million). Kenmare Resources plc incurred a tax charge of $0.5 million (H1 2020: $0.3 million).Cash flowsNet cash from operations in H1 2022 was $66.8 million (H1 2021: $33.2 million)  reflecting higher profitability. Working capital movement of $28.6 million (H1 2021: $42.4 million) reflects primarily increased finished product inventories as a result of decreased shipments during the period.Investing activities of $24.2 million (H1 2021: $31.8 million) represented additions to property  plant and equipment. $55.7 million of debt repayments were made (H1 2021: $20.0 million) and a final dividend for 2021 of $24.1 million (H1 2020: $8.5 million) was paid in May 2022. Lease repayments of $0.6 million (H1 2021: $0.5 million) were also paid in the period.Consequently  Kenmare finished H1 2022 with $30.7 million of cash and cash equivalents  representing a decrease of $38.4 million compared to year-end 2021 ($69.1 million).Balance sheetIn H1 2022 there were additions to property  plant and equipment of $24.2 million (H1 2021: $31.8 million). Additions consisted of $5.4 million development expenditure  $4.6 million in relation to preparing for the relocation of WCP A to the Nataka ore zone  $3.0 million in relation to the Namalope West resettlement plan and $11.2 million in relation to sustaining capital.As stated above  depreciation of $30.5 million  was up 30% (H1 2021: $23.5 million). The mine closure provision asset was reduced by $13.5 million in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $2.2 million). This was due to an increase in the discount rate used to estimate the closure cost provision from 2.1% to 3.2%.The Group conducted an impairment review of property  plant and equipment at the period-end and the key assumptions of this review are set out in Note 9 of the financial statements. No impairment provision is required as a result of this review.Inventory at period-end amounted to $91.2 million (31 December 2021: $60.2 million)  consisting of intermediate and finished mineral products of $49.9 million (31 December 2021: $22.0 million) and consumables and spares of $41.4 million (31 December 2021: $38.2 million). As anticipated  the Group carried a higher level of mineral product inventory at period-end due to reduced shipment capacity as a result of the Bronagh J dry dock.Trade and other receivables amounted to $67.8 million (31 December 2021: $74.7 million). This was comprised of $50.6 million (31 December 2021: $66.2 million) of trade receivables from the sale of mineral products  $14.6 million (31 December 2021: $7.8 million) of supplier prepayments and other miscellaneous debtors  and $2.6 million (31 December 2021: $0.8 million) of VAT receivable. Trade receivables are a function of shipments made before period-end and credit terms specific to the relevant customer. There have been no credit impairments during the period. An expected credit loss of $0.2 million (H1 2021: $0.1 million) was recognised during the period.Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $38.4 million in the period and at 30 June 2022 amounted to $30.7 million (31 December 2021: $69.1 million).Lease liabilities amounted to $1.7 million (31 December 2021: $2.2 million) at period-end.Tax liabilities amounted to $4.4 million (31 December 2021: $4.8 million) and trade and other payables amounted to $28.5 million at period-end (31 December 2021: $32.8 million). The decrease in trade and other payables is due to the reduction in expenditure incurred with suppliers for development projects.Debt facilitiesAt the start of 2022  Kenmare’s debt facilities comprised a $110 million Term Loan Facility and a $40 million RCF. The RCF was repaid in full during the period and remains available to be redrawn by the Group if needed. The first semi-annual principal repayment ($15.7 million) under the Term Loan Facility was paid in March 2022.At period-end  reported debt amounted to $93.2 million (31 December 2021: $148.1 million). This consists of the Term Loan Facility of $94.3 million  loan interest and amortisation of $1.8 million  net of transaction costs of $2.9 million. The Group is in compliance with all debt covenants as at 30 June 2022.On 20 July 2022  the RCF was extended for a year and has a final maturity date of 11 December 2023  extendable by up to a further 12 months at the lenders’ discretion. Current interest on the RCF is at LIBOR plus 5.00% per annum reducing to 4.25% from 11 December 2022.Financial outlookKenmare’s strategic priorities are to operate responsibly  deliver long-life  low-cost production  and to allocate capital efficiently  including developing accretive growth opportunities. The Group is focused on maintaining a robust and flexible balance sheet to enable it to deliver all of these goals  particularly to fund its capital investment requirements and to continue to make compelling shareholder returns.Kenmare will continue to manage its operating cost base in a conservative and sustainable manner  cognisant of inflationary pressures and other risks that face its business  in order to minimise unit costs. With supportive product markets and elevated production levels  Kenmare continues to target a first quartile position on the industry revenue to cost curve. This provides the business with increased cash flow stability and the ability to remain cash flow positive throughout the market cycle.Based on a positive market outlook we expect strong financial performance in H2  with the balance sheet continuing to strengthen.Interim dividendKenmare generated record first half profit after tax of $62.5 million in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $48.0 million). The Board has therefore approved an interim 2022 dividend of USc10.98 per share (H1 2021: USc7.29)  for a total distribution of $10.4 million (H1 2021: $8.0 million). The 2022 interim dividend has been calculated as 66.6% of 25% of H1 2022 profit after tax ($62.5 million)  in line with the intention to target a one-third/two-thirds interim/final dividend split. The financial statements do not reflect this interim dividend.The Company will pay the interim dividend on 21 October 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 23 September 2022. Irish Dividend Withholding Tax (25%) must be deducted from dividends paid by the Company  unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed exemption form to the Company’s Registrar.The dividend timetable is as follows:Announcement of interim dividend 17 August 2022 Ex-Dividend Date 22 September 2022 Record Date 23 September 2022 Currency election cut-off date 27 September 2022 Payment Date 21 October 2022Principal risks and uncertaintiesThere are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on Kenmare’s performance over the remaining six months of the 2022 financial year and which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historic results.These principal risks and uncertainties are disclosed in Kenmare’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2021. A detailed explanation of these principal risks and uncertainties and how Kenmare seeks to mitigate these risks  can be found on pages 64 to 71 of the Annual Report 2021 under the following headings: grant and maintenance of licences  country risk  geotechnical risk  severe weather events  uncertainty over physical characteristics of the orebody  power supply and transmission risk  asset damage or loss  COVID-19  health  safety and environment  mineral resource statement risk  IT security risk  development project risk  industry cyclicality  customer concentration  foreign currency risk and aggressive cost inflation.In addition  Kenmare believes that the risks relating to global geo-political developments  which were identified as emerging risks in the Annual Report 2021  are increasing. Whilst the conflict in Ukraine was specifically identified as an emerging risk with potentially broad effect on Kenmare’s business  geo-political developments elsewhere  such as tensions between China and the USA and/or Taiwan  could also affect Kenmare’s business (for example  the ability to transport product to China). In addition  whether as a result of geo-political developments or otherwise  supply chain risks have increased  such that the ability of the Company to carry out capital projects may be affected both in relation to the timing of those projects and the costs entailed; supply chain issues may also affect the availability of critical spare parts and  in consequence of longer lead times  capital commitments may have to be brought forward.Related party transactionsThere have been no material changes in the related party transactions affecting the financial position or the performance of the Group in the period since publication of the 2021 Annual Report other than those disclosed in Note 22 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.Going concernAs stated in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements  based on the Group’s forecasts and projections  the Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future  a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly  they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.Events after the Statement of Financial Position DateInterim dividendAn interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2022 of USc10.98 per share was approved by the Board on 16 August 2022. The dividend payable of $10.4 million has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. The interim dividend is payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 23 September 2022.There have been no other significant events since 30 June 2022 that would have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group.Forward-looking statementsThis report contains certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them up to the time of their approval of this report  and such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties  including both economic and business risk factors  underlying any such forward-looking information.On behalf of the Board M. CARVILLDirector16 August 2022T. MCCLUSKEYDirector16 August 2022Independent Review Report to Kenmare Resources plc (“the Entity”)ConclusionWe have been engaged by the Entity to review the Entity’s condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2022 which comprises the condensed consolidated interim income statement  the condensed consolidated interim statement of other comprehensive income  the condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position  the condensed consolidated interim statement of cash flows  the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in equity  a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.Based on our review  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2022 is not prepared  in all material respects in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”) as adopted by the EU and the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (“Transparency Directive”)  and the Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) Rules 2019 (“Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland).Basis for conclusionWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (“ISRE (Ireland) 2410”) issued for use in Ireland. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries  primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters  and applying analytical and other review procedures.A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly  we do not express an audit opinion.We read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report to identify material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of consolidated financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on  or materially inconsistent with  the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the review. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.Conclusions relating to going concernBased on our review procedures  which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting  or that the Directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that have not been appropriately disclosed.This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (Ireland) 2410. However  future events or conditions may cause the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern  and the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Entity will continue in operation.Directors’ responsibilitiesThe half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of  and has been approved by  the Directors. The Directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland.The Directors are responsible for preparing the condensed set of consolidated financial statements included in the half-yearly financial report in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU.As disclosed in note 1  the annual financial statements of the Entity for the year ended 31 December 2021 are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.In preparing the condensed set of consolidated financial statements  the Directors are responsible for assessing the Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern  disclosing  as applicable  matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Entity or to cease operations  or have no realistic alternative but to do so.Our responsibilityOur responsibility is to express to the Entity a conclusion on the condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.Our conclusion  including our conclusions relating to going concern  are based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures  as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report.The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilitiesThis report is made solely to the Entity in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the Entity in meeting the requirements of the Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland. Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Entity those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law  we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Entity for our review work  for this report  or for the conclusions we have reached.Keith WattKPMG16 August 2022Chartered Accountants1 Stokes PlaceSt.Stephen’s GreenDublin 2Group condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive incomeFor the financial period ended 30 June 2022Notes Unaudited6 Months30 June 2022$’000 Unaudited6 Months30 June 2021$’000 Revenue 2 197 294 178 249 Cost of sales 4 (95 236) (100 330) Gross profit 102 058 77 919 Other operating costs 5 (27 082) (19 159) Operating profit 74 976 58 760 Finance income 89 40 Finance costs 6 (5 724) (6 143) Foreign exchange (704) (2 014) Profit before tax 68 637 50 643 Income tax expense 7 (6 098) (2 619) Profit for the financial period and total comprehensive income for the financial period 62 539 48 024 Attributable to equity holders 62 539 48 024 $ per share $ per share Profit per share: Basic 8 0.66 0.44 Profit per share: Diluted 8 0.65 0.43The accompanying notes form part of these financial statements.Group condensed consolidated statement of financial positionAs at 30 June 2022Notes Unaudited30 June 2022$’000 Audited31 Dec 2021$’000 Assets Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 9 935 323 954 558 Right-of-use assets 10 1 541 2 136 936 864 956 694 Current assets Inventories 11 91 233 60 219 Trade and other receivables 12 67 753 74 747 Cash and cash equivalents 13 30 697 69 057 189 683 204 023 Total assets 1 126 547 1 160 717 Equity Capital and reserves attributable to the Company’s equity holders Called-up share capital 14 104 104 Share premium 545 950 545 950 Other reserves 230 359 230 539 Retained earnings 192 460 154 050 Total equity 968 873 930 643 Liabilities Non-current liabilities Bank loans 15 61 465 74 757 Lease liabilities 10 1 109 971 Provisions 17 26 572 38 999 89 146 114 727 Current liabilities Bank loans 15 31 780 73 342 Lease liabilities 10 584 1 207 Trade and other payables 16 28 549 32 768 Current tax liabilities 18 4 426 4 808 Provisions 17 3 189 3 222 68 528 115 347 Total liabilities 157 674 230 074 Total equity and liabilities 1 126 547 1 160 717The accompanying notes form part of these financial statements.On behalf of the Board:M.

Basis of preparation and going concernBasis of preparationThe annual financial statements of Kenmare Resources plc (‘the Group’) are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The Group Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended 30 June 2022 have been prepared in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007  as amended  the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland  Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.2 of the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’  as adopted by the European Union.The financial information presented in this document does not constitute statutory financial statements. The amounts presented in the half-yearly financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2022 and the corresponding amounts for the six months ended 30 June 2021 have been reviewed but not audited.The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2021  presented herein  is an abbreviated version of the annual financial statements for the Group in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021. The Group’s annual financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021 have been filed in the Companies Registration Office and the independent auditor issued an unqualified audit report thereon. The annual report is available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com.Use of Judgements and EstimatesThe preparation of the half-yearly financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements  estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses together with disclosure of assets and liabilities. Estimates and underlying assumptions relevant to these financial statements are the same as those described in the last annual financial statements.Going ConcernThe Directors have  at the time of approving the financial statements  a reasonable expectation that the Group has or will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Based on the Group’s cash flow forecast  liquidity and solvency position the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and  therefore  they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.The Group forecast has been prepared by management with best estimates of production  pricing and cost assumptions over the period. Key assumptions upon which the Group forecast is based include a mine plan covering production using the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. Production levels for the purpose of the forecast are approximately 1.2 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite plus co-products  zircon  concentrates and rutile  over the next twelve months. Assumptions for product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers or  where contract prices are based on market prices or production is not presently contracted  prices are forecast taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise and management expectations. Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2022  taking into account the current and future running costs of the Mine and escalated by 2% per annum thereafter. Capital costs are based on the capital plans and include escalation at 2% per annum. Current operating costs and forecast capital costs take into account the current inflationary environment. The 2% inflation rate used to escalate these costs over the life of mine is an estimated long-term inflation rate.Sensitivity analysis is applied to the assumptions above to test the robustness of the cash flow forecasts for reductions in market prices  reductions in production  increases in operating costs and a combined case of the aforementioned factors. Changes in these assumptions affect the level of sales and profitability of the Group and the amount of capital required to deliver the projected production levels. As a result of this assessment  the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next 12 months.Changes in accounting policiesThe accounting policies applied in the half-yearly financial statements are those set out in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.The following new and revised standards  all of which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022  have been adopted in the current financial period;Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendment to IAS 37) effective 1 January 2022Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020 effective 1 January 2022Property  Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendment to IAS 16) effective 1 January 2022Reference to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3) effective 1 January 2022None of the new and revised standards have a material effect on the Group’s condensed consolidated financial statements.2.

The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators for impairment. As at 30 June 2022  the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of net assets  which is considered an indicator of impairment of assets.The Group carried out an impairment review of property  plant and equipment as at 30 June 2022. As a result of the review  and given the performance and outlook of the Group  no impairment provision was recognised in the current financial period. No impairment was recognised in the prior financial year. Given the historic volatility in product pricing and sensitivities of the forecast to the discount rate and to a lesser extent operating costs  the impairment loss of $64.8 million  which was recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 2014  was not reversed.The cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine. The basis on which the Mine is assessed is its value in use. The cash flow forecast employed for the value-in-use computation is from a life of mine financial model. The recoverable amount obtained from the financial model represents the present value of the future discounted pre-tax  pre-finance cash flows discounted at 13.0% (31 December 2021: 10.5%).Key assumptions in the value in use calculation include the following:The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. This rate is a best estimate of the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Mine  taking into consideration country risk  currency risk and price risk. The factors comprising the cost of equity and cost of debt have changed from the year end review  in particular the risk-free rate which has increased to 2.98% (31 December 2021: 1.51%) and the equity risk premium which has increased to 6.01% (31 December 2021: 4.24%)  resulting in a discount rate of 13.0% (31 December 2021: 10.5%). The Group’s estimation of the country risk premium included in the discount rate has remained unchanged from the prior year. The Group does not consider it appropriate to apply the full current country risk premium for Mozambique to the calculation of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as it believes the specific circumstances which have resulted in the risk premium increase over the past number of years are not relevant to the specific circumstances of the Moma Mine. Hence  country risk premium applicable to the calculation of the cost of equity has been adjusted accordingly. Using a discount rate of 13.0%  the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying amount by $132.4 million (31 December 2021: $384.0 million). The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the recoverable amount. A 3.0% increase in the discount rate to 16.0% reduces the recoverable amount by $132.4 million to breakeven. The decrease in the recoverable amount from the year end review is a result of decreased cash flows over the life of mine as a result of increased forecast capital and operating costs  an increase in the discount rate from 10.5% to 13.0%  partially offset by increased forecast sales prices as detailed below.A mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi proved and probable reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine life assumption of 40 years has not changed from the year-end review. Average annual production is approximately 1.2 million tonnes (31 December 2021: 1.2 million tonnes) of ilmenite and co-products zircon  rutile and concentrates over the life of the Mine and remains unchanged from the year end review. Certain minimum stocks of final and intermediate products are assumed to be maintained at period ends.Product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers  or where contracts are based on market prices or production is not currently contracted  prices are forecasted by the Group taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise provided by TiPMC Solutions and management expectations including general inflation of 2% per annum. Forecast prices provided by TiPMC Solutions have been reviewed and found to be consistent with other external sources of information. Average forecast product sales prices have increased over the life of mine from the year-end review as a result of revised forecast pricing. A 4.5% reduction in average sales prices over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $132.4 million to breakeven.Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2022 taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and estimated forecast inflation for 2022. From 2023 onwards  operating costs are escalated by 2% per annum. Average forecast operating costs have increased from the year-end review as a result of inflation. Increased costs associated with estimated future power consumption and price for the mining in Nataka have been included in the forecast cashflows in the period. A 10.0% increase in operating costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $132.4 million to breakeven.Capital costs are based on a life of mine capital plan including inflation at 2% per annum from 2022. Forecast capital costs have increased and their scheduling changed from the year-end review based on updated capital plans required to maintain the existing plants over the life of mine. The forecast takes into account reasonable cost increases and therefore a sensitivity to this assumption  which would give rise to a reduction in the recoverable amount has not been applied.10.

The Styne House lease has a term of 10 years commencing August 2017 and rental payments are fixed for five years. This lease obligation is denominated in Euros.The lease for the electricity generators was renewed in November 2017 for a five-year period and rental payments are fixed for the five years. This lease obligation is denominated in US Dollars.In February 2019  the Group recognised a lease liability of $0.4 million for its Mozambican country office in Maputo. The lease has a seven-year term commencing February 2019 and rental payments are fixed for seven years. This lease obligation is denominated in US Dollars. The Group has discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rates. The weighted average rate applied is 7%.At each reporting date  the Company assesses whether there is any indication that right-of-use assets may be impaired. No impairment indicators were identified as at 30 June 2022 or 31 December 2021.Set out below are the carrying amounts of lease liabilities at each reporting date:Unaudited30 June 2022$’000 Audited31 Dec 2021$’000 Current 584 1 207 Non-Current 1 109 971 1 693 2 17811.

The finance documentation also provides for a Mine Closure Guarantee Facility (provided by either the existing lenders or other finance providers) of up to $40 million  with the provider(s) of such a facility sharing in the common security package. The potential total aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured under the finance documentation is therefore $190 million.The Term Loan Facility has a final maturity date of 11 March 2025. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.40% per annum. Repayment is in seven equal semi-annual instalments and the first repayment was made on 11 March 2022.On 21 July 2022 the Revolving Credit Facility was extended by 12 months and now has a final maturity date of 11 December 2023  which is extendable by a further 12 months at the lenders’ discretion. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.00% per annum (4.25% from 11 December 2022).The Group entered into a mine closure guarantee facility with Absa Bank Moçambique SA effective from 1 July 2022 for an amount of $18.9 million. This guarantee shares the security package with the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility on a pro rata and pari passu basis.The security package consists of (a) security over the Group’s bank accounts (subject to certain exceptions)  (b) pledges of the shares of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited and Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (the “Project Companies”)  (c) security over intercompany loans and (d) Mozambican law security interests over certain rights and agreements with Mozambican authorities  including over the Implementation Agreement  the Mineral Licensing Contract and the Mining Licence.The carrying amount of the secured bank accounts of the Group was $25.3 million as at 30 June 2022 (31 December 2021: $66.9 million). The shares of the Project Companies and intercompany loans are not included in the consolidated statement of financial position as they are eliminated on consolidation. They therefore do not have a carrying amount but  upon enforcement of the pledges on behalf of the lender group  the shares in the Project Companies would cease to be owned or controlled by the Group. The secured rights and agreements do not have a carrying amount. They are  however  necessary for the Project Companies to operate the Mine in Mozambique.The finance documents contain a number of representations  covenants and events of default on customary terms  the breach of which could lead to the secured parties under the finance documentation accelerating the outstanding loans and taking other enforcement steps  such as the enforcement of some or all of the security interests  which could lead  in extremis  with the Group losing its interest in the Mine. The most salient of the relevant terms that could lead to acceleration of the loans and/or enforcement of security are the financial covenants described on the subsequent page.During the period $40.0 million (31 December 2021: drawn down $20.0 million) of the Revolving Credit Facility and US$15.7 million of the Term Loan Facility was repaid. At the period-end  reported debt amounted to $93.2 million (31 December 2021: $148.1 million). This consists of the Term Loan Facility of $94.3 million (31 December 2021: $150 million)  loan interest and amortisation of $1.8 million (31 December 2021: $2.0 million)  net of transaction costs of $2.9 million (31 December 2021: $3.9 million).Reconciliation of movements of debt to cashflows arising from financing activities Unaudited30 June 2022$’000 Audited31 Dec 2021$’000 Bank Loans Balance at 1 January 148 099 145 771 Cash movements Loan interest paid (3 491) (7 147) Principal repaid (55 715) (20 000) Loan drawn down - 20 000 Non-cash movements Loan interest accrued 4 352 9 475 Balance at 30 June/31 December 93 245 148 099Financial CovenantsAs at30 June 2022 As at31 December 2021 CovenantInterest Coverage Ratio 22.39 21.8:1 Not less than 4.00:1 Net Debt to EBITDA 0.27 0.38:1 Not greater than 2.00:1 Debt Service Coverage Ratio 4.88 22.3:1 Not less than 1.20:1 Liquidity (million) $71.0 $69.1 Not less than $15.0 Reserve Tail Ratio 78% 78% Not less than 30%All financial covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement have been complied with during the period.

A corresponding amount equal to the provision is recognised as part of property  plant and equipment.The costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan  are subject to regular review and are estimated based on the net present value of estimated future cost. Mine closure costs are a normal consequence of mining  and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the Mine. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost and $0.4 million (H1 2021: $0.4 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the financial period.The main assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated future costs include:• a discount rate of 3.2% (31 December 2021: 2.1%);• an inflation rate of 2% (31 December 2021: 2%);• an estimated life of mine of 40 years (31 December 2021: 40 years). It is assumed that all licences and permits required to operate will be renewed or extended during the life of mine; and• an estimated closure cost of $34.1 million (31 December 2021: $34.1 million) and an estimated post-closure monitoring provision of $3.9 million (31 December 2021: $3.9 million).The life of mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine closure provision has been reduced by $13.5 million from 31 December 2021 to reflect a change in the discount rate from 2.1% at 31 December 2021 to 3.2% at 30 June 2022.The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the Mine closure provision. The Group uses US Treasury rates. Thirty-year US Treasury yields are the longest period for which yields are quoted. A forty-year rate to align with the estimated life of mine has been calculated by taking the average of the increase in yield from ten to twenty years and the increase in yield from twenty to thirty years and adding this average to the thirty-year treasury rate to arrive at an estimated extrapolated rate for forty years. This discount rate is deemed to provide the best estimate of the current market assessment of risk-free time value of money. Risks specific to the liability are included in the cost estimate.The Mine rehabilitation provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the Company’s liability for rehabilitating areas disturbed by mining activities. Rehabilitation costs are recognised based on the area disturbed and estimated cost of rehabilitation per hectare which is reviewed regularly against actual rehabilitation cost per hectare. Actual rehabilitation expenditure is incurred approximately twelve months after the area has been disturbed. During the financial period there was a release of $0.3 million (H1 2021: $0.3 million) to reflect the actual mine rehabilitation costs incurred  and an addition to the provision of $1.0 million (H1 2021: $0.5 million) for areas newly disturbed.Other provisions comprise an amount of $2.3 million (31 December 2021: $2.3 million) in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding  it is possible that on conclusion the final outcome may differ from management’s estimate.18.

The table does not include fair value information for other receivables  prepayments  trade payables and accruals as these are not measured at fair value as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Trade receivables which are factored through the Absa Bank facility or letters of credit which are always confirmed and discounted through the Barclays Bank facility are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Trade receivables or letters of credit where it is not known at initial recognition if they will be factored are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Group derecognises the original receivable to which the arrangement applies when payment is received from the bank as the terms of the arrangement are non-recourse. The payment to the bank by the Group’s customers are considered non-cash transactions. Trade receivables not measured at fair value are receivables whose payment is received under the sale contract credit terms.The valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 fair values is discounted cash flows  which considers the expected receipts or payments discounted using adjusted market discount rates or where these rates are not available estimated discount rates.Credit riskThe Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual circumstances of each customer. The Group also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base  including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate.Before entering into sales contracts with new customers  the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed regularly during the year.The Group’s customers have been transacting with the Group for a significant number of years  and no customers’ balances have been written off or are credit impaired at the financial period end. In monitoring customer credit risk  customers are reviewed individually and the Group has not identified any factors that would merit reducing exposure to any particular customer. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.For trade receivables measured at fair value through OCI and trade receivables measured at amortised cost  the Group allocates to each customer a credit risk grade based on data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to external ratings  financial statements and available market information about customers) and applying experienced credit judgement.The movement in expected credit losses in respect of trade receivables were measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income during the period was as follows:Unaudited30 June 2022$’000 Audited31 Dec 2021$’000 Opening balance 424 199 Net remeasurement of loss allowance 199 225 Closing 623 424The increase in the loss allowance is mainly attributable to increases in industry specific externally published forward looking default rates which are used as the basis of estimating the Group’s expected credit losses. The methodology for the calculation of expected credit losses is the same as described in the last annual statements.Interest rate benchmark reformA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally  including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as “IBOR reform”). The Group has exposure to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. The Group’s main IBOR exposure at the reporting date is US LIBOR  which is administered by ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA). The alternative reference rate for US LIBOR is the US Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).On 5 March 2021  IBA stated that it will cease the publication of (i) the overnight and one  three  six and twelve months USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday 30 June 2023  and (ii) all other LIBOR settings  including the one week and two months USD LIBOR settings  immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday 31 December 2021. IBA stated that it will not have access to input data necessary to calculate LIBOR settings on a representative basis after those dates. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a separate announcement confirming that IBA had notified the FCA of its intent to cease providing all LIBOR settings. The FCA confirmed that all 35 LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative as of the dates set out by IBA.The Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its operational and risk management processes. The main risk to which the Group is exposed as a result of IBOR reform is in the amendment to the Senior Facility Agreement (SFA) with negotiation with the lender group to reflect the migration from USD LIBOR to SOFR  updating contractual terms and revising operational controls related to the migration. Financial risk is predominantly limited to interest rate risk.The Audit & Risk Committee monitors  while the Executive and senior management manages  the migration to alternative rates. Such management includes evaluation of the extent to which contracts reference IBOR  whether such contracts will need to be amended as a result of IBOR reform and how to manage communication about IBOR reform to counterparties.The Group plans to amend the terms of the SFA for purposes of migrating from USD LIBOR to SOFR prior to the discontinuance of the administration and publication of the relevant LIBOR rates by IBA. The migration to SOFR for purposes of the Group’s trade finance facilities with Absa Bank and Barclays Bank was effected through amendments entered into during the period and had no material impact.The carrying amount of financial liabilities with unreformed contracts at 30 June 2022 was $93.2 million (31 December 2021: $148.1 million).20. Share-based paymentsKenmare Restricted Share Plan (KRSP)During the financial period  632 797 (H1 2021: 689 412) shares were granted to employees under the 2022 KRSP award. The estimated fair value of the shares awarded is $3.7 million (H1 2021: $3.9 million). These share awards vest  subject to continued employment on the third anniversary or  in the case of Executive Directors and certain other staff  subject to continued employment and to the Remuneration Committee’s assessment against a discretionary underpin  on the third anniversary of grant.During the financial period  the Group recognised a share-based payment expense of $3.2 million (H1 2021: $2.1 million) comprising $1.5 million in relation to the vesting of KRSP awards during the period and $1.7 million in relation to an adjustment to reflect the value of awards exercised during the period.During the period  awards in respect of 540 389 shares were exercised at a cost of $3.4 million. These figures do not include shares in respect of dividend equivalents which are added to awards on vesting.The movement in the condensed statement of changes in equity of $0.2 million (H1 2021: $0.1 million) is made up of the share-based payment expense of $3.2 million (H1 2021: $2.1 million) net of the cost of settlement of the equity-based shares of $3.4 million (H1 2021: $2.2 million).21. Contingent liabilitiesThe Group  like other businesses operating in Mozambique  is subject to tax audits by the Mozambican Tax Authorities. These audits may review a range of matters including corporate income tax  indirect taxes and transaction related issues  and can take a number of years to complete. The Mozambican Tax Authority conducted an audit of the tax obligations of the KMML Mozambique Branch in relation to the years 2015 to 2017. The Group is liaising with the Tax Authority to address matters raised during the audit. It is not possible to estimate with certainty the timing of any future resolution or possible outcomes.A provision of $2.3 million (31 December 2021: $2.3 million) is included in the financial statements in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding  it is possible that on conclusion the outcome may differ from management’s estimates. Other tax matters raised during the audit are likewise still outstanding. No provision has been made in these financial statements in relation to the other tax matters as the Group does not consider that there is any material future probable loss.22. Related party transactionsTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries  which are related parties  have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.Apart from existing remuneration arrangements there were no material transactions or balances between the Group and its key management personnel or members of their close families during the period under review.23.

The collaborations with Le Bonheur Children's Hospital  the Wisconsin Health Information Organization (WHIO)  and Yale University will uncover and leverage the power of education and real-world evidence (RWE) to address this research gap  expand awareness  and enact positive change in the health outcomes of individuals with seizure clusters.Seizure clusters are episodes of increased seizure activity  during which two or more seizures occur within a 24-hour period. It is estimated that more than 150 000 people in the U.S. with uncontrolled epilepsy also experience seizure clusters. Due to their unpredictable nature  these disruptive events can leave those living with epilepsy feeling anxious  worried  frustrated  or isolated – further fueling a decline in mental health for this patient population.""Our real-world evidence and educational collaborations with Le Bonheur Children's Hospital  the Wisconsin Health Information Organization  and Yale University illustrate our desire to meaningfully contribute to how physicians  patients  and the overall care system think about and treat seizure clusters. This includes how we frame and account for the value of treatments within the healthcare ecosystem "" said Brad Chapman  Head  U.S. Epilepsy and Rare Syndromes at UCB. ""We know that rescue medications that allow adults and adolescents to get back to their daily activities quickly is especially important  whether it's in the classroom or in day-to-day life  and we are committed to delivering solutions that further this ambition.""The project with Le Bonheur Children's Hospital focuses on improving the lived epilepsy patient experience by developing resources designed specifically for patients and caregivers that address the importance of the proper use of rescue medications outside the hospital. This ""Ask the Experts"" project seeks to combat identified gaps in patient and caregiver education and information as it relates to epilepsy and more specifically seizure clusters through the development of an educational resource and a video.""We know most seizure clusters happen at home or during other daily activities; treating seizure clusters where and when they happen is critical for better patient outcomes "" said Dr. James Wheless  BScPharm  MD  FAAP  FAAN  FAES  Co-Director of the Neuroscience Institute  Le Bonheur Children's Hospital. ""As school starts and with COVID-19 still a medical concern  it's of the utmost importance that we prepare students to successfully start their school year with a seizure action plan and appropriate rescue medications so they can prepare their teachers and school nurses to act when the cluster starts.""The collaboration with WHIO aims to understand the economic and clinical impact of undertreating seizure clusters and to explore drivers of better outcomes. This project will analyze retrospective claims at a state level to examine prescribing trends  healthcare utilization  costs  access barriers  and disease prevalence.Dr. George Morris  MD  MPH  FAAN  FAES  epileptologist in the Milwaukee-area  and valued partner in the WHIO Project  explains  ""Epilepsy's impact on a person's health and their quality of life is significantly affected by seizure clusters. The health risk from aspiration and terrifying experience of the patient  family  and friends is unique to epilepsy. This project uses a unique data source to see the comprehensive effects across nearly all Wisconsin patients. We are excited to know what factors may help reduce seizure clusters to inform providers and patients about best practices.""The Yale University Project  Reduction of Seizures through Education and Support (ROSES)  aims to increase understanding of seizure cluster management  to contribute new insights to clinical management and patient-centric care  and improve overall epilepsy quality care. Specifically  this study is designed to assess the impact of seizure rescue medications  treatment patterns  healthcare resource utilization  clinic quality improvement tools (i.e.  Seizure Action Plans)  and the patient/caregiver experience.About Epilepsy1-4Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder of the brain. It is the fourth most common neurological condition worldwide and affects approximately 65 million people. In the U.S. more than 3.4 million people have epilepsy. Anyone can develop epilepsy; it occurs across all ages  races and genders  and is defined as one or more unprovoked seizures with a risk of further seizures.About Seizure Clusters5-10Of the one third of patients living with uncontrolled epilepsy  it is estimated that more than 150 000 people in the U.S. with refractory epilepsy also experience seizure clusters. Seizure clusters are broadly defined as acute episodes of consecutive seizures that occur within a short period of time with a patient regaining consciousness during the interictal period. These clusters are also distinguishable from a person's typical seizure pattern. Other names for seizure clusters include acute-repetitive seizures (ARS)  serial seizures  crescendo seizures  and seizure flurries  which highlight the repetitive nature of the seizures. Seizure clusters are a form of seizure emergency that can evolve into prolonged seizures or status epilepticus.About UCB in EpilepsyUCB has a rich heritage in epilepsy with over 20 years of experience in the research and development of anti-epileptic drugs.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.ReferencesCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

However  significant tension in supply and logistics chains  amplified by the conflict in Ukraine  caused disruption to business over the last months of the year  leading to delivery delays and project postponements.The impact of these delays amounted to around €7m in turnover not invoiced in 2021/2022  but which is set to be recorded in the new 2022/2023 financial year.Despite these delays and increased pressure on prices (raw materials  energy  electronic components  etc.)  MND confirms its aim to improve profitability in 2021/2022 compared to the previous year (€2.6m in adjusted EBITDA in 2020/2021)  driven by the operational effects of the ""Succeed Together 2024"" strategic plan  as well as cost-saving measures and moves to lighten the Group's cost structure.TURNOVER BY BUSINESS LINEThe ""Snowmaking and Ropeways"" business line generated turnover of €60.0m  reflecting strong growth of 122%.Business was upbeat throughout the year  with the installation of numerous automatic snowmaking systems and  above all  a threefold increase in turnover in the cable transport business as a result of major projects that went into production during the year. The increase in urban transport activity in 2021/2022 also stood out with progress in various mobility projects (urban cable car in Saint-Denis on Reunion Island  new urban and tourist cable car in the city of Huy in Belgium).After a decline in the first half of 2021/2022 (-18%)  turnover in the ""Safety & Leisure"" business line rebounded as expected in the second half of the year (+73%)  driven by the recovery in investments by ski resort operators for the 2021/2022 winter season. In all  turnover in the division totalled €14.2m  up a slight 1% over the year.In regional terms  the Group stepped up its multi-continent presence during 2021/2022  particularly in North America (United States) and Asia (China and Japan)  as a result of the multiple international projects won during the previous financial year.The geographical breakdown of 2021/2022 turnover was as follows:39% of business generated in France (versus 41% in 2020/2021);14% in Europe excluding France (vs. 32% in 2020/2021);47% in the rest of world region (vs. 28% in 2020/2021)  with growth in North America to 19% (vs. 6%) and Asia  to 16% (vs. 13%).ORDER BACKLOG OF €81.8M ON 30 JUNE 2022Sales activity over the last months of year was robust with €64.3m in firm orders recorded over the full-year  including €44.6m in the second half.The Group won two major ropeways projects in France and the US for a total of nearly €40m  turnover for which is to be invoiced in 2022/2023 and 2023/2024.As of 30 June 2022  the backlog of firm orders totalled €81.8m  vs. €54.7m at end-December 2021.2022/2023 OUTLOOKWith €55.3m of firm orders already to be invoiced in 2022/2023  MND is approaching this new financial year with confidence despite the economic context and continuing tensions in supply chains.The Group aims to deliver another year of turnover growth and to continue improving profitability (adjusted EBITDA).At 30 June 2022  available cash amounted to €5.2m  compared with €5.7m at the end of December 2021.Net financial debt (excluding IFRS 16 lease debt) amounted to €111.7m on 30 June 2022  of which €89.9m in senior debt (with 100% capitalised interest) with Cheyne Capital  bullet maturity December 2023 and May 2024  and a loan of €20.1m (with 100% capitalised interest) from the French government  via the fund for economic and social development (FDES).For information  prior to the close of its 2021/2022 financial year  the Group obtained a waiver from its principal creditor Cheyne Capital in the event of default resulting from non-compliance with its financial covenants (ratios) at 30 June 2022.The Group announces that in recent weeks it has entered into discussions with its main creditors  especially the French State through the FDES and the investment fund Cheyne Capital  and is studying various options  such as setting up new long-term financing and/or strengthening its equity (including the conditions of a possible incorporation of certain receivables into the capital)  in order to carry out its growth plan over the coming financial years  as well as to undertake major industrial and research and development investments  and thus to ensure the Group's long-term viability.These discussions aim to provide the group with a balanced financial structure and secure the necessary liquidity to enable it to finalise the deployment of its strategic plan by 2024/2025.The Group will issue a press release once these discussions are concluded.On 11 August 2022  a simple bullet bond was put in place for an amount of €6m in principal  subscribed to by Cheyne Capital  and maturing on 31 December 2023.Xavier Gallot-Lavallée  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MND stated:""Despite significant supply chain and procurement challenges  MND delivered strong full-year turnover growth in 2021/2022  driven by a number of commercial successes in the past year and the development of new international markets.The sustained development of cable transport  the take-off of urban mobility activities and robust growth in North American activities - with a fivefold increase in turnover - and in Asia  testify to the commercial dynamism of the MND Group.These successes  together with the effects of the strategic transformation plan ""Succeed Together 2024""  will contribute to further improving our operating performance over the past year  and also our sustainable return to profitable growth.It is now important for the Group to realign its balance sheet structure and continue to strengthen its financial capacities in order to deliver on its 'Succeed Together 2024' strategic plan  building on the efforts and results achieved over the past two years.""FINANCIAL CALENDAR2021/2022 full-year results: 28 October 2022The publication will take place after Euronext Paris market close.ContactsPress Relations - Alexandre Bérard+33 (0)6 45 42 95 46 - alex@alternativemedia.frFinancial Press Relations - Serena Boni+33 (0)4 72 18 04 92 - sboni@actus.frInvestor Relations - Mathieu Omnes+33 (0)1 53 67 36 92 - momnes@actus.frAbout MNDMND is a French industrial group specialised in ropeway mobility  snowmaking systems  mountain safety and thrill-making leisure facilities.
