India’s $1 trillion sovereign bond market is one of the biggest among emerging markets not to be part of any global index.Goldman’s optimism comes even as the index inclusion has largely gone on the back burner after New Delhi desisted from making any tax changes for foreigners that would have helped Indian bonds settlement on international clearing platforms like Euroclear. The analysts wrote that both Chinese and Indonesian government bonds though not Euroclearable are part of the JPMorgan index.“Adding India  which is a large  deep and high-yielding market  would help to diversify as well as boost the average yield of the overall index ” the analysts wrote. “Such a move would be beneficial to various stakeholders  including EM investors and the Indian government.”Account openings for foreigners are still cumbersome in India but can be addressed by a longer lead time for inclusion  according to the note.

Completion of this operation is subject to the finalization of the bank financing contract.One of the world leaders in HLA typing for graft compatibilityFounded in 2005 in Utrecht  the Netherlands  GenDx specializes in the molecular diagnostics of transplants by HLA typing of organs or patients as part of the evaluation of compatibility between donors and recipients. Among others  it is one of the pioneers of typing based on genomic sequencing (SBT or Sequencing Based Typing) for which it currently offers high-resolution solutions based on the most recent NGS2 technologies.Story continuesGenDx develops and markets a complete family of products which includes:- reagents for performing HLA typing by sequencing;- software for analyzing sequencing results  customized for different sequencing techniques and platforms;- training modules  facilitating the adoption of its solutions by its customers.The company has more than 80 employees  mainly based in the Netherlands  including a sales force present in Benelux  Germany and the USA. In 2021  GenDx generated €17 million in revenue  for €6.9 million in EBITDA. During the first half of 2022  GenDx's revenue is estimated at €11.2 million  for €5.4 million of EBITDA3.An acquisition with strong potential for growth and value creationIn 2021  transplantation diagnostics accounted for 23.8% of Eurobio Scientific Group's (the “Group”) non-COVID revenue  i.e. 20 million euros. The acquisition of GenDx should enable the consolidation of the Group's presence in this specialty and generate new international development synergies.The main synergies linked to this acquisition are:- a strong complementarity of transplantation activities: Eurobio Scientific is currently only a distributor in France where GenDx has no direct presence;- R&D complementarity: GenDx supplements the Group's scientific and technical expertise with significant know-how in HLA and NGS within teams operating in a center of excellence in Utrecht;- GenDx's technological advance in the digitization of diagnostics  through algorithms and software developed by its bioinformatics specialists;- an extension of the international commercial presence by the direct presence of GenDx in the Netherlands  Germany and North America where it will supplement the local capacities of Eurobio Scientific  and by its distributors in the rest of Europe  Asia and the rest of the world.Given the characteristics of GenDx  the strong complementarity between the two groups  and the many synergies identified  the valuation of this transaction is in line with those of recent acquisitions involving similar assets in the field of medical diagnostics.Better access to care and advances in medicine are resulting in a growing demand for transplants. However  this is hampered by the availability of organs to be transplanted. A precise and rapid diagnosis  making it possible to increase the success rate of these surgeries  promotes a better balance between supply and demand. The transplant diagnostics market is therefore growing rapidly  and the technological and commercial strength of the new entity resulting from the merger of Eurobio Scientific and GenDx  should make it a leading player.Denis Fortier  Deputy Managing Director and co-CEO of Eurobio Scientific  Chairman of EurobioNext  declares: ""This operation is transformative for Eurobio Scientific and is fully in line with the development strategy that we have been successfully pursuing for several years and which is based on a direct presence in Europe and an increase in the share of proprietary products. The strong complementarity between our two groups should make it possible to increase the advance of our Group both technologically  geographically and commercially”.Hervé Duchesne de Lamotte  Deputy Managing Director and CFO of Eurobio Scientific  adds: ""This merger  which has the support of our financial partners  will allow Eurobio Scientific to significantly increase the share of proprietary products in its turnover and therefore its profitability. The size of the financing associated with this transaction also gives Eurobio Scientific the means to steadily pursue the development of the Group”.“We are particularly proud of this acquisition of GenDx which will further strengthen the added value of Eurobio Scientific's innovation. It is the fruit of historical relations between Denis Fortier and Wietse Mulder  two entrepreneurs who share the same vision of the development of their business. We are convinced that GenDx will play an important role in the development of Eurobio Scientific around NGS technology as well as on the two challenges of the future which are preventive medicine and smart health”  comments Arthur Vigneras  Investment Director with NextStage AM.Wietse Mulder  CEO and co-founder of GenDx  adds “For GenDx it was important to get closer to a group led by entrepreneurs. Eurobio Scientific  through its demonstrated agility during the COVID crisis and its complementarity with our activities  quickly appeared to us as the best partner to ensure the continued development of transplantation activities  while strengthening the technological base of our new Group. On a more personal note  I am delighted to join this new group and enable the creation of a leading player in the field of molecular diagnostics in Europe ”.Cash and bank loan financingThe acquisition will be financed in part by the Group's own cash and in part by a loan from a syndicate bringing together the Group's banks  in particular LCL  BNP  Crédit Agricole Ile de France  BRED and CIC. The loan will be for a total amount of 90 million euros. It will be amortized half-yearly over a period of six years for 63 million euros  and will be repayable in fine at the end of the seventh year for 27 million euros. The interest rate will be EURIBOR4 plus a margin varying according to certain financial ratios and ranging between 0.9 and 1.6% for the amortized tranche  and between 1.75 and 2.45% for the in fine tranche. A portion of this loan will be used to repay the outstanding balance of the March 2020 syndicated loan  for approximately €4.5 million.The final completion of the acquisition is subject to the legal finalization of the agreement with the banks  which will include the usual covenants for this type of transaction  the respective committees having already given their agreements. It should take place by mid-October.List of participants in the transactionEurobio Scientific: Denis Fortier (Deputy Managing Director  co-CEO) and Hervé Duchesne de Lamotte (Deputy Managing Director  CFO)  Jean-Michel Carle (President and CEO)NextStage AM: Grégoire Sentilhes (Co-founder  Chairman and CEO)  Arthur Vignéras (Investment Director) and Emilio Johnston (Associate)M&A Buyside Advisor: Rothschild & Co.

8999,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-sanofi-provides-amcenestrant-053000829.html,Press Release: Sanofi provides update on amcenestrant clinical development program,Sanofi provides update on amcenestrant clinical development program PARIS  August 17  2022. Sanofi is discontinuing the global clinical development program...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeSanofi provides update on amcenestrant clinical development programPARIS  August 17  2022. Sanofi is discontinuing the global clinical development program of amcenestrant  an investigational oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). The decision is based on the outcome of a prespecified interim analysis of the Phase 3 AMEERA-5 trial evaluating amcenestrant in combination with palbociclib compared with letrozole in combination with palbociclib in patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer.An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) found that amcenestrant in combination with palbociclib did not meet the prespecified boundary for continuation in comparison with the control arm and recommended stopping the trial. No new safety signals were observed. Trial participants will be transitioned to letrozole in combination with palbociclib or another appropriate standard of care therapy  as determined by their physician.The company will continue to review the data and plans to share the results with the scientific community in the future. All other studies of amcenestrant  including in early-stage breast cancer (AMEERA-6)  will be discontinued.John Reed  MD  PhDGlobal Head of Research and Development at Sanofi“While we are disappointed by this outcome  our research will further the scientific understanding of endocrine therapies in people with breast cancer. Our sincere gratitude goes to the patients  families and healthcare professionals involved in the amcenestrant clinical development program. Oncology remains a priority area for Sanofi  and we will continue to pursue transformative research to develop new medicines for people living with cancer.”In March  Sanofi announced that the Phase 2 AMEERA-3 trial had not met the primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Story continuesAbout AMEERA-5AMEERA-5 is a randomized  double-blind Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of amcenestrant in combination with palbociclib  a CDK4/6 inhibitor  in the first-line treatment of patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. A total of 1068 patients who had not received any prior systemic anticancer therapies for advanced disease were randomized 1:1 to receive either amcenestrant or letrozole in combination with palbociclib.About AMEERA-6AMEERA-6 is a randomized  double-blind Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of amcenestrant compared with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer who have discontinued adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy due to treatment related toxicity. The trial was initiated in partnership with the Breast International Group (BIG)  the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)  and the Alliance Foundation Trials (AFT).About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

EBITDA increased 28%  resulting in a 30% increase in profit after tax  and giving us confidence to increase our interim dividend to USc10.98 per share. This represents a 51% increase compared to last year’s interim dividend  benefitting from the share buy-back completed in December 2021.After a challenging first five months of the year  production improved in late May and this has continued for the 12 weeks since then. At this run rate  we remain on track to achieve guidance  albeit at the bottom of the range.We ended the first half of the year with a robust balance sheet  having reduced net debt by $17.3 million.

Included in operating costs are depreciation and amortisation. Total cash costs consists of total operating costs less freight and non-cash costs  including inventory movements.OperationsKenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR was 0.00 per 200 000 hours worked to 30 June 2022 (30 June 2021: 0.14)  with zero Lost Time Injuries recorded during the first half of the year. The Company is focused on maintaining its strongest ever safety performance  with more than 18 months since the last Lost Time Injury.During H1 2022  Kenmare mined 19.5 million tonnes of ore at an average ore grade of 4.35%. Excavated ore tonnes decreased by 2% compared to H1 2021 (19.9 million tonnes) and ore grades decreased by 7% (H1 2021: 4.67%).HMC production in H1 2022 was impacted by increased slimes levels during Q2  most significantly at WCP A  and compounded by two tropical storms passing close to Moma in Q1.A tight turn in WCP A’s mine path in 2021 led to reduced space for the plant’s slimes settling paddocks  which are necessary for slimes management. To increase paddock settling capacity  Kenmare reduced high grade supplemental dry mining in H1 2022 and increased dredge mining  therefore negatively impacting ore grades. Normal dry mining operations resumed in June as pond slimes levels had been stabilised  resulting in increased HMC production  and these production improvements have been maintained in the first six weeks of Q3 2022.As stated in the Q2 and H1 2022 Production Update  as part of the PFS  WCP A is expected to have a desliming circuit installed to more efficiently mine the Nataka ore zone. A cost-benefit analysis is being conducted to investigate the acceleration of the installation of the desliming circuit ahead of the move. This has the potential to increase the effective capacity of WCP A and better mitigate against the slimes levels at the end of the Namalope mine path.Production of all finished products decreased by 10% to 550 700 tonnes in H1 2022 compared to H1 2021 (612 100 tonnes)  broadly in line with the 9% reduction in HMC processed.Ilmenite production was 499 700 tonnes  an 11% decrease compared to H1 2021 (559 000 tonnes)  due primarily to the reduction in HMC processed and slightly exacerbated by reduced HMC quality. Primary zircon production was 26 500 tonnes  a 6% decrease compared to H1 2021 (28 200 tonnes) and rutile production was 4 000 tonnes  a decrease of 4% compared to H1 2021 (4 200 tonnes). Concentrates production was 20 500 tonnes  a 1% decrease compared to H1 2021 (20 700 tonnes). For primary zircon and rutile  the reduction in HMC processed was partially offset by improved recoveries. Concentrates production was less impacted by reduced HMC processed due to the draw of intermediate stockpiles.Following robust production between late May and mid-August  the Company is still expected to achieve the bottom of 2022 production guidance for all finished products.Kenmare shipped 424 300 tonnes of finished products during the period  a 29% decrease compared to H1 2021 (594 100 tonnes). This was due primarily to poorer weather conditions and reduced shipping capacity in Q2  as the Bronagh J transshipment vessel left site in early May 2022 for its five-yearly dry dock maintenance work. This reduction will continue during Q3 until the Bronagh J returns to service  which is expected in August. However  there will be sufficient capacity to catch up when both transshipment vessels are operating  with finished product inventories expected to return to normal levels during H1 2023.In H1 2022 shipments comprised 382 200 tonnes of ilmenite  20 500 tonnes of primary zircon  4 800 tonnes of rutile and 16 800 tonnes of concentrates.Closing stock of HMC at the end of H1 2022 was 9 200 tonnes  compared with 11 600 tonnes at the end of 2021  due to a drawdown of HMC stockpiles during the period to compensate for reduced HMC production. Closing stock of finished products at the end of H1 2022 was 214 900 tonnes  compared to 88 700 tonnes at the end of 2021  reflecting the lower shipping capacity.Capital projectsIn May 2022  the Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply project completed its commissioning phase and began operation. The objective of the RUPS is to improve power stability at the Mineral Separation Plant and make a significant contribution to Kenmare’s goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 12% by 2024. Since becoming operational  the RUPS has proved successful at mitigating electrical supply disruptions in accordance with this objective. The capital cost of the RUPS is estimated to be $20 million  up slightly from the previous estimate of approximately $18 million.Work is continuing on the PFS for the Nataka ore zone  where WCP A is expected to commence mining in 2025. Some elements of the PFS are significantly advanced so work towards the Definitive Feasibility Study has commenced in those areas. Other results have led Kenmare to continue to conduct further investigations at PFS level and some important capital decisions  like mining method  are yet to be finalised. The hydromining trial conducted in Namalope and Nataka was successful and is contributing to the work to optimise mining at Nataka. The PFS is expected to be completed later in 2022  with an update provided in early 2023. Initial estimates suggest that the capital cost of the move is not likely to be less than $225 million.Market updateDemand for titanium feedstocks and zircon strengthened throughout H1 2022  which allowed Kenmare to achieve consecutive prices increases in Q1 and Q2 and a record average received price of $429 per tonne for H1. Positive market fundamentals have continued into Q3 2022.Global demand for ilmenite grew further during the half year due to robust downstream demand for titanium pigment  with pigment producers continuing to operate at high utilisation rates  particularly outside of China. In Q2  economic activity in China was impacted by several city-wide COVID-19 related lockdowns  which reduced demand for titanium pigment and therefore ilmenite. Despite this  chloride pigment production continued to increase in China  resulting in growing demand for ilmenite of Kenmare’s quality.Global production of titanium feedstocks expanded in H1  although it remained insufficient to meet demand. Pigment production was therefore constrained by feedstock availability and low inventories. Despite the tight supply of titanium feedstocks  major new projects are making limited progress  which may constrain ilmenite supply over the medium term.Notwithstanding recent uncertainty regarding the outlook for global growth  demand from our customers remains robust and inventories remain below normal levels in the supply chain. As a result  pricing momentum for ilmenite has continued into Q3 and Kenmare’s order book for H2 is strong. However  demand for ilmenite is linked to global economic growth and market forecasts for world GDP have been reducing.The zircon market tightened further in H1 2022 as inventories in the global supply chain were largely drawn down in 2021. Demand has been strong in all major regions except China  which was also impacted by severe COVID-19-related lockdowns. With no significant new supply entering the market  zircon remains in short supply and prices increased throughout H1 2022. Tight market conditions for zircon have continued into Q3 2022.Financial reviewIn H1 2022  Kenmare delivered a strong financial performance  generating a 9% increase in revenue (FOB) to $182.1 million (H1 2021: $167.8 million) and a 28% increase in EBITDA to $105.5 million (H1 2021: $82.3 million). Record first half revenues and profits were supported by robust markets for all finished products.Kenmare’s balance sheet strengthened during the period  with net debt reducing by $17.3 million to $65.5 million (31 December 2021: $82.8 million)  after paying the $24.1 million 2021 final dividend. The Company is targeting a full year dividend payout ratio of 25% of profit after tax for 2022  subject to prevailing product market and other conditions  and is pleased to announce a 2022 interim dividend of USc10.98 (H1 2021: USc7.29) per share. This represents a 51% increase compared to the 2021 interim dividend  benefitting from the share buy-back completed in December 2021.RevenueRevenue (FOB) increased by 9% in H1 2022 to $182.1 million (H1 2021: $167.8 million)  driven by a 52% increase in the average received price (FOB) to $429 per tonne (H1 2021: $282 per tonne). This average received price (FOB) represents a new half-yearly company record. It was due to both price increases for individual products and a change in product mix  with an increased proportion of higher value products (primary zircon and rutile) sold relative to H1 2021. The increase in revenue was despite a 29% reduction in shipments.Freight costs in H1 2022 increased to $15.2 million (H1 2021: $10.4 million)  reflecting a tighter freight market due to strong global demand for commodities.Ilmenite revenue (FOB) decreased by 7% to $133.5 million in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $143.9 million)  as a result of a 32% decrease in ilmenite shipment volumes  offset by a 36% price increase to $349 per tonne (H1 2021: $256 per tonne). Primary zircon revenue (FOB) increased by 69% to $32.5 million (H1 2021: $19.2 million) due to an 11% increase in primary zircon shipment volumes and a 52% price increase.Operating costsTotal operating costs in H1 2022 were $122.3 million  a 2% increase compared to H1 2021 ($119.5 million). Costs reflect increased depreciation of $30.5 million  up 30% (H1 2021: $23.5 million)  due to asset additions in the 12 month period to the end of June 2022  and amended depreciation rates on certain assets  offset by reduced depreciation on assets depreciated on a unit of production basis  as a result of lower HMC production in the period. However  a $27.8 million increase of finished product inventory  due to reduced shipping capacity  decreased total operating costs for the period. The increased finished product inventory is expected to unwind as product shipments normalise in H1 2023.Total cash operating costs were $101.2 million  a 16% increase compared to H1 2021 ($87.3 million). This was due primarily to general inflationary increases and higher mining royalties and processing taxes due to increased sales and pricing. Combined with a 10% decrease in production of finished products  this resulted in a 29% increase in cash operating costs per tonne of finished product to $184 per tonne in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $143 per tonne). Cash operating cost per tonne of ilmenite decreased by 7% to $105 per tonne as a result of higher co-product revenues and a favourable product mix.Finance income and costsKenmare recognised finance income of $0.08 million in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $0.04 million)  consisting of interest on bank deposits. Finance costs were $5.7 million in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $6.1 million)  including loan interest of $4.4 million (H1 2021: $4.9 million). The decrease in loan interest year-on-year reflects the lower principal outstanding following the commencement of principal repayments in H1 2022  offset by higher US LIBOR interest rates. Factoring and other fees were $0.7 million in the period (H1 2021: $0.8 million) and the unwinding of the mine closure provision amounted to $0.4 million (H1 2021: $0.4 million). Commitment fees under the debt facilities were $0.2 million ($0.02 million) and lease interest was $0.1 million (H1 2021: $0.1 million).TaxThe tax charge for H1 2022 amounted to $6.1 million (H1 2021: $2.6 million). Kenmare’s subsidiary  Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited  had taxable profits of $16.1 million (H1 2021: $6.6 million)  resulting in an income tax charge of $5.6 million (H1 2021: $2.3 million). Kenmare Resources plc incurred a tax charge of $0.5 million (H1 2020: $0.3 million).Cash flowsNet cash from operations in H1 2022 was $66.8 million (H1 2021: $33.2 million)  reflecting higher profitability. Working capital movement of $28.6 million (H1 2021: $42.4 million) reflects primarily increased finished product inventories as a result of decreased shipments during the period.Investing activities of $24.2 million (H1 2021: $31.8 million) represented additions to property  plant and equipment. $55.7 million of debt repayments were made (H1 2021: $20.0 million) and a final dividend for 2021 of $24.1 million (H1 2020: $8.5 million) was paid in May 2022. Lease repayments of $0.6 million (H1 2021: $0.5 million) were also paid in the period.Consequently  Kenmare finished H1 2022 with $30.7 million of cash and cash equivalents  representing a decrease of $38.4 million compared to year-end 2021 ($69.1 million).Balance sheetIn H1 2022 there were additions to property  plant and equipment of $24.2 million (H1 2021: $31.8 million). Additions consisted of $5.4 million development expenditure  $4.6 million in relation to preparing for the relocation of WCP A to the Nataka ore zone  $3.0 million in relation to the Namalope West resettlement plan and $11.2 million in relation to sustaining capital.As stated above  depreciation of $30.5 million  was up 30% (H1 2021: $23.5 million). The mine closure provision asset was reduced by $13.5 million in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $2.2 million). This was due to an increase in the discount rate used to estimate the closure cost provision from 2.1% to 3.2%.The Group conducted an impairment review of property  plant and equipment at the period-end and the key assumptions of this review are set out in Note 9 of the financial statements. No impairment provision is required as a result of this review.Inventory at period-end amounted to $91.2 million (31 December 2021: $60.2 million)  consisting of intermediate and finished mineral products of $49.9 million (31 December 2021: $22.0 million) and consumables and spares of $41.4 million (31 December 2021: $38.2 million). As anticipated  the Group carried a higher level of mineral product inventory at period-end due to reduced shipment capacity as a result of the Bronagh J dry dock.Trade and other receivables amounted to $67.8 million (31 December 2021: $74.7 million). This was comprised of $50.6 million (31 December 2021: $66.2 million) of trade receivables from the sale of mineral products  $14.6 million (31 December 2021: $7.8 million) of supplier prepayments and other miscellaneous debtors  and $2.6 million (31 December 2021: $0.8 million) of VAT receivable. Trade receivables are a function of shipments made before period-end and credit terms specific to the relevant customer. There have been no credit impairments during the period. An expected credit loss of $0.2 million (H1 2021: $0.1 million) was recognised during the period.Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $38.4 million in the period and at 30 June 2022 amounted to $30.7 million (31 December 2021: $69.1 million).Lease liabilities amounted to $1.7 million (31 December 2021: $2.2 million) at period-end.Tax liabilities amounted to $4.4 million (31 December 2021: $4.8 million) and trade and other payables amounted to $28.5 million at period-end (31 December 2021: $32.8 million). The decrease in trade and other payables is due to the reduction in expenditure incurred with suppliers for development projects.Debt facilitiesAt the start of 2022  Kenmare’s debt facilities comprised a $110 million Term Loan Facility and a $40 million RCF. The RCF was repaid in full during the period and remains available to be redrawn by the Group if needed. The first semi-annual principal repayment ($15.7 million) under the Term Loan Facility was paid in March 2022.At period-end  reported debt amounted to $93.2 million (31 December 2021: $148.1 million). This consists of the Term Loan Facility of $94.3 million  loan interest and amortisation of $1.8 million  net of transaction costs of $2.9 million. The Group is in compliance with all debt covenants as at 30 June 2022.On 20 July 2022  the RCF was extended for a year and has a final maturity date of 11 December 2023  extendable by up to a further 12 months at the lenders’ discretion. Current interest on the RCF is at LIBOR plus 5.00% per annum reducing to 4.25% from 11 December 2022.Financial outlookKenmare’s strategic priorities are to operate responsibly  deliver long-life  low-cost production  and to allocate capital efficiently  including developing accretive growth opportunities. The Group is focused on maintaining a robust and flexible balance sheet to enable it to deliver all of these goals  particularly to fund its capital investment requirements and to continue to make compelling shareholder returns.Kenmare will continue to manage its operating cost base in a conservative and sustainable manner  cognisant of inflationary pressures and other risks that face its business  in order to minimise unit costs. With supportive product markets and elevated production levels  Kenmare continues to target a first quartile position on the industry revenue to cost curve. This provides the business with increased cash flow stability and the ability to remain cash flow positive throughout the market cycle.Based on a positive market outlook we expect strong financial performance in H2  with the balance sheet continuing to strengthen.Interim dividendKenmare generated record first half profit after tax of $62.5 million in H1 2022 (H1 2021: $48.0 million). The Board has therefore approved an interim 2022 dividend of USc10.98 per share (H1 2021: USc7.29)  for a total distribution of $10.4 million (H1 2021: $8.0 million). The 2022 interim dividend has been calculated as 66.6% of 25% of H1 2022 profit after tax ($62.5 million)  in line with the intention to target a one-third/two-thirds interim/final dividend split. The financial statements do not reflect this interim dividend.The Company will pay the interim dividend on 21 October 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 23 September 2022. Irish Dividend Withholding Tax (25%) must be deducted from dividends paid by the Company  unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed exemption form to the Company’s Registrar.The dividend timetable is as follows:Announcement of interim dividend 17 August 2022 Ex-Dividend Date 22 September 2022 Record Date 23 September 2022 Currency election cut-off date 27 September 2022 Payment Date 21 October 2022Principal risks and uncertaintiesThere are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on Kenmare’s performance over the remaining six months of the 2022 financial year and which could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historic results.These principal risks and uncertainties are disclosed in Kenmare’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2021. A detailed explanation of these principal risks and uncertainties and how Kenmare seeks to mitigate these risks  can be found on pages 64 to 71 of the Annual Report 2021 under the following headings: grant and maintenance of licences  country risk  geotechnical risk  severe weather events  uncertainty over physical characteristics of the orebody  power supply and transmission risk  asset damage or loss  COVID-19  health  safety and environment  mineral resource statement risk  IT security risk  development project risk  industry cyclicality  customer concentration  foreign currency risk and aggressive cost inflation.In addition  Kenmare believes that the risks relating to global geo-political developments  which were identified as emerging risks in the Annual Report 2021  are increasing. Whilst the conflict in Ukraine was specifically identified as an emerging risk with potentially broad effect on Kenmare’s business  geo-political developments elsewhere  such as tensions between China and the USA and/or Taiwan  could also affect Kenmare’s business (for example  the ability to transport product to China). In addition  whether as a result of geo-political developments or otherwise  supply chain risks have increased  such that the ability of the Company to carry out capital projects may be affected both in relation to the timing of those projects and the costs entailed; supply chain issues may also affect the availability of critical spare parts and  in consequence of longer lead times  capital commitments may have to be brought forward.Related party transactionsThere have been no material changes in the related party transactions affecting the financial position or the performance of the Group in the period since publication of the 2021 Annual Report other than those disclosed in Note 22 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.Going concernAs stated in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements  based on the Group’s forecasts and projections  the Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future  a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly  they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.Events after the Statement of Financial Position DateInterim dividendAn interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2022 of USc10.98 per share was approved by the Board on 16 August 2022. The dividend payable of $10.4 million has not been included as a liability in these financial statements. The interim dividend is payable to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 23 September 2022.There have been no other significant events since 30 June 2022 that would have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group.Forward-looking statementsThis report contains certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them up to the time of their approval of this report  and such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties  including both economic and business risk factors  underlying any such forward-looking information.On behalf of the Board M. CARVILLDirector16 August 2022T. MCCLUSKEYDirector16 August 2022Independent Review Report to Kenmare Resources plc (“the Entity”)ConclusionWe have been engaged by the Entity to review the Entity’s condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2022 which comprises the condensed consolidated interim income statement  the condensed consolidated interim statement of other comprehensive income  the condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position  the condensed consolidated interim statement of cash flows  the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in equity  a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.Based on our review  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2022 is not prepared  in all material respects in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”) as adopted by the EU and the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (“Transparency Directive”)  and the Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) Rules 2019 (“Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland).Basis for conclusionWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (“ISRE (Ireland) 2410”) issued for use in Ireland. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries  primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters  and applying analytical and other review procedures.A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly  we do not express an audit opinion.We read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report to identify material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of consolidated financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on  or materially inconsistent with  the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the review. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.Conclusions relating to going concernBased on our review procedures  which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting  or that the Directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that have not been appropriately disclosed.This conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordance with ISRE (Ireland) 2410. However  future events or conditions may cause the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern  and the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Entity will continue in operation.Directors’ responsibilitiesThe half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of  and has been approved by  the Directors. The Directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland.The Directors are responsible for preparing the condensed set of consolidated financial statements included in the half-yearly financial report in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU.As disclosed in note 1  the annual financial statements of the Entity for the year ended 31 December 2021 are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.In preparing the condensed set of consolidated financial statements  the Directors are responsible for assessing the Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern  disclosing  as applicable  matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Entity or to cease operations  or have no realistic alternative but to do so.Our responsibilityOur responsibility is to express to the Entity a conclusion on the condensed set of consolidated financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.Our conclusion  including our conclusions relating to going concern  are based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures  as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report.The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilitiesThis report is made solely to the Entity in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the Entity in meeting the requirements of the Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland. Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Entity those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law  we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Entity for our review work  for this report  or for the conclusions we have reached.Keith WattKPMG16 August 2022Chartered Accountants1 Stokes PlaceSt.Stephen’s GreenDublin 2Group condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive incomeFor the financial period ended 30 June 2022Notes Unaudited6 Months30 June 2022$’000 Unaudited6 Months30 June 2021$’000 Revenue 2 197 294 178 249 Cost of sales 4 (95 236) (100 330) Gross profit 102 058 77 919 Other operating costs 5 (27 082) (19 159) Operating profit 74 976 58 760 Finance income 89 40 Finance costs 6 (5 724) (6 143) Foreign exchange (704) (2 014) Profit before tax 68 637 50 643 Income tax expense 7 (6 098) (2 619) Profit for the financial period and total comprehensive income for the financial period 62 539 48 024 Attributable to equity holders 62 539 48 024 $ per share $ per share Profit per share: Basic 8 0.66 0.44 Profit per share: Diluted 8 0.65 0.43The accompanying notes form part of these financial statements.Group condensed consolidated statement of financial positionAs at 30 June 2022Notes Unaudited30 June 2022$’000 Audited31 Dec 2021$’000 Assets Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 9 935 323 954 558 Right-of-use assets 10 1 541 2 136 936 864 956 694 Current assets Inventories 11 91 233 60 219 Trade and other receivables 12 67 753 74 747 Cash and cash equivalents 13 30 697 69 057 189 683 204 023 Total assets 1 126 547 1 160 717 Equity Capital and reserves attributable to the Company’s equity holders Called-up share capital 14 104 104 Share premium 545 950 545 950 Other reserves 230 359 230 539 Retained earnings 192 460 154 050 Total equity 968 873 930 643 Liabilities Non-current liabilities Bank loans 15 61 465 74 757 Lease liabilities 10 1 109 971 Provisions 17 26 572 38 999 89 146 114 727 Current liabilities Bank loans 15 31 780 73 342 Lease liabilities 10 584 1 207 Trade and other payables 16 28 549 32 768 Current tax liabilities 18 4 426 4 808 Provisions 17 3 189 3 222 68 528 115 347 Total liabilities 157 674 230 074 Total equity and liabilities 1 126 547 1 160 717The accompanying notes form part of these financial statements.On behalf of the Board:M.

Basis of preparation and going concernBasis of preparationThe annual financial statements of Kenmare Resources plc (‘the Group’) are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The Group Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended 30 June 2022 have been prepared in accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007  as amended  the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland  Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.2 of the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’  as adopted by the European Union.The financial information presented in this document does not constitute statutory financial statements. The amounts presented in the half-yearly financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2022 and the corresponding amounts for the six months ended 30 June 2021 have been reviewed but not audited.The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2021  presented herein  is an abbreviated version of the annual financial statements for the Group in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021. The Group’s annual financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021 have been filed in the Companies Registration Office and the independent auditor issued an unqualified audit report thereon. The annual report is available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com.Use of Judgements and EstimatesThe preparation of the half-yearly financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements  estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses together with disclosure of assets and liabilities. Estimates and underlying assumptions relevant to these financial statements are the same as those described in the last annual financial statements.Going ConcernThe Directors have  at the time of approving the financial statements  a reasonable expectation that the Group has or will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Based on the Group’s cash flow forecast  liquidity and solvency position the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and  therefore  they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.The Group forecast has been prepared by management with best estimates of production  pricing and cost assumptions over the period. Key assumptions upon which the Group forecast is based include a mine plan covering production using the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. Production levels for the purpose of the forecast are approximately 1.2 million tonnes per annum of ilmenite plus co-products  zircon  concentrates and rutile  over the next twelve months. Assumptions for product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers or  where contract prices are based on market prices or production is not presently contracted  prices are forecast taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise and management expectations. Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2022  taking into account the current and future running costs of the Mine and escalated by 2% per annum thereafter. Capital costs are based on the capital plans and include escalation at 2% per annum. Current operating costs and forecast capital costs take into account the current inflationary environment. The 2% inflation rate used to escalate these costs over the life of mine is an estimated long-term inflation rate.Sensitivity analysis is applied to the assumptions above to test the robustness of the cash flow forecasts for reductions in market prices  reductions in production  increases in operating costs and a combined case of the aforementioned factors. Changes in these assumptions affect the level of sales and profitability of the Group and the amount of capital required to deliver the projected production levels. As a result of this assessment  the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next 12 months.Changes in accounting policiesThe accounting policies applied in the half-yearly financial statements are those set out in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.The following new and revised standards  all of which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022  have been adopted in the current financial period;Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendment to IAS 37) effective 1 January 2022Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020 effective 1 January 2022Property  Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendment to IAS 16) effective 1 January 2022Reference to the Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3) effective 1 January 2022None of the new and revised standards have a material effect on the Group’s condensed consolidated financial statements.2.

The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators for impairment. As at 30 June 2022  the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of net assets  which is considered an indicator of impairment of assets.The Group carried out an impairment review of property  plant and equipment as at 30 June 2022. As a result of the review  and given the performance and outlook of the Group  no impairment provision was recognised in the current financial period. No impairment was recognised in the prior financial year. Given the historic volatility in product pricing and sensitivities of the forecast to the discount rate and to a lesser extent operating costs  the impairment loss of $64.8 million  which was recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 2014  was not reversed.The cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine. The basis on which the Mine is assessed is its value in use. The cash flow forecast employed for the value-in-use computation is from a life of mine financial model. The recoverable amount obtained from the financial model represents the present value of the future discounted pre-tax  pre-finance cash flows discounted at 13.0% (31 December 2021: 10.5%).Key assumptions in the value in use calculation include the following:The discount rate is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. This rate is a best estimate of the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Mine  taking into consideration country risk  currency risk and price risk. The factors comprising the cost of equity and cost of debt have changed from the year end review  in particular the risk-free rate which has increased to 2.98% (31 December 2021: 1.51%) and the equity risk premium which has increased to 6.01% (31 December 2021: 4.24%)  resulting in a discount rate of 13.0% (31 December 2021: 10.5%). The Group’s estimation of the country risk premium included in the discount rate has remained unchanged from the prior year. The Group does not consider it appropriate to apply the full current country risk premium for Mozambique to the calculation of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as it believes the specific circumstances which have resulted in the risk premium increase over the past number of years are not relevant to the specific circumstances of the Moma Mine. Hence  country risk premium applicable to the calculation of the cost of equity has been adjusted accordingly. Using a discount rate of 13.0%  the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying amount by $132.4 million (31 December 2021: $384.0 million). The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the recoverable amount. A 3.0% increase in the discount rate to 16.0% reduces the recoverable amount by $132.4 million to breakeven. The decrease in the recoverable amount from the year end review is a result of decreased cash flows over the life of mine as a result of increased forecast capital and operating costs  an increase in the discount rate from 10.5% to 13.0%  partially offset by increased forecast sales prices as detailed below.A mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi proved and probable reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine life assumption of 40 years has not changed from the year-end review. Average annual production is approximately 1.2 million tonnes (31 December 2021: 1.2 million tonnes) of ilmenite and co-products zircon  rutile and concentrates over the life of the Mine and remains unchanged from the year end review. Certain minimum stocks of final and intermediate products are assumed to be maintained at period ends.Product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers  or where contracts are based on market prices or production is not currently contracted  prices are forecasted by the Group taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise provided by TiPMC Solutions and management expectations including general inflation of 2% per annum. Forecast prices provided by TiPMC Solutions have been reviewed and found to be consistent with other external sources of information. Average forecast product sales prices have increased over the life of mine from the year-end review as a result of revised forecast pricing. A 4.5% reduction in average sales prices over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $132.4 million to breakeven.Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2022 taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and estimated forecast inflation for 2022. From 2023 onwards  operating costs are escalated by 2% per annum. Average forecast operating costs have increased from the year-end review as a result of inflation. Increased costs associated with estimated future power consumption and price for the mining in Nataka have been included in the forecast cashflows in the period. A 10.0% increase in operating costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $132.4 million to breakeven.Capital costs are based on a life of mine capital plan including inflation at 2% per annum from 2022. Forecast capital costs have increased and their scheduling changed from the year-end review based on updated capital plans required to maintain the existing plants over the life of mine. The forecast takes into account reasonable cost increases and therefore a sensitivity to this assumption  which would give rise to a reduction in the recoverable amount has not been applied.10.

The Styne House lease has a term of 10 years commencing August 2017 and rental payments are fixed for five years. This lease obligation is denominated in Euros.The lease for the electricity generators was renewed in November 2017 for a five-year period and rental payments are fixed for the five years. This lease obligation is denominated in US Dollars.In February 2019  the Group recognised a lease liability of $0.4 million for its Mozambican country office in Maputo. The lease has a seven-year term commencing February 2019 and rental payments are fixed for seven years. This lease obligation is denominated in US Dollars. The Group has discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rates. The weighted average rate applied is 7%.At each reporting date  the Company assesses whether there is any indication that right-of-use assets may be impaired. No impairment indicators were identified as at 30 June 2022 or 31 December 2021.Set out below are the carrying amounts of lease liabilities at each reporting date:Unaudited30 June 2022$’000 Audited31 Dec 2021$’000 Current 584 1 207 Non-Current 1 109 971 1 693 2 17811.

The finance documentation also provides for a Mine Closure Guarantee Facility (provided by either the existing lenders or other finance providers) of up to $40 million  with the provider(s) of such a facility sharing in the common security package. The potential total aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured under the finance documentation is therefore $190 million.The Term Loan Facility has a final maturity date of 11 March 2025. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.40% per annum. Repayment is in seven equal semi-annual instalments and the first repayment was made on 11 March 2022.On 21 July 2022 the Revolving Credit Facility was extended by 12 months and now has a final maturity date of 11 December 2023  which is extendable by a further 12 months at the lenders’ discretion. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.00% per annum (4.25% from 11 December 2022).The Group entered into a mine closure guarantee facility with Absa Bank Moçambique SA effective from 1 July 2022 for an amount of $18.9 million. This guarantee shares the security package with the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility on a pro rata and pari passu basis.The security package consists of (a) security over the Group’s bank accounts (subject to certain exceptions)  (b) pledges of the shares of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited and Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (the “Project Companies”)  (c) security over intercompany loans and (d) Mozambican law security interests over certain rights and agreements with Mozambican authorities  including over the Implementation Agreement  the Mineral Licensing Contract and the Mining Licence.The carrying amount of the secured bank accounts of the Group was $25.3 million as at 30 June 2022 (31 December 2021: $66.9 million). The shares of the Project Companies and intercompany loans are not included in the consolidated statement of financial position as they are eliminated on consolidation. They therefore do not have a carrying amount but  upon enforcement of the pledges on behalf of the lender group  the shares in the Project Companies would cease to be owned or controlled by the Group. The secured rights and agreements do not have a carrying amount. They are  however  necessary for the Project Companies to operate the Mine in Mozambique.The finance documents contain a number of representations  covenants and events of default on customary terms  the breach of which could lead to the secured parties under the finance documentation accelerating the outstanding loans and taking other enforcement steps  such as the enforcement of some or all of the security interests  which could lead  in extremis  with the Group losing its interest in the Mine. The most salient of the relevant terms that could lead to acceleration of the loans and/or enforcement of security are the financial covenants described on the subsequent page.During the period $40.0 million (31 December 2021: drawn down $20.0 million) of the Revolving Credit Facility and US$15.7 million of the Term Loan Facility was repaid. At the period-end  reported debt amounted to $93.2 million (31 December 2021: $148.1 million). This consists of the Term Loan Facility of $94.3 million (31 December 2021: $150 million)  loan interest and amortisation of $1.8 million (31 December 2021: $2.0 million)  net of transaction costs of $2.9 million (31 December 2021: $3.9 million).Reconciliation of movements of debt to cashflows arising from financing activities Unaudited30 June 2022$’000 Audited31 Dec 2021$’000 Bank Loans Balance at 1 January 148 099 145 771 Cash movements Loan interest paid (3 491) (7 147) Principal repaid (55 715) (20 000) Loan drawn down - 20 000 Non-cash movements Loan interest accrued 4 352 9 475 Balance at 30 June/31 December 93 245 148 099Financial CovenantsAs at30 June 2022 As at31 December 2021 CovenantInterest Coverage Ratio 22.39 21.8:1 Not less than 4.00:1 Net Debt to EBITDA 0.27 0.38:1 Not greater than 2.00:1 Debt Service Coverage Ratio 4.88 22.3:1 Not less than 1.20:1 Liquidity (million) $71.0 $69.1 Not less than $15.0 Reserve Tail Ratio 78% 78% Not less than 30%All financial covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement have been complied with during the period.

A corresponding amount equal to the provision is recognised as part of property  plant and equipment.The costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan  are subject to regular review and are estimated based on the net present value of estimated future cost. Mine closure costs are a normal consequence of mining  and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the Mine. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost and $0.4 million (H1 2021: $0.4 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the financial period.The main assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated future costs include:• a discount rate of 3.2% (31 December 2021: 2.1%);• an inflation rate of 2% (31 December 2021: 2%);• an estimated life of mine of 40 years (31 December 2021: 40 years). It is assumed that all licences and permits required to operate will be renewed or extended during the life of mine; and• an estimated closure cost of $34.1 million (31 December 2021: $34.1 million) and an estimated post-closure monitoring provision of $3.9 million (31 December 2021: $3.9 million).The life of mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine closure provision has been reduced by $13.5 million from 31 December 2021 to reflect a change in the discount rate from 2.1% at 31 December 2021 to 3.2% at 30 June 2022.The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the Mine closure provision. The Group uses US Treasury rates. Thirty-year US Treasury yields are the longest period for which yields are quoted. A forty-year rate to align with the estimated life of mine has been calculated by taking the average of the increase in yield from ten to twenty years and the increase in yield from twenty to thirty years and adding this average to the thirty-year treasury rate to arrive at an estimated extrapolated rate for forty years. This discount rate is deemed to provide the best estimate of the current market assessment of risk-free time value of money. Risks specific to the liability are included in the cost estimate.The Mine rehabilitation provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the Company’s liability for rehabilitating areas disturbed by mining activities. Rehabilitation costs are recognised based on the area disturbed and estimated cost of rehabilitation per hectare which is reviewed regularly against actual rehabilitation cost per hectare. Actual rehabilitation expenditure is incurred approximately twelve months after the area has been disturbed. During the financial period there was a release of $0.3 million (H1 2021: $0.3 million) to reflect the actual mine rehabilitation costs incurred  and an addition to the provision of $1.0 million (H1 2021: $0.5 million) for areas newly disturbed.Other provisions comprise an amount of $2.3 million (31 December 2021: $2.3 million) in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding  it is possible that on conclusion the final outcome may differ from management’s estimate.18.

The table does not include fair value information for other receivables  prepayments  trade payables and accruals as these are not measured at fair value as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Trade receivables which are factored through the Absa Bank facility or letters of credit which are always confirmed and discounted through the Barclays Bank facility are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Trade receivables or letters of credit where it is not known at initial recognition if they will be factored are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Group derecognises the original receivable to which the arrangement applies when payment is received from the bank as the terms of the arrangement are non-recourse. The payment to the bank by the Group’s customers are considered non-cash transactions. Trade receivables not measured at fair value are receivables whose payment is received under the sale contract credit terms.The valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 fair values is discounted cash flows  which considers the expected receipts or payments discounted using adjusted market discount rates or where these rates are not available estimated discount rates.Credit riskThe Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual circumstances of each customer. The Group also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base  including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate.Before entering into sales contracts with new customers  the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed regularly during the year.The Group’s customers have been transacting with the Group for a significant number of years  and no customers’ balances have been written off or are credit impaired at the financial period end. In monitoring customer credit risk  customers are reviewed individually and the Group has not identified any factors that would merit reducing exposure to any particular customer. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.For trade receivables measured at fair value through OCI and trade receivables measured at amortised cost  the Group allocates to each customer a credit risk grade based on data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss (including but not limited to external ratings  financial statements and available market information about customers) and applying experienced credit judgement.The movement in expected credit losses in respect of trade receivables were measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income during the period was as follows:Unaudited30 June 2022$’000 Audited31 Dec 2021$’000 Opening balance 424 199 Net remeasurement of loss allowance 199 225 Closing 623 424The increase in the loss allowance is mainly attributable to increases in industry specific externally published forward looking default rates which are used as the basis of estimating the Group’s expected credit losses. The methodology for the calculation of expected credit losses is the same as described in the last annual statements.Interest rate benchmark reformA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally  including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as “IBOR reform”). The Group has exposure to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. The Group’s main IBOR exposure at the reporting date is US LIBOR  which is administered by ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA). The alternative reference rate for US LIBOR is the US Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).On 5 March 2021  IBA stated that it will cease the publication of (i) the overnight and one  three  six and twelve months USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday 30 June 2023  and (ii) all other LIBOR settings  including the one week and two months USD LIBOR settings  immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday 31 December 2021. IBA stated that it will not have access to input data necessary to calculate LIBOR settings on a representative basis after those dates. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a separate announcement confirming that IBA had notified the FCA of its intent to cease providing all LIBOR settings. The FCA confirmed that all 35 LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative as of the dates set out by IBA.The Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its operational and risk management processes. The main risk to which the Group is exposed as a result of IBOR reform is in the amendment to the Senior Facility Agreement (SFA) with negotiation with the lender group to reflect the migration from USD LIBOR to SOFR  updating contractual terms and revising operational controls related to the migration. Financial risk is predominantly limited to interest rate risk.The Audit & Risk Committee monitors  while the Executive and senior management manages  the migration to alternative rates. Such management includes evaluation of the extent to which contracts reference IBOR  whether such contracts will need to be amended as a result of IBOR reform and how to manage communication about IBOR reform to counterparties.The Group plans to amend the terms of the SFA for purposes of migrating from USD LIBOR to SOFR prior to the discontinuance of the administration and publication of the relevant LIBOR rates by IBA. The migration to SOFR for purposes of the Group’s trade finance facilities with Absa Bank and Barclays Bank was effected through amendments entered into during the period and had no material impact.The carrying amount of financial liabilities with unreformed contracts at 30 June 2022 was $93.2 million (31 December 2021: $148.1 million).20. Share-based paymentsKenmare Restricted Share Plan (KRSP)During the financial period  632 797 (H1 2021: 689 412) shares were granted to employees under the 2022 KRSP award. The estimated fair value of the shares awarded is $3.7 million (H1 2021: $3.9 million). These share awards vest  subject to continued employment on the third anniversary or  in the case of Executive Directors and certain other staff  subject to continued employment and to the Remuneration Committee’s assessment against a discretionary underpin  on the third anniversary of grant.During the financial period  the Group recognised a share-based payment expense of $3.2 million (H1 2021: $2.1 million) comprising $1.5 million in relation to the vesting of KRSP awards during the period and $1.7 million in relation to an adjustment to reflect the value of awards exercised during the period.During the period  awards in respect of 540 389 shares were exercised at a cost of $3.4 million. These figures do not include shares in respect of dividend equivalents which are added to awards on vesting.The movement in the condensed statement of changes in equity of $0.2 million (H1 2021: $0.1 million) is made up of the share-based payment expense of $3.2 million (H1 2021: $2.1 million) net of the cost of settlement of the equity-based shares of $3.4 million (H1 2021: $2.2 million).21. Contingent liabilitiesThe Group  like other businesses operating in Mozambique  is subject to tax audits by the Mozambican Tax Authorities. These audits may review a range of matters including corporate income tax  indirect taxes and transaction related issues  and can take a number of years to complete. The Mozambican Tax Authority conducted an audit of the tax obligations of the KMML Mozambique Branch in relation to the years 2015 to 2017. The Group is liaising with the Tax Authority to address matters raised during the audit. It is not possible to estimate with certainty the timing of any future resolution or possible outcomes.A provision of $2.3 million (31 December 2021: $2.3 million) is included in the financial statements in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding  it is possible that on conclusion the outcome may differ from management’s estimates. Other tax matters raised during the audit are likewise still outstanding. No provision has been made in these financial statements in relation to the other tax matters as the Group does not consider that there is any material future probable loss.22. Related party transactionsTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries  which are related parties  have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.Apart from existing remuneration arrangements there were no material transactions or balances between the Group and its key management personnel or members of their close families during the period under review.23.

The collaborations with Le Bonheur Children's Hospital  the Wisconsin Health Information Organization (WHIO)  and Yale University will uncover and leverage the power of education and real-world evidence (RWE) to address this research gap  expand awareness  and enact positive change in the health outcomes of individuals with seizure clusters.Seizure clusters are episodes of increased seizure activity  during which two or more seizures occur within a 24-hour period. It is estimated that more than 150 000 people in the U.S. with uncontrolled epilepsy also experience seizure clusters. Due to their unpredictable nature  these disruptive events can leave those living with epilepsy feeling anxious  worried  frustrated  or isolated – further fueling a decline in mental health for this patient population.""Our real-world evidence and educational collaborations with Le Bonheur Children's Hospital  the Wisconsin Health Information Organization  and Yale University illustrate our desire to meaningfully contribute to how physicians  patients  and the overall care system think about and treat seizure clusters. This includes how we frame and account for the value of treatments within the healthcare ecosystem "" said Brad Chapman  Head  U.S. Epilepsy and Rare Syndromes at UCB. ""We know that rescue medications that allow adults and adolescents to get back to their daily activities quickly is especially important  whether it's in the classroom or in day-to-day life  and we are committed to delivering solutions that further this ambition.""The project with Le Bonheur Children's Hospital focuses on improving the lived epilepsy patient experience by developing resources designed specifically for patients and caregivers that address the importance of the proper use of rescue medications outside the hospital. This ""Ask the Experts"" project seeks to combat identified gaps in patient and caregiver education and information as it relates to epilepsy and more specifically seizure clusters through the development of an educational resource and a video.""We know most seizure clusters happen at home or during other daily activities; treating seizure clusters where and when they happen is critical for better patient outcomes "" said Dr. James Wheless  BScPharm  MD  FAAP  FAAN  FAES  Co-Director of the Neuroscience Institute  Le Bonheur Children's Hospital. ""As school starts and with COVID-19 still a medical concern  it's of the utmost importance that we prepare students to successfully start their school year with a seizure action plan and appropriate rescue medications so they can prepare their teachers and school nurses to act when the cluster starts.""The collaboration with WHIO aims to understand the economic and clinical impact of undertreating seizure clusters and to explore drivers of better outcomes. This project will analyze retrospective claims at a state level to examine prescribing trends  healthcare utilization  costs  access barriers  and disease prevalence.Dr. George Morris  MD  MPH  FAAN  FAES  epileptologist in the Milwaukee-area  and valued partner in the WHIO Project  explains  ""Epilepsy's impact on a person's health and their quality of life is significantly affected by seizure clusters. The health risk from aspiration and terrifying experience of the patient  family  and friends is unique to epilepsy. This project uses a unique data source to see the comprehensive effects across nearly all Wisconsin patients. We are excited to know what factors may help reduce seizure clusters to inform providers and patients about best practices.""The Yale University Project  Reduction of Seizures through Education and Support (ROSES)  aims to increase understanding of seizure cluster management  to contribute new insights to clinical management and patient-centric care  and improve overall epilepsy quality care. Specifically  this study is designed to assess the impact of seizure rescue medications  treatment patterns  healthcare resource utilization  clinic quality improvement tools (i.e.  Seizure Action Plans)  and the patient/caregiver experience.About Epilepsy1-4Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder of the brain. It is the fourth most common neurological condition worldwide and affects approximately 65 million people. In the U.S. more than 3.4 million people have epilepsy. Anyone can develop epilepsy; it occurs across all ages  races and genders  and is defined as one or more unprovoked seizures with a risk of further seizures.About Seizure Clusters5-10Of the one third of patients living with uncontrolled epilepsy  it is estimated that more than 150 000 people in the U.S. with refractory epilepsy also experience seizure clusters. Seizure clusters are broadly defined as acute episodes of consecutive seizures that occur within a short period of time with a patient regaining consciousness during the interictal period. These clusters are also distinguishable from a person's typical seizure pattern. Other names for seizure clusters include acute-repetitive seizures (ARS)  serial seizures  crescendo seizures  and seizure flurries  which highlight the repetitive nature of the seizures. Seizure clusters are a form of seizure emergency that can evolve into prolonged seizures or status epilepticus.About UCB in EpilepsyUCB has a rich heritage in epilepsy with over 20 years of experience in the research and development of anti-epileptic drugs.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.ReferencesCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

Our revenue for January–June was EUR 2.1 million  which is about 31 percent higher than in the corresponding period of the previous year. EUR 1.4 million of the turnover was accumulated in the first quarter and EUR 0.7 million in the second quarter.The net result of the first half of the year was weakened by the increase in material costs in particular  which we were unable to transfer to the previously agreed-upon fixed customer prices. In new tenders  we have taken the changes in material costs into account more strongly than before. Our operating result for January–June was EUR -2.4 million  compared to EUR -2.2 million a year ago.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused global turbulence in the energy sector. Europe’s dependence on the energy imported from Russia demands quick solutions from energy industry operators for the coming winter. At the same time  it has awakened both cities and companies as well as EU decision-makers to think about sustainable and flexible energy solutions further into the future. Interest towards solar heat has grown when energy availability and self-sufficiency issues have risen alongside the climate targets. As a result of the recent market development  the relative price competitiveness of solar heat has continued to improve  despite the fact that the material costs of solar heating systems have also increased.Story continuesSolar heat is typically used locally  which reduces expensive power transmission line and battery investments. In addition  the large-scale use of solar heat accelerates the transition to clean energy production when emission-free electricity of limited availability can be utilised elsewhere than in heat production.The increased uncertainty about the availability and costs of energy and materials complicates the timing of the customers’ investment decisions. Energy investments are currently more expensive than before  but the pressure towards renewable energy investments is constantly increasing.During the reporting period  we signed a contract with Newheat SAS on the delivery of a solar thermal field worth around EUR 3 million to Verdun  France. This is already our fourth system delivery to Newheat who  as the owner and operator of the solar thermal system  sells heat with long-term contracts to its customers  in this case to Lactalis Group’s whey powder factory. We are pleased with Newheat’s choice to continue cooperation with us.Towards the end of the reporting period  we had the pleasure of announcing a long-prepared pilot project for the mining industry in Latin America. The delivery worth around 0.2 million euros is significantly more important than its monetary value  as it is Savosolar's first customer in the mining industry and the first customer in Latin America  where even the world’s leading mining companies are currently actively looking for low-emission energy sources.We have continued to develop our products and offerings by  among other things  strengthening our ability to integrate clean sources of heat and our competence to support the customers’ project development.The future of solar heat looks bright. Our customers who have switched to the utilisation of solar heat have been very satisfied with their investment decisions  especially in the current situation. Even though the exceptionally high cost level may hold back all energy investment decisions in the short term  I see that the rise in energy prices and the availability risks will keep interest towards solar heat high and speed up decisions to switch to low-cost and truly clean renewable solar heat.”SAVOSOLAR AS A COMPANYSavosolar Plc is a Finnish public limited liability company listed in Nasdaq First North Growth Market Sweden and Nasdaq First North Growth Market Finland that designs and supplies large solar thermal systems for district heat producers and industry. The systems are based on Savosolar’s highly efficient solar heat collectors  at the heart of which are Savosolar’s proprietary optically coated direct flow absorbers. With this leading and patented technology  Savosolar helps its customers to produce renewable and competitive clean energy on a global scale. According to the information available to the company’s executive management  Savosolar’s collectors are the most efficient large solar heat collectors in the word.Savosolar helps organisations and companies to reduce their carbon emissions with clean thermal energy.Savosolar’s registered office and production plant are located in Mikkeli  Finland  in addition to which the company also has an office in Vantaa  Finland  and subsidiaries in Denmark and Germany  as well as offices in France and China. In its sales activities  Savosolar also utilises partners who are familiar with the local markets. The company has such partners in Europe  China  Latin America and Australia.ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR THE HALF-YEAR REPORTThis half-year report is unaudited. The release has been prepared in accordance with the Finnish Accounting Standards (FAS) using the same principles as in the 2021 financial statements. The comparison figures refer to the corresponding period in 2021  unless otherwise indicated.DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS IN JANUARY–JUNE 2022RevenueSavosolar’s revenue for January–June grew by 31 per cent and amounted to EUR 2.1 (1.6) million  returning to the level preceding the previous year’s market downfall. Revenue for April–June was EUR 0.7 (0.9) million.It is typical of project-based operations that the revenue of individual quarters and half-years may vary depending on the degree of completion of the project deliveries.Significant orders and new contracts for the reporting periodIn March  Savosolar signed a contract with Newheat SAS on the delivery of a solar thermal field worth around EUR 3 million to Verdun  France. Once completed  the system will produce heat for Lactalis Group’s whey powder factory  being the largest solar heating system in France for industrial process heat. The system is due to be commissioned at the end of this year  and the field will be handed over to the customer in the spring of 2023.In June  Savosolar signed an agreement with Jorgensen Thermal Solutions ApS on the delivery of a solar thermal field in Sonora  Mexico. Jorgensen will act as the main contractor in the project that  when completed  will supply process heat for a mining facility of Mexicana De Cobre S.A. The solar field delivered by Savosolar is about 900 square metres in size  and its value for Savosolar is about EUR 0.2 million. Works for delivery will begin in 2022  and the commissioning of the plant will take place in 2023.The solar thermal heating system we delivered last year to Guangzhou Power Supply Bureau  Guangdong Power Grid Co. in China was commissioned in June.Savosolar’s order backlog at the end of the period year stood at around EUR 1.5 (1.1) million. At the end of the reporting period  the value of the identified active sales targets for the upcoming few years amounted to about EUR 130 (145) million  of which projects in the planning and tendering stage accounted for EUR 34.6 million. (31.12.2021: about EUR 15 million). The value of projects in the planning and tendering stage increased especially by tenders submitted for the mining industry process heating.Costs and earningsSavosolar’s costs related to materials and services during January–June 2022 totalled EUR 2.1 (1.4) million. Material costs were increased by the rising price of materials and components.Personnel costs amounted to EUR 1.3 (1.2) million. Other operating expenses remained unchanged  totalling EUR 1.0 (1.0) million.The operating result (EBIT) for January–June 2021 declined and amounted to EUR -2.4 (-2.2) million. The operating result for April–June was EUR -1.2 (-1.1) million.

The authorisation is valid until 30 September 2026. Of the authorisation 81 183 075 shares were remaining on 30 June 2022.GENERAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY FACTORS CONCERNING OPERATIONSThe most significant risks involved in Savosolar's business are the ability to win new projects to achieve growth in line with the strategy  the sufficiency of the necessary working capital  and the ability to increase the efficiency of operations so as to turn the operations profitable.The war in Ukraine has increased uncertainty concerning the availability and prices of materials and components. No Russian or Ukrainian components are directly used in Savosolar’s products. However  the war situation can maintain exceptionally high prices material and component prices and prolonged delivery times. If continued for a long time  these may slow down the growth of Savosolar’s business and the improvement of profitability. On the other hand  the rise in energy prices and the reduction of the use of Russian fossil fuels are estimated to have a positive effect on the demand for renewable energy  which also facilitates the development of Savosolar's business.The company’s Board of Directors monitors the development of the company’s profitability and cash flow actively and  together with the company’s management  seeks the best solutions to develop the company towards profitable long-term business. The Board of Directors continuously considers the sufficiency of financing as an important part of the company’s growth strategy. Considering the recent favourable development for the company and the industry  the Board is confident that the company will be able to raise the necessary financing in the form on equity and debt capital to achieve the growth and profitability in line with its strategy.However  it cannot be guaranteed that the volume and profitability of the company’s business will grow sufficiently and that the company can gain enough supplementary finance just on time and with terms and conditions that are favourable enough for the present shareholders. In case the company does not succeed in generating growth and improving its profitability and/or raising additional financing to meet the needs of business  the company may be forced to postpone  cut back or terminate operations.STRATEGY AND LONG-TERM GOALSSavosolar’s intention is to help organisations and companies to reduce their carbon emissions with clean renewable thermal energy.The company’s vision is to be the first-choice supplier of large solar installations on a global scale.The company’s strategic objective is to grow substantially and be the leading supplier of large solar thermal installations where quality and efficiency matter the most. This means large-scale systems such as solar district heating (SDH) and solar heat for industrial processes (SHIP). In industry  the principal segments are the mining  paper and food industry and greenhouses.In implementing its strategy  the key factors for the company are its proprietary solar collector technology and knowledge of system design as well as its strong local and global partners. The geographical focus of operations continues to remain in Europe  but the company is actively seeking partners and marketing its products and services outside Europe as well. Savosolar delivers energy systems on a turnkey basis in line with its strategy in collaboration with its partners. The partners in different countries also serve as a sales channel for Savosolar’s products.MARKET ENVIRONMENTUntil now  underlying clean renewable energy production has  above all  been the fight against global warming. The European Commission’s proposal for a directive on renewable energy sources of July 2021 (Fit for 55) aims at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% from the 1990 level by 2030. The EU’s target is to be carbon neutral by 2050. The European Union has also allocated 30 per cent of its EUR 1 800 billion support instrument for recovery from the corona pandemic for 2021–2023 to climate actions  i.e.  for strengthening the EU Green Deal programme. Emission reduction and carbon neutrality targets have been widely set in other parts of the world as well.In the emission reduction targets  the public discussion has largely focused on electrification with solar and wind power. In Europe  for example  heating accounts for about 50% of total energy use  traffic about 30% and direct electricity use only about 20%  and more than half of Europe’s carbon emissions are caused by heating.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused global turbulence in the energy sector  the effects of which are particularly visible in Europe. The need to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy has quickly emerged alongside the climate targets. Concern about the price and availability of energy  especially in heat production  has given rise to measures to secure energy supply in preparation for the coming winter  but at the same time  it has increased interest towards renewable energy.Even though the utilisation of emission-free solar heat in district heating and industrial processes has increased in recent years  according to the International Energy Agency (IEA)  only around 11 percent of heating is produced with renewable energy worldwide. In electricity production  renewable energy sources account for about 29 percent  according to IEA. Electrification is a strong trend  but it is clear that the electricity produced solely by means of renewable forms of energy is not nearly enough to replace all fossil energy  nor to meet the needs of the green hydrogen economy of the future. By increasing the utilisation of solar heat in heating  renewable electricity can be utilised more and faster in  for example  electrified traffic.In May 2022  the EU Commission published an extensive package  the RePowerEU plan  which seeks solutions on how to transition away from Russian fossil energy to clean energy as soon as possible. Among other things  the Commission proposes to increase the renewable energy target of the Energy Efficiency Directive from 40% to 45%. As one concrete measure  the Commission proposes speeding up the permit processes for renewable energy projects.In the same context with the RePower communication  the Commission announced a solar energy strategy that aims to ensure the utilisation of the full potential of solar energy in order to reach the climate and energy targets of the European Green Deal Programme. The Member States should speed up the deployment of solar electricity and the utilisation of large heat pumps  geothermal energy  and solar heat. The strategy highlights increasing the use of solar heat especially in district heating.According to a report prepared on the production of district heat in Narbonne  France  solar heat has the lowest life-cycle emissions among the clean sources of energy (source: Inuk ST Plant CO2 footprint study 2021 / Ademe). No rare earth metals are used in Savosolar’s solar collectors  and the collector materials are completely recyclable. The strengths of solar heat also include the Europe-based manufacturing of solar thermal technology and the smaller need for land compared to  for example  photovoltaic panels.In its roadmap announced in June  Solar Heat Europe has calculated that solar heat capacity will triple from 2021 to 2030. This would mean that at the end of the current decade  emission-free solar heat would have replaced around 12 billion cubic meters of Russian gas. At the same time  more than 250 000 green transition jobs would be created in Europe. According to the roadmap  the greatest potential is in industrial process heating  especially in food production  of which around 10 percent could already be covered by solar heat in 2030.The goal of increasing energy self-sufficiency and reducing emissions further reinforces the need for the joint use of different forms of energy and heat production. The flexibility of energy systems  the optimisation of the use of different energy sources and the possibilities for energy storage will grow in significance. Solar heat is well-suited for various kinds of heat co-generation systems  and it can be cost-effectively stored by means of water reservoirs.The market for large solar thermal systems with a temperature of less than one hundred degrees has a limited number of skilled turnkey suppliers that operate globally. Savosolar is the technology and quality leader in this segment.Savosolar Plc's financial reporting in 2022Savosolar’s business review for January–September will be published on 26 October 2022.The financial reports will be published in Finnish and English.SAVOSOLAR PLCBoard of DirectorsMore information:CEO Jari VarjotiePhone: +358 400 419 734E-mail: jari.varjotie@savosolar.comANNEXES1 Comparison by reporting period2 Income statement3 Balance sheet4 Cash flow statement5 Calculation of changes in equity6 Financial ratios and calculation of key figuresSavosolar in briefSavosolar with its highly efficient collectors and large-scale solar thermal systems has taken solar thermal technology to the next level.

A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil3  which may support future regulatory submissions in this group if VLA1553 is approved in adults.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “This is an extremely important milestone for our VLA1553 program and we are very proud to be the first company worldwide that has begun submission of a BLA for a chikungunya vaccine candidate. Chikungunya is a major public health threat that continues to grow  and no vaccine or specific treatments are currently available for this debilitating disease. We will continue to work assiduously to bring VLA1553 to market as soon as possible.”Valneva is currently targeting the end of 2022 for completion of the BLA submission. Once all portions of the application have been submitted and if the filing is accepted  the FDA will determine priority review eligibility and the action date which the FDA will target to complete its evaluation.This rolling BLA submission is part of the accelerated approval pathway agreed upon with the FDA in 20204. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the first half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in 72-92% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20325. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 100 countries. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas6 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.Story continuesAbout VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 120 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20227 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20228.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15539. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201910  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to regulatory approval of VLA1553  timing and plans for clinical programs and product candidates and revenue forecasts.

Paris and Thorigne-Fouillard  France – Aug. 18  2022: Kalima Client Side Smart Contract Now Capable to Execute Lightning Transactions.,Kalima Client Side Smart Contract Now Capable to Execute Lightning Transactionspress releasePRESS RELEASE. Paris and Thorigne-Fouillard  France – Aug. 18  2022: Kalima Client Side Smart Contract Now Capable to Execute Lightning Transactions. Kalima and Kerlink to present a demonstration on how to accelerate the adoption of Smart Contracts for Enterprise and the Internet of Things (IoT) at Surfin’ Bitcoin event. During the Surfin’ Bitcoin event  which will be held in Biarritz from Aug. 25 to 27 2022  Kalima [FR60749951927]  a provider of blockchain solutions for Enterprise and the Internet of Things and Kerlink ((AKLK – FR0013156007)  a specialist in solutions dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT)  will perform a technical demonstration of the combination of blockchain and cryptocurrencies for the execution of Smart Contracts  to accelerate their adoption by enterprises.IoT and enterprise-oriented Smart Contracts using Bitcoin  through the Lightning NetworkThe Lightning Network is a layer 2 decentralized network designed for instant micropayments on Bitcoin. Layer 2 solutions act as the overlay of an already existing blockchain and solve the problems of transaction scalability and speed that the main blockchain (layer 1) cannot address effectively enough. This feature of the Lightning Network technically enables users to realize instant  high-volume micropayments in Bitcoins. Until now  no technical solution has met this need for Smart Contracts in the Bitcoin network.Kalima and Kerlink are working together on a new solution for Smart Contracts  based on the Kalima Blockchain industrial protocol  specifically designed for enterprises and IoT  which will enable Lightning Network (Bitcoin) microtransactions. The goal is simple: make Bitcoin payments possible using the Lightning Network layer and authenticate/secure enterprise and IoT data  thanks to Kalima Smart Contracts put in place.The Kalima protocol therefore brings the ability to embed blockchain in connected objects  to directly process the data in the sensor  and to add value to it (for example contextualization)  considering its native authenticated and traceable nature. The differentiator of Kalima lies in its ability to run its Smart Contracts at the edge  and thus process data at the closest point in the company’s processes (the sensor)  rather than having a cluster of data stored and processed in the Cloud.The Kalima Smart Contracts then work “on top” of the Lightning Network  and the data is kept outside of Bitcoin transactions and of circuits and nodes that make up the Lightning Network. Calling it a Layer 3 solution for Bitcoin offered by the Kalima protocol would even make sense  given the protocol’s features.On this basis  Kalima and Kerlink will demonstrate a technical proof-of-concept (POC)  in which a Kalima-embedded Kerlink LoRaWAN® gateway will manage “on-chain” data. The gateway will grant the transmission of data collected by sensors to the central platform in charge of data analysis (Cloud computing scenario)  or the processing and filtering of data at the edge (within the gateways)  and the transmission of crucial data only (Edge computing scenario).In this solution:The Bitcoin blockchain is used to manage and guarantee property rights  access rights and avoid double-spending problems The Lightning Network is used to scale micro-payment transactions (speed and volume)  andThe Kalima / Kerlink combination adds value to the gateway  limiting resource consumption and delivering response times and transaction volumes compatible with industry requirements.Technical demonstration based on a real-world experience at Surfin’ BitcoinFrom Aug. 25 to 27  during the Surfin’ Bitcoin event in Biarritz  Kalima and Kerlink will show a concrete IoT use case of Smart Contracts for Lightning Network and Bitcoin.The workshop will demonstrate how the Kalima protocol  through the execution of Smart Contracts in a Kerlink LoRaWAN® gateway  can trigger micropayments in Bitcoin on the Lightning Network  fitting IoT scenarios and parameters.The focus of the PoC will be set on the protection of employees and workers  and more particularly on the issue of Internal Air Quality (IAQ) management within companies’ working spaces. The scenario will highlight how the degradation of air quality is detected by a sensor that instantly transmits the alert to the company. Upon the reception of this alert  the company will be instructed to immediately take the necessary and appropriate measures to effectively respond to this degradation. A simple response from the team  such as ventilating the building by opening the windows  will quickly bring the IAQ back to its normal level. This active behavior of regularly improving the air quality in the building  will then be rewarded  in this case with Bitcoin granted to the buildings’ management team(s).This workshop will concretely illustrate the real-world technical feasibility of the Kalima / Kerlink solution and will present a simple and virtuous use case  made possible by this technical enabler.About KerlinkKerlink Group is a leading global provider of connectivity solutions for the design  deployment and operation of public and private networks dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT).

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today  Constantin Baack. Please go ahead.Constantin BaackThank you  operator  and good afternoon  and good morning  everyone. This is Constantin Baack  CEO of MPC Container Ships  and I would like to welcome you to our Q2 2022 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today to discuss MPC Container Ships second quarter earnings. This morning  we have issued a stock market announcement covering MPCC's second quarter results for the period ending June 30  2022. The release  as well as the accompanying presentation for this session  are available on the investor media section of our website.Please be advised that the material provided in our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements and indicative figures. Actual results may differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements  due to the risk and uncertainties associated with our business.Before I start with the presentation  let me direct a few words as a little preamble. We are pleased to report another strong quarter for MPC Container Ships  in which we have been able to continue to sustainably grow our earnings and profits amid macro uncertainties. Consequently  we have announced a recurring dividend for the second quarter 2022  which is around 15% higher than in the previous quarter. Year-to-date MPCC has as such declared dividends of more than $350  million emphasizing our commitment to return capital to shareholders. Despite geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties  the container charter market continues to be historically strong. We'll touch on the market in more detail as we go through  but I would like to emphasize that in particular  our segment of the container market is still robust at elevated levels  although charter periods have decreased slightly over the quarter. Nevertheless  charter rates are still at multiple of pre-pandemic levels  and available tonnage remains very thin.And on that note  I would like to start with today's presentation  commencing with Q2 year-to-date company highlights  followed by a market update  and concluding with a company outlook. Turning to Slide 4  which provides a snapshot of our key pillars in terms of fleet  financial standing  strategic focus  and corporate setup. As one of the leading intraregional tonnage provider  we presently own and operate a fleet of 68 vessels  which includes our four new buildings  and JV vessels  with a total capacity of roughly 150 000 TU. Over the past years  and past quarters  we have rolled out a clear and solid charting strategy  creating value for our shareholders. Over the past quarters  we have focused on reshuffling the balance sheet  and we now have a very solid balance sheet  with moderate to low leverage and 34 unencumbered vessels providing us with a high flexibility and discretion for our capital allocation decisions  in particular  the ability to return capital to investors. We have furthermore locked in long-term charters in order to build a sizable contract or charter contract and projected EBITDA backlog of $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion  respectively.Shipping is a cyclical and certainly capital-intensive business  and therefore  we believe that having a very clear and rational set of principles when it comes to decision-making and capital allocation  is key and is required to continue to develop our company. And we firmly believe we have walked the talk in that respect by executing on a clear strategy  which centers around mitigation of residual value risk  and placing an emphasis on the development - or sorry  on the deployment of capital in certain phases  and placing an emphasis on returning capital to shareholders in other phases. And that remains our clear priority going forward. In addition  and finally for this slide  we continue to operate in our well-established corporate setup. We put high priority on transparent corporate governance  strong ESG commitment  and certainly our strong execution capabilities.Please turn to the next slide  Page 5 of the presentation. As already alluded to in my initial words  we are pleased to report a strong financial performance in Q2 2022. As you can see on the left-hand side  in the table  with basically all KPIs significantly above the compared period in last year  both in terms of performance indicators  but also balance sheet items as illustrated by the various multiples shown in the table on this slide. From a performance standpoint  at $152 million  revenues were around 2.2 times  and hence  significantly above the Q2 2021 levels. Similarly  EBITDA  and also earnings per share  came in significantly above prior year’s levels. As I said throughout the bench  most of the KPIs have improved. That also includes some operational KPIs like vessel utilization  and also the average TCE that we were able to generate during this quarter. Furthermore  on the back of that  we have also increased our revenue and EBITDA guidance for the full year 2022 to the range of $570 million to 585 million when it comes to revenues  and $470 million to $490 million when it comes to EBITDA for 2022. Looking at the financial position of the company  as per end of Q2  we had a cash balance of around $86 million  and the same applies on a positive note  to the development of our equity ratio  now standing at 73%  and the financial leverage at 22%  both improvements compared to last quarter  but also to the second quarter 2021. Further details on our Q2 financials are made available in the appendix of this presentation  and are also accessible through our website via our Q2 financial report.Now  on the right-hand side  a few year-to-date updates information. And I will not run through all of them  but let me highlight a few. Again  the update of the guidance I had already mentioned  we have also seen improvement of many of the operational KPIs  a continued focus in a market that still is affected by certain COVID implications  in particular in Asia  but also by inflation  as one example. We continuously focus on OpEx and CapEx and  of course  seafarers welfare. We have concluded six dry dockings year-to-date 2022  with another seven likely to happen in the second half of this year. We have executed on our distribution plan  as mentioned previously. Year-to-date  $271 million in dividends have been declared and distributed to shareholders until that date. And today  we have declared  firstly  a recurring dividend of $0.15 per share  or roughly $67 US million for Q2. And we have also declared an event-driven distribution of $0.04 per share  or roughly $17 million US. That has been resolved by the board  and whilst in our earlier press release today  we have still mentioned that the handover of Serafina  which is linked to this event-driven distribution  is pending. It has  in the meantime  been successfully handed over  and therefore concluded today.On that note  let me continue with the next page  basically running you through our value approach  with three strategic pillars being distributions  financial flexibility  and accretive growth measures. I already stressed that we’ve placed a clear emphasis on returning capital to investors. At the moment  we have - we look at a very strong cash generation and EBITDA backlog  and we have  again  increased our dividend for this quarter compared to the previous quarters. We are committed to our very clear and stringent distribution policy of distributing 75% of adjusted net profit as a recurring distribution on a quarterly basis. In addition  and to the point I mentioned just earlier on the AS Serafina  we will also continue to selectively consider the sale of vessels  if accretive  and if we believe the price is attractive in this market environment  and then also distribute capital back to investors on that basis. Furthermore  and obviously subject to the share price development  we would also  as part of our distribution strategy  consider share buybacks  but again  that is subject to share price development over time. Financial flexibility  we operate on  I would argue  an industry low leverage of roughly 20%. We have done debt repayments of $45 million year-to-date  and the debt outstanding  on a gross basis  is $190 million as per the balance sheet date Q2  with the net debt position being around $100 million as per the balance sheet date end of Q2. We will maintain and put a clear emphasis on maintaining a very high balance sheet flexibility  which includes unencumbered vessels or a large number of vessels being unencumbered  and also having ideally flexible instruments like the two revolving credit facilities that we have in place at hand. In addition  there are no debt maturities until 2024. So  we have a very clear and transparent runway when it comes to our debt obligations and our flexibility.Finally  and very importantly  we will continue to adhere to a very rational portfolio management approach  as evidenced by the selective sale of certain vessels. We have sold and handed over three vessels for around $106 million in proceeds in the first quarter this year. And the AS Serafina  which has effectively been handed over now in Q3  but as also been alluded to earlier  will generate  or has actually generated $34 million in gross proceeds. And out of that  we will add dividend out and pay this event-driven distribution in connection with the recurring dividend in the course of September. Furthermore  we have also executed on our selective fleet renewal. We will always adhere to our principle of mitigation of residual value risk. So  we have done so in the two new building projects that we have executed in year-to-date 2022  one being two 5 500 TU vessels  where we look at a CapEx of around $144 million  and an EBITDA backlog roughly in the same figure. So  full derisking over the initial charter. We believe that is an attractive and interesting way to allocate capital selectively  but only in conjunction with a charter commitment.Furthermore  we have announced the contracting of two carbon-neutral new buildings  1 300 TU  where we look at CapEx of around $80 million  with a very solid 15-year charter against this commitment  with an EBITDA backlog of around $140 million. So  those would be transactions that we deem accretive and attractive  but we believe they will have to be very selectively chosen going forward. As I mentioned earlier  the clear priority in terms of capital allocation remains on the distribution  and any commitment we have taken so far on those two new buildings has zero impact on our ability to pay dividends and the volume of our dividends going forward for the next couple of years.On that note  let me move forward to the next slide  Slide 7  where we have kind of illustrated the distributions of dividends year-to-date. From left to right  it’s the dividends we have paid in in February and March as event-driven and recurring  the dividend we have paid end of May  and the dividend that is expected by the end of September 2022. The grayish part are event-driven distributions or dividends related to vessel sales. And the blue part of the column relates to the recurring dividend. As you can see  the recurring dividend in line with our improved profitability  has increased quarter-by-quarter  and we expect that to be very solid going forward on the back of our existing charter backlog. The cumulative yield  looking at today's market cap and the dividends paid year-to-date  or announced today  translates into roughly 33%  which is a very significant yield in our perspective. And overall  we have cumulative distributions over around $355 million or $3.5 billion NOK year-to-date on that basis. Or accumulative distribution in NOK per share of just a shade below 8 NOK for 2022 so far.Let me now continue with a short market update. Recently  geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties have increased globally. There are certainly two market developments  being inflationary pressure from the COVID-19 rescue packages  as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict that put significant upward pressure on certain prices  energy prices  et cetera and simultaneously put pressure on the global economy. Consequently  the general macro-outlook in terms of GDP growth has been revised downwards. Having said that  if you look at the container market  that is now on Slide #9  the weakening of the global economic environment  and the induced market uncertainty  has also had some impact on the container vessel industry. And this is visible in particular with the slight softening of freight rates  as can be seen on the top left of this chart. At the same time  rate and also congestions  as well as disruptions on the right-hand side  remain at record levels. So  whilst there is a softening  the level is still extremely high on both the disruption figures  as well as the overall freight rates. As you can see on the top left  especially spot rates  so the red line is the SCFI  and the blue line is the CCFI. So  one is the spot rates  and one is the contract rates. So  longer-term rates  especially the spot rates  have come down. However  as I mentioned  freight rates remain at very high levels historically  and certainly well above pre-COVID levels as well. On the right-hand side  you can see port congestion  which remains at record high levels. Will the situation improve anytime soon? I doubt it. While port congestion  for example  at the US west coast  has improved somewhat  it remains at record levels at the US east coast  and certainly driven by Russia-Ukraine conflict  and COVID-19 policies in Asia. It is also at record levels in the EU  as well as Asia.Please turn now  though  to Slide 10  where we now drill a bit deeper on the intricacies of the charter market and vessel availability. While freight rates have already softened somewhat  time charter rates are still near record high. The reason is that with the market surge over the past 24 months  vessel availability has decreased to almost negligible levels  as you can see on the right-hand side. Usually  if you move into a new year  start of the year  you have around 1 500 vessels available to the charter market across sizes and sectors  and that has been reduced significantly due to the significant number of fixtures that have been concluded over the course of the last couple of months  in particular  the first quarter of this year. So  going forward  we expect for the rest of the year  way fewer fixtures than one would usually see  leading to a stability in the charter market. And also  for 2023  we do not expect to see anywhere near the 1 500 vessels that would usually be available to the charter market in historic years. We believe that will be below 500 vessels based on our own analysis. Having said that  also in terms of idle vessels  we are at a very low point. Only 66 vessels are idle. A lot of vessels are also in dry dock situations. So  we are certainly positive when it comes to vessel availability  and hence stability of the market. That relates to time charter rates and simple vessel availability  if we now look at - more specifically also at charter periods and re-delivery windows  as well as forward fixtures  which is something that we have stressed over the last quarters in our quarterly reporting. We have seen quite a contraction in charter periods. So  rates remain extremely stable  but periods have come down somewhat  which is also linked to the fact that there's more hesitance and somewhat uncertainty on the side of the liners  not necessarily because there are more vessels available to the market  or there's less demand. So  we clearly see that bit on the left-hand side  and on the right lane  where you see the reduction in charter periods that is obviously a development that is a downturn compared to last quarter. However  still at very  very - historically  very high rates. And therefore  we believe this is nothing to be overly concerned about going forward. So  periods are still prolonged compared to previous years  and fixtures still get done. However  both the periods have been a bit shorter  as well as the forward-fixing activity  and that's on the right-hand side  has also come down a bit. During the first quarter  we have fixed 18 out of our 24 open positions for this year. Q2  we have only done one fixture  and we have five more fixtures ahead for the rest of the year. So  we see that there's a bit less traction when it comes to forward fixing  and we have a bit more back to normality where you fix vessels 30 to 40 days ahead of charter expiry.On that note  let me turn from a more specific charter market - from charter market details to the bigger picture in terms of supply and demand development. We do see a healthy midterm outlook in particular for our size and segment. On the left-hand side here  you can see the overall market where there's obviously a significant supply growth versus a demand growth that is lagging behind. It’s expected to lag behind for the years to come. Having said  that does not factor in any implications from new regulation  such as slow steaming  which we expect will be a very tangible reaction by the market. And if you listen to the CEOs of the big liner companies  everyone expects that to impact the capacity in the market by somewhere between 5% and 15%  depending on the trade  depending on the vessel size  et cetera. So  that is not factored in here. And we also believe that there might be a bit of slippage when it comes to vessel deliveries into the market. So  this is a static analysis for the total market  which we believe still has some headroom to develop  and the gap between supply and demand coming down. On the right-hand side  very specifically  and encouraging from our standpoint  is the supply-demand situation for our intraregional trades  the trades in which we are involved. We look at a still fairly low order book when it comes to the smaller vessel sizes. We look at low fleet growth of around 1% CAGR 2021 to 2025 in the sub 5 000 TU segment. And we see a strong trade growth of intraregional trades. We also believe that reshuffling of supply chains  et cetera  will contribute to that even further  and we therefore are positive when it comes to the overall supply-demand growth development and outlook for our specific segment.Now  from market to company outlook and company specifics  let me move forward to Slide 14 where we have shown the charter backlog and forward visibility in a format that we have commonly used in previous quarters. From left to right  on the left-hand side  you can see the Q3 and Q4 forward. The two columns represent the open days and fixed days operating days of the vessels. So  we basically see  we are almost sold out for the rest of the year. We have five more vessels to be fixed more towards the end of this year  representing the number of open days. We have a secure TCE of around mid $31 000 per day on the fixed days. And we have a secured revenue of around $300 million to 315 million for the remainder of 2022. Most of the open positions  as I said  are in Q4 2022. If you now take a bit of a broader picture on the years ahead on the right-hand side  first of all  you can see from top to bottom  the EBITDA and revenue backlogs. So  $1.8 billion in revenues and projected EBITDA backlog of around $1.4 billion. And you can see from left to right  the respective figures in terms of fixed days  open days  contracted forward TCE  and contracted forward revenues for the second half of 2022 in aggregate  as well as 2023 and 2024  as well as 2025  and then also 2026 forward. Interestingly  we have quite a visibility for the years ahead in terms of contracted revenues and certainly contracted rates and days  yet we still have some open days  in particular from 2025 onwards. And we are very positively looking forward on the basis of our charter backlog.Now  what does that mean in terms of where are we from a risk standpoint? We have illustrated on Slide 15  a bit of an overview where we have looked at the net interest-bearing debt as per end of Q2  added the market cap  as per  I think yesterday  arriving at an enterprise value of $1.2 billion. If you then deduct the scrap value of the vessels as the bare minimum  plus the projected EBITDA of $1.4 billion  as well as the proceeds from the vessel sales that has taken place to-date  we see an excess value above the current enterprise value of more than $0.5 Billion US. So  we believe from a pure enterprise coverage standpoint  we are very well positioned going forward. And that is obviously the protection from a downside perspective. On the other hand  we have shown  and also that is in line with figures that we've shown in previous quarters  a bit of a sensitivity to show the significant potential for further sustainable distributions going forward. What have we done? On the top of this slide  we have shown for 2023  2024  and 2025  operating revenues  EBITDA  and net profit  excluding potential special effects. So  this is a pure sensitivity on the open days derived from the slide that I alluded to earlier. And that means we have  at current market rates  which  for the blended basket of our vessel  is around $40 500 per day  we arrive at these figures  and we will continue obviously to apply our clear and transparent distribution policy so everyone can derive dividend scenarios and return scenarios  which we believe is very attractive in this market environment  given our backlog and the application of our policy. On the lower end of this - lower part of the slide  we have run that number on the basis of the 10-year historical average  according to Clarksons for all vessel baskets  which is roughly $16 500 per day. And that obviously gives you lower figures  but shows you a bit of the sensitivity and the fact that we do have a lot of charters locked in  and there's a very clear path to sustainable distributions in our view going forward.On that note  let me conclude before we open the floor for questions on a bit of an outlook and where we stand. We see  from a pure market assessment standpoint  that the container market remains historically strong  despite geopolitical and macro uncertainty. We continue to witness severe global supply chain disruptions and congestions globally. And that is certainly here to stay  at least for the foreseeable months and quarters in our view. In addition  the industry landscape will be affected by energy transition and decarbonization of the industry  which will induce capacity contraction in our view  for example  through slow steaming. Overall  and again  we alluded to that as well  we see a favorable outlook for intraregional trades for various reasons explained  in particular  the diversification of supply chains  which we believe will likely benefit intraregional trade lanes disproportionately. And we also see a very solid demand growth in those regions. At MPCC  we believe  with our very low leverage  and our strong cash generation  we are very well positioned to not only continue our path of prioritizing distributions to shareholders  but also to make use of opportunities as and if they arise. We will continue with a very clear focus on mitigating residual value risk in any decision we take  and also selectively explore the possibly vessel sales or attractive charter opportunities with our existing fleet.And on that note  I would like to hand back to you  operator  and I'm looking forward to receiving questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Frode Mørkedal from Clarksons. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Frode MørkedalThank you. Hi  guys. I had a question on your capital allocation  your thoughts process there. I guess your vessel sales could have been used to buy back shares. At least if I look at the current backlog you have  and just assume scrap value at the end  the stock is trading well below that  right? So  it makes attractive to buy back shares in my view. So  maybe if you could talk about that.Constantin BaackSure. Thanks  Frode  for the question. And yes  I mean  our capital allocation policy foresees  and that's why we use the term distributions and not necessarily dividends  because we want to take the right decision at the right point in time while it's being  let's say  reliable partly to return capital to investors. We believe the dividend is a very meaningful and attractive measure. We  by the way  pay the dividend out of share premium  which means it's tax-free also to other jurisdictions  than  for example  Norwegian investors. We believe that is a very important feature. Having said that  we would - and I mentioned that earlier  we would not rule out share buybacks. Obviously  share buybacks  the price has to be right. We cannot be exposed to any  let's say  insider projects that we're working at. We will have to consider the close periods  et cetera. So  having said that  I mean  it definitely is one of the options that we have on the table  and it's nothing that we would rule out. We believe that being clear in the distribution and reliable to the investor community in terms of walking the talk on our quarterly distributions  that is clearly the way to go about it. Of course  if there were a few vessel sales lined up  that could in any event  constitute an opportunity to buy back shares. Having said that  we haven't done it yet. again  share price has to be in the right vicinity. We have to be able to act as far as I said  close periods or inside our related matters are concerned. And then we are definitely considerate of share buyback as another option. It is being discussed with the board on a regular basis  and I would not rule out that we see something happening in the not-too-distant future. However  we believe to be a reliable partner on the dividends is also extremely valuable to shareholders.Frode MørkedalYes  I agree. Makes sense. Second question is more about the macro environment. Clearly  you have a very strong backlog  but I guess if the outlook of the potential market is at least for a slowdown  and maybe we could have a recession  et cetera  right? So  maybe if you could talk about where MPC is positioned in this type of environment  and how you would navigate if there were softer periods ahead  right  in terms of your balance sheet and decision process thinking there.Constantin BaackSure. I mean  in terms of balance sheet  we have been clear  and I think that's the - I would almost say that the unique feature  when you look at our cash generation  we are not kind of - we cannot - we do not only allocate everything to dividends or to distributions  but a very significant part of our cash generations. We continue to deleverage the balance sheet  which is probably a bit unusual in a market like this. We believe it's the right thing to do. We believe having flexibility should the future get a bit rougher in terms of the waters  we believe that will also constitute opportunities  and to have a very solid balance sheet structure with a significant part of the fleet unencumbered  low leverage  and ability to act  is something where we believe we will have a very attractive proposition and market position going forward. So  we believe that the emphasis is put on the right things  right  deleverage  while it's not compromising on the dividends  and yet being able to act as opportunities arise. So  that's more the company position. Now  to your question on general macro environment. Of course  I mean  the geopolitical situation is tense. it's very difficult to read. So  I think to have a high degree of flexibility in your balance sheet is a very solid preparation for whatever comes ahead. At the same time  vessel availability  as I mentioned before  is very limited. We believe that the new regulation will lead to a significant lease lower speeds  certainly in specific traits. And we see that actually as an opportunity on - from a pure capacity standpoint. So  whilst the overall macro environment is very difficult to read  I certainly believe that we are well positioned and our counterparties  to be frank  I mean  the top 10 liners  they have - all of them have net debt of zero. So  we believe the counterparties on all our contracts are very well positioned. So  we are actually just continuing to roll out our strategy  taking rational decisions when it comes to potential - selectively potential investments. And I would like to highlight the word selectively  and stick to our capital allocation policy  including deleveraging of the balance sheet.Frode MørkedalGreat. Thanks. Thank you very much.OperatorThere are no more questions on the phones at this time. Please continue.Constantin BaackYes. Thanks  operator. There are a number of questions through the web  which I'm happy to take  unless you chip in with more questions through the line. There is one question by (unintelligible). He's asking about five vessels will come off charter before year-end. One of these is already off charter  Alexandria. Will all or some of these vessels be marketed for sale  or why has none of them secured a new charter yet? We are  as we have done in the past  considering both options  chartering out vessels  or potentially even selling vessels  as we have done on previous occasions. So  that's the thought process there from our side. If you look at the Alexandria  yes  she is off charter  but she's now in dry dock. So  that is the reason  and we will obviously continue to market her. We are positive that we will find a very good employment. I mean  the question is  as I mentioned earlier  the duration. As durations have come down a bit  as alluded to in the market section  and obviously the potential sales is also something to seriously consider. So  we would stick to our game plan of being very rational in the decision to sell or charter of the vessel. We believe the market has obviously been less active by virtue of fewer vessels being available  yet rates are still very solid  and we are not overly concerned about charter opportunities out there  and we'll take them as we move forward. As I said earlier  forward fixing activity  that has come down  but that has been a very unique and almost unheard-of development that we have seen during the first quarter of this year. And we are now more back to the normal days where you extend the charter or renew a charter 30 to 40 days ahead of charter expiry when the vessel comes out of dry dock  and that is also the case for AS Alexandria.There is another question by (indiscernible). Due to the lack of understanding from the journalists  analytic resources  could MPCC clarify the new build will not impact dividend. There has been a lot of comments from different brokerhouse analytics that clearly show lack of understanding. Yes  we can just repeat and explain in more detail that the new builds that we have carried out  have zero impact on our dividend capacity  our dividends  and that is one reason why we have this dividend policy in place relate to 70% of net profit  75% of net profit. So  any investments into the new buildings  will have no impact during the construction or now on net earnings  as that is a balance sheet and cash flow development  and we’re yet to generate enough cash to do so. So  it has zero impact on the dividend capacity. To the contrary  it actually has a positive impact on the earnings and dividend capacity going forward  because we have secured a significant revenue and EBITDA backlog for those four new builds. So  we have also communicated that to the analyst community  and I'm hopeful that some of them are here on the call. We just had Frode asking a question. So  I think everyone is hopefully on the right page there  what the new buildings will do and will not do in terms of rather enhancing our dividend capacity down the road  with zero impact today.There's another question from (Martin Hughes). Is there any plans to start share buyback program? Okay. I think I answered that when I replied to Frode. I will not repeat that. Martin  if you have any further questions  please clarify that question in a bit more detail. There's a question of (indiscernible). If I understand the CII rating correct  the rating will be calculated the following year. What incentives will the charterers have to maintain a good CII rating when the charter agreement expires? We generally have  and that is a very important feature  so-called CII clauses in our charter parties that mean that charters will have to basically utilize our vessel in the calls with a certain rating scheme  meaning they cannot just - we will not be penalized by them running the ships to the contrary. They have to stick to a certain CII rating scheme  and that is in general  a C rating as part of our charter agreements.There’s another question by (indiscernible)  saying  because of the current charter market with low durations and ship values remaining high  is it more accretive to sell ships  or do you expect the market to be strong even after the one to tier duration is over? Yes. Vessel sale - and I think that is part of my earlier answer to the question  we would always consider a vessel sale. And certainly  if you can arbitrage between the realizable sale price for a ship and the implied charter price or value by ship  we would always consider that at the point in time where a charter renewal is possible and also for vessels that are operatable. So  that is part of our decision-making process. And I think the sale of AS Serafina proves this  that we do not shy away if that's an attractive deal. And by the way  the AS Serafina  in terms of an implied NAV per share of that sale  that is probably slightly above 40 NOK per share. So  a significant premium to the implied value by the current trading. So  we would always want to make use of these kind of opportunities that are accretive to our company and shareholders on a per share basis.Then there's another question by (indiscernible). How much speed reduction is required to keep your fleet INCI compliant? Will this affect any of the existing charter agreements? As I said  I mean  there are INCI clauses in the charter agreements that we have well considered. And in addition  speed reduction really depends on the trading profile. And what we do know is that liners are already adjusting their services and their trading profiles to some extent where our vessels are employed. So  it's a question that cannot be easily answered  at least not black and white. Certain trades in particular  for example  we did an analysis on the tariffs where we believe there will be a significant impact on speeds. We have spoken to various operators in that region who are considering to reshuffle their services. So  we do believe that there will be a quite significant speed reduction because of the trading pattern of the vessels. So  that's my answer to that question.And there’s a question by (indiscernible). My compliments on a good quarter and prudent corporate governance. You still have 20 22 open fixtures. That is surprising. Are these being held open for sale  or are you doing a wait-and-see game with charterers? In general  as I said  the market is a bit more quiet  and simply the dynamics in the market have changed. I mean  we believe that we have a very solid kind of remaining charter book of five vessels  and we will find employment. And obviously  to keep optionality on a potential sale is one of the options. As an example  the AS Serafina got sold to an operator. And if you want just the option to sell a vessel to an operator  you rather want to have no charter attached to it  because that provides for a different set of potential bias on assets. And therefore  we actually feel very comfortable with the mix of our continue - our upcoming charters for the remainder of this year.There's a question by (indiscernible). The forward fixing window is closing. Are you seeing the same on durations  or still likely to see three year or longer than historically normal charters for the open positions you have for the remainder of 2022 and for 2023? It's certainly - periods have come down  but there are certainly still also longer periods available. So  it really depends on the vessel position and individual situation. As I said  the market has been a bit less active just by virtue of fewer vessels being available. And we will consider sales  short-term charter  long-term charter  when the time is right. And the forward fixing dynamics have simply changed in this market environment.A question by (indiscernible). What kind of purchase do you look at  single buy or company  et cetera? I'm not sure what that exactly means  but if that relates to potential acquisitions  as I said  we will be selective on acquisitions. We believe the market is cyclically more on the higher side of things. So  to carry our purchases  we would always follow our principle of mitigating residual value risk. So  if there was a purchase  for example  the new builds that we have done  we would only consider that if there’s a full derisking over the charter period. And in general  we would be more selective. And as you've seen with AS Serafina  we would probably also consider to be on the selling side in the current market environment.There is another question by (Martin Engstrom). Do you feel a turning point where it is more attractive to sell ships rather than forward fix on long-term contracts? Or do you still believe it is more attractive to forward fix most available ships? Again  I think if you look back the last 18 months  we have taken different decisions to buy  to sell  to charter out  and we believe we will do that according to our principles  and have done that  at least from our standpoint  in a way that we have generated value to the company and shareholders  and we will continue to do that. And maybe at this point in time  one is more on the selling side of assets than the buying side. However  both will have to be carefully and cautiously considered and not taken easily.I have a question by (Ian Lewis). What's your view on IMO’s carbon reduction legislation on the fleet of container ships  such as the MPCC fleet ready for the introduction of EEXI and CII  where you have to scrap all the ships with low ratings T or E? The answer to that is  I don't see any scrapping imminently in front of our doorstep. As I said  we have certain EEXI CII clauses in our charter parties. So  vessels will not be operated  at least not in the next couple of quarters and months  and certainly not 2023 that would suggest any of such measures. Of course  the carbon reduction legislation will have steeper impact on certain size segments by virtue of the formula  and also certain regions by virtue of the trading pattern. And we believe that is something that is currently being reshuffled also by the line operators. And as I said  we believe that there will be certainly slow steaming on the cost that will play a significant role for the years ahead.Another question by (indiscernible). Is there any accretive acquisition in the market at this point? Well  we believe that the new building deals we've done  they have required quite some preparatory work  and they are certainly  I would argue  unique in the way we have conducted them  and they are not necessarily replicable. Therefore  we want to be very selective  and we would rather be cautious when it comes to certain growth investments at this point in time  also given the macro uncertainty.There's a question (indiscernible). Are there option contracts for the MPCC share like for (indiscernible) shares at the Euronext in Germany? Well  it is up to the respective stock exchanges to offer option series on the stocks. Listed stock exchanges will consider listing of options series if there is a demand for market participants. So  I can only then encourage you to take that up with the respective stock exchange  but at this stage  that is not present.There's a question by (Klaus Hanson). Can you give some color on the prospect for cascading as bigger new builds hit the market? How much of port infrastructure in MPCC’s core trade areas can accommodate larger vessels? That is obviously a relevant question  yet a question that cannot be answered black and white. Obviously  cascading has taken place since there’s container shipping. So  there will continue to be cascading going forward. I have no doubt about it. There are not just port infrastructure restrictions that dictate the way this might be conducted or not. There's also port rotation schemes  schedule integrity  considerations  et cetera. So  it is much more complex. We have seen some cascading in intra-Asian trades where Baby Panamaxes have moved in. However  they have basically moved into that market segment  the intra-Asian trade that has grown most significantly over the last decade. So  they have rather taken up the incremental demand than have actually pushed out any smaller vessels. So  if you look on the absolute terms  for example  they are still basically the same number of smaller vessels employed in these kind of trade lanes.If you now look at the larger vessels in the order book  well  they would probably shift the trading pattern  but they will not at all cascade into all the smaller trades. It’s impossible by virtue of port turnaround times  schedule integrity  as well as the physical restrictions you alluded to in your question here. So  we are - certainly based on the existing order book for the smaller vessels  and the age profile of the smaller vessels  we are still very positive that cascading  yes  will happen  but it will not kind of mean a complete game changer to the smaller vessel segment as far as our view is concerned. To the contrary  we still believe that looking at the demand development and port rotations  et cetera  and the intraregional trade as such  still create a very attractive  let's say  field for growth for our vessels and sizes.There's a question by (indiscernible). Revenues in H1 2022 was $295 million US. The presentation on Slide 14 assumes that $350 million is contracted for H2. when I add both  I come with $600 million us  and that relates to the revenue guidance of $570 million to $585 million. Yes  indeed  there is a bit of slack  but there is also dockings coming up. This is the contracted revenues. We also have to consider prolonged docking times  for example  leading to off hire  and on the same side  it’s not - it cannot be completely ruled out that revenues come in higher than what we have anticipated. But there are risks on the cost side  as well as on the revenue side when it comes to off hire that have led to our current guidance. And that is the guidance we believe is the best guidance we can give at this point in time.Are there any further questions through the line  operator? I don't see any additional questions through the web here  but I would wait another minute and at least give you the chance to bring in questions through the phone line  if there are any.OperatorThere is no questions at the moment.
