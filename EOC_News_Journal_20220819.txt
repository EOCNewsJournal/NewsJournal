Our revenue for January–June was EUR 2.1 million  which is about 31 percent higher than in the corresponding period of the previous year. EUR 1.4 million of the turnover was accumulated in the first quarter and EUR 0.7 million in the second quarter.The net result of the first half of the year was weakened by the increase in material costs in particular  which we were unable to transfer to the previously agreed-upon fixed customer prices. In new tenders  we have taken the changes in material costs into account more strongly than before. Our operating result for January–June was EUR -2.4 million  compared to EUR -2.2 million a year ago.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused global turbulence in the energy sector. Europe’s dependence on the energy imported from Russia demands quick solutions from energy industry operators for the coming winter. At the same time  it has awakened both cities and companies as well as EU decision-makers to think about sustainable and flexible energy solutions further into the future. Interest towards solar heat has grown when energy availability and self-sufficiency issues have risen alongside the climate targets. As a result of the recent market development  the relative price competitiveness of solar heat has continued to improve  despite the fact that the material costs of solar heating systems have also increased.Story continuesSolar heat is typically used locally  which reduces expensive power transmission line and battery investments. In addition  the large-scale use of solar heat accelerates the transition to clean energy production when emission-free electricity of limited availability can be utilised elsewhere than in heat production.The increased uncertainty about the availability and costs of energy and materials complicates the timing of the customers’ investment decisions. Energy investments are currently more expensive than before  but the pressure towards renewable energy investments is constantly increasing.During the reporting period  we signed a contract with Newheat SAS on the delivery of a solar thermal field worth around EUR 3 million to Verdun  France. This is already our fourth system delivery to Newheat who  as the owner and operator of the solar thermal system  sells heat with long-term contracts to its customers  in this case to Lactalis Group’s whey powder factory. We are pleased with Newheat’s choice to continue cooperation with us.Towards the end of the reporting period  we had the pleasure of announcing a long-prepared pilot project for the mining industry in Latin America. The delivery worth around 0.2 million euros is significantly more important than its monetary value  as it is Savosolar's first customer in the mining industry and the first customer in Latin America  where even the world’s leading mining companies are currently actively looking for low-emission energy sources.We have continued to develop our products and offerings by  among other things  strengthening our ability to integrate clean sources of heat and our competence to support the customers’ project development.The future of solar heat looks bright. Our customers who have switched to the utilisation of solar heat have been very satisfied with their investment decisions  especially in the current situation. Even though the exceptionally high cost level may hold back all energy investment decisions in the short term  I see that the rise in energy prices and the availability risks will keep interest towards solar heat high and speed up decisions to switch to low-cost and truly clean renewable solar heat.”SAVOSOLAR AS A COMPANYSavosolar Plc is a Finnish public limited liability company listed in Nasdaq First North Growth Market Sweden and Nasdaq First North Growth Market Finland that designs and supplies large solar thermal systems for district heat producers and industry. The systems are based on Savosolar’s highly efficient solar heat collectors  at the heart of which are Savosolar’s proprietary optically coated direct flow absorbers.

Of the authorisation 81 183 075 shares were remaining on 30 June 2022.GENERAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY FACTORS CONCERNING OPERATIONSThe most significant risks involved in Savosolar's business are the ability to win new projects to achieve growth in line with the strategy  the sufficiency of the necessary working capital  and the ability to increase the efficiency of operations so as to turn the operations profitable.The war in Ukraine has increased uncertainty concerning the availability and prices of materials and components. No Russian or Ukrainian components are directly used in Savosolar’s products. However  the war situation can maintain exceptionally high prices material and component prices and prolonged delivery times. If continued for a long time  these may slow down the growth of Savosolar’s business and the improvement of profitability. On the other hand  the rise in energy prices and the reduction of the use of Russian fossil fuels are estimated to have a positive effect on the demand for renewable energy  which also facilitates the development of Savosolar's business.The company’s Board of Directors monitors the development of the company’s profitability and cash flow actively and  together with the company’s management  seeks the best solutions to develop the company towards profitable long-term business. The Board of Directors continuously considers the sufficiency of financing as an important part of the company’s growth strategy. Considering the recent favourable development for the company and the industry  the Board is confident that the company will be able to raise the necessary financing in the form on equity and debt capital to achieve the growth and profitability in line with its strategy.However  it cannot be guaranteed that the volume and profitability of the company’s business will grow sufficiently and that the company can gain enough supplementary finance just on time and with terms and conditions that are favourable enough for the present shareholders. In case the company does not succeed in generating growth and improving its profitability and/or raising additional financing to meet the needs of business  the company may be forced to postpone  cut back or terminate operations.STRATEGY AND LONG-TERM GOALSSavosolar’s intention is to help organisations and companies to reduce their carbon emissions with clean renewable thermal energy.The company’s vision is to be the first-choice supplier of large solar installations on a global scale.The company’s strategic objective is to grow substantially and be the leading supplier of large solar thermal installations where quality and efficiency matter the most. This means large-scale systems such as solar district heating (SDH) and solar heat for industrial processes (SHIP). In industry  the principal segments are the mining  paper and food industry and greenhouses.In implementing its strategy  the key factors for the company are its proprietary solar collector technology and knowledge of system design as well as its strong local and global partners. The geographical focus of operations continues to remain in Europe  but the company is actively seeking partners and marketing its products and services outside Europe as well. Savosolar delivers energy systems on a turnkey basis in line with its strategy in collaboration with its partners. The partners in different countries also serve as a sales channel for Savosolar’s products.MARKET ENVIRONMENTUntil now  underlying clean renewable energy production has  above all  been the fight against global warming. The European Commission’s proposal for a directive on renewable energy sources of July 2021 (Fit for 55) aims at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% from the 1990 level by 2030. The EU’s target is to be carbon neutral by 2050. The European Union has also allocated 30 per cent of its EUR 1 800 billion support instrument for recovery from the corona pandemic for 2021–2023 to climate actions  i.e.  for strengthening the EU Green Deal programme. Emission reduction and carbon neutrality targets have been widely set in other parts of the world as well.In the emission reduction targets  the public discussion has largely focused on electrification with solar and wind power. In Europe  for example  heating accounts for about 50% of total energy use  traffic about 30% and direct electricity use only about 20%  and more than half of Europe’s carbon emissions are caused by heating.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused global turbulence in the energy sector  the effects of which are particularly visible in Europe. The need to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy has quickly emerged alongside the climate targets. Concern about the price and availability of energy  especially in heat production  has given rise to measures to secure energy supply in preparation for the coming winter  but at the same time  it has increased interest towards renewable energy.Even though the utilisation of emission-free solar heat in district heating and industrial processes has increased in recent years  according to the International Energy Agency (IEA)  only around 11 percent of heating is produced with renewable energy worldwide. In electricity production  renewable energy sources account for about 29 percent  according to IEA. Electrification is a strong trend  but it is clear that the electricity produced solely by means of renewable forms of energy is not nearly enough to replace all fossil energy  nor to meet the needs of the green hydrogen economy of the future. By increasing the utilisation of solar heat in heating  renewable electricity can be utilised more and faster in  for example  electrified traffic.In May 2022  the EU Commission published an extensive package  the RePowerEU plan  which seeks solutions on how to transition away from Russian fossil energy to clean energy as soon as possible. Among other things  the Commission proposes to increase the renewable energy target of the Energy Efficiency Directive from 40% to 45%. As one concrete measure  the Commission proposes speeding up the permit processes for renewable energy projects.In the same context with the RePower communication  the Commission announced a solar energy strategy that aims to ensure the utilisation of the full potential of solar energy in order to reach the climate and energy targets of the European Green Deal Programme. The Member States should speed up the deployment of solar electricity and the utilisation of large heat pumps  geothermal energy  and solar heat. The strategy highlights increasing the use of solar heat especially in district heating.According to a report prepared on the production of district heat in Narbonne  France  solar heat has the lowest life-cycle emissions among the clean sources of energy (source: Inuk ST Plant CO2 footprint study 2021 / Ademe). No rare earth metals are used in Savosolar’s solar collectors  and the collector materials are completely recyclable. The strengths of solar heat also include the Europe-based manufacturing of solar thermal technology and the smaller need for land compared to  for example  photovoltaic panels.In its roadmap announced in June  Solar Heat Europe has calculated that solar heat capacity will triple from 2021 to 2030. This would mean that at the end of the current decade  emission-free solar heat would have replaced around 12 billion cubic meters of Russian gas. At the same time  more than 250 000 green transition jobs would be created in Europe. According to the roadmap  the greatest potential is in industrial process heating  especially in food production  of which around 10 percent could already be covered by solar heat in 2030.The goal of increasing energy self-sufficiency and reducing emissions further reinforces the need for the joint use of different forms of energy and heat production. The flexibility of energy systems  the optimisation of the use of different energy sources and the possibilities for energy storage will grow in significance. Solar heat is well-suited for various kinds of heat co-generation systems  and it can be cost-effectively stored by means of water reservoirs.The market for large solar thermal systems with a temperature of less than one hundred degrees has a limited number of skilled turnkey suppliers that operate globally. Savosolar is the technology and quality leader in this segment.Savosolar Plc's financial reporting in 2022Savosolar’s business review for January–September will be published on 26 October 2022.The financial reports will be published in Finnish and English.SAVOSOLAR PLCBoard of DirectorsMore information:CEO Jari VarjotiePhone: +358 400 419 734E-mail: jari.varjotie@savosolar.comANNEXES1 Comparison by reporting period2 Income statement3 Balance sheet4 Cash flow statement5 Calculation of changes in equity6 Financial ratios and calculation of key figuresSavosolar in briefSavosolar with its highly efficient collectors and large-scale solar thermal systems has taken solar thermal technology to the next level.

A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil3  which may support future regulatory submissions in this group if VLA1553 is approved in adults.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “This is an extremely important milestone for our VLA1553 program and we are very proud to be the first company worldwide that has begun submission of a BLA for a chikungunya vaccine candidate. Chikungunya is a major public health threat that continues to grow  and no vaccine or specific treatments are currently available for this debilitating disease. We will continue to work assiduously to bring VLA1553 to market as soon as possible.”Valneva is currently targeting the end of 2022 for completion of the BLA submission. Once all portions of the application have been submitted and if the filing is accepted  the FDA will determine priority review eligibility and the action date which the FDA will target to complete its evaluation.This rolling BLA submission is part of the accelerated approval pathway agreed upon with the FDA in 20204. The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the first half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in 72-92% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20325. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 100 countries. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas6 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.Story continuesAbout VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 120 countries. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 20227 and final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20228.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15539. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201910  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

Paris and Thorigne-Fouillard  France – Aug. 18  2022: Kalima Client Side Smart Contract Now Capable to Execute Lightning Transactions.,Kalima Client Side Smart Contract Now Capable to Execute Lightning Transactionspress releasePRESS RELEASE. Paris and Thorigne-Fouillard  France – Aug. 18  2022: Kalima Client Side Smart Contract Now Capable to Execute Lightning Transactions. Kalima and Kerlink to present a demonstration on how to accelerate the adoption of Smart Contracts for Enterprise and the Internet of Things (IoT) at Surfin’ Bitcoin event. During the Surfin’ Bitcoin event  which will be held in Biarritz from Aug. 25 to 27 2022  Kalima [FR60749951927]  a provider of blockchain solutions for Enterprise and the Internet of Things and Kerlink ((AKLK – FR0013156007)  a specialist in solutions dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT)  will perform a technical demonstration of the combination of blockchain and cryptocurrencies for the execution of Smart Contracts  to accelerate their adoption by enterprises.IoT and enterprise-oriented Smart Contracts using Bitcoin  through the Lightning NetworkThe Lightning Network is a layer 2 decentralized network designed for instant micropayments on Bitcoin. Layer 2 solutions act as the overlay of an already existing blockchain and solve the problems of transaction scalability and speed that the main blockchain (layer 1) cannot address effectively enough. This feature of the Lightning Network technically enables users to realize instant  high-volume micropayments in Bitcoins. Until now  no technical solution has met this need for Smart Contracts in the Bitcoin network.Kalima and Kerlink are working together on a new solution for Smart Contracts  based on the Kalima Blockchain industrial protocol  specifically designed for enterprises and IoT  which will enable Lightning Network (Bitcoin) microtransactions. The goal is simple: make Bitcoin payments possible using the Lightning Network layer and authenticate/secure enterprise and IoT data  thanks to Kalima Smart Contracts put in place.The Kalima protocol therefore brings the ability to embed blockchain in connected objects  to directly process the data in the sensor  and to add value to it (for example contextualization)  considering its native authenticated and traceable nature. The differentiator of Kalima lies in its ability to run its Smart Contracts at the edge  and thus process data at the closest point in the company’s processes (the sensor)  rather than having a cluster of data stored and processed in the Cloud.The Kalima Smart Contracts then work “on top” of the Lightning Network  and the data is kept outside of Bitcoin transactions and of circuits and nodes that make up the Lightning Network. Calling it a Layer 3 solution for Bitcoin offered by the Kalima protocol would even make sense  given the protocol’s features.On this basis  Kalima and Kerlink will demonstrate a technical proof-of-concept (POC)  in which a Kalima-embedded Kerlink LoRaWAN® gateway will manage “on-chain” data. The gateway will grant the transmission of data collected by sensors to the central platform in charge of data analysis (Cloud computing scenario)  or the processing and filtering of data at the edge (within the gateways)  and the transmission of crucial data only (Edge computing scenario).In this solution:The Bitcoin blockchain is used to manage and guarantee property rights  access rights and avoid double-spending problems The Lightning Network is used to scale micro-payment transactions (speed and volume)  andThe Kalima / Kerlink combination adds value to the gateway  limiting resource consumption and delivering response times and transaction volumes compatible with industry requirements.Technical demonstration based on a real-world experience at Surfin’ BitcoinFrom Aug. 25 to 27  during the Surfin’ Bitcoin event in Biarritz  Kalima and Kerlink will show a concrete IoT use case of Smart Contracts for Lightning Network and Bitcoin.The workshop will demonstrate how the Kalima protocol  through the execution of Smart Contracts in a Kerlink LoRaWAN® gateway  can trigger micropayments in Bitcoin on the Lightning Network  fitting IoT scenarios and parameters.The focus of the PoC will be set on the protection of employees and workers  and more particularly on the issue of Internal Air Quality (IAQ) management within companies’ working spaces. The scenario will highlight how the degradation of air quality is detected by a sensor that instantly transmits the alert to the company. Upon the reception of this alert  the company will be instructed to immediately take the necessary and appropriate measures to effectively respond to this degradation. A simple response from the team  such as ventilating the building by opening the windows  will quickly bring the IAQ back to its normal level. This active behavior of regularly improving the air quality in the building  will then be rewarded  in this case with Bitcoin granted to the buildings’ management team(s).This workshop will concretely illustrate the real-world technical feasibility of the Kalima / Kerlink solution and will present a simple and virtuous use case  made possible by this technical enabler.About KerlinkKerlink Group is a leading global provider of connectivity solutions for the design  deployment and operation of public and private networks dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT).

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today  Constantin Baack. Please go ahead.Constantin BaackThank you  operator  and good afternoon  and good morning  everyone. This is Constantin Baack  CEO of MPC Container Ships  and I would like to welcome you to our Q2 2022 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today to discuss MPC Container Ships second quarter earnings. This morning  we have issued a stock market announcement covering MPCC's second quarter results for the period ending June 30  2022. The release  as well as the accompanying presentation for this session  are available on the investor media section of our website.Please be advised that the material provided in our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements and indicative figures. Actual results may differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements  due to the risk and uncertainties associated with our business.Before I start with the presentation  let me direct a few words as a little preamble. We are pleased to report another strong quarter for MPC Container Ships  in which we have been able to continue to sustainably grow our earnings and profits amid macro uncertainties. Consequently  we have announced a recurring dividend for the second quarter 2022  which is around 15% higher than in the previous quarter. Year-to-date MPCC has as such declared dividends of more than $350  million emphasizing our commitment to return capital to shareholders. Despite geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties  the container charter market continues to be historically strong. We'll touch on the market in more detail as we go through  but I would like to emphasize that in particular  our segment of the container market is still robust at elevated levels  although charter periods have decreased slightly over the quarter. Nevertheless  charter rates are still at multiple of pre-pandemic levels  and available tonnage remains very thin.And on that note  I would like to start with today's presentation  commencing with Q2 year-to-date company highlights  followed by a market update  and concluding with a company outlook. Turning to Slide 4  which provides a snapshot of our key pillars in terms of fleet  financial standing  strategic focus  and corporate setup. As one of the leading intraregional tonnage provider  we presently own and operate a fleet of 68 vessels  which includes our four new buildings  and JV vessels  with a total capacity of roughly 150 000 TU. Over the past years  and past quarters  we have rolled out a clear and solid charting strategy  creating value for our shareholders. Over the past quarters  we have focused on reshuffling the balance sheet  and we now have a very solid balance sheet  with moderate to low leverage and 34 unencumbered vessels providing us with a high flexibility and discretion for our capital allocation decisions  in particular  the ability to return capital to investors. We have furthermore locked in long-term charters in order to build a sizable contract or charter contract and projected EBITDA backlog of $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion  respectively.Shipping is a cyclical and certainly capital-intensive business  and therefore  we believe that having a very clear and rational set of principles when it comes to decision-making and capital allocation  is key and is required to continue to develop our company. And we firmly believe we have walked the talk in that respect by executing on a clear strategy  which centers around mitigation of residual value risk  and placing an emphasis on the development - or sorry  on the deployment of capital in certain phases  and placing an emphasis on returning capital to shareholders in other phases. And that remains our clear priority going forward. In addition  and finally for this slide  we continue to operate in our well-established corporate setup. We put high priority on transparent corporate governance  strong ESG commitment  and certainly our strong execution capabilities.Please turn to the next slide  Page 5 of the presentation. As already alluded to in my initial words  we are pleased to report a strong financial performance in Q2 2022. As you can see on the left-hand side  in the table  with basically all KPIs significantly above the compared period in last year  both in terms of performance indicators  but also balance sheet items as illustrated by the various multiples shown in the table on this slide. From a performance standpoint  at $152 million  revenues were around 2.2 times  and hence  significantly above the Q2 2021 levels. Similarly  EBITDA  and also earnings per share  came in significantly above prior year’s levels. As I said throughout the bench  most of the KPIs have improved. That also includes some operational KPIs like vessel utilization  and also the average TCE that we were able to generate during this quarter. Furthermore  on the back of that  we have also increased our revenue and EBITDA guidance for the full year 2022 to the range of $570 million to 585 million when it comes to revenues  and $470 million to $490 million when it comes to EBITDA for 2022. Looking at the financial position of the company  as per end of Q2  we had a cash balance of around $86 million  and the same applies on a positive note  to the development of our equity ratio  now standing at 73%  and the financial leverage at 22%  both improvements compared to last quarter  but also to the second quarter 2021. Further details on our Q2 financials are made available in the appendix of this presentation  and are also accessible through our website via our Q2 financial report.Now  on the right-hand side  a few year-to-date updates information. And I will not run through all of them  but let me highlight a few. Again  the update of the guidance I had already mentioned  we have also seen improvement of many of the operational KPIs  a continued focus in a market that still is affected by certain COVID implications  in particular in Asia  but also by inflation  as one example. We continuously focus on OpEx and CapEx and  of course  seafarers welfare. We have concluded six dry dockings year-to-date 2022  with another seven likely to happen in the second half of this year. We have executed on our distribution plan  as mentioned previously. Year-to-date  $271 million in dividends have been declared and distributed to shareholders until that date. And today  we have declared  firstly  a recurring dividend of $0.15 per share  or roughly $67 US million for Q2. And we have also declared an event-driven distribution of $0.04 per share  or roughly $17 million US. That has been resolved by the board  and whilst in our earlier press release today  we have still mentioned that the handover of Serafina  which is linked to this event-driven distribution  is pending. It has  in the meantime  been successfully handed over  and therefore concluded today.On that note  let me continue with the next page  basically running you through our value approach  with three strategic pillars being distributions  financial flexibility  and accretive growth measures. I already stressed that we’ve placed a clear emphasis on returning capital to investors. At the moment  we have - we look at a very strong cash generation and EBITDA backlog  and we have  again  increased our dividend for this quarter compared to the previous quarters. We are committed to our very clear and stringent distribution policy of distributing 75% of adjusted net profit as a recurring distribution on a quarterly basis. In addition  and to the point I mentioned just earlier on the AS Serafina  we will also continue to selectively consider the sale of vessels  if accretive  and if we believe the price is attractive in this market environment  and then also distribute capital back to investors on that basis. Furthermore  and obviously subject to the share price development  we would also  as part of our distribution strategy  consider share buybacks  but again  that is subject to share price development over time. Financial flexibility  we operate on  I would argue  an industry low leverage of roughly 20%. We have done debt repayments of $45 million year-to-date  and the debt outstanding  on a gross basis  is $190 million as per the balance sheet date Q2  with the net debt position being around $100 million as per the balance sheet date end of Q2. We will maintain and put a clear emphasis on maintaining a very high balance sheet flexibility  which includes unencumbered vessels or a large number of vessels being unencumbered  and also having ideally flexible instruments like the two revolving credit facilities that we have in place at hand. In addition  there are no debt maturities until 2024. So  we have a very clear and transparent runway when it comes to our debt obligations and our flexibility.Finally  and very importantly  we will continue to adhere to a very rational portfolio management approach  as evidenced by the selective sale of certain vessels. We have sold and handed over three vessels for around $106 million in proceeds in the first quarter this year. And the AS Serafina  which has effectively been handed over now in Q3  but as also been alluded to earlier  will generate  or has actually generated $34 million in gross proceeds. And out of that  we will add dividend out and pay this event-driven distribution in connection with the recurring dividend in the course of September. Furthermore  we have also executed on our selective fleet renewal. We will always adhere to our principle of mitigation of residual value risk. So  we have done so in the two new building projects that we have executed in year-to-date 2022  one being two 5 500 TU vessels  where we look at a CapEx of around $144 million  and an EBITDA backlog roughly in the same figure. So  full derisking over the initial charter. We believe that is an attractive and interesting way to allocate capital selectively  but only in conjunction with a charter commitment.Furthermore  we have announced the contracting of two carbon-neutral new buildings  1 300 TU  where we look at CapEx of around $80 million  with a very solid 15-year charter against this commitment  with an EBITDA backlog of around $140 million. So  those would be transactions that we deem accretive and attractive  but we believe they will have to be very selectively chosen going forward. As I mentioned earlier  the clear priority in terms of capital allocation remains on the distribution  and any commitment we have taken so far on those two new buildings has zero impact on our ability to pay dividends and the volume of our dividends going forward for the next couple of years.On that note  let me move forward to the next slide  Slide 7  where we have kind of illustrated the distributions of dividends year-to-date. From left to right  it’s the dividends we have paid in in February and March as event-driven and recurring  the dividend we have paid end of May  and the dividend that is expected by the end of September 2022. The grayish part are event-driven distributions or dividends related to vessel sales. And the blue part of the column relates to the recurring dividend. As you can see  the recurring dividend in line with our improved profitability  has increased quarter-by-quarter  and we expect that to be very solid going forward on the back of our existing charter backlog. The cumulative yield  looking at today's market cap and the dividends paid year-to-date  or announced today  translates into roughly 33%  which is a very significant yield in our perspective. And overall  we have cumulative distributions over around $355 million or $3.5 billion NOK year-to-date on that basis. Or accumulative distribution in NOK per share of just a shade below 8 NOK for 2022 so far.Let me now continue with a short market update. Recently  geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties have increased globally. There are certainly two market developments  being inflationary pressure from the COVID-19 rescue packages  as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict that put significant upward pressure on certain prices  energy prices  et cetera and simultaneously put pressure on the global economy. Consequently  the general macro-outlook in terms of GDP growth has been revised downwards. Having said that  if you look at the container market  that is now on Slide #9  the weakening of the global economic environment  and the induced market uncertainty  has also had some impact on the container vessel industry. And this is visible in particular with the slight softening of freight rates  as can be seen on the top left of this chart. At the same time  rate and also congestions  as well as disruptions on the right-hand side  remain at record levels. So  whilst there is a softening  the level is still extremely high on both the disruption figures  as well as the overall freight rates. As you can see on the top left  especially spot rates  so the red line is the SCFI  and the blue line is the CCFI. So  one is the spot rates  and one is the contract rates. So  longer-term rates  especially the spot rates  have come down. However  as I mentioned  freight rates remain at very high levels historically  and certainly well above pre-COVID levels as well. On the right-hand side  you can see port congestion  which remains at record high levels. Will the situation improve anytime soon? I doubt it. While port congestion  for example  at the US west coast  has improved somewhat  it remains at record levels at the US east coast  and certainly driven by Russia-Ukraine conflict  and COVID-19 policies in Asia. It is also at record levels in the EU  as well as Asia.Please turn now  though  to Slide 10  where we now drill a bit deeper on the intricacies of the charter market and vessel availability. While freight rates have already softened somewhat  time charter rates are still near record high. The reason is that with the market surge over the past 24 months  vessel availability has decreased to almost negligible levels  as you can see on the right-hand side. Usually  if you move into a new year  start of the year  you have around 1 500 vessels available to the charter market across sizes and sectors  and that has been reduced significantly due to the significant number of fixtures that have been concluded over the course of the last couple of months  in particular  the first quarter of this year. So  going forward  we expect for the rest of the year  way fewer fixtures than one would usually see  leading to a stability in the charter market. And also  for 2023  we do not expect to see anywhere near the 1 500 vessels that would usually be available to the charter market in historic years. We believe that will be below 500 vessels based on our own analysis. Having said that  also in terms of idle vessels  we are at a very low point. Only 66 vessels are idle. A lot of vessels are also in dry dock situations. So  we are certainly positive when it comes to vessel availability  and hence stability of the market. That relates to time charter rates and simple vessel availability  if we now look at - more specifically also at charter periods and re-delivery windows  as well as forward fixtures  which is something that we have stressed over the last quarters in our quarterly reporting. We have seen quite a contraction in charter periods. So  rates remain extremely stable  but periods have come down somewhat  which is also linked to the fact that there's more hesitance and somewhat uncertainty on the side of the liners  not necessarily because there are more vessels available to the market  or there's less demand. So  we clearly see that bit on the left-hand side  and on the right lane  where you see the reduction in charter periods that is obviously a development that is a downturn compared to last quarter. However  still at very  very - historically  very high rates. And therefore  we believe this is nothing to be overly concerned about going forward. So  periods are still prolonged compared to previous years  and fixtures still get done. However  both the periods have been a bit shorter  as well as the forward-fixing activity  and that's on the right-hand side  has also come down a bit. During the first quarter  we have fixed 18 out of our 24 open positions for this year. Q2  we have only done one fixture  and we have five more fixtures ahead for the rest of the year. So  we see that there's a bit less traction when it comes to forward fixing  and we have a bit more back to normality where you fix vessels 30 to 40 days ahead of charter expiry.On that note  let me turn from a more specific charter market - from charter market details to the bigger picture in terms of supply and demand development. We do see a healthy midterm outlook in particular for our size and segment. On the left-hand side here  you can see the overall market where there's obviously a significant supply growth versus a demand growth that is lagging behind. It’s expected to lag behind for the years to come. Having said  that does not factor in any implications from new regulation  such as slow steaming  which we expect will be a very tangible reaction by the market. And if you listen to the CEOs of the big liner companies  everyone expects that to impact the capacity in the market by somewhere between 5% and 15%  depending on the trade  depending on the vessel size  et cetera. So  that is not factored in here. And we also believe that there might be a bit of slippage when it comes to vessel deliveries into the market. So  this is a static analysis for the total market  which we believe still has some headroom to develop  and the gap between supply and demand coming down. On the right-hand side  very specifically  and encouraging from our standpoint  is the supply-demand situation for our intraregional trades  the trades in which we are involved. We look at a still fairly low order book when it comes to the smaller vessel sizes. We look at low fleet growth of around 1% CAGR 2021 to 2025 in the sub 5 000 TU segment. And we see a strong trade growth of intraregional trades. We also believe that reshuffling of supply chains  et cetera  will contribute to that even further  and we therefore are positive when it comes to the overall supply-demand growth development and outlook for our specific segment.Now  from market to company outlook and company specifics  let me move forward to Slide 14 where we have shown the charter backlog and forward visibility in a format that we have commonly used in previous quarters. From left to right  on the left-hand side  you can see the Q3 and Q4 forward. The two columns represent the open days and fixed days operating days of the vessels. So  we basically see  we are almost sold out for the rest of the year. We have five more vessels to be fixed more towards the end of this year  representing the number of open days. We have a secure TCE of around mid $31 000 per day on the fixed days. And we have a secured revenue of around $300 million to 315 million for the remainder of 2022. Most of the open positions  as I said  are in Q4 2022. If you now take a bit of a broader picture on the years ahead on the right-hand side  first of all  you can see from top to bottom  the EBITDA and revenue backlogs. So  $1.8 billion in revenues and projected EBITDA backlog of around $1.4 billion. And you can see from left to right  the respective figures in terms of fixed days  open days  contracted forward TCE  and contracted forward revenues for the second half of 2022 in aggregate  as well as 2023 and 2024  as well as 2025  and then also 2026 forward. Interestingly  we have quite a visibility for the years ahead in terms of contracted revenues and certainly contracted rates and days  yet we still have some open days  in particular from 2025 onwards. And we are very positively looking forward on the basis of our charter backlog.Now  what does that mean in terms of where are we from a risk standpoint? We have illustrated on Slide 15  a bit of an overview where we have looked at the net interest-bearing debt as per end of Q2  added the market cap  as per  I think yesterday  arriving at an enterprise value of $1.2 billion. If you then deduct the scrap value of the vessels as the bare minimum  plus the projected EBITDA of $1.4 billion  as well as the proceeds from the vessel sales that has taken place to-date  we see an excess value above the current enterprise value of more than $0.5 Billion US. So  we believe from a pure enterprise coverage standpoint  we are very well positioned going forward. And that is obviously the protection from a downside perspective. On the other hand  we have shown  and also that is in line with figures that we've shown in previous quarters  a bit of a sensitivity to show the significant potential for further sustainable distributions going forward. What have we done? On the top of this slide  we have shown for 2023  2024  and 2025  operating revenues  EBITDA  and net profit  excluding potential special effects. So  this is a pure sensitivity on the open days derived from the slide that I alluded to earlier. And that means we have  at current market rates  which  for the blended basket of our vessel  is around $40 500 per day  we arrive at these figures  and we will continue obviously to apply our clear and transparent distribution policy so everyone can derive dividend scenarios and return scenarios  which we believe is very attractive in this market environment  given our backlog and the application of our policy. On the lower end of this - lower part of the slide  we have run that number on the basis of the 10-year historical average  according to Clarksons for all vessel baskets  which is roughly $16 500 per day. And that obviously gives you lower figures  but shows you a bit of the sensitivity and the fact that we do have a lot of charters locked in  and there's a very clear path to sustainable distributions in our view going forward.On that note  let me conclude before we open the floor for questions on a bit of an outlook and where we stand. We see  from a pure market assessment standpoint  that the container market remains historically strong  despite geopolitical and macro uncertainty. We continue to witness severe global supply chain disruptions and congestions globally. And that is certainly here to stay  at least for the foreseeable months and quarters in our view. In addition  the industry landscape will be affected by energy transition and decarbonization of the industry  which will induce capacity contraction in our view  for example  through slow steaming. Overall  and again  we alluded to that as well  we see a favorable outlook for intraregional trades for various reasons explained  in particular  the diversification of supply chains  which we believe will likely benefit intraregional trade lanes disproportionately. And we also see a very solid demand growth in those regions. At MPCC  we believe  with our very low leverage  and our strong cash generation  we are very well positioned to not only continue our path of prioritizing distributions to shareholders  but also to make use of opportunities as and if they arise. We will continue with a very clear focus on mitigating residual value risk in any decision we take  and also selectively explore the possibly vessel sales or attractive charter opportunities with our existing fleet.And on that note  I would like to hand back to you  operator  and I'm looking forward to receiving questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Frode Mørkedal from Clarksons. Please go ahead. Your line is open.Frode MørkedalThank you. Hi  guys. I had a question on your capital allocation  your thoughts process there. I guess your vessel sales could have been used to buy back shares. At least if I look at the current backlog you have  and just assume scrap value at the end  the stock is trading well below that  right? So  it makes attractive to buy back shares in my view. So  maybe if you could talk about that.Constantin BaackSure. Thanks  Frode  for the question. And yes  I mean  our capital allocation policy foresees  and that's why we use the term distributions and not necessarily dividends  because we want to take the right decision at the right point in time while it's being  let's say  reliable partly to return capital to investors. We believe the dividend is a very meaningful and attractive measure. We  by the way  pay the dividend out of share premium  which means it's tax-free also to other jurisdictions  than  for example  Norwegian investors. We believe that is a very important feature. Having said that  we would - and I mentioned that earlier  we would not rule out share buybacks. Obviously  share buybacks  the price has to be right. We cannot be exposed to any  let's say  insider projects that we're working at. We will have to consider the close periods  et cetera. So  having said that  I mean  it definitely is one of the options that we have on the table  and it's nothing that we would rule out. We believe that being clear in the distribution and reliable to the investor community in terms of walking the talk on our quarterly distributions  that is clearly the way to go about it. Of course  if there were a few vessel sales lined up  that could in any event  constitute an opportunity to buy back shares. Having said that  we haven't done it yet. again  share price has to be in the right vicinity. We have to be able to act as far as I said  close periods or inside our related matters are concerned. And then we are definitely considerate of share buyback as another option. It is being discussed with the board on a regular basis  and I would not rule out that we see something happening in the not-too-distant future. However  we believe to be a reliable partner on the dividends is also extremely valuable to shareholders.Frode MørkedalYes  I agree. Makes sense. Second question is more about the macro environment. Clearly  you have a very strong backlog  but I guess if the outlook of the potential market is at least for a slowdown  and maybe we could have a recession  et cetera  right? So  maybe if you could talk about where MPC is positioned in this type of environment  and how you would navigate if there were softer periods ahead  right  in terms of your balance sheet and decision process thinking there.Constantin BaackSure. I mean  in terms of balance sheet  we have been clear  and I think that's the - I would almost say that the unique feature  when you look at our cash generation  we are not kind of - we cannot - we do not only allocate everything to dividends or to distributions  but a very significant part of our cash generations. We continue to deleverage the balance sheet  which is probably a bit unusual in a market like this. We believe it's the right thing to do. We believe having flexibility should the future get a bit rougher in terms of the waters  we believe that will also constitute opportunities  and to have a very solid balance sheet structure with a significant part of the fleet unencumbered  low leverage  and ability to act  is something where we believe we will have a very attractive proposition and market position going forward. So  we believe that the emphasis is put on the right things  right  deleverage  while it's not compromising on the dividends  and yet being able to act as opportunities arise. So  that's more the company position. Now  to your question on general macro environment. Of course  I mean  the geopolitical situation is tense. it's very difficult to read. So  I think to have a high degree of flexibility in your balance sheet is a very solid preparation for whatever comes ahead. At the same time  vessel availability  as I mentioned before  is very limited. We believe that the new regulation will lead to a significant lease lower speeds  certainly in specific traits. And we see that actually as an opportunity on - from a pure capacity standpoint. So  whilst the overall macro environment is very difficult to read  I certainly believe that we are well positioned and our counterparties  to be frank  I mean  the top 10 liners  they have - all of them have net debt of zero. So  we believe the counterparties on all our contracts are very well positioned. So  we are actually just continuing to roll out our strategy  taking rational decisions when it comes to potential - selectively potential investments. And I would like to highlight the word selectively  and stick to our capital allocation policy  including deleveraging of the balance sheet.Frode MørkedalGreat. Thanks. Thank you very much.OperatorThere are no more questions on the phones at this time. Please continue.Constantin BaackYes. Thanks  operator. There are a number of questions through the web  which I'm happy to take  unless you chip in with more questions through the line. There is one question by (unintelligible). He's asking about five vessels will come off charter before year-end. One of these is already off charter  Alexandria. Will all or some of these vessels be marketed for sale  or why has none of them secured a new charter yet? We are  as we have done in the past  considering both options  chartering out vessels  or potentially even selling vessels  as we have done on previous occasions. So  that's the thought process there from our side. If you look at the Alexandria  yes  she is off charter  but she's now in dry dock. So  that is the reason  and we will obviously continue to market her. We are positive that we will find a very good employment. I mean  the question is  as I mentioned earlier  the duration. As durations have come down a bit  as alluded to in the market section  and obviously the potential sales is also something to seriously consider. So  we would stick to our game plan of being very rational in the decision to sell or charter of the vessel. We believe the market has obviously been less active by virtue of fewer vessels being available  yet rates are still very solid  and we are not overly concerned about charter opportunities out there  and we'll take them as we move forward. As I said earlier  forward fixing activity  that has come down  but that has been a very unique and almost unheard-of development that we have seen during the first quarter of this year. And we are now more back to the normal days where you extend the charter or renew a charter 30 to 40 days ahead of charter expiry when the vessel comes out of dry dock  and that is also the case for AS Alexandria.There is another question by (indiscernible). Due to the lack of understanding from the journalists  analytic resources  could MPCC clarify the new build will not impact dividend. There has been a lot of comments from different brokerhouse analytics that clearly show lack of understanding. Yes  we can just repeat and explain in more detail that the new builds that we have carried out  have zero impact on our dividend capacity  our dividends  and that is one reason why we have this dividend policy in place relate to 70% of net profit  75% of net profit. So  any investments into the new buildings  will have no impact during the construction or now on net earnings  as that is a balance sheet and cash flow development  and we’re yet to generate enough cash to do so. So  it has zero impact on the dividend capacity. To the contrary  it actually has a positive impact on the earnings and dividend capacity going forward  because we have secured a significant revenue and EBITDA backlog for those four new builds. So  we have also communicated that to the analyst community  and I'm hopeful that some of them are here on the call. We just had Frode asking a question. So  I think everyone is hopefully on the right page there  what the new buildings will do and will not do in terms of rather enhancing our dividend capacity down the road  with zero impact today.There's another question from (Martin Hughes). Is there any plans to start share buyback program? Okay. I think I answered that when I replied to Frode. I will not repeat that. Martin  if you have any further questions  please clarify that question in a bit more detail. There's a question of (indiscernible). If I understand the CII rating correct  the rating will be calculated the following year. What incentives will the charterers have to maintain a good CII rating when the charter agreement expires? We generally have  and that is a very important feature  so-called CII clauses in our charter parties that mean that charters will have to basically utilize our vessel in the calls with a certain rating scheme  meaning they cannot just - we will not be penalized by them running the ships to the contrary. They have to stick to a certain CII rating scheme  and that is in general  a C rating as part of our charter agreements.There’s another question by (indiscernible)  saying  because of the current charter market with low durations and ship values remaining high  is it more accretive to sell ships  or do you expect the market to be strong even after the one to tier duration is over? Yes. Vessel sale - and I think that is part of my earlier answer to the question  we would always consider a vessel sale. And certainly  if you can arbitrage between the realizable sale price for a ship and the implied charter price or value by ship  we would always consider that at the point in time where a charter renewal is possible and also for vessels that are operatable. So  that is part of our decision-making process. And I think the sale of AS Serafina proves this  that we do not shy away if that's an attractive deal. And by the way  the AS Serafina  in terms of an implied NAV per share of that sale  that is probably slightly above 40 NOK per share. So  a significant premium to the implied value by the current trading. So  we would always want to make use of these kind of opportunities that are accretive to our company and shareholders on a per share basis.Then there's another question by (indiscernible). How much speed reduction is required to keep your fleet INCI compliant? Will this affect any of the existing charter agreements? As I said  I mean  there are INCI clauses in the charter agreements that we have well considered. And in addition  speed reduction really depends on the trading profile. And what we do know is that liners are already adjusting their services and their trading profiles to some extent where our vessels are employed. So  it's a question that cannot be easily answered  at least not black and white. Certain trades in particular  for example  we did an analysis on the tariffs where we believe there will be a significant impact on speeds. We have spoken to various operators in that region who are considering to reshuffle their services. So  we do believe that there will be a quite significant speed reduction because of the trading pattern of the vessels. So  that's my answer to that question.And there’s a question by (indiscernible). My compliments on a good quarter and prudent corporate governance. You still have 20 22 open fixtures. That is surprising. Are these being held open for sale  or are you doing a wait-and-see game with charterers? In general  as I said  the market is a bit more quiet  and simply the dynamics in the market have changed. I mean  we believe that we have a very solid kind of remaining charter book of five vessels  and we will find employment. And obviously  to keep optionality on a potential sale is one of the options. As an example  the AS Serafina got sold to an operator. And if you want just the option to sell a vessel to an operator  you rather want to have no charter attached to it  because that provides for a different set of potential bias on assets. And therefore  we actually feel very comfortable with the mix of our continue - our upcoming charters for the remainder of this year.There's a question by (indiscernible). The forward fixing window is closing. Are you seeing the same on durations  or still likely to see three year or longer than historically normal charters for the open positions you have for the remainder of 2022 and for 2023? It's certainly - periods have come down  but there are certainly still also longer periods available. So  it really depends on the vessel position and individual situation. As I said  the market has been a bit less active just by virtue of fewer vessels being available. And we will consider sales  short-term charter  long-term charter  when the time is right. And the forward fixing dynamics have simply changed in this market environment.A question by (indiscernible). What kind of purchase do you look at  single buy or company  et cetera? I'm not sure what that exactly means  but if that relates to potential acquisitions  as I said  we will be selective on acquisitions. We believe the market is cyclically more on the higher side of things. So  to carry our purchases  we would always follow our principle of mitigating residual value risk. So  if there was a purchase  for example  the new builds that we have done  we would only consider that if there’s a full derisking over the charter period. And in general  we would be more selective. And as you've seen with AS Serafina  we would probably also consider to be on the selling side in the current market environment.There is another question by (Martin Engstrom). Do you feel a turning point where it is more attractive to sell ships rather than forward fix on long-term contracts? Or do you still believe it is more attractive to forward fix most available ships? Again  I think if you look back the last 18 months  we have taken different decisions to buy  to sell  to charter out  and we believe we will do that according to our principles  and have done that  at least from our standpoint  in a way that we have generated value to the company and shareholders  and we will continue to do that. And maybe at this point in time  one is more on the selling side of assets than the buying side. However  both will have to be carefully and cautiously considered and not taken easily.I have a question by (Ian Lewis). What's your view on IMO’s carbon reduction legislation on the fleet of container ships  such as the MPCC fleet ready for the introduction of EEXI and CII  where you have to scrap all the ships with low ratings T or E? The answer to that is  I don't see any scrapping imminently in front of our doorstep. As I said  we have certain EEXI CII clauses in our charter parties. So  vessels will not be operated  at least not in the next couple of quarters and months  and certainly not 2023 that would suggest any of such measures. Of course  the carbon reduction legislation will have steeper impact on certain size segments by virtue of the formula  and also certain regions by virtue of the trading pattern. And we believe that is something that is currently being reshuffled also by the line operators. And as I said  we believe that there will be certainly slow steaming on the cost that will play a significant role for the years ahead.Another question by (indiscernible). Is there any accretive acquisition in the market at this point? Well  we believe that the new building deals we've done  they have required quite some preparatory work  and they are certainly  I would argue  unique in the way we have conducted them  and they are not necessarily replicable. Therefore  we want to be very selective  and we would rather be cautious when it comes to certain growth investments at this point in time  also given the macro uncertainty.There's a question (indiscernible). Are there option contracts for the MPCC share like for (indiscernible) shares at the Euronext in Germany? Well  it is up to the respective stock exchanges to offer option series on the stocks. Listed stock exchanges will consider listing of options series if there is a demand for market participants. So  I can only then encourage you to take that up with the respective stock exchange  but at this stage  that is not present.There's a question by (Klaus Hanson). Can you give some color on the prospect for cascading as bigger new builds hit the market? How much of port infrastructure in MPCC’s core trade areas can accommodate larger vessels? That is obviously a relevant question  yet a question that cannot be answered black and white. Obviously  cascading has taken place since there’s container shipping. So  there will continue to be cascading going forward. I have no doubt about it. There are not just port infrastructure restrictions that dictate the way this might be conducted or not. There's also port rotation schemes  schedule integrity  considerations  et cetera. So  it is much more complex. We have seen some cascading in intra-Asian trades where Baby Panamaxes have moved in. However  they have basically moved into that market segment  the intra-Asian trade that has grown most significantly over the last decade. So  they have rather taken up the incremental demand than have actually pushed out any smaller vessels. So  if you look on the absolute terms  for example  they are still basically the same number of smaller vessels employed in these kind of trade lanes.If you now look at the larger vessels in the order book  well  they would probably shift the trading pattern  but they will not at all cascade into all the smaller trades. It’s impossible by virtue of port turnaround times  schedule integrity  as well as the physical restrictions you alluded to in your question here. So  we are - certainly based on the existing order book for the smaller vessels  and the age profile of the smaller vessels  we are still very positive that cascading  yes  will happen  but it will not kind of mean a complete game changer to the smaller vessel segment as far as our view is concerned. To the contrary  we still believe that looking at the demand development and port rotations  et cetera  and the intraregional trade as such  still create a very attractive  let's say  field for growth for our vessels and sizes.There's a question by (indiscernible). Revenues in H1 2022 was $295 million US. The presentation on Slide 14 assumes that $350 million is contracted for H2. when I add both  I come with $600 million us  and that relates to the revenue guidance of $570 million to $585 million. Yes  indeed  there is a bit of slack  but there is also dockings coming up. This is the contracted revenues. We also have to consider prolonged docking times  for example  leading to off hire  and on the same side  it’s not - it cannot be completely ruled out that revenues come in higher than what we have anticipated. But there are risks on the cost side  as well as on the revenue side when it comes to off hire that have led to our current guidance. And that is the guidance we believe is the best guidance we can give at this point in time.Are there any further questions through the line  operator? I don't see any additional questions through the web here  but I would wait another minute and at least give you the chance to bring in questions through the phone line  if there are any.OperatorThere is no questions at the moment.

This made it possible to resume conversion of DRs for as long as the fee was zero  since the NSD did not get any economic benefits from this  Clearstream said.The NSD decided at the end of July to extend the marketing period until August 14  inclusive  after which Euroclear said it would continue to execute instructions to convert DRs to shares until the new deadline.Then last week the NSD extended the zero rate until the middle of October.The NSD announced that it will forego payment until October 15  and since the NSD will not receive any economic benefits from conversion Euroclear will continue to execute instructions to convert DRs to Russian shares  the clearing system said in a notice to depositories.,neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,negative,0.02,0.26,0.71,True,English,"['Russian DR conversion', 'zero rate', 'Euroclear', 'extension', 'NSD', 'National Settlement Depository', 'Capital Markets Union', 'Moscow Exchange Group', 'European Union sanctions', ""Russian companies' DRs"", 'Russian DR conversion', 'Russian issuers', 'European settlements', 'zero rate', 'depositary receipts', 'clearing systems', 'Financial Stability', 'DG FISMA', 'underlying securities', 'DR programs', 'economic benefits', 'new deadline', 'Russian shares', 'marketing period', 'Financial Services', 'The NSD', 'Euroclear', 'extension', 'Aug', 'Interfax', 'instructions', 'hold', 'imposition', 'June', 'Clearstream', 'clarification', 'Directorate-General', 'transaction', 'creation', 'obligations', 'turn', 'payment', 'accounts', 'July', 'fee', 'end', 'middle', 'October', 'notice', 'depositories']",2022-08-19,2022-08-19,interfax.com

This was set up primarily to increase the amount of capital invested that is permanent. Pershing Square Holdings had underperformed the S&P 500 since its EOY 2012 inception. This changed in 2019 as they compounded at ~50% in the three years through 2021. For 2022 through August 16th  they are down 10.8%. Their original flagship fund’s (2004 inception) track record is excellent with annualized returns of ~17% compared to ~10.4% for the S&P 500 index.Note 1: Pershing Square Holdings has always traded at a discount to NAV. It currently trades at $33.40 per share compared to NAV of $50.90.Note 2: In July 2020  Pershing Square sponsored the largest SPAC IPO to date  Pershing Square Tontine Holdings. The offering had several retail-investor friendly attributes that made it stand out from the rest of the SPACs. The stock traded at a vast premium to trust value until the UMG transaction fell through. As no deal was consummated by the deadline (July 23  2022)  they chose to return the capital back to shareholders. The biggest SPAC choosing to liquidate without a deal is symptomatic of the dire market sentiment overall toward SPAC transactions.Note 3: Earlier this year  they disclosed the following regarding their hedging strategy  principles  and performance:Principles: asymmetric payoff structures along with monetization that provides liquidity during periods of market dislocation. Strategy: Interest rate hedges from late 2020 to early 2022 as they believed Fed would raise rates earlier than anticipated. Performance: 18.5x return on $64M to $1.2B in 2005-2009 subprime crisis through CDS on MBIA  96.3x return on $27M to $2.6B in 2020 COVID-19 through Index CDS on Investment Grade & High Yield Bonds  and 7.4x return on $188M to $1.4B in 2020-2022 through Out-of-the-money 2 year & 10 year swaptions.Note 4: Pershing Square has a ~10% stake in UMG Music Group (OTCPK:UMGNF) at a cost-basis of ~€18 per share.

The full interim financial report is available here on the Biotalys website.Patrice Sellès  Chief Executive Officer of Biotalys  commented: ""Biotalys continues to forge the path toward a safer  more sustainable food supply by building a strong product pipeline  an exceptionally talented team and a global partner network. As we are coming closer towards the regulatory approval of our first biocontrol Evoca  the continued positive feedback the product has earned both in the field and from renowned industry experts has created great excitement throughout our international team. We achieved a series of major milestones during the first half of 2022  and remain focused on our mission to bring innovative  protein-based biocontrols to growers.""H1 2022 operational highlightsIn the first half of this year  Biotalys has been actively building its team and partnerships to further develop its platform and pipeline:Story continuesThese accomplishments will also pave the way for Biotalys’ pipeline of product candidates  which includes biofungicides  biobactericides and bio-insecticides.After announcing the achievement of a significant breakthrough in protein expression (more than 500% increase in production) for the bioactive ingredient of Evoca in January 2022  which dramatically lowers production costs  Biotalys adapted its biofungicide pipeline to effectively capture market share. As a result  Biotalys’ current pipeline of protein-based biocontrols is as follows:Biotalys pipeline of product candidates can be summarized as follows: Once approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  Biotalys plans to launch the first generation of Evoca for market calibration in select states in the United States through its distribution partner Biobest  followed by an introduction in the EU (pending EU regulatory approval). The second generation of Evoca (containing the same protein bioactive  with enhanced manufacturing and formulation) is currently in the development stage and on track to be submitted to the EPA in the U.S. for follow-on registration. The third generation of Evoca (containing the same protein bioactive  with further optimized manufacturing and formulation) has progressed into the development stage and is planned to enter both the US and the EU markets by 2026. The company expects this third generation of Evoca to generate positive cashflow margins  which will not be the case for the first and second generation of Evoca in view of current production costs. BioFun-6 continues to progress according to plan  allowing Biotalys to focus on throughput and selection capacity  increasing the probability of success and a differentiating offer in the field of fruit and vegetables protection by 2028. BioFun-7 was initiated at the beginning of H1 and is progressing as per plan with a number of academic partnerships in preparation as well as internal development of methods and assays to perform the first work packages. The other pipeline programs (BioIns-1  BioBac-1  BioFun-2 and BioFun-4) are expected to provide valuable IP and know-how  strengthening the company’s AGROBODY Foundry platform and could form the basis of further R&D collaborations.* Evoca™: Pending Registration.

The increase mainly relates to grants to support Biotalys’ R&D activities  which accounted for €1.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2022 (H1 2021: €0.4 million).Research and development expenses amounted to €7.6 million for the first half of 2022  an increase of €1.3 million compared to the same period of 2021. These increases primarily relate to higher spending for external development (+€0.4 million) and field trial costs (+€0.4 million) in preparation for the market calibration with Evoca next year  as well as increased wage costs (+€0.3 million).General and administrative expenses amounted to €2.6 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €2.2 million in the same period of 2021. The increase was mainly driven by higher wage costs related to the expansion of the team.Net cash used in operating activities increased by €2.3 million for the six months ended 30 June 2022 to €9.6 million  compared to €7.3 million for the six months ended 30 June 2021. These increases primarily relate to a €0.8 million increase in operating loss (net of non-cash items) and changes in working capital driven by the higher payables balance in June 2021 related to certain IPO costs.Outlook for the remainder of 2022 and beyondBiotalys expects to obtain the first registration for Evoca in the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently reviewing the regulatory dossier Biotalys submitted for Evoca end of December 2020. Based on recent discussions with the agency  the company now expects to obtain product registration in early 2023. Biotalys believes this new registration timeline will have no impact on the business plan of the company considering Evoca (first generation) is a market calibration product.The company continues to focus on the market calibration of Evoca in selected states in the U.S.  as well as on the advancement of its ongoing discovery and development initiatives via the AGROBODY Foundry platform. The company will consider the future net development costs of the first and second generation of Evoca as R&D costs.Building on its most recent field trials to perfect application timing best practices  Biotalys is now conducting trials at-flowering sprays within IPM programs in a broader range of commercial important crops  including berries  cucurbits and tomatoes as it deepens field trial data from around the globe.Biotalys also aims to continue selectively leveraging its AGROBODY Foundry platform and pipeline to expand into new markets and crops  and to secure additional strategic collaborations and create additional value.The company has reduced the expected cash burn for the full year 2022 to a range between €24 and €26 million. Savings are anticipated for certain manufacturing  field trial and personnel and other operating costs  and likely extended delivery times for some equipment purchases will delay the cash impact.The outcome of the ongoing feasibility study with Novozymes is expected in early 2023  and may serve as a potential key milestone for Biotalys and Novozymes to enter into development  supply and commercialization agreements for a future generation of Evoca.Auditor StatementThe condensed consolidated financial statements for the six-months’ period ended 30 June 2022 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ as adopted by the European Union.

Prosus  a Dutch multinational conglomerate owned by Naspers  and its Brazilian affiliate Movile owned the remaining shares  and as a result of this transaction  Prospus and Movile will own iFood in its entirety.While Just Eat Takeaway said that its iFood equity value has increased five-fold over the lifespan of the joint venture  the sell-off comes amid troubling times for the company  which resulted from a $7.6 billion merger between the U.K.’s Just East and Dutch rival Takeaway.com back in 2020.After its valuation plummeted more than 80% in 10 months  news emerged last month that Just Eat Takeaway was scaling back in France  resulting in 390 layoffs. And less than a year after its $7.3 billion Grubhub acquisition finally closed  Just Eat Takeaway revealed it was looking to offload Grubhub as part of a broader pursuit of “sustainable  profitable growth.”The company said today that it plans to use its iFood proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet  while also honoring repayments on upcoming debt maturities. It also confirmed that it “continues to actively explore the partial or full sale” of Grubhub.“Just Eat Takeaway remains focused on improving its profitability and on a disciplined allocation of capital ” the company wrote in a statement.While the sale is still subject to stakeholder approval at an upcoming Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM)  Just Eat Takeaway said that it expects the transaction to be approved before the end of 2022.,neutral,0.02,0.92,0.06,negative,0.04,0.2,0.75,True,English,"['Eat Takeaway', 'stake', 'Brazil', 'iFood', 'TechCrunch', 'Dutch Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'upcoming Extraordinary General Meeting', 'Dutch rival Takeaway.com', 'three separate funding rounds', 'Dutch multinational conglomerate', 'upcoming debt maturities', 'Just Eat Takeaway', 'European food ordering', 'sustainable, profitable growth', '$7.3 billion Grubhub acquisition', 'iFood equity value', '$7.6 billion merger', 'delivery giant', 'initial deal', 'pending deal', 'early trading', 'Brazilian affiliate', 'joint venture', 'troubling times', 'U.K.', 'broader pursuit', 'balance sheet', 'disciplined allocation', 'stakeholder approval', 'next 12 months', 'remaining shares', 'iFood proceeds', 'full sale', '10 months', 'Prosus', 'cash', 'performance', 'News', 'Colombia', 'inception', 'business', 'process', 'Naspers', 'Movile', 'result', 'transaction', 'Prospus', 'entirety', 'lifespan', 'sell-off', 'company', 'East', 'valuation', 'France', '390 layoffs', 'part', 'repayments', 'profitability', 'capital', 'statement', 'EGM', '2022']",2022-08-19,2022-08-19,techcrunch.com

These systems used to operate much like the stock exchange. But  AEX was the first official stock exchangeFounded in the year 1602  Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX) is considered to be the oldest still functioning stock exchange in the world. It was created along with the Dutch East India Company (VOC). With the prevalence of European trade and the need to offer financiers a way to profit from the increasing commercial activities  the requirement for a bank grew. Financiers needed a safe and regulated place to buy and sell the shares of early global enterprises. Before AEX  many regions and towns had independent systems of trade regulations and asset valuation. These systems used to operate much like the stock exchange. But  AEX was the first official stock exchange.Ownership changes:AEX has gone through some changes in ownership and governance structure over the centuries. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the European Options Exchange (EOE) merged in 1997. Its blue-chip index ""Amsterdam Exchange"" was renamed “AEX”.Amsterdam Stock Exchange  Brussels Stock Exchange  and the Paris Stock Exchange combined in September 2000 to form Euronext Amsterdam  which is the largest cash equities market in Europe. It fell under the umbrella of NYSE Euronext for some time. In 2014  it became an independent entity once again. Euronext was the sixth largest combined stock exchange by market cap as of 2017.The three broad equity indexes of Euronext Amsterdam are the mid-cap AMX  blue-chip AEX  small-cap AScX. AEX began in 1983  and remains the most traded and influential index. It consists of over 20 of the most regularly traded Dutch companies. The companies include international businesses like Unilever  Philips  ING Group and Royal Dutch Shell.Other details:Alongside Paris's CAC 40  Brussels' BEL 20 and Germany's DAX  Amsterdam Stock Exchange is one of the leading national indices of Euronext stock exchange group. A composition review of the AEX index is done every quarter. A comprehensive review is conducted in March  and the interim reviews are done in June  September  and December. Any changes made to the index as a result of these examinations come in effect on the month’s third Friday. Before 2008  the changes in the index were made only once a year in March.Read all the Latest News  Trending News  Cricket News  Bollywood News India News and Entertainment News here.
