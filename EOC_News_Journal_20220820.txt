9048,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4535710-tracking-bill-ackman-pershing-square-portfolio-q2-2022-update,Tracking Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Portfolio - Q2 2022 Update,Bill Ackman’s 13F portfolio value decreased from $10.39B to $7.46B this quarter. Click here to know the changes to Pershing Square's portfolio in Q2 2022.,Bryan BedderThis article is part of a series that provides an ongoing analysis of the changes made to Pershing Square’s 13F portfolio on a quarterly basis. It is based on Ackman’s regulatory 13F Form filed on 8/15/2022. Please visit our Tracking Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings article for an idea on how his holdings have progressed over the years and our previous update for the fund’s moves during Q1 2022.Ackman’s 13F portfolio value decreased ~28% from ~$10.78B to ~$7.46B this quarter. The number of positions increased from 8 to 7. The portfolio remains heavily concentrated with a few huge bets. The top three positions account for ~59% of the total portfolio value: Lowe's Companies  Chipotle Mexican Grill  and Restaurant Brands.In addition to partner stakes  the fund also invests the capital from Pershing Square Holdings (OTCPK:PSHZF)  a public entity that debuted in Euronext Amsterdam in October 2014. This was set up primarily to increase the amount of capital invested that is permanent. Pershing Square Holdings had underperformed the S&P 500 since its EOY 2012 inception. This changed in 2019 as they compounded at ~50% in the three years through 2021. For 2022 through August 16th  they are down 10.8%. Their original flagship fund’s (2004 inception) track record is excellent with annualized returns of ~17% compared to ~10.4% for the S&P 500 index.Note 1: Pershing Square Holdings has always traded at a discount to NAV. It currently trades at $33.40 per share compared to NAV of $50.90.Note 2: In July 2020  Pershing Square sponsored the largest SPAC IPO to date  Pershing Square Tontine Holdings. The offering had several retail-investor friendly attributes that made it stand out from the rest of the SPACs. The stock traded at a vast premium to trust value until the UMG transaction fell through. As no deal was consummated by the deadline (July 23  2022)  they chose to return the capital back to shareholders. The biggest SPAC choosing to liquidate without a deal is symptomatic of the dire market sentiment overall toward SPAC transactions.Note 3: Earlier this year  they disclosed the following regarding their hedging strategy  principles  and performance:Principles: asymmetric payoff structures along with monetization that provides liquidity during periods of market dislocation. Strategy: Interest rate hedges from late 2020 to early 2022 as they believed Fed would raise rates earlier than anticipated. Performance: 18.5x return on $64M to $1.2B in 2005-2009 subprime crisis through CDS on MBIA  96.3x return on $27M to $2.6B in 2020 COVID-19 through Index CDS on Investment Grade & High Yield Bonds  and 7.4x return on $188M to $1.4B in 2020-2022 through Out-of-the-money 2 year & 10 year swaptions.Note 4: Pershing Square has a ~10% stake in UMG Music Group (OTCPK:UMGNF) at a cost-basis of ~€18 per share. It currently trades at ~€21.31.To learn more about Bill Ackman  check-out the book “Confidence Game: How Hedge Fund Manager Bill Ackman Called Wall Street's Bluff”.Stake Disposals:Netflix Inc. (NFLX): Pershing Square’s investor call in February disclosed a new holding: 3.1M shares of Netflix acquired at $395 cost-basis. On April 20th  they disclosed the sale of that position in the low 220s. The loss reduced their YTD returns by ~4%. Netflix currently trades at ~$245.Stake Decreases:Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG): CMG is a large ~17% of the portfolio position. The stake was established in Q3 2016 at a cost-basis of ~$405 per share.

Q1 2020 also saw a one-third selling at ~$860 per share. There was a ~7% trimming in Q1 2021 at ~$1 340 per share. Q3 2021 saw a ~3% increase at ~$1 910 per share. The stock currently trades at ~$1 711. There was marginal trimming this quarter.Restaurant Brands International (QSR): The QSR stake is a large ~16% of the portfolio stake.

The four quarters through Q3 2019 had also seen a ~28% selling at prices between $52 and $79. In June 2020  they increased the position by roughly two-thirds through forward contracts at $44.20 cost-basis. The stock currently trades at $59.79. There was marginal trimming in the last two quarters.Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT): The large ~15% portfolio stake was established in October 2018. It was purchased at prices between $64 and $78. Q1 2020 saw a ~30% stake increase at a cost-basis of ~$70. Last quarter saw a ~20% selling at prices between ~$129 and ~$158. The stock currently trades at ~$139. There was marginal trimming this quarter.Note 1: Their overall cost-basis is ~$72 per share.Note 2: In Q4 2018  Hilton Worldwide Holdings came back into the portfolio after a gap of eighteen months. The previous position was purchased in Q3 2016 and disposed a year later. Pershing Square has said that the new position was acquired at a better valuation compared to their previous purchase. Also  the business structure has transformed into a capital-light model following the spinoff in early 2017 of Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) and Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV).Domino’s Pizza (DPZ): DPZ is an ~11% of the portfolio stake established in Q1 2021 at prices between ~$330 and ~$375 and the stock currently trades at ~$417.

The four quarters through Q2 2021 had seen a ~20% selling at prices between ~$136 and ~$211. The stock currently trades at ~$217. There was marginal trimming last quarter.Note: Pershing Square's cost-basis on LOW is ~$85 per share.Howard Hughes Corp (HHC): HHC is now a 12.42% of the 13F portfolio position. The stake was first established in 2010 as a result of its spin-off from GGP Inc. The vast majority of the current stake is from the addition of ~10M shares in Q1 2020 at ~$50 per share through a private placement. Q1 2021 saw a ~25% stake increase at prices between ~$78 and ~$102. The stock is currently at $71.66. Q3 2021 also saw a minor ~1% increase at $92 per share.Note: They have a 27.3% ownership stake in the business.Canadian Pacific Railway (CP): CP is a 2.76% of the portfolio position purchased in Q4 2021 at prices between ~$64.50 and ~$78 and the stock currently trades at ~$82. There was a minor ~5% stake increase last quarter.Note: The position was not in their Q4 2021 13F report but was disclosed in an amended filing this March.Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC) are other long positions in the partnership - the holdings were disclosed in 13D filings on November 15  2013 - as they are not 13F securities  they are not listed in the 13F report.

The combined investment outlay was ~$400M. FNMA & FMCC currently trade at ~$0.60 per share.

The full interim financial report is available here on the Biotalys website.Patrice Sellès  Chief Executive Officer of Biotalys  commented: ""Biotalys continues to forge the path toward a safer  more sustainable food supply by building a strong product pipeline  an exceptionally talented team and a global partner network. As we are coming closer towards the regulatory approval of our first biocontrol Evoca  the continued positive feedback the product has earned both in the field and from renowned industry experts has created great excitement throughout our international team. We achieved a series of major milestones during the first half of 2022  and remain focused on our mission to bring innovative  protein-based biocontrols to growers.""H1 2022 operational highlightsIn the first half of this year  Biotalys has been actively building its team and partnerships to further develop its platform and pipeline:Story continuesThese accomplishments will also pave the way for Biotalys’ pipeline of product candidates  which includes biofungicides  biobactericides and bio-insecticides.After announcing the achievement of a significant breakthrough in protein expression (more than 500% increase in production) for the bioactive ingredient of Evoca in January 2022  which dramatically lowers production costs  Biotalys adapted its biofungicide pipeline to effectively capture market share. As a result  Biotalys’ current pipeline of protein-based biocontrols is as follows:Biotalys pipeline of product candidates can be summarized as follows: Once approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  Biotalys plans to launch the first generation of Evoca for market calibration in select states in the United States through its distribution partner Biobest  followed by an introduction in the EU (pending EU regulatory approval). The second generation of Evoca (containing the same protein bioactive  with enhanced manufacturing and formulation) is currently in the development stage and on track to be submitted to the EPA in the U.S. for follow-on registration. The third generation of Evoca (containing the same protein bioactive  with further optimized manufacturing and formulation) has progressed into the development stage and is planned to enter both the US and the EU markets by 2026. The company expects this third generation of Evoca to generate positive cashflow margins  which will not be the case for the first and second generation of Evoca in view of current production costs. BioFun-6 continues to progress according to plan  allowing Biotalys to focus on throughput and selection capacity  increasing the probability of success and a differentiating offer in the field of fruit and vegetables protection by 2028. BioFun-7 was initiated at the beginning of H1 and is progressing as per plan with a number of academic partnerships in preparation as well as internal development of methods and assays to perform the first work packages. The other pipeline programs (BioIns-1  BioBac-1  BioFun-2 and BioFun-4) are expected to provide valuable IP and know-how  strengthening the company’s AGROBODY Foundry platform and could form the basis of further R&D collaborations.* Evoca™: Pending Registration.

The increase mainly relates to grants to support Biotalys’ R&D activities  which accounted for €1.0 million for the six months ended 30 June 2022 (H1 2021: €0.4 million).Research and development expenses amounted to €7.6 million for the first half of 2022  an increase of €1.3 million compared to the same period of 2021. These increases primarily relate to higher spending for external development (+€0.4 million) and field trial costs (+€0.4 million) in preparation for the market calibration with Evoca next year  as well as increased wage costs (+€0.3 million).General and administrative expenses amounted to €2.6 million for the first half of 2022  compared to €2.2 million in the same period of 2021. The increase was mainly driven by higher wage costs related to the expansion of the team.Net cash used in operating activities increased by €2.3 million for the six months ended 30 June 2022 to €9.6 million  compared to €7.3 million for the six months ended 30 June 2021. These increases primarily relate to a €0.8 million increase in operating loss (net of non-cash items) and changes in working capital driven by the higher payables balance in June 2021 related to certain IPO costs.Outlook for the remainder of 2022 and beyondBiotalys expects to obtain the first registration for Evoca in the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently reviewing the regulatory dossier Biotalys submitted for Evoca end of December 2020. Based on recent discussions with the agency  the company now expects to obtain product registration in early 2023. Biotalys believes this new registration timeline will have no impact on the business plan of the company considering Evoca (first generation) is a market calibration product.The company continues to focus on the market calibration of Evoca in selected states in the U.S.  as well as on the advancement of its ongoing discovery and development initiatives via the AGROBODY Foundry platform. The company will consider the future net development costs of the first and second generation of Evoca as R&D costs.Building on its most recent field trials to perfect application timing best practices  Biotalys is now conducting trials at-flowering sprays within IPM programs in a broader range of commercial important crops  including berries  cucurbits and tomatoes as it deepens field trial data from around the globe.Biotalys also aims to continue selectively leveraging its AGROBODY Foundry platform and pipeline to expand into new markets and crops  and to secure additional strategic collaborations and create additional value.The company has reduced the expected cash burn for the full year 2022 to a range between €24 and €26 million. Savings are anticipated for certain manufacturing  field trial and personnel and other operating costs  and likely extended delivery times for some equipment purchases will delay the cash impact.The outcome of the ongoing feasibility study with Novozymes is expected in early 2023  and may serve as a potential key milestone for Biotalys and Novozymes to enter into development  supply and commercialization agreements for a future generation of Evoca.Auditor StatementThe condensed consolidated financial statements for the six-months’ period ended 30 June 2022 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ as adopted by the European Union.

The initial deal will amount to €1.5 billion in cash  plus another €300 million depending o…,European food ordering and delivery giant Just Eat Takeaway has revealed that it’s selling its stake in Brazil’s iFood for up to €1.8 billion ($1.8 billion) to Prosus.The initial deal will amount to €1.5 billion in cash  plus another €300 million depending on the performance of iFood over the next 12 months.News of the pending deal sent Just Eat Takeaway’s shares soaring 25% to more than €21 in early trading on the Dutch Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.Equity multipleFounded in 2011  iFood operates mainly in Brazil and Colombia  and had raised nearly $600 million in funding since its inception — with Just Eat Takeaway investing across three separate funding rounds  securing around 33% of the business in the process.
