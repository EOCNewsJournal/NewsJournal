9095,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4536077-rheinmetall-promises-best-year-ever-2022,Rheinmetall Promises ‘The Best Year Ever’ In 2022 (OTCMKTS:RNMBF),Rheinmetall is a large supplier to the automotive and defense sectors in Germany. Read more to see a full investment analysis of Rheinmetall stock.,YAROSLAV ISKRYZHYTSKYI/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionAs it has been almost four years since I last discussed Rheinmetall (OTCPK:RNMBF) (OTCPK:RNMBY) here on Seeking Alpha  I feel an update is warranted and the recent release of the Q2 and H1 results provides an excellent starting point for an updated analysis. I would also like to refer you to Wolf Report's recent coverage on Rheinmetall clearly explaining the updated thesis and how the increased budget for the German military forces will have a direct positive benefit for Rheinmetall.Yahoo FinanceThe US listing of Rheinmetall is pretty illiquid  so I would strongly recommend to trade in Rheinmetall on the Deutsche Boerse where it is trading with RHM as ticker symbol. The current market capitalization is approximately 7.3B EUR (using a net share count of 43.4M shares)  and the average daily volume in Germany is approximately a quarter of a million shares per day.The results in the first semester were very satisfyingThe first half of this year was pretty good for Rheinmetall as the company reported an increased revenue and operating income at a higher margin. That's quite encouraging in a world where margins are continuously under pressure. More importantly  Rheinmetall continues to see an increasing order intake in both the civilian and defense business.That's great news as this once again confirms Rheinmetall is in an excellent position to benefit of the increased and increasing defense spending in Germany. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has sent a shockwave through Europe and most countries are increasing their budgets to (finally) start meeting the [soft] NATO requirement to spend 2% of the GDP on defense.Rheinmetall Investor RelationsNot a whole lot has changed if you would have been in a coma for the past four years: the outlook for the automotive industry remains uncertain but the defense spending is improving and accelerating and that pretty much is the same picture as in 2018.In the first semester of this year  Rheinmetall reported a total revenue of 2.67B EUR and after including the changes in inventories  the total 'operating performance' came in at 2.9B EUR. As expected  the higher revenue wasn't really resulting in a much better performance as the COGS increased by about 7.5% and the staff-related expenses also increased by about 10%. With a reported EBIT of 185M EUR we shouldn't be too unhappy though  especially when you see the 'other net financial expense' came in at 40M EUR versus just 11M EUR in the first semester of last year.Rheinmetall Investor RelationsThe net income came in at 134M EUR of which 6M EUR was related to discontinued operations and about 29M EUR of the total reported net income was attributable to non-controlling interests. This means the EPS was approximately 2.42 EUR per share. This includes about 0.14 EUR in net attributable income from discontinued operations resulting in an EPS of 2.28 EUR generated by the continuing operations.Looking at the cash flow result  Rheinmetall reported a negative operating cash flow of 557M EUR. However  this was predominantly caused by a 589M EUR investment in the working capital position as well as a 131M EUR change in receivables and prepaid items. Adjusting the result for these elements  the adjusted operating cash flow was a positive 163M EUR. That's still not great but keep in mind this includes about 62M EUR related to pension provisions and retirement obligations.Rheinmetall Investor RelationsUsing the 163M EUR as starting point and after deducting the 100M EUR in capital expenditures  Rheinmetall's free cash flow was approximately 63M EUR. And if we would add back the pension-related items  the free cash flow would have been close to 125M EUR which is pretty much in line with the reported net income (on a consolidated basis).This doesn't sound too appealing  nor from an EPS point of view nor from a free cash flow point of view. But keep in mind Rheinmetall's performance tends to be rather heavily weighted towards the second half of the year and I expect to see the same thing this year. Considering Rheinmetall is still guiding for a 15% revenue increase this year  we can basically expect the H2 revenue to be at least 20% higher than the total revenue in the first half of the year. In fact  barring unforeseen circumstances  the full-year EPS will likely come in close to 10 EUR per share if the H2 expectations indeed do play out.Let's also not forget the order intake from the German army will likely accelerate in the next few quarters.Rheinmetall Investor RelationsInvestment thesisI missed my opportunity in 2018 when Rheinmetall was trading at less than 80 EUR and then I missed a second opportunity during the COVID crisis in 2020 when Rheinmetall's share price dipped to less than 50 EUR per share. I don't think Rheinmetall is expensive now and that impression was confirmed during the Q2 conference call when the CEO mentioned 2022 'will be the best year in the history of Rheinmetall'. A bold statement and considering the anticipated order intake numbers for the next 24 months  it's likely 2023 and 2024 could be more record-breaking years.I haven't decided yet if I should establish a long position. Perhaps I should consider writing put options as for instance the P120 for December (which is almost 30% below the current share price) is approximately 3.75 EUR while the P140 (a 17% discount to the current share price) has an option premium of approximately 7.50. Attractive premiums and even if I don't get assigned to buy the shares at those low levels I'd still walk away with some sort of return.,neutral,0.09,0.91,0.01,mixed,0.43,0.05,0.52,True,English,"['Rheinmetall Promises', 'Best Year', 'OTCMKTS', 'RNMBF', 'other net financial expense', 'negative operating cash flow', 'free cash flow point', 'direct positive benefit', 'current market capitalization', 'average daily volume', 'cash flow result', 'German military forces', 'increasing order intake', 'order intake numbers', '131M EUR change', 'a million shares', 'past four years', 'working capital position', 'Q2 conference call', 'net attributable income', 'excellent starting point', '589M EUR investment', 'positive 163M EUR', 'increasing defense spending', 'Rheinmetall Investor Relations', 'net share count', ""total 'operating performance"", 'operating income', 'excellent position', 'net income', '43.4M shares', 'a quarter', 'capital expenditures', 'German army', 'EPS point', '40M EUR', '134M EUR', '6M EUR', '29M EUR', '62M EUR', '100M EUR', 'YAROSLAV ISKRYZHYTSKYI', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:RNMBF', 'OTCPK:RNMBY', 'recent release', 'Wolf Report', 'recent coverage', 'Yahoo Finance', 'US listing', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'ticker symbol', 'first semester', 'first half', 'higher margin', 'defense business', 'great news', 'most countries', 'automotive industry', 'same picture', 'staff-related expenses', 'controlling interests', 'prepaid items', 'pension provisions', 'retirement obligations', 'pension-related items', 'consolidated basis', 'second half', 'same thing', 'unforeseen circumstances', 'H2 expectations', 'Investment thesis', 'COVID crisis', 'bold statement', 'total revenue', 'higher revenue', '15% revenue increase', 'H2 revenue', 'share price', 'H1 results', 'full-year EPS', 'second opportunity', 'last year', 'continuing operations', 'best year', '10 EUR', '50 EUR', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'Alpha', 'update', 'analysis', 'budget', 'RHM', '3B', 'Germany', 'day', 'company', 'world', 'margins', 'pressure', 'civilian', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'shockwave', 'Europe', 'GDP', 'lot', 'coma', 'outlook', '67B', 'changes', 'inventories', '2.9B', 'COGS', 'EBIT', '185M', '11M', '557M', 'receivables', 'elements', 'mind', '125M', 'line', 'view', 'fact', 'close', 'next', 'quarters', 'less', 'impression', 'CEO', 'history', '2.42', '28']",2022-08-22,2022-08-22,seekingalpha.com

The analysis found that the combination of COVID and differing federal and state obligations complicate the process employers must follow in warning of mass layoffs. On June 15  a federal appellate court ruled that the COVID-19 pandemic is not a natural disaster that would relieve employers of their duty to give adequate warning before mass layoffs. Although the WARN Act pertains to these larger employers  several jurisdictions have plant closing and layoff requirements that apply to employers with fewer than 100 employees. Some jurisdictions also have stricter notice requirements  with an obligation to provide notice immediately.Key takeaways from the analysis of the WARN Act include:Coverage. The WARN Act applies to public and private employers with at least 100 employees. However  several jurisdictions have plant closing and layoff requirements that apply to public and/or private employers with fewer than 100 employees  including California  Connecticut  the District of Columbia  Hawaii  Illinois  Iowa  Maryland  Massachusetts  New York  Tennessee  and Wisconsin. Requirements can be varied and nuanced: for example  Connecticut has mandates that apply to call centers with at least 50 employees; the District of Columbia has provisions affecting contractors with 25 or more employees; and Iowa's WARN requirements apply to employers with at least 25 full-time employees.Notice. Similarly  some jurisdictions have stricter notice requirements than the 60 days in advance of the specified event that is mandated under the federal WARN Act  either generally  or in particular circumstances. Examples include Alabama  Connecticut  the District of Columbia  Illinois  Iowa  Minnesota  Nevada  New Jersey  New York  Ohio  and Vermont. In some cases  notice must be given as quickly as immediately  within a reasonable time  or as early as possible. Some jurisdictions have notice requirements that are specific to call centers and/or COVID-related events.Severance. Although the federal WARN Act does not include a severance pay requirement  some states do have provisions related to severance  or continuation of income and/or health insurance benefits  including Connecticut  Hawaii  Maine  Massachusetts  New Jersey  and Vermont. For example  in Maine and New Jersey  employers may be required to pay severance of one week's pay for every year of employment. However  in Vermont  severance is not required except as a penalty for violations of that state's notice requirement.Penalties. Under the federal WARN Act  violators may be liable  among other things  for back pay for each day of violation  and benefits  including medical expenses incurred  for up to 60 days  but not more than half the days the employee was employed. Some states with plant closing and layoff laws have similar liability provisions. Several jurisdictions impose civil penalties that can be as high as $10 000 per day for each day of particular types of violations. Employers in at least two states may be subject to criminal liability. In some cases  employees have the right to bring court actions  even class suits  for specified violations  with the right to recover lost wages  benefits  costs  and attorneys' fees.Story continuesTo learn more  visit: https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/vitallaw-law-firmsWho:Pamela Wolf  J.D.  Senior Labor & Employment Legal Analyst at Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S.""Given that 24 states  the District of Columbia  and Puerto Rico have laws that may impose various and nuanced requirements in the event of a public and/or private plant closure or relocation  layoff  or reduction in force  it is imperative that employers understand both federal WARN Act requirements and state law provisions that apply in locations where they do business. Some jurisdictions also have requirements triggered by COVID-19-related events."" – Pamela Wolf  J.D.Contact: For members of the media interested in additional details on the WARN Act's obligations per state or an interview with legal expert Pamela Wolf  J.D. from Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S.  please contact lrusmedia@wolterskluwer.com.About Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S.Wolters Kluwer (WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk  and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

The analysis found that the combination of COVID and differing federal and state obligations complicate the process employers must follow in warning of mass layoffs. On June 15  a federal appellate court ruled that the COVID-19 pandemic is not a natural disaster that would relieve employers of their duty to give adequate warning before mass layoffs. Although the WARN Act pertains to these larger employers  several jurisdictions have plant closing and layoff requirements that apply to employers with fewer than 100 employees. Some jurisdictions also have stricter notice requirements  with an obligation to provide notice immediately.Key takeaways from the analysis of the WARN Act include:Coverage. The WARN Act applies to public and private employers with at least 100 employees. However  several jurisdictions have plant closing and layoff requirements that apply to public and/or private employers with fewer than 100 employees  including California   Connecticut   the District of Columbia   Hawaii   Illinois   Iowa   Maryland   Massachusetts   New York   Tennessee   and Wisconsin . Requirements can be varied and nuanced: for example  Connecticut has mandates that apply to call centers with at least 50 employees; the District of Columbia has provisions affecting contractors with 25 or more employees; and Iowa's WARN requirements apply to employers with at least 25 full-time employees.The WARN Act applies to public and private employers with at least 100 employees.

Notice. Similarly  some jurisdictions have stricter notice requirements than the 60 days in advance of the specified event that is mandated under the federal WARN Act  either generally  or in particular circumstances. Examples include Alabama   Connecticut   the District of Columbia   Illinois  Iowa   Minnesota   Nevada   New Jersey   New York   Ohio   and Vermont . In some cases  notice must be given as quickly as immediately  within a reasonable time  or as early as possible.

Although the federal WARN Act does not include a severance pay requirement  some states do have provisions related to severance  or continuation of income and/or health insurance benefits  including Connecticut   Hawaii   Maine   Massachusetts   New Jersey   and Vermont . For example  in Maine and New Jersey   employers may be required to pay severance of one week's pay for every year of employment. However  in Vermont   severance is not required except as a penalty for violations of that state's notice requirement.Although the federal WARN Act does not include a severance pay requirement  some states do have provisions related to severance  or continuation of income and/or health insurance benefits  including           and . For example  in and   employers may be required to pay severance of one week's pay for every year of employment. However  in   severance is not required except as a penalty for violations of that state's notice requirement. Penalties. Under the federal WARN Act  violators may be liable  among other things  for back pay for each day of violation  and benefits  including medical expenses incurred  for up to 60 days  but not more than half the days the employee was employed. Some states with plant closing and layoff laws have similar liability provisions. Several jurisdictions impose civil penalties that can be as high as $10 000 per day for each day of particular types of violations. Employers in at least two states may be subject to criminal liability. In some cases  employees have the right to bring court actions  even class suits  for specified violations  with the right to recover lost wages  benefits  costs  and attorneys' fees.To learn more  visit: https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/vitallaw-law-firmsWho: Pamela Wolf  J.D.  Senior Labor & Employment Legal Analyst at Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S.""Given that 24 states  the District of Columbia  and Puerto Rico have laws that may impose various and nuanced requirements in the event of a public and/or private plant closure or relocation  layoff  or reduction in force  it is imperative that employers understand both federal WARN Act requirements and state law provisions that apply in locations where they do business. Some jurisdictions also have requirements triggered by COVID-19-related events."" – Pamela Wolf  J.D.Contact: For members of the media interested in additional details on the WARN Act's obligations per state or an interview with legal expert Pamela Wolf  J.D. from Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S.  please contact [email protected].About Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S.Wolters Kluwer (WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk  and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

Although our initial pilot with Immigration and Customs Enforcement has concluded  we are pursuing multiple opportunities in the ATD and broader Criminal Justice Space  including a partnership to offer additional value-added services that will further distinguish our offerings  as well as increasing the revenue potential from each engagement.”“In parallel  we continue to advance our long-term work with a premier S&P 500 bank  as well as our collaboration with Fidelity Information Services  LLC (“FIS”) to implement our proprietary tokenization in FIS’ new global identity authentication system. Two pilots are scheduled with banks  and we anticipate commencing pilots with additional banks later this year. These pilots all utilize our next-generation identity package  offering rapid deployment across devices and platforms with custom workflows for a consistent user experience.”Story continues“Overall  apart from government and banking use-cases  our technology platform has broad applications with significant market opportunities across multiple sectors  including travel  healthcare  Metaverse and cryptographic key and account credential safekeeping  and more. Building on our success  we recently announced key partnerships with IdRamp  to leverage our technologies for transformative biometric multi-factor authentication applications  as well as letus (formerly RentMoola)  to deliver world-class security in the rental space.”“We are also proud to continue working with Mastercard International to leverage our patented IT2 tokenized identity technology for Humanitarian & Development purposes as a core element of its Community Pass and Inclusive Identity offerings. This offering is designed to not only provide financial inclusion services for individuals and businesses  but also broader access to basic necessities  including food  water healthcare and more. We are further encouraged by the recent announcement that a Wellness Pass pilot program utilizing our technology is launching in Ethiopia  a market with over one hundred and fifteen million potential users. Moreover  there are nearly two billion people in the world without the ability to assert an identity for digital transactions and we believe this represents not only a tremendous business opportunity but also an important contribution to global societal inclusion.”“At the same time as developing our user base  we continue to invest in research and development to further expand our portfolio of transformative identity solutions  not only covering identity tokenization but also presentation attack detection  metaverse identity systems  NFTs  and trust scores. Towards this end  we recently received a Notice of Allowance by the United States Patent Office for our twelfth patent  and we have an additional twenty-one patent applications pending. Trust Stamp’s technology uniquely addresses the market need for an unparalleled level of identity data protection at a fraction of the cost  while improving the efficiency and expanding the utility of legacy identity systems.”“Our investments in scalable infrastructure position us to achieve growth and deliver meaningful value for our shareholders. We remain committed to our mission of delivering equitable  privacy-preserving identity solutions that empower access and protect data for individuals and organizations around the world. We remain highly encouraged by the outlook for the business and look forward to providing further updates in the weeks and months ahead.”Financial Performance OverviewRevenueNet revenue increased by $2.28 million or 182.0%  to $3.53 million for H1 2022  compared to $1.25 million for H1 2021. This increase was primarily due to revenue contracts executed by new and existing customers  while net revenue was $0.71 million in Q2 2022 compared to $0.72 million in Q2 2021 reflecting the timing of orders and the pause in performance (and hence billing) in respect of a government.Gross ProfitGross profit increased by $1.84 million or 284.0% for the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year  and gross profit margin improved to 70.5% for the half-year 2022  compared to 51.7% for H1 2021. The improvement was due in part to the Company’s prior investment in research and development  which enabled the utilization of existing technologies with relatively nominal implementation costs for new deployments. Gross profit was $360 thousand  or 50.8% of revenue in Q2 2022  compared to $373 thousand  or 51.8% of revenue for Q2 2022. It is important to note that the cost of goods sold in Q2 included labor costs related to retaining the staff needed to service the government contract without receiving offsetting revenue.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development (R&D) costs for Q2 2022 were $574 thousand for Q2 2022  compared to $317 thousand for Q2 2021. R&D costs were $1.0 million for H1 2022  compared to $484 thousand for H1 2021 reflecting the increase in R&D personnel to support an accelerated product roadmap. R&D costs are not expected to continue growing at their prior pace and the Company anticipates reporting lowered expenditure on R&D by Q4 of 2022 as a result of increased operational efficiencies.Selling  General  and Administrative ExpensesSelling  general  and administrative (SG&A) expense was $2.53 million for Q2 2022  compared to $1.95 million for Q2 2021.
