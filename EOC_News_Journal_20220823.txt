9095,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4536077-rheinmetall-promises-best-year-ever-2022,Rheinmetall Promises ‘The Best Year Ever’ In 2022 (OTCMKTS:RNMBF),Rheinmetall is a large supplier to the automotive and defense sectors in Germany. Read more to see a full investment analysis of Rheinmetall stock.,YAROSLAV ISKRYZHYTSKYI/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionAs it has been almost four years since I last discussed Rheinmetall (OTCPK:RNMBF) (OTCPK:RNMBY) here on Seeking Alpha  I feel an update is warranted and the recent release of the Q2 and H1 results provides an excellent starting point for an updated analysis. I would also like to refer you to Wolf Report's recent coverage on Rheinmetall clearly explaining the updated thesis and how the increased budget for the German military forces will have a direct positive benefit for Rheinmetall.Yahoo FinanceThe US listing of Rheinmetall is pretty illiquid  so I would strongly recommend to trade in Rheinmetall on the Deutsche Boerse where it is trading with RHM as ticker symbol. The current market capitalization is approximately 7.3B EUR (using a net share count of 43.4M shares)  and the average daily volume in Germany is approximately a quarter of a million shares per day.The results in the first semester were very satisfyingThe first half of this year was pretty good for Rheinmetall as the company reported an increased revenue and operating income at a higher margin. That's quite encouraging in a world where margins are continuously under pressure. More importantly  Rheinmetall continues to see an increasing order intake in both the civilian and defense business.That's great news as this once again confirms Rheinmetall is in an excellent position to benefit of the increased and increasing defense spending in Germany. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has sent a shockwave through Europe and most countries are increasing their budgets to (finally) start meeting the [soft] NATO requirement to spend 2% of the GDP on defense.Rheinmetall Investor RelationsNot a whole lot has changed if you would have been in a coma for the past four years: the outlook for the automotive industry remains uncertain but the defense spending is improving and accelerating and that pretty much is the same picture as in 2018.In the first semester of this year  Rheinmetall reported a total revenue of 2.67B EUR and after including the changes in inventories  the total 'operating performance' came in at 2.9B EUR. As expected  the higher revenue wasn't really resulting in a much better performance as the COGS increased by about 7.5% and the staff-related expenses also increased by about 10%. With a reported EBIT of 185M EUR we shouldn't be too unhappy though  especially when you see the 'other net financial expense' came in at 40M EUR versus just 11M EUR in the first semester of last year.Rheinmetall Investor RelationsThe net income came in at 134M EUR of which 6M EUR was related to discontinued operations and about 29M EUR of the total reported net income was attributable to non-controlling interests. This means the EPS was approximately 2.42 EUR per share. This includes about 0.14 EUR in net attributable income from discontinued operations resulting in an EPS of 2.28 EUR generated by the continuing operations.Looking at the cash flow result  Rheinmetall reported a negative operating cash flow of 557M EUR. However  this was predominantly caused by a 589M EUR investment in the working capital position as well as a 131M EUR change in receivables and prepaid items. Adjusting the result for these elements  the adjusted operating cash flow was a positive 163M EUR. That's still not great but keep in mind this includes about 62M EUR related to pension provisions and retirement obligations.Rheinmetall Investor RelationsUsing the 163M EUR as starting point and after deducting the 100M EUR in capital expenditures  Rheinmetall's free cash flow was approximately 63M EUR. And if we would add back the pension-related items  the free cash flow would have been close to 125M EUR which is pretty much in line with the reported net income (on a consolidated basis).This doesn't sound too appealing  nor from an EPS point of view nor from a free cash flow point of view. But keep in mind Rheinmetall's performance tends to be rather heavily weighted towards the second half of the year and I expect to see the same thing this year. Considering Rheinmetall is still guiding for a 15% revenue increase this year  we can basically expect the H2 revenue to be at least 20% higher than the total revenue in the first half of the year. In fact  barring unforeseen circumstances  the full-year EPS will likely come in close to 10 EUR per share if the H2 expectations indeed do play out.Let's also not forget the order intake from the German army will likely accelerate in the next few quarters.Rheinmetall Investor RelationsInvestment thesisI missed my opportunity in 2018 when Rheinmetall was trading at less than 80 EUR and then I missed a second opportunity during the COVID crisis in 2020 when Rheinmetall's share price dipped to less than 50 EUR per share. I don't think Rheinmetall is expensive now and that impression was confirmed during the Q2 conference call when the CEO mentioned 2022 'will be the best year in the history of Rheinmetall'. A bold statement and considering the anticipated order intake numbers for the next 24 months  it's likely 2023 and 2024 could be more record-breaking years.I haven't decided yet if I should establish a long position. Perhaps I should consider writing put options as for instance the P120 for December (which is almost 30% below the current share price) is approximately 3.75 EUR while the P140 (a 17% discount to the current share price) has an option premium of approximately 7.50. Attractive premiums and even if I don't get assigned to buy the shares at those low levels I'd still walk away with some sort of return.,neutral,0.09,0.91,0.01,mixed,0.43,0.05,0.52,True,English,"['Rheinmetall Promises', 'Best Year', 'OTCMKTS', 'RNMBF', 'other net financial expense', 'negative operating cash flow', 'free cash flow point', 'direct positive benefit', 'current market capitalization', 'average daily volume', 'cash flow result', 'German military forces', 'increasing order intake', 'order intake numbers', '131M EUR change', 'a million shares', 'past four years', 'working capital position', 'Q2 conference call', 'net attributable income', 'excellent starting point', '589M EUR investment', 'positive 163M EUR', 'increasing defense spending', 'Rheinmetall Investor Relations', 'net share count', ""total 'operating performance"", 'operating income', 'excellent position', 'net income', '43.4M shares', 'a quarter', 'capital expenditures', 'German army', 'EPS point', '40M EUR', '134M EUR', '6M EUR', '29M EUR', '62M EUR', '100M EUR', 'YAROSLAV ISKRYZHYTSKYI', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:RNMBF', 'OTCPK:RNMBY', 'recent release', 'Wolf Report', 'recent coverage', 'Yahoo Finance', 'US listing', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'ticker symbol', 'first semester', 'first half', 'higher margin', 'defense business', 'great news', 'most countries', 'automotive industry', 'same picture', 'staff-related expenses', 'controlling interests', 'prepaid items', 'pension provisions', 'retirement obligations', 'pension-related items', 'consolidated basis', 'second half', 'same thing', 'unforeseen circumstances', 'H2 expectations', 'Investment thesis', 'COVID crisis', 'bold statement', 'total revenue', 'higher revenue', '15% revenue increase', 'H2 revenue', 'share price', 'H1 results', 'full-year EPS', 'second opportunity', 'last year', 'continuing operations', 'best year', '10 EUR', '50 EUR', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'Alpha', 'update', 'analysis', 'budget', 'RHM', '3B', 'Germany', 'day', 'company', 'world', 'margins', 'pressure', 'civilian', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'shockwave', 'Europe', 'GDP', 'lot', 'coma', 'outlook', '67B', 'changes', 'inventories', '2.9B', 'COGS', 'EBIT', '185M', '11M', '557M', 'receivables', 'elements', 'mind', '125M', 'line', 'view', 'fact', 'close', 'next', 'quarters', 'less', 'impression', 'CEO', 'history', '2.42', '28']",2022-08-22,2022-08-23,seekingalpha.com

The development is a revolutionary multi lens 3D imaging scanner. The development is being done by Invis’art SAS  a company in France (FR71878526433  Château de Tarailhan  11560 Fleury D’Aude). The opportunity of developing the multi lens 3D imaging scanner in Condor Technologies is the result of the operations and transactions that have taken place and that were previously explained by Condor Technologies in its press releases that were published on 4 December 2019  25 February 2020 and 14 April 2021.Invis’art is a French company 99 99 % owned by Condor Technologies.Invis’art is being led by Mme Aurore Duret who is the acting CEO of Invis Art. She is supported by the teams of Condor Technologies and more in particular by Professor Francois Duret at the board of Invis’art and considered being the inventor of CAD CAM in Dentistry.This breakthrough patented 3D imaging device is radically different from any existing intra oral scanner in the sense that the scan takes less that 10 seconds to capture an entire arch. It requires no training for the usage of the device. It replicates the gesture of traditional tray impression used by dentists all over the world. This gesture has been part of every dental practice over 100 years.More information can be found at www.invisart.frWe anticipate the end of the development by Q1 of 2023. The aim is to present the pre-production units at the IDS dental show in March of 2023.ABOUT CONDOR TECHNOLOGIES NVCondor Technologies is a company specialized in dental CAD/CAM equipment  with its most known product the Invis’art Tray Scanner.Condor Technologies is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The analysis found that the combination of COVID and differing federal and state obligations complicate the process employers must follow in warning of mass layoffs. On June 15  a federal appellate court ruled that the COVID-19 pandemic is not a natural disaster that would relieve employers of their duty to give adequate warning before mass layoffs. Although the WARN Act pertains to these larger employers  several jurisdictions have plant closing and layoff requirements that apply to employers with fewer than 100 employees. Some jurisdictions also have stricter notice requirements  with an obligation to provide notice immediately.Key takeaways from the analysis of the WARN Act include:Coverage. The WARN Act applies to public and private employers with at least 100 employees. However  several jurisdictions have plant closing and layoff requirements that apply to public and/or private employers with fewer than 100 employees  including California  Connecticut  the District of Columbia  Hawaii  Illinois  Iowa  Maryland  Massachusetts  New York  Tennessee  and Wisconsin. Requirements can be varied and nuanced: for example  Connecticut has mandates that apply to call centers with at least 50 employees; the District of Columbia has provisions affecting contractors with 25 or more employees; and Iowa's WARN requirements apply to employers with at least 25 full-time employees.Notice. Similarly  some jurisdictions have stricter notice requirements than the 60 days in advance of the specified event that is mandated under the federal WARN Act  either generally  or in particular circumstances. Examples include Alabama  Connecticut  the District of Columbia  Illinois  Iowa  Minnesota  Nevada  New Jersey  New York  Ohio  and Vermont. In some cases  notice must be given as quickly as immediately  within a reasonable time  or as early as possible. Some jurisdictions have notice requirements that are specific to call centers and/or COVID-related events.Severance. Although the federal WARN Act does not include a severance pay requirement  some states do have provisions related to severance  or continuation of income and/or health insurance benefits  including Connecticut  Hawaii  Maine  Massachusetts  New Jersey  and Vermont. For example  in Maine and New Jersey  employers may be required to pay severance of one week's pay for every year of employment. However  in Vermont  severance is not required except as a penalty for violations of that state's notice requirement.Penalties. Under the federal WARN Act  violators may be liable  among other things  for back pay for each day of violation  and benefits  including medical expenses incurred  for up to 60 days  but not more than half the days the employee was employed. Some states with plant closing and layoff laws have similar liability provisions. Several jurisdictions impose civil penalties that can be as high as $10 000 per day for each day of particular types of violations. Employers in at least two states may be subject to criminal liability. In some cases  employees have the right to bring court actions  even class suits  for specified violations  with the right to recover lost wages  benefits  costs  and attorneys' fees.Story continuesTo learn more  visit: https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/vitallaw-law-firmsWho:Pamela Wolf  J.D.  Senior Labor & Employment Legal Analyst at Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S.""Given that 24 states  the District of Columbia  and Puerto Rico have laws that may impose various and nuanced requirements in the event of a public and/or private plant closure or relocation  layoff  or reduction in force  it is imperative that employers understand both federal WARN Act requirements and state law provisions that apply in locations where they do business. Some jurisdictions also have requirements triggered by COVID-19-related events."" – Pamela Wolf  J.D.Contact: For members of the media interested in additional details on the WARN Act's obligations per state or an interview with legal expert Pamela Wolf  J.D. from Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S.  please contact lrusmedia@wolterskluwer.com.About Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S.Wolters Kluwer (WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk  and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

The analysis found that the combination of COVID and differing federal and state obligations complicate the process employers must follow in warning of mass layoffs. On June 15  a federal appellate court ruled that the COVID-19 pandemic is not a natural disaster that would relieve employers of their duty to give adequate warning before mass layoffs. Although the WARN Act pertains to these larger employers  several jurisdictions have plant closing and layoff requirements that apply to employers with fewer than 100 employees. Some jurisdictions also have stricter notice requirements  with an obligation to provide notice immediately.Key takeaways from the analysis of the WARN Act include:Coverage. The WARN Act applies to public and private employers with at least 100 employees. However  several jurisdictions have plant closing and layoff requirements that apply to public and/or private employers with fewer than 100 employees  including California   Connecticut   the District of Columbia   Hawaii   Illinois   Iowa   Maryland   Massachusetts   New York   Tennessee   and Wisconsin . Requirements can be varied and nuanced: for example  Connecticut has mandates that apply to call centers with at least 50 employees; the District of Columbia has provisions affecting contractors with 25 or more employees; and Iowa's WARN requirements apply to employers with at least 25 full-time employees.The WARN Act applies to public and private employers with at least 100 employees.

With its energy efficiency services  ...,"VoltaliaHelexia  a subsidiary of Voltalia (Euronext Paris  ISIN code: FR0011995588)  helps companies reduce their energy bills. With its energy efficiency services  Helexia reduces the electricity consumption of companies. At the same time  Helexia enables companies to produce photovoltaic electricity on their sites  on their roofs or on their parking lots.In the context of energy scarcity and cost inflation  European companies need to reduce their energy bills.This energy transition can only be achieved with a comprehensive approach: reducing energy consumption and producing green energy.Helexia's range of services is broad and and covers the definition of the strategy  the execution of works and the operation (control and maintenance) of the installations.Helexia can ensure these tasks for the customer  who then remains the owner of the installations  or carry on its balance sheet the investments required to improve energy efficiency (energy performance contracts) or to produce solar energy (self-consumption or solar electricity sales contracts). For the customer  this makes it possible to transform the constraint into an opportunity.Helexia is deploying a very strong growth system to meet the needs of its clients. On the only aspect of photovoltaic production whose investment is carried by Helexia  the portfolio of roofs and solar shades under contract1 went from 52 to 402 megawatts in 36 months: a multiplication by 7.7.""In recent years  Helexia's clients' first priority has often been to reduce their carbon footprint  although reducing energy costs has not been overlooked. With the scarcity of energy that now characterizes the news in many countries  reducing consumption and on-site photovoltaic production have become sometimes vital issues. Helexia helps its clients achieve their financial and environmental objectives "" said Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.""Each country has its own particularities: France now has a strong political will to cover parking lots with solar shading; Spain is circumventing the constraints of connection to the electricity grid by increasing self-consumption; and Portugal is multiplying the number of electric vehicle chargers associated with on-site photovoltaic production. But there is a common trend: that of energy sobriety "" says Benjamin Simonis  Managing Director of Helexia.Story continuesThey trusted HelexiaSNCF  Auchan Retail  Capfruit  Telefonica  Leroy Merlin  Lidl  Graham Packaging  Veolia Environnement  Boulanger  De Dietrich  Clermont Auvergne Métropole  Decathlon  Metalchimica  Reyes Group  Chronodrive  Bricomart  E.Leclerc  Leybold  Argan.Helexia client caseHelexia accompanied the Portuguese company Joluso Invepe in its energetic transition. Specialising in the production of bodywork and semi-trailers for trucks since 1986  the company called on Helexia to advise it and monitor the work. Helexia carried out an energy audit to identify possible savings  and then replaced the lighting with LED lamps. Helexia has also installed a 182 kilowatt photovoltaic power plant on the roof  enabling the production of 283 megawatt hours and covering 33% of the company's energy needs.Helexia's servicesConsultancy services help to define the energy strategy to be implemented in order to achieve the CSR objectives of companies and to achieve real budgetary savings.Energy audit: it helps to understand energy consumption and to identify energy saving actions. According to the French national organisation for standardisation (AFNOR)  the cumulative energy saving potential identified by an audit is estimated at 25% in euros and 23% in kilowatt hour (kWh)Carbon footprint: broader than the energy audit  it looks at all direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.Energy Master Plan: this is the planning of emission reduction actions over the long term to optimise the return on investment and control the bugdetsSetting up an an Energy Management System (EMS) / ISO 50 001 certification: defining the appropriate organisation to achieve continuous improvementSupport for the installation of rooftop or carport photovoltaic power plants  installation of electric vehicle chargers or for energy saving actions:Engineering/Design: Helexia is present during all pre-project stages to define the most appropriate technical solutions and identify the right service providersProject execution: project owner assistance for works execution until installation commissioning  either as Contracting Authority Supportor as a turnkey project.Asset and Energy Management solutions help to optimise energy consumption.

Although our initial pilot with Immigration and Customs Enforcement has concluded  we are pursuing multiple opportunities in the ATD and broader Criminal Justice Space  including a partnership to offer additional value-added services that will further distinguish our offerings  as well as increasing the revenue potential from each engagement.”“In parallel  we continue to advance our long-term work with a premier S&P 500 bank  as well as our collaboration with Fidelity Information Services  LLC (“FIS”) to implement our proprietary tokenization in FIS’ new global identity authentication system. Two pilots are scheduled with banks  and we anticipate commencing pilots with additional banks later this year. These pilots all utilize our next-generation identity package  offering rapid deployment across devices and platforms with custom workflows for a consistent user experience.”Story continues“Overall  apart from government and banking use-cases  our technology platform has broad applications with significant market opportunities across multiple sectors  including travel  healthcare  Metaverse and cryptographic key and account credential safekeeping  and more. Building on our success  we recently announced key partnerships with IdRamp  to leverage our technologies for transformative biometric multi-factor authentication applications  as well as letus (formerly RentMoola)  to deliver world-class security in the rental space.”“We are also proud to continue working with Mastercard International to leverage our patented IT2 tokenized identity technology for Humanitarian & Development purposes as a core element of its Community Pass and Inclusive Identity offerings. This offering is designed to not only provide financial inclusion services for individuals and businesses  but also broader access to basic necessities  including food  water healthcare and more. We are further encouraged by the recent announcement that a Wellness Pass pilot program utilizing our technology is launching in Ethiopia  a market with over one hundred and fifteen million potential users. Moreover  there are nearly two billion people in the world without the ability to assert an identity for digital transactions and we believe this represents not only a tremendous business opportunity but also an important contribution to global societal inclusion.”“At the same time as developing our user base  we continue to invest in research and development to further expand our portfolio of transformative identity solutions  not only covering identity tokenization but also presentation attack detection  metaverse identity systems  NFTs  and trust scores. Towards this end  we recently received a Notice of Allowance by the United States Patent Office for our twelfth patent  and we have an additional twenty-one patent applications pending. Trust Stamp’s technology uniquely addresses the market need for an unparalleled level of identity data protection at a fraction of the cost  while improving the efficiency and expanding the utility of legacy identity systems.”“Our investments in scalable infrastructure position us to achieve growth and deliver meaningful value for our shareholders. We remain committed to our mission of delivering equitable  privacy-preserving identity solutions that empower access and protect data for individuals and organizations around the world. We remain highly encouraged by the outlook for the business and look forward to providing further updates in the weeks and months ahead.”Financial Performance OverviewRevenueNet revenue increased by $2.28 million or 182.0%  to $3.53 million for H1 2022  compared to $1.25 million for H1 2021. This increase was primarily due to revenue contracts executed by new and existing customers  while net revenue was $0.71 million in Q2 2022 compared to $0.72 million in Q2 2021 reflecting the timing of orders and the pause in performance (and hence billing) in respect of a government.Gross ProfitGross profit increased by $1.84 million or 284.0% for the first half of 2022 compared to the same period last year  and gross profit margin improved to 70.5% for the half-year 2022  compared to 51.7% for H1 2021. The improvement was due in part to the Company’s prior investment in research and development  which enabled the utilization of existing technologies with relatively nominal implementation costs for new deployments. Gross profit was $360 thousand  or 50.8% of revenue in Q2 2022  compared to $373 thousand  or 51.8% of revenue for Q2 2022. It is important to note that the cost of goods sold in Q2 included labor costs related to retaining the staff needed to service the government contract without receiving offsetting revenue.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development (R&D) costs for Q2 2022 were $574 thousand for Q2 2022  compared to $317 thousand for Q2 2021. R&D costs were $1.0 million for H1 2022  compared to $484 thousand for H1 2021 reflecting the increase in R&D personnel to support an accelerated product roadmap. R&D costs are not expected to continue growing at their prior pace and the Company anticipates reporting lowered expenditure on R&D by Q4 of 2022 as a result of increased operational efficiencies.Selling  General  and Administrative ExpensesSelling  general  and administrative (SG&A) expense was $2.53 million for Q2 2022  compared to $1.95 million for Q2 2021. SG&A expense was $5.70 million for H1 2022  compared to $3.87 million for H1 2021. The increase in SG&A expense during the three and six months ended June 30  2022  was primarily driven by investment in personnel to support growth initiatives. SG&A for the H1 2022 also included legal and professional services fees  as well as other one-off fees and costs related to the listing of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market in the first quarter of 2022. The company anticipates reporting reduced SG&A costs in Q4 as a result of increased operational efficiencies.Operating LossOperating loss was $2.94 million for Q2 2022  compared to $2.05 million for H1 2021. Operating loss was $4.58 million for H1 2022  compared to $3.98 million for H1 2021. The primary reason for the increase in operating loss was an increase in SG&A (including carrying the labor costs required to support the government contract while performance was paused)  and the increase in R&D expenses.Net LossNet loss was $2.92 million or $0.13 per basic and diluted share for Q2 2022  compared to $1.97 or $0.10 per basic and diluted share for Q2 2021. Net loss was $4.61 million or $0.20 per basic and diluted share for H1 2022  compared to $4.00 million or $0.22 per basic and diluted share for H1 2021.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of June 30  2022  and December 31  2021  the Company had approximately $2.83 million and $3.48 million of cash  respectively. Total working capital as of June 30  2022  was $2.94 million  compared to $3.36 million as of December 31  2021. As of June 30  2022  and December 31  2021  the Company had no long-term debt. Total stockholders’ equity was $4.95 million as of June 30  2022  compared to $5.03 million as of December 31  2021.A copy of the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 30  2022 has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and posted on the Company’s website at https://investors.truststamp.ai/sec-filings/ .About Trust StampTrust Stamp   is a global provider of AI-powered identity services for use in multiple sectors including banking and finance  regulatory compliance  government  real estate  communications  and humanitarian services.

We look forward to working with WHO as they review VLA2001 for prequalification and to continuing our existing discussions with governments who are considering VLA2001 for their vaccine portfolios.”Valneva currently has agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain3. Valneva is retaining inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase. In parallel  the Company is continuing discussions with various other governments around the world  with the aim to deploy approximately eight to ten million doses of remaining inventory into international markets in the next six to twelve months. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine.4Story continuesAbout VLA2001VLA2001 is the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine which has received marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe5. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom6 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates7 and Kingdom of Bahrain8.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to possible purchase agreements and regulatory approval of VLA2001 and clinical trial results.

9140,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/notice-extraordinary-general-meeting-jyske-110100760.html,Notice of Extraordinary General Meeting of Jyske Bank A/S,This is to give notice of an Extraordinary General Meeting of Jyske Bank A/S  which will be held on Wednesday 14 September 2022  at 10.00 a.m. at Vestergade ...,Jyske BankThis is to give notice of an Extraordinary General Meeting of Jyske Bank A/S  which will be held on Wednesday 14 September 2022  at 10.00 a.m. at Vestergade 8-16  8600 Silkeborg  Denmark.At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 22 August 2022  the motion to amend the Articles of Association was adopted. However  the members in general meeting with a right to vote represented less than 90% of the share capital  wherefore the final adoption of the amendment to the Articles of Association is subject to adoption at a new Extraordinary General Meeting.The AGENDA for consideration and final adoption.a. Motions proposed by the Supervisory Board: Reduction of Jyske Bank’s nominal share capital by DKK 47 279 050 (corresponding to 4 727 905 shares at a nominal value of DKK 10) from DKK 690 000 000 to DKK 642 720 950. With reference to S.188(1) of the Danish Companies Act we point out that the capital reduction takes place through cancellation of previously acquired own shares acquired by Jyske Bank in accordance with authorisation from members in general meeting. Hence  the capital reduction is spent on payment of capital owners.If the motion is adopted  Jyske Bank's holding of own shares will be reduced by 4 727 905 shares of a nominal value of DKK 10 These shares have been bought back at a total amount of DKK 1 699 780 525 which implies that  apart from the nominal capital reduction  a total amount of DKK 1 652 501 475 has been paid to the capital owners in connection with the buy-backs. The capital reduction takes place at a share premium since it will be at 359.52 for each share of a nominal amount of DKK 10  corresponding to the average price at which the shares have been bought back.In consequence of the above  the following amendment to the Articles of Association is proposed:Art. 2 to be amended to the effect that Jyske Bank’s nominal share capital be DKK 642 720 950 distributed on 64 272 095 shares.b. The Supervisory Board proposes that members in general meeting authorise the chairman of the meeting (with a right of substitution) to notify any resolutions adopted to the Danish Business Authority and to make such adjustments which may be required by the Danish Business Authority in connection with the registration of the resolutions adopted.c. Any other business.Reference to Jyske Bank's website for further informationWhere in this notice of a general meeting  reference is made to Jyske Bank’s website for further information  this link can be used: www.jyskebank.com/investorrelations/generalmeetings .Adoption of motions - special requirementsThe motion to amend Jyske Bank’s Articles of Association (item a of the agenda) at extraordinary general meetings shall only be finally adopted where adopted by three fourth of the votes cast and by three fourth of the voting share capital represented at the general meeting cf.

9141,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zwipe-h1-2022-results-healthy-061300377.html,Zwipe H1 2022 results - healthy commercial momentum,"Zwipe AS (""Zwipe"" or ""the company"") today announces its results for the first half 2022.","OSLO  NORWAY  Aug. 23  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Zwipe AS (""Zwipe"" or ""the company"") today announces its results for the first half 2022.Operational highlightsVisa certifies Zwipe Pay Biometric Payment Card (""BPC"") Platform and issues Letter of Approval (""LoA"") to Zwipe.Beautiful Card Corporation (""BCC"")  TAG Systems and Inkript obtain Visa LoAs for their own card built on the Zwipe Pay platform.Fraport AG  providing operational services to 31 airports globally  selected Zwipe Access as one of two solutions to test in a pilot of next generation access control solutions at Frankfurt Airport.Zwipe Access platform was successfully integrated with LEGIC and HID solutions to provide seamless end-to-end biometric card-based access control security to enterprises and facilities.Seven new issuers across Germany  India  the Middle East and Africa signed up with Zwipe to launch pilots.Placard  the largest payment smart card supplier in Australia and New Zealand  selected the Zwipe Pay platform for delivering biometric payment cards to banks in the region.Significant organizational development with Robert Puskaric joining as the new CEO in June  Danielle Glenn as the new CFO in May and Patrice Meilland as the new Chief Strategy and Product Officer in April.Financial highlightsReviewIn H1 2022  we signed seven new issuers for Zwipe Pay  from Germany to India and across the Middle East. All of them are planning pilots with our card manufacturing partners  although we have learned that pilot preparation is taking longer than previously expected. We also expanded our global delivery capabilities and market reach by signing one major SCM and onboarding two leading personalization solution providers as go-to-market (""GTM"") partners.Zwipe is pursuing an ""execution first"" approach focusing on launching announced pilots. In total  seven issuer pilots are progressing with good pace and according to issuer plans. Additional pilot launches are expected in the coming quarters  with launch dates entirely dependent on issuer decisions. We are also focused on ""execution first"" with our SCM customers - getting all certified and ready for mass volume production. While these remain our top priorities  Zwipe continues expanding our customer and issuer pipeline - critical to our medium-term success.Story continuesIn March  Zwipe completed the certification process with Visa and obtained the Visa LoA. This certification marks a major milestone towards commercialization of Zwipe Pay and was followed by Visa LoAs obtained by lead customers BCC  TAG Systems and Inkript. This list is expected to grow significantly going forward. Zwipe has successfully completed additional testing with third party laboratories that should ease additional payment scheme certifications.It is undeniable that market takeoff of biometric payment cards has been slower than envisioned. BPC volumes deployed are expected to remain fairly low into 2023  before growing exponentially thereafter. Zwipe is not immune to the delayed market takeoff  but our customers and partners remain committed to launching pilots and commercial propositions  even if somewhat later than originally planned. Furthermore  consumer demand for BPCs remains strong with 82% of individuals surveyed by Zwipe saying that they want their next card to be biometric and 60% saying they would consider switching to banks who offer biometric cards. Importantly  most third-party research continues to point to BPCs accounting for 15-20% of total EMV units shipped by 2030 (estimated at 3-4 billion units)  highlighting just how large the market potential remains.For Zwipe Access  we now have a healthy and growing list of opportunities within the data center and airport verticals as well as other security sensitive customer segments. The growing number of requests for Zwipe Access solutions is driven by increasing demand for stronger data privacy  higher security and better user experience. Indeed  Zwipe was recognized by Fraport  operating 31 international airports globally  as a potential provider for next generation security solutions at their airports. Fraport's initial trials have now been completed and they are evaluating possible next steps.There were substantial changes in the executive management team at Zwipe during the first half  with three of the six-member C-suite newly joining the company - strengthening leadership  bringing industry expertise and positioning Zwipe well for the future.Financial reviewZwipe reported total revenues of 0.8 mNOK during H1 2022 versus 1.4 mNOK in H1 2021. On an adjusted basis  total operating expenses increased by 13.3 mNOK to 48.4 mNOK in H1 2022 versus H1 2021. The majority of this increase was due to personnel expenses  which increased by 9.1 mNOK to 25.9 mNOK in H1 2022 versus H1 2021. Of the 9.1 mNOK  5.5 mNOK were one-off costs related to former executives leaving the company. The remaining increase in personnel expense is largely due to an increase in headcount by 13 people to meet the strong demand for the company's solutions and to prepare for piloting and deployment of our card payment solutions and services.Zwipe's cash position remains strong  with cash and cash equivalents at 109.7 mNOK on 30 June 2022.Total equity as of 30 June 2022 was 108.8 mNOK resulting in an equity ratio of 89%  roughly stable versus the position at the end of the first half of 2021.The way forwardZwipe is progressing well in many important areas even if the market for biometric payment cards is developing at a slower pace than expected. Operating expenses and headcount are not expected to increase substantially in H2 vs H1 2022 nor at the pace expected at the start of the year. Zwipe will  however  continue to invest intelligently - particularly in its people and technology.For Zwipe Pay  second half priorities will center on pilot deployment with issuers  assisting SCMs in becoming mass production and delivery ready  and continuing to expand our customer and issuer pipeline. Further developing the dedicated customer project management function and standardized blueprint to improve pilot execution will be a key focus during H2 2022.Going forward  Zwipe Access is expected to contribute a larger part of revenue than previously assumed. The pipeline for Zwipe Access is healthy and growing with prospects within the data center and airport verticals as well as other security sensitive customer segments.Results presentationCEO Robert Puskaric and CFO Danielle Glenn will present the H1 2022 results by webcast tomorrow  Wednesday August 24th  at 09:00 CEST.Webcast detailsFormat: Webcast  Conference Call and Q&ALanguage: EnglishLink: https://q4-emea.wavecast.io/zwipe-as/h1-2022-operational-updateDial-in numbers:Norway - +47.57.98.94.30Sweden - +46.8.505.246.90Sweden - Toll-Free- +46.20.0123749United Kingdom - +44.20.3481.4247United Kingdom - Toll-Free- +44.800.260.6466Participants will be required to register to view the webcast and participate in the Q&AThis information is subject to the disclosure requirements in Regulation EU 596/2014 article 19 number 3 and the Norwegian Securities Trading Act section 5-12  and is information that Zwipe AS is obligated to make public pursuant to the continuing obligations of companies admitted to trading on Euronext Growth Oslo (Euronext Growth Oslo Rule Book - Part II) and on Nasdaq First North Growth Market.

Placard  the largest payment smart card supplier in Australia and New Zealand   selected the Zwipe Pay platform for delivering biometric payment cards to banks in the region.and   selected the Zwipe Pay platform for delivering biometric payment cards to banks in the region. Significant organizational development with Robert Puskaric joining as the new CEO in June  Danielle Glenn as the new CFO in May and Patrice Meilland as the new Chief Strategy and Product Officer in April.Financial highlightsReviewIn H1 2022  we signed seven new issuers for Zwipe Pay  from Germany to India and across the Middle East. All of them are planning pilots with our card manufacturing partners  although we have learned that pilot preparation is taking longer than previously expected. We also expanded our global delivery capabilities and market reach by signing one major SCM and onboarding two leading personalization solution providers as go-to-market (""GTM"") partners.Zwipe is pursuing an ""execution first"" approach focusing on launching announced pilots. In total  seven issuer pilots are progressing with good pace and according to issuer plans. Additional pilot launches are expected in the coming quarters  with launch dates entirely dependent on issuer decisions. We are also focused on ""execution first"" with our SCM customers - getting all certified and ready for mass volume production. While these remain our top priorities  Zwipe continues expanding our customer and issuer pipeline - critical to our medium-term success.In March  Zwipe completed the certification process with Visa and obtained the Visa LoA. This certification marks a major milestone towards commercialization of Zwipe Pay and was followed by Visa LoAs obtained by lead customers BCC  TAG Systems and Inkript. This list is expected to grow significantly going forward. Zwipe has successfully completed additional testing with third party laboratories that should ease additional payment scheme certifications.It is undeniable that market takeoff of biometric payment cards has been slower than envisioned. BPC volumes deployed are expected to remain fairly low into 2023  before growing exponentially thereafter. Zwipe is not immune to the delayed market takeoff  but our customers and partners remain committed to launching pilots and commercial propositions  even if somewhat later than originally planned. Furthermore  consumer demand for BPCs remains strong with 82% of individuals surveyed by Zwipe saying that they want their next card to be biometric and 60% saying they would consider switching to banks who offer biometric cards. Importantly  most third-party research continues to point to BPCs accounting for 15-20% of total EMV units shipped by 2030 (estimated at 3-4 billion units)  highlighting just how large the market potential remains.For Zwipe Access  we now have a healthy and growing list of opportunities within the data center and airport verticals as well as other security sensitive customer segments. The growing number of requests for Zwipe Access solutions is driven by increasing demand for stronger data privacy  higher security and better user experience. Indeed  Zwipe was recognized by Fraport  operating 31 international airports globally  as a potential provider for next generation security solutions at their airports. Fraport's initial trials have now been completed and they are evaluating possible next steps.There were substantial changes in the executive management team at Zwipe during the first half  with three of the six-member C-suite newly joining the company - strengthening leadership  bringing industry expertise and positioning Zwipe well for the future.Financial reviewZwipe reported total revenues of 0.8 mNOK during H1 2022 versus 1.4 mNOK in H1 2021. On an adjusted basis  total operating expenses increased by 13.3 mNOK to 48.4 mNOK in H1 2022 versus H1 2021. The majority of this increase was due to personnel expenses  which increased by 9.1 mNOK to 25.9 mNOK in H1 2022 versus H1 2021. Of the 9.1 mNOK  5.5 mNOK were one-off costs related to former executives leaving the company. The remaining increase in personnel expense is largely due to an increase in headcount by 13 people to meet the strong demand for the company's solutions and to prepare for piloting and deployment of our card payment solutions and services.Zwipe's cash position remains strong  with cash and cash equivalents at 109.7 mNOK on 30 June 2022.Total equity as of 30 June 2022 was 108.8 mNOK resulting in an equity ratio of 89%  roughly stable versus the position at the end of the first half of 2021.The way forwardZwipe is progressing well in many important areas even if the market for biometric payment cards is developing at a slower pace than expected. Operating expenses and headcount are not expected to increase substantially in H2 vs H1 2022 nor at the pace expected at the start of the year.

Here's what automakers should do.,DETROIT  Aug. 23  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- For years  automakers have talked about electric vehicles and autonomous driving as two connected parts of the future of cars.

But new research from Ipsos shows that automakers might be better off if they talked about them separately.Ipsos' latest Mobility Navigator Study shows that while almost half of drivers (49%) say they're interested in an electric vehicle for their next car  only 31% would be interested in a fully autonomous (aka self-driving) car. And people are growing more interested in electric vehicles every year  while interest in self-driving cars remains stubbornly low.""Combining electrification and autonomous as a bundled technology advancement may not be a match made in heaven "" said Chance Parker  Vice President  U.S. Automotive & Mobility Development at Ipsos. ""Dedicated education about autonomous vehicles with a clear safety benefit can help reduce misconceptions and improve trial and acceptance across all generations.""That's not to say people aren't interested in any new driving technology to help them on the road. More than 60% of consumers say they are interested in individual features like accident avoidance  night/all-weather vision  and advanced driver assistance  which are key advancements in driving technology.Vehicles today offer more potential interactions for the driver  raising concerns over the level of driver distraction. These worries are becoming a common issue. In a U.S. poll of 1 000 adults conducted in 2021  Ipsos found that drivers believe they encounter a distracted driver in one of every two drives they take.In addition to identifying which features and technology generate the most interest among consumers  the study results also reaffirm that the auto industry is facing a potentially sticky generation gap regarding these transformational technologies. The latest Mobility Navigator data on electric vehicles shows a dramatic difference in attitudes toward electric vehicles by generation. Millennials and Gen Z consumers are much more positive about electric vehicles than their Boomer counterparts. When consumers are asked about autonomous driving technology  the same gap emerges  and may be getting worse.""Differences in attitudes toward new technology between younger and older consumers are not new – but these technologies aren't simply features than can be used or ignored as you see fit "" Parker said. ""Instead  both technologies completely change your relationship with your vehicle. Given the billions of dollars being poured into both technologies  the stakes are extremely high.""Another finding with far-reaching ramifications: Consumers ultimately want control of autonomous technology. Even those consumers who are pro-autonomous driving vehicles express that there is a time and place for it: Three out of four consumers who would consider autonomous technology say they would only want to use it in certain circumstances. This will also require more education for consumers  so they better understand and trust the technology. And until full autonomy is embedded and accepted  it will mean that consumers need user-friendly controls and interfaces with which to control the autonomous tech in their vehicle.To see more charts and learn more about the study  visit https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/knowledge/customer-experience/Why-are-consumers-still-leery-of-autonomous-driving-technology or watch our on-demand webinar at https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/knowledge/customer-experience/Features-and-technology-driving-interest-in-new-automobiles-recording.Additional data is available through a subscription to the offering.About IpsosIpsos is one of the largest market research and polling companies globally  operating in 90 markets and employing over 18 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  customers or employees.

It earlier rose to a one-week high of 326.75 euros as it continued a rebound from a near six-month low of 301.25 euros struck last Thursday.Wheat markets drew impetus from a rally in Chicago corn and soybeans after disappointing early results from a major Midwest field tour and an unexpected decline in weekly U.S. crop ratings put attention on weather damage to yields. GRA/The euro's slide to below parity against the dollar has also buoyed Euronext by making the market more attractive overseas  although the euro regained some ground on Tuesday after a fresh two-decade low. FRX/Warnings by Ukrainian and U.S. officials of possible Russian attacks on Kyiv  as Ukraine prepared to mark independence from Soviet rule in 1991 and six months since Russian troops invaded  maintained concern about disruption to Black Sea grain supplies.Traders were assessing news that Egypt's state grains buyer directly purchased 240 000 tonnes of Russian wheat on Monday.Falling prices of Russian wheat had pressured Euronext last week. However  some traders said the price reportedly paid by Egypt - $368 a tonne  cost and freight included - did not appear aggressive and may sustain doubts about Russian exports after a slow start to the campaign.European weather forecasts were showing warm temperatures along with showers in the week ahead  which could provide limited relief to drought-hit summer crops like corn and help upcoming planting of winter grains.Europe is facing its worst drought in at least 500 years  a European Union agency said on Tuesday.That came after the EU's crop monitor on Monday slashed its yield forecasts for corn and sunflower crops but slightly upped its estimate for mostly harvested wheat.($1 = 1.0025 euros)(Reporting by Gus Trompiz; Editing by Jan Harvey)((gus.trompiz@thomsonreuters.com; +33 1 49 49 52 18; Reuters Messaging: gus.trompiz.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq  Inc.,neutral,0.03,0.75,0.22,negative,0.04,0.2,0.76,True,English,"['U.S. crop worries', 'EU wheat', 'market', 'weekly U.S. crop ratings', 'major Midwest field tour', 'Black Sea grain supplies', 'U.S. officials', 'U.S. corn', 'European Union agency', 'state grains buyer', 'drought-hit summer crops', 'possible Russian attacks', 'December wheat BL2Z2', 'European weather forecasts', 'crop monitor', 'grain markets', 'weather damage', 'winter grains', 'yield forecasts', 'sunflower crops', 'Russian troops', 'Russian wheat', 'Russian exports', 'soybean conditions', 'one-week high', 'six-month low', 'Wheat markets', 'early results', 'unexpected decline', 'fresh two-decade', 'Soviet rule', 'Falling prices', 'slow start', 'warm temperatures', 'limited relief', 'upcoming planting', 'worst drought', 'Jan Harvey', 'Chicago corn', 'Euronext wheat', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'weak euro', 'Gus Trompiz', 'Reuters Messaging', 'gains', 'Tuesday', 'reports', 'support', 'tensions', 'Ukraine', 'traders', '326.00 euros', '326.75 euros', 'rebound', '301.25 euros', 'impetus', 'rally', 'soybeans', 'attention', 'yields', 'slide', 'parity', 'dollar', 'ground', 'FRX', 'Warnings', 'Ukrainian', 'Kyiv', 'independence', 'concern', 'disruption', 'news', 'Egypt', '240,000 tonnes', 'Monday', 'cost', 'freight', 'doubts', 'campaign', 'showers', '500 years', 'estimate', '1.0025 euros', 'Editing', 'thomsonreuters', 'views', 'opinions', 'author', 'Nasdaq', 'Inc']",2022-08-23,2022-08-23,nasdaq.com
