With its energy efficiency services  ...,"VoltaliaHelexia  a subsidiary of Voltalia (Euronext Paris  ISIN code: FR0011995588)  helps companies reduce their energy bills. With its energy efficiency services  Helexia reduces the electricity consumption of companies. At the same time  Helexia enables companies to produce photovoltaic electricity on their sites  on their roofs or on their parking lots.In the context of energy scarcity and cost inflation  European companies need to reduce their energy bills.This energy transition can only be achieved with a comprehensive approach: reducing energy consumption and producing green energy.Helexia's range of services is broad and and covers the definition of the strategy  the execution of works and the operation (control and maintenance) of the installations.Helexia can ensure these tasks for the customer  who then remains the owner of the installations  or carry on its balance sheet the investments required to improve energy efficiency (energy performance contracts) or to produce solar energy (self-consumption or solar electricity sales contracts). For the customer  this makes it possible to transform the constraint into an opportunity.Helexia is deploying a very strong growth system to meet the needs of its clients. On the only aspect of photovoltaic production whose investment is carried by Helexia  the portfolio of roofs and solar shades under contract1 went from 52 to 402 megawatts in 36 months: a multiplication by 7.7.""In recent years  Helexia's clients' first priority has often been to reduce their carbon footprint  although reducing energy costs has not been overlooked. With the scarcity of energy that now characterizes the news in many countries  reducing consumption and on-site photovoltaic production have become sometimes vital issues. Helexia helps its clients achieve their financial and environmental objectives "" said Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.""Each country has its own particularities: France now has a strong political will to cover parking lots with solar shading; Spain is circumventing the constraints of connection to the electricity grid by increasing self-consumption; and Portugal is multiplying the number of electric vehicle chargers associated with on-site photovoltaic production. But there is a common trend: that of energy sobriety "" says Benjamin Simonis  Managing Director of Helexia.Story continuesThey trusted HelexiaSNCF  Auchan Retail  Capfruit  Telefonica  Leroy Merlin  Lidl  Graham Packaging  Veolia Environnement  Boulanger  De Dietrich  Clermont Auvergne Métropole  Decathlon  Metalchimica  Reyes Group  Chronodrive  Bricomart  E.Leclerc  Leybold  Argan.Helexia client caseHelexia accompanied the Portuguese company Joluso Invepe in its energetic transition. Specialising in the production of bodywork and semi-trailers for trucks since 1986  the company called on Helexia to advise it and monitor the work. Helexia carried out an energy audit to identify possible savings  and then replaced the lighting with LED lamps. Helexia has also installed a 182 kilowatt photovoltaic power plant on the roof  enabling the production of 283 megawatt hours and covering 33% of the company's energy needs.Helexia's servicesConsultancy services help to define the energy strategy to be implemented in order to achieve the CSR objectives of companies and to achieve real budgetary savings.Energy audit: it helps to understand energy consumption and to identify energy saving actions. According to the French national organisation for standardisation (AFNOR)  the cumulative energy saving potential identified by an audit is estimated at 25% in euros and 23% in kilowatt hour (kWh)Carbon footprint: broader than the energy audit  it looks at all direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.Energy Master Plan: this is the planning of emission reduction actions over the long term to optimise the return on investment and control the bugdetsSetting up an an Energy Management System (EMS) / ISO 50 001 certification: defining the appropriate organisation to achieve continuous improvementSupport for the installation of rooftop or carport photovoltaic power plants  installation of electric vehicle chargers or for energy saving actions:Engineering/Design: Helexia is present during all pre-project stages to define the most appropriate technical solutions and identify the right service providersProject execution: project owner assistance for works execution until installation commissioning  either as Contracting Authority Supportor as a turnkey project.Asset and Energy Management solutions help to optimise energy consumption.

We look forward to working with WHO as they review VLA2001 for prequalification and to continuing our existing discussions with governments who are considering VLA2001 for their vaccine portfolios.”Valneva currently has agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States2 and the Kingdom of Bahrain3. Valneva is retaining inventory for potential additional supply to these EU Member States should demand increase. In parallel  the Company is continuing discussions with various other governments around the world  with the aim to deploy approximately eight to ten million doses of remaining inventory into international markets in the next six to twelve months. In light of current order levels and existing inventories  Valneva has suspended manufacturing of the vaccine.4Story continuesAbout VLA2001VLA2001 is the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine which has received marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe5. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom6 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates7 and Kingdom of Bahrain8.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099laetitia.bachelot-fontaine@valneva.comJoshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520joshua.drumm@valneva.comForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to possible purchase agreements and regulatory approval of VLA2001 and clinical trial results.

9140,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/notice-extraordinary-general-meeting-jyske-110100760.html,Notice of Extraordinary General Meeting of Jyske Bank A/S,This is to give notice of an Extraordinary General Meeting of Jyske Bank A/S  which will be held on Wednesday 14 September 2022  at 10.00 a.m. at Vestergade ...,Jyske BankThis is to give notice of an Extraordinary General Meeting of Jyske Bank A/S  which will be held on Wednesday 14 September 2022  at 10.00 a.m. at Vestergade 8-16  8600 Silkeborg  Denmark.At the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 22 August 2022  the motion to amend the Articles of Association was adopted. However  the members in general meeting with a right to vote represented less than 90% of the share capital  wherefore the final adoption of the amendment to the Articles of Association is subject to adoption at a new Extraordinary General Meeting.The AGENDA for consideration and final adoption.a. Motions proposed by the Supervisory Board: Reduction of Jyske Bank’s nominal share capital by DKK 47 279 050 (corresponding to 4 727 905 shares at a nominal value of DKK 10) from DKK 690 000 000 to DKK 642 720 950. With reference to S.188(1) of the Danish Companies Act we point out that the capital reduction takes place through cancellation of previously acquired own shares acquired by Jyske Bank in accordance with authorisation from members in general meeting. Hence  the capital reduction is spent on payment of capital owners.If the motion is adopted  Jyske Bank's holding of own shares will be reduced by 4 727 905 shares of a nominal value of DKK 10 These shares have been bought back at a total amount of DKK 1 699 780 525 which implies that  apart from the nominal capital reduction  a total amount of DKK 1 652 501 475 has been paid to the capital owners in connection with the buy-backs. The capital reduction takes place at a share premium since it will be at 359.52 for each share of a nominal amount of DKK 10  corresponding to the average price at which the shares have been bought back.In consequence of the above  the following amendment to the Articles of Association is proposed:Art. 2 to be amended to the effect that Jyske Bank’s nominal share capital be DKK 642 720 950 distributed on 64 272 095 shares.b. The Supervisory Board proposes that members in general meeting authorise the chairman of the meeting (with a right of substitution) to notify any resolutions adopted to the Danish Business Authority and to make such adjustments which may be required by the Danish Business Authority in connection with the registration of the resolutions adopted.c. Any other business.Reference to Jyske Bank's website for further informationWhere in this notice of a general meeting  reference is made to Jyske Bank’s website for further information  this link can be used: www.jyskebank.com/investorrelations/generalmeetings .Adoption of motions - special requirementsThe motion to amend Jyske Bank’s Articles of Association (item a of the agenda) at extraordinary general meetings shall only be finally adopted where adopted by three fourth of the votes cast and by three fourth of the voting share capital represented at the general meeting cf.

9141,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zwipe-h1-2022-results-healthy-061300377.html,Zwipe H1 2022 results - healthy commercial momentum,"Zwipe AS (""Zwipe"" or ""the company"") today announces its results for the first half 2022.","OSLO  NORWAY  Aug. 23  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Zwipe AS (""Zwipe"" or ""the company"") today announces its results for the first half 2022.Operational highlightsVisa certifies Zwipe Pay Biometric Payment Card (""BPC"") Platform and issues Letter of Approval (""LoA"") to Zwipe.Beautiful Card Corporation (""BCC"")  TAG Systems and Inkript obtain Visa LoAs for their own card built on the Zwipe Pay platform.Fraport AG  providing operational services to 31 airports globally  selected Zwipe Access as one of two solutions to test in a pilot of next generation access control solutions at Frankfurt Airport.Zwipe Access platform was successfully integrated with LEGIC and HID solutions to provide seamless end-to-end biometric card-based access control security to enterprises and facilities.Seven new issuers across Germany  India  the Middle East and Africa signed up with Zwipe to launch pilots.Placard  the largest payment smart card supplier in Australia and New Zealand  selected the Zwipe Pay platform for delivering biometric payment cards to banks in the region.Significant organizational development with Robert Puskaric joining as the new CEO in June  Danielle Glenn as the new CFO in May and Patrice Meilland as the new Chief Strategy and Product Officer in April.Financial highlightsReviewIn H1 2022  we signed seven new issuers for Zwipe Pay  from Germany to India and across the Middle East. All of them are planning pilots with our card manufacturing partners  although we have learned that pilot preparation is taking longer than previously expected. We also expanded our global delivery capabilities and market reach by signing one major SCM and onboarding two leading personalization solution providers as go-to-market (""GTM"") partners.Zwipe is pursuing an ""execution first"" approach focusing on launching announced pilots. In total  seven issuer pilots are progressing with good pace and according to issuer plans. Additional pilot launches are expected in the coming quarters  with launch dates entirely dependent on issuer decisions. We are also focused on ""execution first"" with our SCM customers - getting all certified and ready for mass volume production. While these remain our top priorities  Zwipe continues expanding our customer and issuer pipeline - critical to our medium-term success.Story continuesIn March  Zwipe completed the certification process with Visa and obtained the Visa LoA. This certification marks a major milestone towards commercialization of Zwipe Pay and was followed by Visa LoAs obtained by lead customers BCC  TAG Systems and Inkript. This list is expected to grow significantly going forward. Zwipe has successfully completed additional testing with third party laboratories that should ease additional payment scheme certifications.It is undeniable that market takeoff of biometric payment cards has been slower than envisioned. BPC volumes deployed are expected to remain fairly low into 2023  before growing exponentially thereafter. Zwipe is not immune to the delayed market takeoff  but our customers and partners remain committed to launching pilots and commercial propositions  even if somewhat later than originally planned. Furthermore  consumer demand for BPCs remains strong with 82% of individuals surveyed by Zwipe saying that they want their next card to be biometric and 60% saying they would consider switching to banks who offer biometric cards. Importantly  most third-party research continues to point to BPCs accounting for 15-20% of total EMV units shipped by 2030 (estimated at 3-4 billion units)  highlighting just how large the market potential remains.For Zwipe Access  we now have a healthy and growing list of opportunities within the data center and airport verticals as well as other security sensitive customer segments. The growing number of requests for Zwipe Access solutions is driven by increasing demand for stronger data privacy  higher security and better user experience. Indeed  Zwipe was recognized by Fraport  operating 31 international airports globally  as a potential provider for next generation security solutions at their airports. Fraport's initial trials have now been completed and they are evaluating possible next steps.There were substantial changes in the executive management team at Zwipe during the first half  with three of the six-member C-suite newly joining the company - strengthening leadership  bringing industry expertise and positioning Zwipe well for the future.Financial reviewZwipe reported total revenues of 0.8 mNOK during H1 2022 versus 1.4 mNOK in H1 2021. On an adjusted basis  total operating expenses increased by 13.3 mNOK to 48.4 mNOK in H1 2022 versus H1 2021. The majority of this increase was due to personnel expenses  which increased by 9.1 mNOK to 25.9 mNOK in H1 2022 versus H1 2021. Of the 9.1 mNOK  5.5 mNOK were one-off costs related to former executives leaving the company. The remaining increase in personnel expense is largely due to an increase in headcount by 13 people to meet the strong demand for the company's solutions and to prepare for piloting and deployment of our card payment solutions and services.Zwipe's cash position remains strong  with cash and cash equivalents at 109.7 mNOK on 30 June 2022.Total equity as of 30 June 2022 was 108.8 mNOK resulting in an equity ratio of 89%  roughly stable versus the position at the end of the first half of 2021.The way forwardZwipe is progressing well in many important areas even if the market for biometric payment cards is developing at a slower pace than expected. Operating expenses and headcount are not expected to increase substantially in H2 vs H1 2022 nor at the pace expected at the start of the year. Zwipe will  however  continue to invest intelligently - particularly in its people and technology.For Zwipe Pay  second half priorities will center on pilot deployment with issuers  assisting SCMs in becoming mass production and delivery ready  and continuing to expand our customer and issuer pipeline. Further developing the dedicated customer project management function and standardized blueprint to improve pilot execution will be a key focus during H2 2022.Going forward  Zwipe Access is expected to contribute a larger part of revenue than previously assumed. The pipeline for Zwipe Access is healthy and growing with prospects within the data center and airport verticals as well as other security sensitive customer segments.Results presentationCEO Robert Puskaric and CFO Danielle Glenn will present the H1 2022 results by webcast tomorrow  Wednesday August 24th  at 09:00 CEST.Webcast detailsFormat: Webcast  Conference Call and Q&ALanguage: EnglishLink: https://q4-emea.wavecast.io/zwipe-as/h1-2022-operational-updateDial-in numbers:Norway - +47.57.98.94.30Sweden - +46.8.505.246.90Sweden - Toll-Free- +46.20.0123749United Kingdom - +44.20.3481.4247United Kingdom - Toll-Free- +44.800.260.6466Participants will be required to register to view the webcast and participate in the Q&AThis information is subject to the disclosure requirements in Regulation EU 596/2014 article 19 number 3 and the Norwegian Securities Trading Act section 5-12  and is information that Zwipe AS is obligated to make public pursuant to the continuing obligations of companies admitted to trading on Euronext Growth Oslo (Euronext Growth Oslo Rule Book - Part II) and on Nasdaq First North Growth Market.

Placard  the largest payment smart card supplier in Australia and New Zealand   selected the Zwipe Pay platform for delivering biometric payment cards to banks in the region.and   selected the Zwipe Pay platform for delivering biometric payment cards to banks in the region. Significant organizational development with Robert Puskaric joining as the new CEO in June  Danielle Glenn as the new CFO in May and Patrice Meilland as the new Chief Strategy and Product Officer in April.Financial highlightsReviewIn H1 2022  we signed seven new issuers for Zwipe Pay  from Germany to India and across the Middle East. All of them are planning pilots with our card manufacturing partners  although we have learned that pilot preparation is taking longer than previously expected. We also expanded our global delivery capabilities and market reach by signing one major SCM and onboarding two leading personalization solution providers as go-to-market (""GTM"") partners.Zwipe is pursuing an ""execution first"" approach focusing on launching announced pilots. In total  seven issuer pilots are progressing with good pace and according to issuer plans. Additional pilot launches are expected in the coming quarters  with launch dates entirely dependent on issuer decisions. We are also focused on ""execution first"" with our SCM customers - getting all certified and ready for mass volume production. While these remain our top priorities  Zwipe continues expanding our customer and issuer pipeline - critical to our medium-term success.In March  Zwipe completed the certification process with Visa and obtained the Visa LoA. This certification marks a major milestone towards commercialization of Zwipe Pay and was followed by Visa LoAs obtained by lead customers BCC  TAG Systems and Inkript. This list is expected to grow significantly going forward. Zwipe has successfully completed additional testing with third party laboratories that should ease additional payment scheme certifications.It is undeniable that market takeoff of biometric payment cards has been slower than envisioned. BPC volumes deployed are expected to remain fairly low into 2023  before growing exponentially thereafter. Zwipe is not immune to the delayed market takeoff  but our customers and partners remain committed to launching pilots and commercial propositions  even if somewhat later than originally planned. Furthermore  consumer demand for BPCs remains strong with 82% of individuals surveyed by Zwipe saying that they want their next card to be biometric and 60% saying they would consider switching to banks who offer biometric cards. Importantly  most third-party research continues to point to BPCs accounting for 15-20% of total EMV units shipped by 2030 (estimated at 3-4 billion units)  highlighting just how large the market potential remains.For Zwipe Access  we now have a healthy and growing list of opportunities within the data center and airport verticals as well as other security sensitive customer segments. The growing number of requests for Zwipe Access solutions is driven by increasing demand for stronger data privacy  higher security and better user experience. Indeed  Zwipe was recognized by Fraport  operating 31 international airports globally  as a potential provider for next generation security solutions at their airports. Fraport's initial trials have now been completed and they are evaluating possible next steps.There were substantial changes in the executive management team at Zwipe during the first half  with three of the six-member C-suite newly joining the company - strengthening leadership  bringing industry expertise and positioning Zwipe well for the future.Financial reviewZwipe reported total revenues of 0.8 mNOK during H1 2022 versus 1.4 mNOK in H1 2021. On an adjusted basis  total operating expenses increased by 13.3 mNOK to 48.4 mNOK in H1 2022 versus H1 2021. The majority of this increase was due to personnel expenses  which increased by 9.1 mNOK to 25.9 mNOK in H1 2022 versus H1 2021. Of the 9.1 mNOK  5.5 mNOK were one-off costs related to former executives leaving the company. The remaining increase in personnel expense is largely due to an increase in headcount by 13 people to meet the strong demand for the company's solutions and to prepare for piloting and deployment of our card payment solutions and services.Zwipe's cash position remains strong  with cash and cash equivalents at 109.7 mNOK on 30 June 2022.Total equity as of 30 June 2022 was 108.8 mNOK resulting in an equity ratio of 89%  roughly stable versus the position at the end of the first half of 2021.The way forwardZwipe is progressing well in many important areas even if the market for biometric payment cards is developing at a slower pace than expected. Operating expenses and headcount are not expected to increase substantially in H2 vs H1 2022 nor at the pace expected at the start of the year.

Here's what automakers should do.,DETROIT  Aug. 23  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- For years  automakers have talked about electric vehicles and autonomous driving as two connected parts of the future of cars. But new research from Ipsos shows that automakers might be better off if they talked about th…,"DETROIT  Aug. 23  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- For years  automakers have talked about electric vehicles and autonomous driving as two connected parts of the future of cars. But new research from Ipsos shows that automakers might be better off if they talked about them separately.Ipsos' latest Mobility Navigator Study shows that while almost half of drivers (49%) say they're interested in an electric vehicle for their next car  only 31% would be interested in a fully autonomous (aka self-driving) car. And people are growing more interested in electric vehicles every year  while interest in self-driving cars remains stubbornly low.""Combining electrification and autonomous as a bundled technology advancement may not be a match made in heaven "" said Chance Parker  Vice President  U.S. Automotive & Mobility Development at Ipsos. ""Dedicated education about autonomous vehicles with a clear safety benefit can help reduce misconceptions and improve trial and acceptance across all generations.""That's not to say people aren't interested in any new driving technology to help them on the road. More than 60% of consumers say they are interested in individual features like accident avoidance  night/all-weather vision  and advanced driver assistance  which are key advancements in driving technology.Vehicles today offer more potential interactions for the driver  raising concerns over the level of driver distraction. These worries are becoming a common issue. In a U.S. poll of 1 000 adults conducted in 2021  Ipsos found that drivers believe they encounter a distracted driver in one of every two drives they take.In addition to identifying which features and technology generate the most interest among consumers  the study results also reaffirm that the auto industry is facing a potentially sticky generation gap regarding these transformational technologies. The latest Mobility Navigator data on electric vehicles shows a dramatic difference in attitudes toward electric vehicles by generation. Millennials and Gen Z consumers are much more positive about electric vehicles than their Boomer counterparts. When consumers are asked about autonomous driving technology  the same gap emerges  and may be getting worse.""Differences in attitudes toward new technology between younger and older consumers are not new – but these technologies aren't simply features than can be used or ignored as you see fit "" Parker said. ""Instead  both technologies completely change your relationship with your vehicle. Given the billions of dollars being poured into both technologies  the stakes are extremely high.""Another finding with far-reaching ramifications: Consumers ultimately want control of autonomous technology. Even those consumers who are pro-autonomous driving vehicles express that there is a time and place for it: Three out of four consumers who would consider autonomous technology say they would only want to use it in certain circumstances. This will also require more education for consumers  so they better understand and trust the technology. And until full autonomy is embedded and accepted  it will mean that consumers need user-friendly controls and interfaces with which to control the autonomous tech in their vehicle.To see more charts and learn more about the study  visit https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/knowledge/customer-experience/Why-are-consumers-still-leery-of-autonomous-driving-technology or watch our on-demand webinar at https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/knowledge/customer-experience/Features-and-technology-driving-interest-in-new-automobiles-recording.Additional data is available through a subscription to the offering.About IpsosIpsos is one of the largest market research and polling companies globally  operating in 90 markets and employing over 18 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  customers or employees.

By holding own shares  the Company’s obligations outstanding for share-based incentive programmes are also ensured.Acquisitions are to be carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price that is within the registered price range at any given time  meaning the range between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price. Acquisitions of own shares are limited so that the Company’s total holding of treasury shares at no time exceeds 10 percent of the total number of shares in the Company.Divestments of the Company’s treasury shares may be carried out with or without preferential rights for shareholders but may not be carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm.

In order to encourage participation in the share-based incentive programme (“the Programme”)  a subsidy equivalent to the premium paid for each call option shall be paid. The subsidy will be paid in September 2024 provided that the employment of the option holder with the Group has not been terminated or that the call options have not been divested before this date.The costs of the Programme comprise the subsidy to be paid in September 2024 as above  and the social security fees that will accrue on this subsidy. The total cost of the subsidy  including social security fees  is estimated at MSEK 2.5 after corporate tax (based on the market conditions on 30 June 2022). Offsetting the subsidy is the option premium totalling approximately MSEK 2.5  which the Company will receive when transferring the call options  as a result of which the Programme does not entail any net charge to the Company’s equity.Information about the Annual General MeetingFurther information about the Annual General Meeting is available on the Company’s website under: Corporate governance/Annual General Meeting.Next reportThe Interim Report for the period 1 April–30 September 2022 (6 months) will be published on 20 October 2022.Stockholm  24 August 2022Bergman & Beving AB (publ)BOARD OF DIRECTORSFor further information  please contact:Magnus Söderlind  President & CEO  Bergman & Beving AB  Tel: +46 10 454 77 00Peter Schön  CFO  Bergman & Beving AB  Tel: +46 70 339 89 99This information is information that Bergman & Beving AB (publ) is obliged to make public pursuant to Nasdaq Stockholm’s Rule book for Issuers.

9159,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/launch-odd-lot-offer-finalisation-060000497.html,Launch of Odd-lot Offer and Finalisation of Offer Price,Kenmare Resources PLC(“Kenmare” or the “Company”) 24 August 2022 Launch of Odd-lot Offer and Finalisation of Offer Price NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR...,Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources PLC(“Kenmare” or the “Company”)24 August 2022Launch of Odd-lot Offer and Finalisation of Offer PriceNOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN WHOLE OR IN PART  IN  INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTIONKenmare Resources plc (“Kenmare” or the “Company”) announces that it has today launched an Odd-lot Offer pursuant to which shareholders holding fewer than 200 ordinary shares in Kenmare (the “Odd-lot Holders”) will be offered the opportunity to sell their shares at a 5% premium to the market price.IntroductionAt the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 26 May 2022 shareholders approved the making by the Company of an Odd-lot Offer at any time within 18 months of the date of the meeting.The Directors have decided to proceed with the launch of an Odd-lot Offer. The Odd-lot Offer opens today  24 August 2022  and will close on 30 September 2022.Shareholders with registered addresses in Ireland and the UK who were Odd-lot Holders on the First Record Date (being 21 April 2022) and who remain Odd-lot Holders on the Second Record Date (being 30 September 2022) are invited to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company.The price per Ordinary Share to be paid to Odd-lot Holders whose ordinary shares are repurchased pursuant to the Odd-lot Offer (the “Offer Price”) will be £4.82  being a 5 per cent. premium to the volume weighted average price of ordinary shares traded on the London Stock Exchange over the five trading days prior to 24 August 2022.BackgroundThe Odd-lot Offer is being implemented because  as a result of the Company’s restructuring and recapitalisation in 2016  the Company has an unusually large number of small shareholders for a company of its size. The Company has a total of more than 3 800 shareholders of which approximately 3 415 (88.96%) are small shareholders who hold fewer than 200 ordinary shares and  in aggregate  represent less than 0.2% of the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue.Story continuesThe Odd-lot Offer will facilitate the disposal by Eligible Odd-lot Holders of their shares at a 5% premium without the dealing costs that would typically render such disposal uneconomic  whilst giving active Shareholders the ability to opt-out of such a disposal by making the requisite election.The Directors believe that the Odd-lot Offer is to the benefit of Shareholders as a whole as it will lower the Company’s cost base and will facilitate a reduction in the number of Shareholders in the Company in an equitable manner.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ANY SHAREHOLDER WHO WISHES TO REMAIN A SHAREHOLDER MAY ELECT TO DO SO.The maximum number of Ordinary Shares eligible to participate in the Odd-lot Offer is approximately 105 802  representing less than 0.2% of the issued share capital of the Company  as determined on 21 April 2022 (the “First Record Date”). Therefore  if all Eligible Odd-lot Holders participated in the Odd-lot Offer  the maximum cash consideration payable to such Odd-lot Holders would be approximately £510 000.Details of the Odd-lot OfferEligible Odd-lot Holders are invited by the Form of Election/Surrender which is being sent to Eligible Odd-lot Holders to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Form of Election/Surrender  the Circular and the Purchase Contract.Shareholders with registered addresses in Ireland and the UK who were Odd-lot Holders on the First Record Date (being 21 April 2022) and who remain Odd-lot Holders on the Second Record Date (being 30 September 2022) are invited to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company. Shareholders who become Odd-lot Holders between the First Record Date and the Second Record Date will not be entitled to participate in the Odd-lot Offer.Holdings under the same name with different designations will be treated as separate holdings of Shareholders for these purposes.As the purpose of an Odd-lot Offer is to simplify the Company’s share register and make it more cost efficient  the Odd-lot Offer is open to the registered holders of Ordinary Shares only and not to Euroclear Participants or CDI Holders. For securities law reasons  only those Shareholders with registered addresses in the UK and Ireland will be eligible to participate in an Odd-lot Offer.Under the terms of the Odd-lot Offer  eligible Odd-lot Holders are able to elect to:(i) sell their Odd-lot holdings to the Company at the Offer Price; or(ii) retain their Odd-lot holdings.The holdings of Eligible Odd-lot Holders who either:(i) elect (under the terms of the Odd-lot Offer) to sell their holdings of Odd-lots; or(ii) do not make an election under an Odd-lot Offer will be acquired by the Company at the Offer Price.No Odd-lot Holder shall be entitled to make a partial election in respect of the Odd-lot Offer.

However  the changing competitive landscape  combined with new FDA’s requests for additional clinical data that would require significant additional resources on our part  led to the difficult decision to stop the development of Graspa in ALL. We are now focusing our resources on our most promising preclinical programs  while pursuing strategic partnering options to maximize value for our shareholders and employees.”Following positive results of a Phase 2 trial  sponsored by the Nordic Organization for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO)  presented at the 2020 American Society of Hematology annual meeting  ERYTECH has been in discussions with the FDA for the approval of Graspa to treat ALL patients who had previously experienced hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase therapy.A meeting to discuss the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) took place in June 2021  after which the Company confirmed its intention to submit a BLA  subject to the submission of additional requested information to the FDA and agreement on an Initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP).Story continuesThe Company recently received feedback from the FDA on its iPSP  submitted in July 2022. After thorough evaluation of this feedback  which included a new request for additional data  and taking into account the changing competitive landscape in the treatment of hypersensitive ALL  the Company has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to no longer seek approval for Graspa in ALL and to focus its resources on its preclinical programs and strategic partnering activities.Following the sale of its production facility in Princeton  New Jersey  for $44.5 million in April 2022  the Company appointed a specialized advisor to evaluate strategic options to leverage its ERYCAPS® platform with complementary assets and/or a broader corporate transaction.

At the same time  we are focused on being a sustainable business  one that again proved its resilience in the face of global challenges and uncertainties.Discount to net asset valueTo increase net asset value per share  this year we initiated an open ended repurchase programme of Naspers and Prosus shares. This builds on earlier actions like the approved share exchange that better balanced Naspers and Prosus on their respective stock exchanges last year and repurchasing US$10bn in shares over the past two years. The current repurchase programme will be funded by an orderly  on-market sale of Tencent shares held by the group. Tencent is supportive of the withdrawal by Prosus of its voluntary restriction on the sale of its Tencent Shares.. We believe this will generate significant value for our shareholders over a sustained period. In addition  our management team has been incentivised to reduce this discount for the long-term value creation of the group.Delivering our strategyEssentially  our strategy is to build valuable businesses that solve everyday problems for customers. We do this globally by backing innovative local entrepreneurs  but deploying a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We typically grow our capital commitments progressively as we learn and scale  intrinsically linked to future returns.Today  across our core segments of ecommerce  food  payments and fintech  etail and  most recently edtech  our impact is significant. Our entrepreneurs and teams improve the daily lives of billions of customers. We enable people to buy and sell safely online  easily order food delivered quickly to their homes. We enable participation in the digital economy and access to important financial services otherwise unavailable to people. We enable customers to educate themselves without visiting a classroom. And we help to satisfy a basic human need  the ability to connect and interact with others that is so important in the digital age.A year of progressDespite a turbulent operating environment  FY22 was a period of progress for the group. Like many technology companies  we faced significant macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds  resulting in highly volatile capital markets. The combination of the war in Ukraine  higher inflation and rising interest rates drove up the cost of capital and increased uncertainty. Valuations of global peers in tech and internet sectors declined sharply in recent months as the level of risk appetite reduced significantly. These forces drove the first decline in the group’s net asset value in many years. To navigate these turbulent times  we are prioritising capital on supporting our existing businesses and prudent balance-sheet management to sustain adequate financial liquidity.Group revenues grew 24% to US$37bn  driven by ecommerce which grew revenues 56%. Group trading profit was down 10% to US$5bn. Core headline earnings  our measure of after-tax operating performance  was down 40% to US$2.1bn  reflecting our sale of a 2% interest in Tencent and its lower contribution after greater losses from its associates. Our ecommerce businesses were resilient  growing revenues 53% in the second half and significantly outperforming global peers in many cases. The food-delivery segment’s performance remained strong while growth momentum continued globally in payments and fintech. In this segment  we increased our scale in India  one of the fastest-growing consumer internet markets and closing the BillDesk acquisition will create further opportunity to expand into credit and digital banking. In edtech  we made substantial progress in expanding the portfolio by acquiring market leaders in our focus areas. Our etail segment maintained revenues but recorded a small loss as it invests in growth opportunities.We ended the year with a strong and liquid balance sheet reflecting US$9.7bn in cash and cash equivalents  2.5 times the prior-year level. We invested US$6.3bn to increase our stakes in existing investments and new assets with substantial opportunity for future value creation  particularly in our food-delivery and edtech segments. We will continue to invest organically to build on our strong progress in specific segments: autos in classifieds  convenience in food delivery and India credit in payments and fintech.We raised US$9.25bn in additional capital last year. We also continued to crystallise returns and pay back capital to shareholders. In total  we have allocated US$50bn in capital over the past six years: some 57% of that being invested into the business and new growth opportunities  around 25% returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends  and the balance held in cash.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has deeply impacted our classifieds business in the ecommerce segment. We are appalled by the war in Ukraine and we continue to do all we can for our Ukrainian employees and the country’s people. In March 2022  we began separating the Russian classifieds business Avito from our OLX Group  and announced in May that we would exit this business and are identifying an appropriate buyer for our shares in Avito. We have also written down the full carrying value of our VK asset  the Russian online platform.Our role in societyOne of our three strategic priorities is to be a force for good for our stakeholders. Around the world  sustainability is central to our growth and strategy.At the same time  there is growing interest from shareholders  regulators and other stakeholders in how seriously we honour our responsibilities as a global technology group.We have a strong heritage of acting responsibly. But much of this good work has been implicit. We believe it is now essential that we do business with the stated goal of being a positive force for the world around us.To illustrate  our Ventures arm is increasing its focus on sustainable investment themes  such as agriculture technology or agtech and healthtech. During the year  we invested in several agtech companies applying sustainable digital solutions by using soil biology analytics and artificial intelligence tools to determine the most sustainable solutions for crops  while addressing specific climate and social-inclusion challenges. These priorities are consistent with our support for circular-economy innovations to mitigate and reduce environmental footprints.More tangibly  being a force for good translates into employment. An independent research study on iFood’s food-delivery operations in Brazil found that the company created about 730 000 jobs (formal and informal)  or 0.72% of the employed population in 2020  as part of its value chain. In addition  the study noted that iFood drivers receive an hourly wage comparable to being employed in the formal sector.Being a force for good applies equally in crisis situations. The appalling war in Ukraine is foremost a human tragedy. Ahead of the invasion  our OLX business prepared for a worsening situation  setting up accommodation for our teams and their families in the west of the country  advancing wages  and instituting regular contact with everyone. When the invasion began  we offered relocation to safer areas in the country and outside Ukraine. In addition  we are contributing US$10m to assist humanitarian aid efforts in Ukraine. Our Ukrainian and Polish employees are involved in selecting suitable registered and established charities to receive this support. At the onset of the war  we also made a US$350 000 donation to the international committee of the Red Cross.Aligning remuneration to performance and value creationOur group operates in highly competitive  fast-changing markets  many characterised by the shortage of key skills. Our remuneration structures therefore focus on attracting  motivating and retaining the best people to create sustainable shareholder value.Our strategic approach to human resources and remuneration better enables us to compete for the digital talent at the heart of our businesses. Our remuneration aims are simple: promote superior performance; focus employees on achieving key business goals; and realise effective returns on employee spend. Equality and consistency are embedded in group pay practices as we build our diverse and inclusive workplaces. Our pay practices around the world are fair  competitive and above minimum-wage standards.Importantly  we continue to engage with shareholders on remunerations topics. This feedback is constructive in continually improving the transparency of both our disclosure and reward structures.In the review period  several factors contributed to widening the discount in our trading value relative to a sum-of-the-parts valuation to its highest level. While we still focus a material portion of executive directors’ incentives on non-Tencent portions of the group over the long run  we believe there is a critical benefit to reducing this discount.Accordingly  for FY23  we proposed materially increasing the CEO and CFO’s short-term variable compensation exposure to narrowing the discount. At the same time  we have materially reduced the balance of annual compensation to emphasise the importance of this discount-focused incentive and align remuneration with shareholder expectations.In addition  given our strong belief that reducing the discount is fundamental to maximising shareholder returns  the committee did not award long-term incentives for FY23.In line with our commitment to greater transparency  we again improved disclosure on executive remuneration by detailing short-term incentive goals and achievements for FY22. We believe that revealing details of STI targets to our competitors before the end of the financial year is not in the best interests of our shareholders so  from FY23  we will disclose these targets retrospectively.Distributions to shareholdersThe distributions proposed by the company’s board of directors (“the board”) has been approved by the shareholders. On this basis  holders of ordinary shares N are entitled to a gross payment  in the form of a capital repayment  of 14 euro cents per share  holders of ordinary shares A1 will receive an amount per share equal to the outcome of the formula set forth in article 30.4 of the articles of association  being 1.118 euro cents per ordinary share A1  and holders of ordinary shares B will receive a dividend distribution of 0.000014 euro cents per share for the year ended 31 March 2022.Holders of ordinary shares N as at Friday  2 September 2022 (the dividend record date) who do not wish to receive a capital repayment can elect to receive a dividend instead. A choice for one option implies an opt-out of the other option. Elections to receive a dividend instead of a capital repayment will need to be made by holders of ordinary shares N by Monday  19 September 2022. Capital repayments and dividends will be payable to shareholders recorded in the books on the dividend record date and paid on or after Tuesday  27 September 2022.Dividends and capital repayments are declared and paid in euros. For those holders holding their ordinary shares N in South Africa via Strate will receive a gross distribution of 236.28080 Rand cents per ordinary share N. South Africa holders of ordinary shares A1 will receive a gross dividend of 18.86871 Rand cents per ordinary share A1. Holders of ordinary shares B will receive a dividend distribution of 0.00024 Rand cents per ordinary B share. This is based on an EUR/ZAR exchange rate of 16.8772 as at 24 August 2022.Generally  shareholders holding their ordinary shares N on the South African register positively electing to receive a dividend will receive a net distribution of at least 153.58252 Rand cents per ordinary share N. A maximum amount of 82.69828 Rand cents will be withheld (being 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax plus 20% SA dividend tax). This 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax may be reduced if shareholders provide evidence via the ABN AMRO platform that they are entitled to tax treaty benefits. The amount of additional South African dividend tax payable will be calculated by deducting from the 20% South African dividend tax otherwise due  a rebate equal to the Dutch dividend withholding tax paid in respect of the dividend (without any right of recovery). Those shareholders  unless exempt from paying dividend tax or entitled to a reduced withholding tax rate in terms of an applicable tax treaty  will thus be subject to a maximum of 20% total dividend tax which equals 47.25616 Rand cents.Holders of Prosus American Depositary Receipts which trade on an over-the-counter basis in the United States will receive a dividend.Salient dates:Wednesday  24 August 2022 Annual general meeting (including resolution to approve the dividend/capital payment) Results of annual general meeting and currency conversion announcement (i.e. ZAR equivalent of Prosus distribution determined for JSE holders) Wednesday  24 August 2022 Dividend/capital payment finalisation date Tuesday  30 August 2022 Last date to trade on the JSE in order to appear in the shareholder register and participate in the dividend/capital repayment Wednesday  31 August 2022 Ex-dividend/capital repayment date for JSE.

The amount of additional South African dividend tax payable may be subject to a rebate for Dutch dividend withholding tax paid in respect of such dividend without any recovery by any person so that the aggregate dividend tax would in those cases add up to a maximum of 20%.South African corporates who own 5% or more of the shares in Prosus may qualify for a Dutch domestic exemption from Dutch dividend withholding tax.The treaty between South Africa and the Netherlands notes that the Dutch dividend withholding tax may get reduced from 15% to 10%. This reduction applies equally to corporates holding less than 10% of the capital of Prosus  individuals and other persons who qualify as residents of South Africa for treaty purposes. If shareholders  or their tax advisors  conclude that they are entitled to benefits arising from the tax treaty  such shareholders should follow the process prescribed by the tax treaty to claim relief.Those shareholders who qualify for relief or a reduction have until 18 October 2022 to provide evidence to ABN AMRO that their dividend qualifies for relief or a reduction from Dutch dividend withholding tax.Please note that no Dutch dividend withholding tax will be withheld on repayments of share capital. There will also be no South African dividend tax on repayments of share capital.Tax Implications1. Dutch Tax Implications1.1. GeneralCapital repayments will be paid from share capital. No Dutch dividend withholding tax (""DWT"") will be withheld on the amounts of capital repayments paid to shareholders.Where a shareholder elects to receive a dividend  generally  15% DWT will be withheld by Prosus on the cash dividend  leaving a distribution amount per share net of this 15% Dutch DWT  unless:1.1.1. a shareholder qualifies for an exemption from or a reduction of Dutch DWT on the basis of Dutch domestic law (including implementation of EU Directives) and/or a tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands; and1.1.2. the formal requirements to apply such exemption from or reduction of Dutch DWT are satisfied (insofar applicable).Prosus will initially withhold 15% on ALL cash dividends distributed on Tuesday  27 September 2022. As a subsequent step  if and to the extent Prosus has been provided before 18 October 2022 with proof that a shareholder qualifies for an exemption from or a reduction of Dutch DWT on the basis of Dutch domestic law  the difference between 15% and the Dutch DWT to be withheld will be paid out to the shareholder  after the Dutch DWT return and/or Dutch DWT notification has been filed by Prosus with the Dutch tax authorities. Prosus will remit the Dutch DWT to be withheld to the Dutch tax authorities based on the Dutch DWT return.1.2. Domestic exemptions from Dutch DWT1.2.1. GeneralCorporate shareholders may be exempt from Dutch DWT in terms of Dutch domestic law  if:1.2.1.1. The shareholder is tax resident in the Netherlands and owns 5% or more of the share capital of Prosus  provided that the further requirements for the application of the Dutch participation exemption are met. Special rules may apply for corporate shareholders that are considered tax transparent in their country of residence  or considered tax transparent from a Dutch tax perspective; or1.2.1.2. A shareholder is considered tax resident within the EU or EEA or is a tax resident of a country with which the Netherlands has concluded a tax treaty containing an article on taxation of dividends (such as South Africa)  and  as a general rule  this corporate shareholder is the beneficial owner of the dividends distributed by Prosus and owns 5% or more of the share capital of Prosus. In addition to the shareholding requirement  the shareholder is also required to meet certain other conditions relating to the application of the Dutch participation exemption  determined as if the corporate shareholder is a Dutch tax resident.The above exemptions are not available in cases of abuse  for which a main purposes test and artificial arrangement test applies.If a shareholder is eligible for an exemption or reduction from Dutch DWT  in order to place reliance on such exemption or reduction  the shareholder is required to submit certain information to ABN AMRO as set-out below.1.2.2. Dutch corporate shareholders owning 5% or more of Prosus' share capitalIn order to rely on this domestic exemption from Dutch DWT described in paragraph 1.2.1.1 above  the shareholder should provide ABN AMRO via its own intermediary bank with: (i) its name  address and place of residency  and corresponding extract from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce; (ii) the number and percentage of shares owned in Prosus; (iii) its bank account details; and (iv) a statement confirming that the Dutch participation exemption applies to the dividend at the level of the Dutch corporate shareholder. This information should be submitted before Tuesday  18 October 2022.As indicated above  Prosus will  as a general rule  initially withhold 15% on ALL dividends distributed on Tuesday  27 September 2022. If  however  Prosus has been provided with proof  to its satisfaction  ultimately before 18 October 2022  that the relevant shareholder qualifies for an exemption from Dutch DWT  no amount of DWT will be withheld  and the 15% DWT that otherwise would have been withheld will be paid out by Prosus to the relevant shareholder directly  after the DWT return has been filed by Prosus with the Dutch tax authorities.1.2.3. EU/EEA or tax treaty country resident corporate shareholders owning 5% or moreIn order for a corporate shareholder to rely on the domestic exemption from Dutch DWT described in in paragraph 1.2.1.2 above  the shareholder should provide ABN AMRO via its own intermediary bank with: (i) its name  address and place of residency; (ii) the number and percentage of shares owned in Prosus; (iii) a tax residency certificate issued by its country of residence; (iv) its bank account details; and (v) a statement confirming that all relevant conditions of the DWT exemption are met. This information should be submitted before 18 October 2022. Subsequently  Prosus will need to file a Dutch DWT notification with the Dutch tax authorities.Shareholders are advised that Prosus will  as a general rule  initially withhold 15% on ALL dividends distributed on the dividend payment date  being Tuesday  27 September 2022. If  however  ABN AMRO has been provided with proof  to its satisfaction  ultimately 18 October 2022  that the relevant shareholder qualifies for an exemption from Dutch DWT  no amount of DWT will be withheld  and the 15% DWT that otherwise would have been withheld will be paid out by Prosus to the relevant shareholder directly  after the DWT return has been filed by Prosus with the Dutch tax authorities.1.3. Tax treaty reliefShareholders that do not qualify for the domestic exemption from Dutch DWT as outlined in paragraph 1.2  may qualify for an exemption from or reduction of Dutch DWT on the basis of a relevant tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands. The claiming of tax treaty relief or a credit will generally be subject to formal requirements. Shareholders should consult their tax advisor to determine if such an exemption or reduction is applicable to their situation and in which way  they can claim this DWT back from the Dutch tax authorities.3. South African Tax Implications2.1. GeneralA capital repayment in respect of a Prosus share that is listed on the JSE will be regarded as a ""foreign return of capital"" for South African tax purposes. No South African dividend tax (""SADT"") will be withheld on the amounts paid to shareholders as a capital repayment.For shareholders holding Prosus shares as a capital investment  the capital repayment will reduce the South African tax base cost of the Prosus shares in the hands of the shareholder by an amount equal to the capital repayment. To the extent that the capital repayment may exceed the tax base cost of the Prosus shares  taxable gains may result shareholders subject to South African capital gains tax.Where a shareholder elects to receive a dividend in respect of a Prosus share that is listed on the JSE  such distribution will be regarded as a ""foreign dividend"" for South African income tax purposes and should generally be exempt from normal tax in South Africa. However such foreign dividends will  generally and in addition to being subject to Dutch DWT  be subject to 20% SADT  to be withheld by the regulated intermediary in South Africa (CSDP)  leaving a distribution amount per share net of SADT  unless:2.1.1. a shareholder qualifies for an exemption from  or a reduction of  SADT  on the basis of South African domestic law or a tax treaty concluded by South Africa and before the dividend is paid  the formal requirements to apply such exemption or reduction from SADT are satisfied (insofar as applicable); or2.1.2. The dividend is paid to another CSDP; or2.1.3. The beneficial owner of such dividend is a natural person  deceased estate or insolvent estate in respect of a dividend paid in respect of a tax free investment as contemplated in section 12T(1) of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (as amended).In order to qualify for any exemption or reduction from SADT described in paragraph 2.1.1. the person to whom the dividend is paid must provide the following documentation to the CSDP before the dividend is paid:2.1.4. a written declaration that the dividend is exempt from SADT in terms of South African domestic law; and2.1.5. a written undertaking to inform the regulated intermediary in writing should the circumstances affecting the exemption/reduction applicable change  or should the beneficial owner cease to be the beneficial owner  by the date determined by the CSDP  or where no date is determined  by the date of payment of the dividend.2.2. Tax implications for South African corporate shareholdersWhere the South African resident beneficial owner of the dividend is a company  the dividend will be exempt from SADT in terms of domestic law  provided the documentary requirements set out above are complied with.2.3. Tax implications for South African non-corporate shareholdersWhere the South African resident beneficial owner of the dividend is a non-corporate shareholder  the dividend may be exempt from SADT in terms of domestic law. Where the dividend does not qualify for one of the domestic exemptions  SADT will be paid at an initial rate of 20%  subject to a rebate for Dutch DWT paid in respect of such dividend without any recovery by any person.2.4. Rebate on SADT paidA rebate for foreign taxes (i.e. Dutch DWT) imposed on the dividend paid is available to reduce the SADT liability. This rebate is calculated based on the Dutch DWT paid without the right of recovery by any person. In other words  the rebate is limited to the amount of Dutch DWT paid after taking into account relevant exemptions from  or reductions of  Dutch DWT that the shareholder may be eligible for as described in paragraph 1 above.The rebate will further be limited to the SADT imposed. For example  if the dividend is exempt from Dutch DWT in terms of Dutch domestic law as a result of the shareholder holding 5% or more of Prosus’s shares  no rebate will be available.The CSDP is responsible for withholding SADT from the dividend payable to shareholders on the South African register and paying such amounts to the South African Revenue Service.In order to apply a rebate  the CSDP must be satisfied:2.4.1. that DWT was applied; and2.4.2. that the relevant shareholder qualifies for a reduced rate of DWT.The rebate for foreign taxes is determined in Rand by translating the foreign currency amount using the same rate used to translate the foreign dividend.2.5. Refund mechanismThe maximum effective dividend tax to be paid by South African tax resident shareholders on the South African register  who are not exempt from SADT will be 20%. For example  where a CSDP is satisfied that a particular shareholder has paid 15% Dutch DWT  which is not recoverable by that shareholder from the Dutch tax authority  such CSDP should withhold only 5% SADT  being the 20% SADT less 15% DWT (unless a specific South African domestic exemption applies and the required documentation as set out in paragraph 2 has been provided to the CSDP). However if the CSDP is not satisfied that the Dutch DWT cannot be recovered by the shareholder  the CSDP may withhold up to 20% in SADT.If such shareholder pays more than an aggregate 20% tax (being the total Dutch and South African dividend tax paid on the same dividend)  such shareholders are advised to follow the procedures set out paragraphs 1  if appropriate  in order to claim a refund of Dutch DWT taxes overpaid. Where an amount of SADT has been overpaid as a result of failure to comply with the requirements described in paragraphs 2.1.4 and 2.1.5  or the failure to deduct a rebate as described in paragraph 2.4  the shareholder may be entitled to claim a refund of the SADT overpaid. This refund must be claimed from the CSDP within a period of three years after the date of payment of the dividend.Whether or not there is a refund due to the shareholder should be determined with reference to the specific facts applicable to that shareholder.The information provided above does not constitute tax advice and is only provided as a general guide on the South African tax treatment of the cash dividend declaration by Prosus to South African tax resident shareholders. For shareholders residing outside of South Africa  the dividend may have other legal or tax implications and such shareholders are advised to obtain appropriate advice from their professional advisers in this regard.Looking forward with confidenceOur purpose is unchanged – we aim to improve everyday life for billions of people around the world by building leading companies that use technology to meet societal needs in better ways.

9172,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/launch-odd-lot-offer-finalisation-060000497.html,Launch of Odd-lot Offer and Finalisation of Offer Price,Kenmare Resources PLC(“Kenmare” or the “Company”) 24 August 2022 Launch of Odd-lot Offer and Finalisation of Offer Price NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR...,Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources PLC(“Kenmare” or the “Company”)24 August 2022Launch of Odd-lot Offer and Finalisation of Offer PriceNOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN WHOLE OR IN PART  IN  INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTIONKenmare Resources plc (“Kenmare” or the “Company”) announces that it has today launched an Odd-lot Offer pursuant to which shareholders holding fewer than 200 ordinary shares in Kenmare (the “Odd-lot Holders”) will be offered the opportunity to sell their shares at a 5% premium to the market price.IntroductionAt the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 26 May 2022 shareholders approved the making by the Company of an Odd-lot Offer at any time within 18 months of the date of the meeting.The Directors have decided to proceed with the launch of an Odd-lot Offer. The Odd-lot Offer opens today  24 August 2022  and will close on 30 September 2022.Shareholders with registered addresses in Ireland and the UK who were Odd-lot Holders on the First Record Date (being 21 April 2022) and who remain Odd-lot Holders on the Second Record Date (being 30 September 2022) are invited to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company.The price per Ordinary Share to be paid to Odd-lot Holders whose ordinary shares are repurchased pursuant to the Odd-lot Offer (the “Offer Price”) will be £4.82  being a 5 per cent. premium to the volume weighted average price of ordinary shares traded on the London Stock Exchange over the five trading days prior to 24 August 2022.BackgroundThe Odd-lot Offer is being implemented because  as a result of the Company’s restructuring and recapitalisation in 2016  the Company has an unusually large number of small shareholders for a company of its size. The Company has a total of more than 3 800 shareholders of which approximately 3 415 (88.96%) are small shareholders who hold fewer than 200 ordinary shares and  in aggregate  represent less than 0.2% of the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue.Story continuesThe Odd-lot Offer will facilitate the disposal by Eligible Odd-lot Holders of their shares at a 5% premium without the dealing costs that would typically render such disposal uneconomic  whilst giving active Shareholders the ability to opt-out of such a disposal by making the requisite election.The Directors believe that the Odd-lot Offer is to the benefit of Shareholders as a whole as it will lower the Company’s cost base and will facilitate a reduction in the number of Shareholders in the Company in an equitable manner.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ANY SHAREHOLDER WHO WISHES TO REMAIN A SHAREHOLDER MAY ELECT TO DO SO.The maximum number of Ordinary Shares eligible to participate in the Odd-lot Offer is approximately 105 802  representing less than 0.2% of the issued share capital of the Company  as determined on 21 April 2022 (the “First Record Date”). Therefore  if all Eligible Odd-lot Holders participated in the Odd-lot Offer  the maximum cash consideration payable to such Odd-lot Holders would be approximately £510 000.Details of the Odd-lot OfferEligible Odd-lot Holders are invited by the Form of Election/Surrender which is being sent to Eligible Odd-lot Holders to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Form of Election/Surrender  the Circular and the Purchase Contract.Shareholders with registered addresses in Ireland and the UK who were Odd-lot Holders on the First Record Date (being 21 April 2022) and who remain Odd-lot Holders on the Second Record Date (being 30 September 2022) are invited to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company. Shareholders who become Odd-lot Holders between the First Record Date and the Second Record Date will not be entitled to participate in the Odd-lot Offer.Holdings under the same name with different designations will be treated as separate holdings of Shareholders for these purposes.As the purpose of an Odd-lot Offer is to simplify the Company’s share register and make it more cost efficient  the Odd-lot Offer is open to the registered holders of Ordinary Shares only and not to Euroclear Participants or CDI Holders. For securities law reasons  only those Shareholders with registered addresses in the UK and Ireland will be eligible to participate in an Odd-lot Offer.Under the terms of the Odd-lot Offer  eligible Odd-lot Holders are able to elect to:(i) sell their Odd-lot holdings to the Company at the Offer Price; or(ii) retain their Odd-lot holdings.The holdings of Eligible Odd-lot Holders who either:(i) elect (under the terms of the Odd-lot Offer) to sell their holdings of Odd-lots; or(ii) do not make an election under an Odd-lot Offer will be acquired by the Company at the Offer Price.No Odd-lot Holder shall be entitled to make a partial election in respect of the Odd-lot Offer. To the extent that an Odd-lot Holder attempts to make a partial election in respect of the Odd-lot Offer  such Odd-lot Holder shall be deemed to have elected to participate in the Odd-lot Offer in respect of their entire shareholding without anything further being required.Eligible Odd-lot Holders who are registered Shareholders on 23 September 2022  being the record date in respect of the 2022 interim dividend announced by the Company on 17 August 2022  shall remain entitled to receive such dividend notwithstanding their participation in the Odd-lot Offer.Further informationShareholders should note that Shareholders approved the Odd-lot Offer at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 26 May 2022.The Offer Price is set in sterling. Shareholders with a registered address in the United Kingdom will be paid by cheque in sterling. Shareholders with a registered address in Ireland will be paid by a cheque in euro on the basis that the cash amount payable in sterling to which they would otherwise be entitled will be paid in euro based on an exchange rate determined by the Company by reference to the exchange rate prevailing on the day on which the Company converts the relevant amount of sterling into euro. Fluctuations in the sterling/euro exchange rate are at the risk of Shareholders tendering Odd-lots.All unclaimed proceeds from the sale of Odd-lots will be retained by the Company until claimed and will be dispatched to the Odd-lot Holder only upon the Odd-lot Holder applying in writing to Kenmare (enclosing the share certificate(s) or other evidence of title). No interest shall be payable and the Company shall not be required to account for any money earned on the unclaimed proceeds. Any such proceeds unclaimed for a period of 6 (six) years from the date of sale of the Odd-lots may be declared by the Directors to be forfeited for the benefit of the Company.The Directors of the Company  in their absolute discretion  reserve the right to withdraw the Odd-lot Offer at any time.Financial effects of the Odd-lot OfferAs at the First Record Date  the number of Ordinary Shares eligible to participate in the Odd-lot Offer was approximately 105 802  representing less than 0.2 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company. Therefore  the Odd-lot Offer and the potential repurchase of Ordinary Shares by the Company pursuant to the Odd-lot Offer is not expected to have a significant effect on the earnings  headline earnings per Ordinary Share  net asset value or tangible net asset value per Ordinary Share of the Company and any purchase of Ordinary Shares pursuant to an Odd-lot Offer will be funded by available cash resources.TAXATIONShareholders should take into account the tax implications for them of participating in the Odd-lot Offer. In order to assist Shareholders  a general description of the Irish and UK tax treatment of participating in the Odd-lot Offer for certain classes of Shareholder will be made available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com/OLO . Shareholders who are in any doubt as to their own tax position should consult their own professional adviser.Key dates and timesThe key dates and times are as follows:First Record Date 21 April 2022 (close of business)Odd-lot Offer opens24 August 2022 Odd-lot Offer closes 30 September 2022 (12.00 noon)Record Date to determine those Odd-lot Holders entitled to participate in the Odd-lot Offer at the (the “Second Record Date” referred to in the Circular)30 September 2022 (close of business) Implementation of the Odd-lot Offer takes effect3 October 2022 Despatch of cheques for Odd-lot Offer proceeds  no later than 17 October 2022Notes:The above dates and times are subject to change.
