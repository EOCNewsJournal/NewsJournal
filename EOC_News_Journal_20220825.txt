The purpose of such repurchases is to be able to adapt the Group’s capital structure and to pay for future acquisitions of businesses and operations using treasury shares. By holding own shares  the Company’s obligations outstanding for share-based incentive programmes are also ensured.Acquisitions are to be carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price that is within the registered price range at any given time  meaning the range between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price. Acquisitions of own shares are limited so that the Company’s total holding of treasury shares at no time exceeds 10 percent of the total number of shares in the Company.Divestments of the Company’s treasury shares may be carried out with or without preferential rights for shareholders but may not be carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm.

These options will entitle the holders to acquire a corresponding number of shares during the period starting on 9 September 2025 and ending on 5 June 2026  equal to approximately 0.8 percent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.6 percent of the total number of votes in the Company. The options are to be acquired at market value. The acquisition price of the shares when exercising call options shall correspond to 120 percent of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Company’s class B shares on the Nasdaq Stockholm during the period from 25 August 2022 to 7 September 2022  inclusive. In order to encourage participation in the share-based incentive programme (“the Programme”)  a subsidy equivalent to the premium paid for each call option shall be paid. The subsidy will be paid in September 2024 provided that the employment of the option holder with the Group has not been terminated or that the call options have not been divested before this date.The costs of the Programme comprise the subsidy to be paid in September 2024 as above  and the social security fees that will accrue on this subsidy. The total cost of the subsidy  including social security fees  is estimated at MSEK 2.5 after corporate tax (based on the market conditions on 30 June 2022). Offsetting the subsidy is the option premium totalling approximately MSEK 2.5  which the Company will receive when transferring the call options  as a result of which the Programme does not entail any net charge to the Company’s equity.Information about the Annual General MeetingFurther information about the Annual General Meeting is available on the Company’s website under: Corporate governance/Annual General Meeting.Next reportThe Interim Report for the period 1 April–30 September 2022 (6 months) will be published on 20 October 2022.Stockholm  24 August 2022Bergman & Beving AB (publ)BOARD OF DIRECTORSFor further information  please contact:Magnus Söderlind  President & CEO  Bergman & Beving AB  Tel: +46 10 454 77 00Peter Schön  CFO  Bergman & Beving AB  Tel: +46 70 339 89 99This information is information that Bergman & Beving AB (publ) is obliged to make public pursuant to Nasdaq Stockholm’s Rule book for Issuers.

9159,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/launch-odd-lot-offer-finalisation-060000497.html,Launch of Odd-lot Offer and Finalisation of Offer Price,Kenmare Resources PLC(“Kenmare” or the “Company”) 24 August 2022 Launch of Odd-lot Offer and Finalisation of Offer Price NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR...,Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources PLC(“Kenmare” or the “Company”)24 August 2022Launch of Odd-lot Offer and Finalisation of Offer PriceNOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN WHOLE OR IN PART  IN  INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTIONKenmare Resources plc (“Kenmare” or the “Company”) announces that it has today launched an Odd-lot Offer pursuant to which shareholders holding fewer than 200 ordinary shares in Kenmare (the “Odd-lot Holders”) will be offered the opportunity to sell their shares at a 5% premium to the market price.IntroductionAt the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 26 May 2022 shareholders approved the making by the Company of an Odd-lot Offer at any time within 18 months of the date of the meeting.The Directors have decided to proceed with the launch of an Odd-lot Offer. The Odd-lot Offer opens today  24 August 2022  and will close on 30 September 2022.Shareholders with registered addresses in Ireland and the UK who were Odd-lot Holders on the First Record Date (being 21 April 2022) and who remain Odd-lot Holders on the Second Record Date (being 30 September 2022) are invited to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company.The price per Ordinary Share to be paid to Odd-lot Holders whose ordinary shares are repurchased pursuant to the Odd-lot Offer (the “Offer Price”) will be £4.82  being a 5 per cent. premium to the volume weighted average price of ordinary shares traded on the London Stock Exchange over the five trading days prior to 24 August 2022.BackgroundThe Odd-lot Offer is being implemented because  as a result of the Company’s restructuring and recapitalisation in 2016  the Company has an unusually large number of small shareholders for a company of its size. The Company has a total of more than 3 800 shareholders of which approximately 3 415 (88.96%) are small shareholders who hold fewer than 200 ordinary shares and  in aggregate  represent less than 0.2% of the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue.Story continuesThe Odd-lot Offer will facilitate the disposal by Eligible Odd-lot Holders of their shares at a 5% premium without the dealing costs that would typically render such disposal uneconomic  whilst giving active Shareholders the ability to opt-out of such a disposal by making the requisite election.The Directors believe that the Odd-lot Offer is to the benefit of Shareholders as a whole as it will lower the Company’s cost base and will facilitate a reduction in the number of Shareholders in the Company in an equitable manner.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ANY SHAREHOLDER WHO WISHES TO REMAIN A SHAREHOLDER MAY ELECT TO DO SO.The maximum number of Ordinary Shares eligible to participate in the Odd-lot Offer is approximately 105 802  representing less than 0.2% of the issued share capital of the Company  as determined on 21 April 2022 (the “First Record Date”). Therefore  if all Eligible Odd-lot Holders participated in the Odd-lot Offer  the maximum cash consideration payable to such Odd-lot Holders would be approximately £510 000.Details of the Odd-lot OfferEligible Odd-lot Holders are invited by the Form of Election/Surrender which is being sent to Eligible Odd-lot Holders to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Form of Election/Surrender  the Circular and the Purchase Contract.Shareholders with registered addresses in Ireland and the UK who were Odd-lot Holders on the First Record Date (being 21 April 2022) and who remain Odd-lot Holders on the Second Record Date (being 30 September 2022) are invited to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company. Shareholders who become Odd-lot Holders between the First Record Date and the Second Record Date will not be entitled to participate in the Odd-lot Offer.Holdings under the same name with different designations will be treated as separate holdings of Shareholders for these purposes.As the purpose of an Odd-lot Offer is to simplify the Company’s share register and make it more cost efficient  the Odd-lot Offer is open to the registered holders of Ordinary Shares only and not to Euroclear Participants or CDI Holders. For securities law reasons  only those Shareholders with registered addresses in the UK and Ireland will be eligible to participate in an Odd-lot Offer.Under the terms of the Odd-lot Offer  eligible Odd-lot Holders are able to elect to:(i) sell their Odd-lot holdings to the Company at the Offer Price; or(ii) retain their Odd-lot holdings.The holdings of Eligible Odd-lot Holders who either:(i) elect (under the terms of the Odd-lot Offer) to sell their holdings of Odd-lots; or(ii) do not make an election under an Odd-lot Offer will be acquired by the Company at the Offer Price.No Odd-lot Holder shall be entitled to make a partial election in respect of the Odd-lot Offer. To the extent that an Odd-lot Holder attempts to make a partial election in respect of the Odd-lot Offer  such Odd-lot Holder shall be deemed to have elected to participate in the Odd-lot Offer in respect of their entire shareholding without anything further being required.Eligible Odd-lot Holders who are registered Shareholders on 23 September 2022  being the record date in respect of the 2022 interim dividend announced by the Company on 17 August 2022  shall remain entitled to receive such dividend notwithstanding their participation in the Odd-lot Offer.Further informationShareholders should note that Shareholders approved the Odd-lot Offer at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 26 May 2022.The Offer Price is set in sterling. Shareholders with a registered address in the United Kingdom will be paid by cheque in sterling. Shareholders with a registered address in Ireland will be paid by a cheque in euro on the basis that the cash amount payable in sterling to which they would otherwise be entitled will be paid in euro based on an exchange rate determined by the Company by reference to the exchange rate prevailing on the day on which the Company converts the relevant amount of sterling into euro. Fluctuations in the sterling/euro exchange rate are at the risk of Shareholders tendering Odd-lots.All unclaimed proceeds from the sale of Odd-lots will be retained by the Company until claimed and will be dispatched to the Odd-lot Holder only upon the Odd-lot Holder applying in writing to Kenmare (enclosing the share certificate(s) or other evidence of title). No interest shall be payable and the Company shall not be required to account for any money earned on the unclaimed proceeds. Any such proceeds unclaimed for a period of 6 (six) years from the date of sale of the Odd-lots may be declared by the Directors to be forfeited for the benefit of the Company.The Directors of the Company  in their absolute discretion  reserve the right to withdraw the Odd-lot Offer at any time.Financial effects of the Odd-lot OfferAs at the First Record Date  the number of Ordinary Shares eligible to participate in the Odd-lot Offer was approximately 105 802  representing less than 0.2 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company. Therefore  the Odd-lot Offer and the potential repurchase of Ordinary Shares by the Company pursuant to the Odd-lot Offer is not expected to have a significant effect on the earnings  headline earnings per Ordinary Share  net asset value or tangible net asset value per Ordinary Share of the Company and any purchase of Ordinary Shares pursuant to an Odd-lot Offer will be funded by available cash resources.TAXATIONShareholders should take into account the tax implications for them of participating in the Odd-lot Offer. In order to assist Shareholders  a general description of the Irish and UK tax treatment of participating in the Odd-lot Offer for certain classes of Shareholder will be made available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com/OLO . Shareholders who are in any doubt as to their own tax position should consult their own professional adviser.Key dates and timesThe key dates and times are as follows:First Record Date 21 April 2022 (close of business)Odd-lot Offer opens24 August 2022 Odd-lot Offer closes 30 September 2022 (12.00 noon)Record Date to determine those Odd-lot Holders entitled to participate in the Odd-lot Offer at the (the “Second Record Date” referred to in the Circular)30 September 2022 (close of business) Implementation of the Odd-lot Offer takes effect3 October 2022 Despatch of cheques for Odd-lot Offer proceeds  no later than 17 October 2022Notes:The above dates and times are subject to change.

However  the changing competitive landscape  combined with new FDA’s requests for additional clinical data that would require significant additional resources on our part  led to the difficult decision to stop the development of Graspa in ALL. We are now focusing our resources on our most promising preclinical programs  while pursuing strategic partnering options to maximize value for our shareholders and employees.”Following positive results of a Phase 2 trial  sponsored by the Nordic Organization for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO)  presented at the 2020 American Society of Hematology annual meeting  ERYTECH has been in discussions with the FDA for the approval of Graspa to treat ALL patients who had previously experienced hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase therapy.A meeting to discuss the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) took place in June 2021  after which the Company confirmed its intention to submit a BLA  subject to the submission of additional requested information to the FDA and agreement on an Initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP).Story continuesThe Company recently received feedback from the FDA on its iPSP  submitted in July 2022. After thorough evaluation of this feedback  which included a new request for additional data  and taking into account the changing competitive landscape in the treatment of hypersensitive ALL  the Company has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to no longer seek approval for Graspa in ALL and to focus its resources on its preclinical programs and strategic partnering activities.Following the sale of its production facility in Princeton  New Jersey  for $44.5 million in April 2022  the Company appointed a specialized advisor to evaluate strategic options to leverage its ERYCAPS® platform with complementary assets and/or a broader corporate transaction. Multiple options are under review  and the Company expects to give further updates on these strategic initiatives in the fourth quarter of this year.About ERYTECHERYTECH is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative red blood cell-based therapeutics for severe forms of cancer and orphan diseases.

At the same time  we are focused on being a sustainable business  one that again proved its resilience in the face of global challenges and uncertainties.Discount to net asset valueTo increase net asset value per share  this year we initiated an open ended repurchase programme of Naspers and Prosus shares. This builds on earlier actions like the approved share exchange that better balanced Naspers and Prosus on their respective stock exchanges last year and repurchasing US$10bn in shares over the past two years. The current repurchase programme will be funded by an orderly  on-market sale of Tencent shares held by the group. Tencent is supportive of the withdrawal by Prosus of its voluntary restriction on the sale of its Tencent Shares.. We believe this will generate significant value for our shareholders over a sustained period. In addition  our management team has been incentivised to reduce this discount for the long-term value creation of the group.Delivering our strategyEssentially  our strategy is to build valuable businesses that solve everyday problems for customers. We do this globally by backing innovative local entrepreneurs  but deploying a disciplined approach to capital allocation. We typically grow our capital commitments progressively as we learn and scale  intrinsically linked to future returns.Today  across our core segments of ecommerce  food  payments and fintech  etail and  most recently edtech  our impact is significant. Our entrepreneurs and teams improve the daily lives of billions of customers. We enable people to buy and sell safely online  easily order food delivered quickly to their homes. We enable participation in the digital economy and access to important financial services otherwise unavailable to people. We enable customers to educate themselves without visiting a classroom. And we help to satisfy a basic human need  the ability to connect and interact with others that is so important in the digital age.A year of progressDespite a turbulent operating environment  FY22 was a period of progress for the group. Like many technology companies  we faced significant macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds  resulting in highly volatile capital markets. The combination of the war in Ukraine  higher inflation and rising interest rates drove up the cost of capital and increased uncertainty. Valuations of global peers in tech and internet sectors declined sharply in recent months as the level of risk appetite reduced significantly. These forces drove the first decline in the group’s net asset value in many years. To navigate these turbulent times  we are prioritising capital on supporting our existing businesses and prudent balance-sheet management to sustain adequate financial liquidity.Group revenues grew 24% to US$37bn  driven by ecommerce which grew revenues 56%. Group trading profit was down 10% to US$5bn. Core headline earnings  our measure of after-tax operating performance  was down 40% to US$2.1bn  reflecting our sale of a 2% interest in Tencent and its lower contribution after greater losses from its associates. Our ecommerce businesses were resilient  growing revenues 53% in the second half and significantly outperforming global peers in many cases. The food-delivery segment’s performance remained strong while growth momentum continued globally in payments and fintech. In this segment  we increased our scale in India  one of the fastest-growing consumer internet markets and closing the BillDesk acquisition will create further opportunity to expand into credit and digital banking. In edtech  we made substantial progress in expanding the portfolio by acquiring market leaders in our focus areas. Our etail segment maintained revenues but recorded a small loss as it invests in growth opportunities.We ended the year with a strong and liquid balance sheet reflecting US$9.7bn in cash and cash equivalents  2.5 times the prior-year level. We invested US$6.3bn to increase our stakes in existing investments and new assets with substantial opportunity for future value creation  particularly in our food-delivery and edtech segments. We will continue to invest organically to build on our strong progress in specific segments: autos in classifieds  convenience in food delivery and India credit in payments and fintech.We raised US$9.25bn in additional capital last year. We also continued to crystallise returns and pay back capital to shareholders. In total  we have allocated US$50bn in capital over the past six years: some 57% of that being invested into the business and new growth opportunities  around 25% returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends  and the balance held in cash.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has deeply impacted our classifieds business in the ecommerce segment. We are appalled by the war in Ukraine and we continue to do all we can for our Ukrainian employees and the country’s people. In March 2022  we began separating the Russian classifieds business Avito from our OLX Group  and announced in May that we would exit this business and are identifying an appropriate buyer for our shares in Avito. We have also written down the full carrying value of our VK asset  the Russian online platform.Our role in societyOne of our three strategic priorities is to be a force for good for our stakeholders. Around the world  sustainability is central to our growth and strategy.At the same time  there is growing interest from shareholders  regulators and other stakeholders in how seriously we honour our responsibilities as a global technology group.We have a strong heritage of acting responsibly. But much of this good work has been implicit. We believe it is now essential that we do business with the stated goal of being a positive force for the world around us.To illustrate  our Ventures arm is increasing its focus on sustainable investment themes  such as agriculture technology or agtech and healthtech. During the year  we invested in several agtech companies applying sustainable digital solutions by using soil biology analytics and artificial intelligence tools to determine the most sustainable solutions for crops  while addressing specific climate and social-inclusion challenges. These priorities are consistent with our support for circular-economy innovations to mitigate and reduce environmental footprints.More tangibly  being a force for good translates into employment. An independent research study on iFood’s food-delivery operations in Brazil found that the company created about 730 000 jobs (formal and informal)  or 0.72% of the employed population in 2020  as part of its value chain. In addition  the study noted that iFood drivers receive an hourly wage comparable to being employed in the formal sector.Being a force for good applies equally in crisis situations. The appalling war in Ukraine is foremost a human tragedy. Ahead of the invasion  our OLX business prepared for a worsening situation  setting up accommodation for our teams and their families in the west of the country  advancing wages  and instituting regular contact with everyone. When the invasion began  we offered relocation to safer areas in the country and outside Ukraine. In addition  we are contributing US$10m to assist humanitarian aid efforts in Ukraine. Our Ukrainian and Polish employees are involved in selecting suitable registered and established charities to receive this support. At the onset of the war  we also made a US$350 000 donation to the international committee of the Red Cross.Aligning remuneration to performance and value creationOur group operates in highly competitive  fast-changing markets  many characterised by the shortage of key skills. Our remuneration structures therefore focus on attracting  motivating and retaining the best people to create sustainable shareholder value.Our strategic approach to human resources and remuneration better enables us to compete for the digital talent at the heart of our businesses. Our remuneration aims are simple: promote superior performance; focus employees on achieving key business goals; and realise effective returns on employee spend. Equality and consistency are embedded in group pay practices as we build our diverse and inclusive workplaces. Our pay practices around the world are fair  competitive and above minimum-wage standards.Importantly  we continue to engage with shareholders on remunerations topics. This feedback is constructive in continually improving the transparency of both our disclosure and reward structures.In the review period  several factors contributed to widening the discount in our trading value relative to a sum-of-the-parts valuation to its highest level. While we still focus a material portion of executive directors’ incentives on non-Tencent portions of the group over the long run  we believe there is a critical benefit to reducing this discount.Accordingly  for FY23  we proposed materially increasing the CEO and CFO’s short-term variable compensation exposure to narrowing the discount. At the same time  we have materially reduced the balance of annual compensation to emphasise the importance of this discount-focused incentive and align remuneration with shareholder expectations.In addition  given our strong belief that reducing the discount is fundamental to maximising shareholder returns  the committee did not award long-term incentives for FY23.In line with our commitment to greater transparency  we again improved disclosure on executive remuneration by detailing short-term incentive goals and achievements for FY22. We believe that revealing details of STI targets to our competitors before the end of the financial year is not in the best interests of our shareholders so  from FY23  we will disclose these targets retrospectively.Distributions to shareholdersThe distributions proposed by the company’s board of directors (“the board”) has been approved by the shareholders. On this basis  holders of ordinary shares N are entitled to a gross payment  in the form of a capital repayment  of 14 euro cents per share  holders of ordinary shares A1 will receive an amount per share equal to the outcome of the formula set forth in article 30.4 of the articles of association  being 1.118 euro cents per ordinary share A1  and holders of ordinary shares B will receive a dividend distribution of 0.000014 euro cents per share for the year ended 31 March 2022.Holders of ordinary shares N as at Friday  2 September 2022 (the dividend record date) who do not wish to receive a capital repayment can elect to receive a dividend instead. A choice for one option implies an opt-out of the other option. Elections to receive a dividend instead of a capital repayment will need to be made by holders of ordinary shares N by Monday  19 September 2022. Capital repayments and dividends will be payable to shareholders recorded in the books on the dividend record date and paid on or after Tuesday  27 September 2022.Dividends and capital repayments are declared and paid in euros. For those holders holding their ordinary shares N in South Africa via Strate will receive a gross distribution of 236.28080 Rand cents per ordinary share N. South Africa holders of ordinary shares A1 will receive a gross dividend of 18.86871 Rand cents per ordinary share A1. Holders of ordinary shares B will receive a dividend distribution of 0.00024 Rand cents per ordinary B share. This is based on an EUR/ZAR exchange rate of 16.8772 as at 24 August 2022.Generally  shareholders holding their ordinary shares N on the South African register positively electing to receive a dividend will receive a net distribution of at least 153.58252 Rand cents per ordinary share N. A maximum amount of 82.69828 Rand cents will be withheld (being 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax plus 20% SA dividend tax). This 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax may be reduced if shareholders provide evidence via the ABN AMRO platform that they are entitled to tax treaty benefits. The amount of additional South African dividend tax payable will be calculated by deducting from the 20% South African dividend tax otherwise due  a rebate equal to the Dutch dividend withholding tax paid in respect of the dividend (without any right of recovery). Those shareholders  unless exempt from paying dividend tax or entitled to a reduced withholding tax rate in terms of an applicable tax treaty  will thus be subject to a maximum of 20% total dividend tax which equals 47.25616 Rand cents.Holders of Prosus American Depositary Receipts which trade on an over-the-counter basis in the United States will receive a dividend.Salient dates:Wednesday  24 August 2022 Annual general meeting (including resolution to approve the dividend/capital payment) Results of annual general meeting and currency conversion announcement (i.e. ZAR equivalent of Prosus distribution determined for JSE holders) Wednesday  24 August 2022 Dividend/capital payment finalisation date Tuesday  30 August 2022 Last date to trade on the JSE in order to appear in the shareholder register and participate in the dividend/capital repayment Wednesday  31 August 2022 Ex-dividend/capital repayment date for JSE. Last date to trade on the Euronext Amsterdam in order to appear in the shareholder register and participate in the dividend/capital repayment. Thursday  1 September 2022 Ex-dividend/capital repayment date for Euronext Amsterdam Friday  2 September 2022 Record date to appear in the shareholder register and participate in the dividend/capital repayment Monday  5 September 2022 – Monday  19 September 2022 Dividend/capital repayment election period Tuesday  27 September 2022 Dividend/capital repayment date Tuesday  18 October 2022 Final date for intermediaries to upload Dutch DWT reclaimsDue to the differing ex-dividend dates between the JSE and Euronext Amsterdam  transfers of N ordinary shares between the JSE and the Euronext Amsterdam between Tuesday  30 August 2022  and Friday  2 September 2022  both dates inclusive  will not be permitted.In addition to the Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate of up to 15%  dividends paid in respect of ordinary N shares on the South African register will also be subject to South African dividend tax at a rate of up to 20% in relation to shareholders not entitled to an exemption from South African dividend tax. The amount of additional South African dividend tax payable may be subject to a rebate for Dutch dividend withholding tax paid in respect of such dividend without any recovery by any person so that the aggregate dividend tax would in those cases add up to a maximum of 20%.South African corporates who own 5% or more of the shares in Prosus may qualify for a Dutch domestic exemption from Dutch dividend withholding tax.The treaty between South Africa and the Netherlands notes that the Dutch dividend withholding tax may get reduced from 15% to 10%. This reduction applies equally to corporates holding less than 10% of the capital of Prosus  individuals and other persons who qualify as residents of South Africa for treaty purposes. If shareholders  or their tax advisors  conclude that they are entitled to benefits arising from the tax treaty  such shareholders should follow the process prescribed by the tax treaty to claim relief.Those shareholders who qualify for relief or a reduction have until 18 October 2022 to provide evidence to ABN AMRO that their dividend qualifies for relief or a reduction from Dutch dividend withholding tax.Please note that no Dutch dividend withholding tax will be withheld on repayments of share capital. There will also be no South African dividend tax on repayments of share capital.Tax Implications1. Dutch Tax Implications1.1. GeneralCapital repayments will be paid from share capital. No Dutch dividend withholding tax (""DWT"") will be withheld on the amounts of capital repayments paid to shareholders.Where a shareholder elects to receive a dividend  generally  15% DWT will be withheld by Prosus on the cash dividend  leaving a distribution amount per share net of this 15% Dutch DWT  unless:1.1.1. a shareholder qualifies for an exemption from or a reduction of Dutch DWT on the basis of Dutch domestic law (including implementation of EU Directives) and/or a tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands; and1.1.2. the formal requirements to apply such exemption from or reduction of Dutch DWT are satisfied (insofar applicable).Prosus will initially withhold 15% on ALL cash dividends distributed on Tuesday  27 September 2022. As a subsequent step  if and to the extent Prosus has been provided before 18 October 2022 with proof that a shareholder qualifies for an exemption from or a reduction of Dutch DWT on the basis of Dutch domestic law  the difference between 15% and the Dutch DWT to be withheld will be paid out to the shareholder  after the Dutch DWT return and/or Dutch DWT notification has been filed by Prosus with the Dutch tax authorities. Prosus will remit the Dutch DWT to be withheld to the Dutch tax authorities based on the Dutch DWT return.1.2. Domestic exemptions from Dutch DWT1.2.1. GeneralCorporate shareholders may be exempt from Dutch DWT in terms of Dutch domestic law  if:1.2.1.1. The shareholder is tax resident in the Netherlands and owns 5% or more of the share capital of Prosus  provided that the further requirements for the application of the Dutch participation exemption are met. Special rules may apply for corporate shareholders that are considered tax transparent in their country of residence  or considered tax transparent from a Dutch tax perspective; or1.2.1.2. A shareholder is considered tax resident within the EU or EEA or is a tax resident of a country with which the Netherlands has concluded a tax treaty containing an article on taxation of dividends (such as South Africa)  and  as a general rule  this corporate shareholder is the beneficial owner of the dividends distributed by Prosus and owns 5% or more of the share capital of Prosus. In addition to the shareholding requirement  the shareholder is also required to meet certain other conditions relating to the application of the Dutch participation exemption  determined as if the corporate shareholder is a Dutch tax resident.The above exemptions are not available in cases of abuse  for which a main purposes test and artificial arrangement test applies.If a shareholder is eligible for an exemption or reduction from Dutch DWT  in order to place reliance on such exemption or reduction  the shareholder is required to submit certain information to ABN AMRO as set-out below.1.2.2. Dutch corporate shareholders owning 5% or more of Prosus' share capitalIn order to rely on this domestic exemption from Dutch DWT described in paragraph 1.2.1.1 above  the shareholder should provide ABN AMRO via its own intermediary bank with: (i) its name  address and place of residency  and corresponding extract from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce; (ii) the number and percentage of shares owned in Prosus; (iii) its bank account details; and (iv) a statement confirming that the Dutch participation exemption applies to the dividend at the level of the Dutch corporate shareholder. This information should be submitted before Tuesday  18 October 2022.As indicated above  Prosus will  as a general rule  initially withhold 15% on ALL dividends distributed on Tuesday  27 September 2022. If  however  Prosus has been provided with proof  to its satisfaction  ultimately before 18 October 2022  that the relevant shareholder qualifies for an exemption from Dutch DWT  no amount of DWT will be withheld  and the 15% DWT that otherwise would have been withheld will be paid out by Prosus to the relevant shareholder directly  after the DWT return has been filed by Prosus with the Dutch tax authorities.1.2.3. EU/EEA or tax treaty country resident corporate shareholders owning 5% or moreIn order for a corporate shareholder to rely on the domestic exemption from Dutch DWT described in in paragraph 1.2.1.2 above  the shareholder should provide ABN AMRO via its own intermediary bank with: (i) its name  address and place of residency; (ii) the number and percentage of shares owned in Prosus; (iii) a tax residency certificate issued by its country of residence; (iv) its bank account details; and (v) a statement confirming that all relevant conditions of the DWT exemption are met. This information should be submitted before 18 October 2022. Subsequently  Prosus will need to file a Dutch DWT notification with the Dutch tax authorities.Shareholders are advised that Prosus will  as a general rule  initially withhold 15% on ALL dividends distributed on the dividend payment date  being Tuesday  27 September 2022. If  however  ABN AMRO has been provided with proof  to its satisfaction  ultimately 18 October 2022  that the relevant shareholder qualifies for an exemption from Dutch DWT  no amount of DWT will be withheld  and the 15% DWT that otherwise would have been withheld will be paid out by Prosus to the relevant shareholder directly  after the DWT return has been filed by Prosus with the Dutch tax authorities.1.3. Tax treaty reliefShareholders that do not qualify for the domestic exemption from Dutch DWT as outlined in paragraph 1.2  may qualify for an exemption from or reduction of Dutch DWT on the basis of a relevant tax treaty concluded by the Netherlands. The claiming of tax treaty relief or a credit will generally be subject to formal requirements. Shareholders should consult their tax advisor to determine if such an exemption or reduction is applicable to their situation and in which way  they can claim this DWT back from the Dutch tax authorities.3. South African Tax Implications2.1. GeneralA capital repayment in respect of a Prosus share that is listed on the JSE will be regarded as a ""foreign return of capital"" for South African tax purposes. No South African dividend tax (""SADT"") will be withheld on the amounts paid to shareholders as a capital repayment.For shareholders holding Prosus shares as a capital investment  the capital repayment will reduce the South African tax base cost of the Prosus shares in the hands of the shareholder by an amount equal to the capital repayment. To the extent that the capital repayment may exceed the tax base cost of the Prosus shares  taxable gains may result shareholders subject to South African capital gains tax.Where a shareholder elects to receive a dividend in respect of a Prosus share that is listed on the JSE  such distribution will be regarded as a ""foreign dividend"" for South African income tax purposes and should generally be exempt from normal tax in South Africa. However such foreign dividends will  generally and in addition to being subject to Dutch DWT  be subject to 20% SADT  to be withheld by the regulated intermediary in South Africa (CSDP)  leaving a distribution amount per share net of SADT  unless:2.1.1. a shareholder qualifies for an exemption from  or a reduction of  SADT  on the basis of South African domestic law or a tax treaty concluded by South Africa and before the dividend is paid  the formal requirements to apply such exemption or reduction from SADT are satisfied (insofar as applicable); or2.1.2. The dividend is paid to another CSDP; or2.1.3. The beneficial owner of such dividend is a natural person  deceased estate or insolvent estate in respect of a dividend paid in respect of a tax free investment as contemplated in section 12T(1) of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (as amended).In order to qualify for any exemption or reduction from SADT described in paragraph 2.1.1. the person to whom the dividend is paid must provide the following documentation to the CSDP before the dividend is paid:2.1.4. a written declaration that the dividend is exempt from SADT in terms of South African domestic law; and2.1.5. a written undertaking to inform the regulated intermediary in writing should the circumstances affecting the exemption/reduction applicable change  or should the beneficial owner cease to be the beneficial owner  by the date determined by the CSDP  or where no date is determined  by the date of payment of the dividend.2.2. Tax implications for South African corporate shareholdersWhere the South African resident beneficial owner of the dividend is a company  the dividend will be exempt from SADT in terms of domestic law  provided the documentary requirements set out above are complied with.2.3. Tax implications for South African non-corporate shareholdersWhere the South African resident beneficial owner of the dividend is a non-corporate shareholder  the dividend may be exempt from SADT in terms of domestic law. Where the dividend does not qualify for one of the domestic exemptions  SADT will be paid at an initial rate of 20%  subject to a rebate for Dutch DWT paid in respect of such dividend without any recovery by any person.2.4. Rebate on SADT paidA rebate for foreign taxes (i.e. Dutch DWT) imposed on the dividend paid is available to reduce the SADT liability. This rebate is calculated based on the Dutch DWT paid without the right of recovery by any person. In other words  the rebate is limited to the amount of Dutch DWT paid after taking into account relevant exemptions from  or reductions of  Dutch DWT that the shareholder may be eligible for as described in paragraph 1 above.The rebate will further be limited to the SADT imposed. For example  if the dividend is exempt from Dutch DWT in terms of Dutch domestic law as a result of the shareholder holding 5% or more of Prosus’s shares  no rebate will be available.The CSDP is responsible for withholding SADT from the dividend payable to shareholders on the South African register and paying such amounts to the South African Revenue Service.In order to apply a rebate  the CSDP must be satisfied:2.4.1. that DWT was applied; and2.4.2. that the relevant shareholder qualifies for a reduced rate of DWT.The rebate for foreign taxes is determined in Rand by translating the foreign currency amount using the same rate used to translate the foreign dividend.2.5. Refund mechanismThe maximum effective dividend tax to be paid by South African tax resident shareholders on the South African register  who are not exempt from SADT will be 20%. For example  where a CSDP is satisfied that a particular shareholder has paid 15% Dutch DWT  which is not recoverable by that shareholder from the Dutch tax authority  such CSDP should withhold only 5% SADT  being the 20% SADT less 15% DWT (unless a specific South African domestic exemption applies and the required documentation as set out in paragraph 2 has been provided to the CSDP). However if the CSDP is not satisfied that the Dutch DWT cannot be recovered by the shareholder  the CSDP may withhold up to 20% in SADT.If such shareholder pays more than an aggregate 20% tax (being the total Dutch and South African dividend tax paid on the same dividend)  such shareholders are advised to follow the procedures set out paragraphs 1  if appropriate  in order to claim a refund of Dutch DWT taxes overpaid. Where an amount of SADT has been overpaid as a result of failure to comply with the requirements described in paragraphs 2.1.4 and 2.1.5  or the failure to deduct a rebate as described in paragraph 2.4  the shareholder may be entitled to claim a refund of the SADT overpaid. This refund must be claimed from the CSDP within a period of three years after the date of payment of the dividend.Whether or not there is a refund due to the shareholder should be determined with reference to the specific facts applicable to that shareholder.The information provided above does not constitute tax advice and is only provided as a general guide on the South African tax treatment of the cash dividend declaration by Prosus to South African tax resident shareholders. For shareholders residing outside of South Africa  the dividend may have other legal or tax implications and such shareholders are advised to obtain appropriate advice from their professional advisers in this regard.Looking forward with confidenceOur purpose is unchanged – we aim to improve everyday life for billions of people around the world by building leading companies that use technology to meet societal needs in better ways.

The Odd-lot Offer opens today  24 August 2022  and will close on 30 September 2022.Shareholders with registered addresses in Ireland and the UK who were Odd-lot Holders on the First Record Date (being 21 April 2022) and who remain Odd-lot Holders on the Second Record Date (being 30 September 2022) are invited to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company.The price per Ordinary Share to be paid to Odd-lot Holders whose ordinary shares are repurchased pursuant to the Odd-lot Offer (the “Offer Price”) will be £4.82  being a 5 per cent. premium to the volume weighted average price of ordinary shares traded on the London Stock Exchange over the five trading days prior to 24 August 2022.BackgroundThe Odd-lot Offer is being implemented because  as a result of the Company’s restructuring and recapitalisation in 2016  the Company has an unusually large number of small shareholders for a company of its size. The Company has a total of more than 3 800 shareholders of which approximately 3 415 (88.96%) are small shareholders who hold fewer than 200 ordinary shares and  in aggregate  represent less than 0.2% of the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue.Story continuesThe Odd-lot Offer will facilitate the disposal by Eligible Odd-lot Holders of their shares at a 5% premium without the dealing costs that would typically render such disposal uneconomic  whilst giving active Shareholders the ability to opt-out of such a disposal by making the requisite election.The Directors believe that the Odd-lot Offer is to the benefit of Shareholders as a whole as it will lower the Company’s cost base and will facilitate a reduction in the number of Shareholders in the Company in an equitable manner.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ANY SHAREHOLDER WHO WISHES TO REMAIN A SHAREHOLDER MAY ELECT TO DO SO.The maximum number of Ordinary Shares eligible to participate in the Odd-lot Offer is approximately 105 802  representing less than 0.2% of the issued share capital of the Company  as determined on 21 April 2022 (the “First Record Date”). Therefore  if all Eligible Odd-lot Holders participated in the Odd-lot Offer  the maximum cash consideration payable to such Odd-lot Holders would be approximately £510 000.Details of the Odd-lot OfferEligible Odd-lot Holders are invited by the Form of Election/Surrender which is being sent to Eligible Odd-lot Holders to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Form of Election/Surrender  the Circular and the Purchase Contract.Shareholders with registered addresses in Ireland and the UK who were Odd-lot Holders on the First Record Date (being 21 April 2022) and who remain Odd-lot Holders on the Second Record Date (being 30 September 2022) are invited to tender their Ordinary Shares for purchase by the Company. Shareholders who become Odd-lot Holders between the First Record Date and the Second Record Date will not be entitled to participate in the Odd-lot Offer.Holdings under the same name with different designations will be treated as separate holdings of Shareholders for these purposes.As the purpose of an Odd-lot Offer is to simplify the Company’s share register and make it more cost efficient  the Odd-lot Offer is open to the registered holders of Ordinary Shares only and not to Euroclear Participants or CDI Holders. For securities law reasons  only those Shareholders with registered addresses in the UK and Ireland will be eligible to participate in an Odd-lot Offer.Under the terms of the Odd-lot Offer  eligible Odd-lot Holders are able to elect to:(i) sell their Odd-lot holdings to the Company at the Offer Price; or(ii) retain their Odd-lot holdings.The holdings of Eligible Odd-lot Holders who either:(i) elect (under the terms of the Odd-lot Offer) to sell their holdings of Odd-lots; or(ii) do not make an election under an Odd-lot Offer will be acquired by the Company at the Offer Price.No Odd-lot Holder shall be entitled to make a partial election in respect of the Odd-lot Offer. To the extent that an Odd-lot Holder attempts to make a partial election in respect of the Odd-lot Offer  such Odd-lot Holder shall be deemed to have elected to participate in the Odd-lot Offer in respect of their entire shareholding without anything further being required.Eligible Odd-lot Holders who are registered Shareholders on 23 September 2022  being the record date in respect of the 2022 interim dividend announced by the Company on 17 August 2022  shall remain entitled to receive such dividend notwithstanding their participation in the Odd-lot Offer.Further informationShareholders should note that Shareholders approved the Odd-lot Offer at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 26 May 2022.The Offer Price is set in sterling. Shareholders with a registered address in the United Kingdom will be paid by cheque in sterling. Shareholders with a registered address in Ireland will be paid by a cheque in euro on the basis that the cash amount payable in sterling to which they would otherwise be entitled will be paid in euro based on an exchange rate determined by the Company by reference to the exchange rate prevailing on the day on which the Company converts the relevant amount of sterling into euro. Fluctuations in the sterling/euro exchange rate are at the risk of Shareholders tendering Odd-lots.All unclaimed proceeds from the sale of Odd-lots will be retained by the Company until claimed and will be dispatched to the Odd-lot Holder only upon the Odd-lot Holder applying in writing to Kenmare (enclosing the share certificate(s) or other evidence of title). No interest shall be payable and the Company shall not be required to account for any money earned on the unclaimed proceeds. Any such proceeds unclaimed for a period of 6 (six) years from the date of sale of the Odd-lots may be declared by the Directors to be forfeited for the benefit of the Company.The Directors of the Company  in their absolute discretion  reserve the right to withdraw the Odd-lot Offer at any time.Financial effects of the Odd-lot OfferAs at the First Record Date  the number of Ordinary Shares eligible to participate in the Odd-lot Offer was approximately 105 802  representing less than 0.2 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company. Therefore  the Odd-lot Offer and the potential repurchase of Ordinary Shares by the Company pursuant to the Odd-lot Offer is not expected to have a significant effect on the earnings  headline earnings per Ordinary Share  net asset value or tangible net asset value per Ordinary Share of the Company and any purchase of Ordinary Shares pursuant to an Odd-lot Offer will be funded by available cash resources.TAXATIONShareholders should take into account the tax implications for them of participating in the Odd-lot Offer. In order to assist Shareholders  a general description of the Irish and UK tax treatment of participating in the Odd-lot Offer for certain classes of Shareholder will be made available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com/OLO . Shareholders who are in any doubt as to their own tax position should consult their own professional adviser.Key dates and timesThe key dates and times are as follows:First Record Date 21 April 2022 (close of business)Odd-lot Offer opens24 August 2022 Odd-lot Offer closes 30 September 2022 (12.00 noon)Record Date to determine those Odd-lot Holders entitled to participate in the Odd-lot Offer at the (the “Second Record Date” referred to in the Circular)30 September 2022 (close of business) Implementation of the Odd-lot Offer takes effect3 October 2022 Despatch of cheques for Odd-lot Offer proceeds  no later than 17 October 2022Notes:The above dates and times are subject to change.

In these circumstances we ensure we stay close to our clients by intensifying our contacts even further. Our existing and new clients maintained confidence in investing their wealth  as evidenced by strong total net inflows of €4.9 billion in assets under management. We’re seeing inflows both in the private as institutional segments.“Earlier in the year  we enhanced our financial and non-financial targets and capital strategy. We continue to focus on further profitable growth with full energy  both organic and inorganic  while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet. In addition  we’ve made good progress on implementing our sustainability strategy and developing our new inclusion & diversity policy.“I’d like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues for their commitment that enabled us to achieve this solid result in the first half of the year. I’m proud of their engagement and dedication to our clients – which they also appreciate greatly. I also want to thank our clients for their trust.”Client assets and assets under managementTotal client assets decreased in the first half year in the wake of the negative market performance to €118.5 billion (2021: €131.2 billion). Net assets under management (AuM) inflow was high  at €4.9 billion. Due to the negative market performance of €17.5 billion  overall AuM decreased to €99.6 billion (2021: €112.1 billion).Story continuesNet AuM inflows in the Private Clients remained robust  with €1.4 billion in the first half of the year. Net AuM inflows at Wholesale & Institutional Clients amounted to €3.5 billion. Client savings rose slightly to €11.9 billion (2021: €11.7 billion).Results in the first half of 2022Net profit was €48.2 million (H1 2021: €58.3 million). The decrease was mainly the result of a €9.9 million provision related to an interest-rate derivatives case  as reported in our Q1 trading update in May of this year.Commission income was up 15% to €201.3 million (H1 2021: €175.7 million)  partly as a result of the acquisition of a 70% stake in Belgian wealth manager Mercier Vanderlinden. Interest income fell to €69.7 million (H1 2021: €76.1 million)  mostly due to lower margins on mortgages and reduced revenues from early repayment fees.Operating expenses rose €19.2 million to €216.0 million (H1 2021: €196.8 million). This increase was partly due to the Mercier Vanderlinden acquisition (around €6 million)  as anticipated  and to higher staff costs. In the years ahead  we will continue to invest to achieve future growth.PERFORMANCE REPORT/PRESENTATION/WEBCASTFor a detailed discussion of Van Lanschot Kempen’s results and balance sheet  please refer to our performance report and presentation on the 2022 half-year results at www.vanlanschotkempen.com/results.

Reported TCE rate for the total fleet of $29 431 per day.Completed the $275 million refinancing of 14 Capesize vessels at attractive terms  further reducing the industry low cash break-even rate.Entered into agreements to sell two Ultramax vessels and construct three Kamsarmax vessels at attractive prices.Estimated TCE rates  inclusive of charter coverage  calculated on a load-to-discharge basis are approximately: $27 900 per day for 80% of Capesize available days and $27 100 per day for 96% of Panamax available days for the third quarter of 2022; and $29 500 per day for 25% of Capesize available days and $21 900 per day for 27% of Panamax available days for the fourth quarter of 2022.Published the Company’s fourth annual ESG report for 2021  which can be found on the Company’s website.Announced a cash dividend of $0.60 per share for the second quarter of 2022  payable on or about September 14  2022 to shareholders of record on September 7  2022. Shareholders holding the Company’s shares through Euronext VPS may receive this cash dividend later  on or about September 16  2022.Ulrik Andersen  Chief Executive Officer  commented:“Golden Ocean delivered another strong result in the second quarter of 2022 despite trade disruptions and economic headwinds. Our performance is attributable to the strength of our commercial operations as well as the quality of our fleet  which allowed us to generate a solid premium to benchmark rates.Story continuesDespite recent weakness in freight rates caused by easing port congestion and the contraction in China’s economy due  in part  to its “zero COVID” policy  our market outlook remains optimistic. Slowing fleet growth and new environmental regulations provide a strong offset to a potential short-term slowing of demand growth which combined with our charter coverage and superior fuel economics from our modern fleet will support continued healthy returns.“The Board of DirectorsGolden Ocean Group LimitedHamilton  BermudaAugust 25  2022Questions should be directed to:Ulrik Andersen: Chief Executive Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 53Peder Simonsen: Chief Financial Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 45The full report is available in the link below.Forward Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30  2022Frontline Ltd. (the “Company” or “Frontline”)  today reported unaudited results for the three and six months ended June 30  2022:HighlightsNet income of $47.1 million  or $0.23 per basic and diluted share for the second quarter of 2022.Adjusted net income of $42.5 million  or $0.21 per basic and diluted share for the second quarter of 2022.Declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share for the second quarter of 2022.Reported total operating revenues of $300.4 million for the second quarter of 2022.Reported spot TCEs for VLCCs  Suezmax tankers and LR2 tankers in the second quarter of 2022 were $16 400  $26 500 and $38 600 per day  respectively.For the third quarter of 2022  we estimate spot TCE on a load-to-discharge basis of $28 100 contracted for 73% of vessel days for VLCCs  $45 000 contracted for 73% of vessel days for Suezmax tankers and $46 200 contracted for 62% of vessel days for LR2 tankers.Announced the signing of a definitive combination agreement for a stock-for-stock combination between Frontline and Euronav NV (“Euronav”) (NYSE & Euronext: EURN) to create a leading global independent oil tanker operator which on a combined basis would own and operate 68 VLCCs and 56 Suezmax tankers  and 20 LR2/Aframax tankers.Took delivery of the VLCC newbuildings  Front Alta and Front Tweed  from Hyundai Heavy Industries (“HHI”) in April and June 2022  respectively.Entered into two senior secured term loan facilities in April and July 2022 for a total amount of up to $356.4 million at attractive terms to refinance two existing term loan facilities maturing in the first quarter of 2023.Lars H. Barstad  Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS  commented:“Frontline’s fleet of LR2 tankers took center stage in the second quarter of 2022 during which period we achieved the highest quarterly TCE we have recorded on this vessel class. Sanctions on Russian oil and other products disrupted trade lanes for refined products globally  causing both refinery margins and freight rates to rise. Crude oil transport has also been affected  and Suezmax tankers have seen increased utilization and freight rates  throughout the second quarter.Story continuesFrontline is proud to show solid earnings in the second quarter and to be able to distribute dividends. We have over the last several quarters pointed to what we believe will be a cyclical up-turn for tankers  and this view has only been further cemented during the first half of the year. Supply and demand for oil and product transportation has gradually been tightening as the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic  and a pivotal point seems to have been found. With the lowest orderbook as a percentage of the fleet seen in decades  and oil supply and demand normalizing  we believe this bodes well for the years to come.Frontline announced on the 11th of July its intention for a stock-for-stock combination with Euronav  with full support from the respective Board of Directors  and we are moving diligently forward to what ultimately will create an unparalleled service offering to our customers and the largest listed tanker owner in the world.”Inger M. Klemp  Chief Financial Officer of Frontline Management AS  added:“In April and July 2022  we entered into two senior secured term loan facilities for a total amount of up to $356.4 million to refinance two existing term loan facilities with total balloon payments of $324.6 million maturing in the first quarter of 2023. The refinancing will reduce our borrowing costs and what we believe to be industry leading cash break even rates and maximize potential cash flow per share after debt service costs. We expect to refinance one further existing term loan facility with total balloon payments of $33.7 million due in the first quarter of 2023 prior to maturity.”Average daily time charter equivalents (""TCEs"")1($ per day) Spot TCE Spot TCE estimates % Covered Estimated average daily cash breakeven rates 2022 Q2 2022 Q1 2022 Q4 2021 2021 Q3 2022 2022 VLCC 16 000 16 400 15 700 16 500 15 300 28 100 73 % 24 900 SMAX 21 600 26 500 16 900 14 200 12 000 45 000 73 % 20 000 LR2 28 600 38 600 19 000 13 900 11 800 46 200 62 % 17 200The estimated average daily cash breakeven rates are the daily TCE rates our vessels must earn to cover operating expenses including dry docks  repayments of loans  interest on loans  bareboat hire  time charter hire and net general and administrative expenses for the remainder of the year.Spot estimates are provided on a load-to-discharge basis  whereby the Company recognizes revenues over time ratably from commencement of cargo loading until completion of discharge of cargo. The rates reported are for all contracted days up until the last contracted discharge of cargo for each vessel in the quarter. The actual rates to be earned in the third quarter of 2022 will depend on the number of additional days that we can contract  and more importantly the number of additional days that each vessel is laden. Therefore  a high number of ballast days at the end of the quarter will limit the amount of additional revenues to be booked on a load-to-discharge basis. Ballast days are days when a vessel is sailing without cargo and therefore  we are unable to recognize revenues on such days. Furthermore  when a vessel remains uncontracted at the end of the quarter  the Company will recognize certain costs during the uncontracted days up until the end of the period  whereas if a vessel is contracted  then certain costs can be deferred and recognized over the load-to-discharge period.The recognition of revenues on a load-to-discharge basis results in revenues being recognized over fewer days  but at a higher rate for those days. Over the life of a voyage there is no difference in the total revenues and costs to be recognized as compared to a discharge-to-discharge basis.When expressing TCE per day the Company uses the total available days  net of off hire days and not just the number of days the vessel is laden.The Board of DirectorsFrontline Ltd.Hamilton  BermudaAugust 24  2022Ola Lorentzon - Chairman and DirectorJohn Fredriksen - DirectorOle B.

9213,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ramsay-sante-provisional-annual-results-153500299.html,RAMSAY SANTE : Provisional annual Results at the end of June 2022,PRESS RELEASE Paris  August 25  2022 Provisional annual results at end June 2022 The solid performance of the Nordic countries has led to an improvement in...,RAMSAY SANTEPRESS RELEASEParis  August 25  2022Provisional annual results at end June 2022The solid performance of the Nordic countries has led to an improvement in the results of the Ramsay Santé group  despite the persistent challenges of high inflation  a shortage of nursing and clinical staff and the ongoing pandemic  in which Ramsay Santé has continued to play a leading role in Europe.In line with its Yes We Care 2025 strategic plan  Ramsay Santé has continued to invest at a level comparable with previous years in order to consolidate its position with patients as a comprehensive and integrated healthcare player in continental Europe.With more than 10 000 COVID patients treated in France  including 4 500 in critical care  Ramsay Santé has maintained its commitment to combating COVID over the past 12 months. In Sweden  we have continued to shoulder significant responsibility both in the care of COVID patients and in limiting the effects of the pandemic on individuals and society. For example  approximately 600 000 doses of COVID vaccine were administered to patients  in our Swedish facilities in particular to our nursing home residents. In addition  we continued to manage almost 20% of all COVID-related hospital care in the Stockholm area.Growth was strong in the 3 Nordic countries  particularly in Medicine  Surgery and Obstetrics (MSO) hospitalisations  up 14% on the previous year  excluding Germany. Consultations in primary care centres in Sweden  including teleconsultations  were up 16%. In France  full MSO inpatient hospital admissions fell by 4.1%  while day patient admissions rose by 3%. The same trend affects our Follow-up Care and Rehabilitation (FCR) activity with a 1.1% drop in inpatients and a 27.6% increase in day patients.Total investments for the period amounted to €217 million compared with €220 million last year. More than 40% of investments correspond to growth and digital investments. These investments are necessary to uphold our operational and medical excellence. The number of primary care centres has increased by 28% from 130 to 167 in 2022. We have opened our first 5 primary care centres in France and invested in 2 new surgical robots. We have also established capital and operational partnerships with the Resilience and NewCard start-ups. In January 2022  we launched Ramsay Services  a digital platform.Reported annual turnover is €4 301 million  up 6.9%. Adjusted for changes in the scope of consolidation and at constant exchange rates  turnover for the year ending June 30th 2022 is up with very solid organic turnover growth of 6.0%.Reported EBITDA increased by 2.3% to €658.4 million (prior year €643.8 million) with a margin of 15.3% (prior year 16.0%). EBITDA development was positively impacted by activity in Nordic countries  which compensated for increases in inflation and personnel costs. The revenue guarantee system put in place by the French government generated €99 million in income for the year ending June 30th 2022  compared with an income of €103 million for the year ending June 30th 2021.The group share of net profit is €118.4 million  benefiting from the increase in activity and improved results  representing 2.8% of turnover.Net financial debt at the end of June 30th 2022 amounts to €3 710 million  including €2 118 million of IFRS 16 liabilities.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“In 2022  for the first time  Ramsay Santé exceeded the threshold of 10 million patients treated in Europe in its various activities  within and outside its facilities  as well as in digital. During the year  the Group mobilised more than ever for the care of Covid patients  and reinforced its ability to treat all patients for all pathologies. In France  our commitment is reflected in the fact that 10% of patients admitted are beneficiaries of Universal Medical Coverage (CMU). The Group has also taken an innovative approach to human resources in France with the signing of an ambitious agreement on quality of life in the workplace. Financial results remain solid  with growth of 6.9% and a slightly lower EBITDA margin (15.3% under IFRS16 in 2022 vs. 16.0% in 2021). These results are due to sustained organic growth as well as acquisitions in Sweden  Norway and Denmark. This demonstrates the relevance of our strategy of consolidating our position as an integrated European health care operator and orchestrating coordinated care pathways  allowing us to guarantee quality and accessibility for all.”These provisional accounts were presented to the Board of Directors at its meeting on August 25th 2022. The audit process is well underway. The final financial statements for the year ending June 30th 2022 will be available to the public when the company's Universal Registration Document is published in late October 2022.Summary of resultsIn € million From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 Variation From 1 July 2020 to30 June 2021 Turnover 4 301.0 +6.9% 4 022.6 EBITDA (IFRS 16) 658.4 +2.3% 643.8 Underlying Operating Profit 281.1 +3.3% 272.0 As a % of turnover +6.5% -0.3 point +6.8% Operating Profit 291.2 +16.2% 250.6 Group share of Net Profit 118.4 65.0 Earnings per share (in €) 1.07 0.59Breakdown of revenue by operating segmentIn € million From 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022 From 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021 Variation Île-de-France 1 057.9 1 000.8 +5.7% Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes 579.6 561.7 +3.2% Hauts de France 393.4 380.6 +3.4% Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur 169.1 161.4 +4.8% Bourgogne Franche Comté 133.7 107.4 +24.5% Other regions 669.8 655.3 +2.2% Nordic countries 1 297.4 1 155.4 +12.3% Reported Turnover 4 301.0 4 022.6 +6.9% Of which:- Turnover on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates4 215.13 977.4+6.0% - Impact of acquisitions and disposals and exchange rate movements 85.9 45.2Note : The table above details the contributions of the various operating segments to the Group's consolidated turnover.Significant events of the financial year:Health crisis due to the COVID PandemicThe financial year ending June 30th 2022 was impacted by the ongoing health crisis due to the COVID pandemic in all countries where the Group operates.FranceIn France  private hospitals have maintained their action plans to combat the COVID epidemic and their level of investment in conjunction with and in support of public hospitals  in accordance with the national health plan.Ramsay Santé upheld its commitment to treating COVID patients with more than 10 000 COVID patients treated in France  including 4 500 in critical care. Like other hospital operators  Ramsay Santé has continued to be supported by measures implemented by the government. The main measures during the period concern:The revenue guaranteeGrants compensating for additional costs related to COVIDThe revenue guarantee covered the entire financial year for Medicine  Surgery and Obstetrics (MSO) and Follow-up Care and Rehabilitation (FCR). It was only in place for the first half of the year (July-December 2021) for Mental Health activities  given the reform of the financing of Mental Health activities (MH) towards an allocation model in force since January 1st 2022.The amount of the funding guarantee recognised by the Group for the year ending June 30th 2022 amounts to €99 million (€103 million for the previous year) and is reported in the income statement under “Other operating income”.In addition to the revenue guarantee  the government also adjusted the levels of grants usually paid to health care institutions in order to compensate for the additional costs related to the COVID crisis that would not otherwise be covered. These subsidies are reported in the income statement under “Other operating income” for €89.8 million (€72.3 million for the previous financial year). Given the time lag between when costs are incurred by facilities and notification by the Regional Health Authorities of the corresponding subsidies  a significant portion of the subsidies reported during the period corresponds to financing for additional costs incurred during the previous financial year  a situation similar to that of the same period last year. Of the total amount of funding recognised in the period  €27.5 million (€14.5 million in the previous year) corresponds to amounts received for the funding of additional costs incurred in the previous year.Outside FranceThe Group's facilities in Scandinavia played an active role in the care of COVID patients as well as in screening and vaccinating the population  backing up public institutions and in close collaboration with the supervisory authorities. Nevertheless  activity was impacted by the health crisis during the period  in particular for inpatient care in Sweden but also in Denmark and Norway where the authorities suspended admissions at the height of the spread of the virus from December 2021 to February 2022. Despite these periods of disruption  the overall activity level and profits were strong as activity was boosted during the periods when normal activity resumed.In Sweden  Sankt Göran Hospital and the Group-operated geriatric hospitals in Stockholm played a key role in managing the outbreak with over 100 beds dedicated to COVID patients. Sankt Göran  together with the Stockholm geriatric hospitals  treated almost 20% of all COVID patients in the Stockholm area throughout the pandemic. The Group contributed significantly to the screening and vaccination effort in Sweden and to screening in Norway.Whilst no support measures were implemented in Norway and Denmark  our facilities in Sweden received grants to cover additional operating costs. In total  the amount of aid received by our institutions in Sweden was €32.2 million in the period  compared to €61.5 million in the previous period.Scope of consolidationRamsay Santé finalised the acquisition of 10 entities in Scandinavia during the year. These acquisitions are complementary to the current business and expand the scope of the Group's services as well as its geographic footprint. In total  these acquisitions represented a net investment of €288.6 million.Furthermore  Ramsay Santé completed the acquisition of GHP Specialty Care AB (“GHP”) in May 2022  for an enterprise value of €238 million. In the 12 months ending December 2021  GHP's turnover amounted to €137 million. GHP employs 765 FTEs. This acquisition contributed €29 million in turnover and €1.9 million in EBITDA to Ramsay Santé's accounts in the year ended 30 June 2022.Indicative offer received by Ramsay Health Care LimitedOn April 20th 2022  Ramsay Générale de Santé noted the announcement by Ramsay Health Care Limited  its Australian reference shareholder listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange  confirming that it had received a non-binding and conditional indicative offer from a consortium of financial investors led by KKR to acquire 100% of the share capital of Ramsay Health Care Limited.On August 25th 2022  Ramsay Health Care Limited issued a further announcement stating that the consortium was continuing to consider the transaction and had confirmed the terms of its indicative offer  which remains subject to certain conditions  including the completion of due diligence of Ramsay Health Care Limited and access to non-public information relating to Ramsay Générale de Santé  and that the Board of Ramsay Générale de Santé had requested the usual information required in such circumstances from the consortium in order to assess the request for access to this non-public information.The full press release issued by Ramsay Health Care Limited can be viewed on the Ramsay Health Care Limited website (www.ramsayhealth.com).Comments on the annual accountsActivity and turnover:In the financial year ending June 30th 2022  Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated turnover of €4 301.0 million  compared with €4 022.6 million for the period from July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021  an increase of 6.9%. Please note that the financing guarantee scheme in the Group's accounts has no impact on reported turnover as it is reported in the income statement under “Other operating income”.On a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates  the Group’s turnover increased by 6.0% with one additional working day.Changes in the scope of consolidation are due to divestment of the German business and two clinics in France in the previous financial year  combined with acquisitions in the Nordic region over the last 12 months.For the financial year ending June 30th 2022  the overall activity of Ramsay Santé’s French entities continued to be impacted by the consequences of the COVID pandemic. The main effects were related to the cancellation of certain scheduled medical and surgical activities during the peaks of the pandemic but also from limiting the number of patients per room. In total  the number of patient admissions increased by 3.2% compared with last year. This increase is mainly related to comparatively lower volumes in 2020-2021  as the negative impact of the COVID pandemic on patients' willingness to access care recedes in our follow-up care  rehabilitation and mental health activities.The variation by business line breaks down as follows:+0.3% in medicine  surgery and obstetrics+23.8% in follow-up care and rehabilitation+11 4% in mental healthAs part of its public service missions  the Group recorded a 16.2% increase in the number of emergency room visits during the past year  with approximately 755 000 visits to our facilities in France.Organic turnover growth in Nordic countries for the year ending June 30th 2022 was +7.4% compared with last year. Organic turnover growth was boosted by both investments and new contracts  additional services related to COVID screening and vaccination  and continued positive turnover growth in the underlying business. Scandinavian business also benefited from the latest acquisitions  which contributed €66 million of additional turnover during the financial year  net of the impact of disposals (German business sold at the end of 2020).Resul ts :EBITDA reached €658.4 million for the financial year ending June 30th 2022  up 2.3% on a reported basis. The Group's EBITDA at 30 June 2022 includes 99.1 million related to the revenue guarantee system described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above  as well as cost compensations for COVID surcharges for France and Sweden. EBITDA was also positively impacted by the organic growth of the business  particularly in the Nordic region. On a comparable basis  at constant scope and exchange rates  EBITDA increased by 1.3% during the year.The EBITDA margin as a percentage of turnover was 15.3%  compared with 16.0% for the same period last year on a reported basis. On a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates  the EBITDA margin dropped slightly from 16.2% to 15.4%.Underlying operating profit amounted to €281.1 million between July 1st 2021 and June 30th 2022 (or 6.5% of turnover)  up 3.3% on the previous year.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net income of €10.2 million for the period ending June 30th 2022  consisting mainly of gains on the disposal of vacant real estate assets  divestments of tangible and intangible assets  and release of provisions related to the disposal of Capio's business in Germany. From July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021  other non-current income and expenses represented a net expense of €21.4 million.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €123.5 million for the year ending June 30th 2022  compared with €123.2 million the previous year.

Net debt includes €1 763.6 million in non-current borrowings and €35.4 million in current borrowings  offset by €132 5 million in cash and cash equivalents.The application of IFRS 16 to operating leases contributed €2 118.3 million to net financial debt at June 30th  of which €1 922.3 million was non-current lease debt and €196.0 million was current lease debt.During the first half of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé carried out a Euro Private Placement bond issue for a total financing amount of €100 million on two tranches maturing in 2027 and 2028.The Group complies with all commitments relating to the financing documentation in place.

The fundamentals are all strong: a record-high order intake  a historical revenue  accompanied by a strong operating profit For the sake of clarity  this press release does not include the 10-year contract worth more than USD 50 million  that was signed in August 2022 and announced to the market on August 19th  2022.H1 Financial performanceRecord order intake of EUR 88.7 millionRevenue in the first six months of the year  amounts to EUR 67 7 million  + 9% YoY. BER revenue is of EUR 5 7 million  growing EUR 1 2 million in comparison to 1H21. Revenue excluding BER is at EUR 62.0 million growing EUR 4 7 million compared to the same period last year.Gross margin is growing with EUR 3.3 million compared to 1H21  though the overall gross margin percentage is eroding with 1 2Pts. This erosion is primarily the consequence of investments in additional resources to ensure quality support for our growing topline.Net profit amounts to EUR 15 5 million  leading to a diluted earnings per share of EUR 1 15 (equal to 1H21 results)OutlookThe secured revenue is at EUR 126 4 million  growing 29% compared to 1H21Based on the secured revenue at end of June 2022  the revenue guidance for the full year is upgraded from EUR 125-140 million to EUR 140-150 million. This upgrade assumes a normal final production cycle of the year  without any impact of shortage in components nor any important changes linked to the pricing of components.The order book evolution can be summarized as following: BER order book is for EUR 3 8 million  fully bookable in 2022 Order book excluding BER is for EUR 87 1 million  growing 70% in comparison to 1H21  of which EUR 32 2 million is for 2023 and beyond. This long-term order book is growing with 39%.The gross margin percentage is expected to be negatively impacted by the investments done in our operations and support organization (comparable impact to 1H22 results). The rising prices of products and inflation are well monitored and controlled through a permanent evaluation of our sales prices.The OPEX growth for the full year is adjusted to a range of 12-15%  as a consequence of inflation  growth investments and post-covid spending patterns.The 1st half results currently support our dividend guidance for the year 2022  meaning a dividend of EUR 1 1 for the full year 2022 and an exceptional dividend of EUR 0 5  leading to a total expected dividend of EUR 1 6 for the year.

With H1 revenue and order intake indicators at their highest level ever  I am proud to say that our PLAYForward strategy is producing the expected results. Based on those strong H1 results  I am now more optimistic for our full year 2022 results. While we are still facing important challenges in our electronic component supply chain  we are now sufficiently confident to increase our earlier revenue guidance for 2022 of EUR 125 million to EUR 140 million to a new guidance of EUR 140 million to EUR 150 million.Our 2 main Market Pillars (Live Service Providers and Live Audience Business) continue to show strong revenue generation. Our third Market Pillar (Big Event Rental) will also generate the expected ‘big event year’ results in 2022 thanks to the major winter sporting events that took place early this year  and thanks to the major sporting events that will take place in the Middle East by the end of this year.In line with our PLAYForward strategy  we have been further increasing our sales  engineering and customer service team size in order to realize our growth ambitions. Our hiring efforts during H1 further accelerated and we have been able to hire over 70 new colleagues in various offices around the world  representing a 10+% increase of our overall team size. Our employer branding and reputation clearly helped us achieve such outstanding results.The high and global inflation has clearly a negative impact on our BOM (bill of material) costs and on our remuneration costs. We have started compensating for the impact of those increased costs by applying price increases. We expect that we will need to continue adapting our pricing to the raising inflation.Overall  I continue to feel cautiously optimistic about our future. While economic market conditions remain very challenging with high inflation  component shortages and with the war in Ukraine  I feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability  performance and innovative edge of our solutions and services. This represents a sound basis for the future.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“Our results for this first semester of 2022 are very comforting and demonstrate that we are a company in growth mode. All our topline indicators support our ambition. Obviously  growth can only happen with accompanying investments: investments primarily in resources in sales  operations & support and R&D. The investments in R&D have been well controlled and modeled  allowing us to validate them as intangible assets and allowing EVS to depreciate the investment in time based on the validation of future benefits of the development of new features. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy with a very low debt level and a sound cash position. Based on these strong results  we are able to maintain our dividend policy defined earlier this year.”EVS Market Dynamics and customer winsDuring the first semester  EVS delivered successfully major winter events  serving the host broadcaster  as well as hundreds of right holders  including NBC. As every year  EVS also supported its customers (facility companies and broadcasters) delivering the NFL Superbowl: one of the most watched events on earth.The modernization projects continue to be on the agenda of our LAB customers. EVS plays a key role in the transformation and modernization of premium broadcast and media centres (representing our LAB customers) with a series of existing and new projects relying on its VIA platform and new IP-based Media Infrastructure. In this last category of solutions  EVS announced at NAB a major multi-million deal with Fox Sports US  selecting Media Infrastructure Strada flexible routing solution  as an additional proof point of the traction for the new EVS solutions and the success of the Axon integration within EVS.We observe a decrease of revenue for LAB customers in H1 compared to the same period in 2021. Depending on the nature of the deal  some LAB projects can take more than 2 years for full revenue recognition. The revenue recognition is based on the content of the deliveries and on the work in progress. This thus depends on the pace and structure of the transformation project. There will thus be variations  even across several years  based on the mix of LAB active projects. The effect has been amplified since EVS has been successful winning very significant deals in US in late 2019 and 2020. These projects are now being finalized or entering new phases with less revenues. Based on these key market references  EVS will now initiate the transformation in other regions  resulting in more normal size projects.Live Service Providers players continue to upgrade their portfolio of replay services to leverage the advantages of the combination of XT-VIA and LSM-VIA. With the end of support of previous generation of XT servers (XT3) nearing  we observe an acceleration of the upgrades for the LSPs both in terms of revenues and orders. As observed for previous generations  not all customers will convert before the end of support date. It also depends on the contract they sign with their customers and/or their investment cycles.LiveCeption Pure solution continues to be deployed in smaller OB Vans and venues thanks to our Channel Partners. The new MediaInfra Strada evolutive routing solution also made its entry within IP OB Vans in North America.New versions of solutions have been announced during H1 2022:Neuron supports a new application  called Neuron Protect  which fulfils the increasing demand for more secured solutions: higher level of redundancy on top of IP networks. It proves that EVS considers security as a top priority and provides new solution components to face the challenges faced by the industry. The new “Compress” version of Neuron offers new low-bitrate codec  JPEG-XS compression required for video transport in remote operations.With the addition of the new version of IP Core to Cerebrum  additional routing capabilities are offered making use of SDN to ensure fully secured orchestration of any IP-based video signals.The new version of “MediaCeption signature” offers a comprehensive set of content management applications combining advanced software and Web-based modules for even richer workflows from ingest to playout. With the RTBF deal announced in February 2022  EVS co-develops a future Flexible Control Room solution build on Cerebrum: the solution - embracing production automation - will support the broadcasters in their transformation to produce more efficiently with dynamic scaling during a production  while proposing an open solution optimized in terms of user experience for operators of all generations.LSM-VIA continues to evolve and integrate more and more features to ease and automate the tasks of EVS operators  offering them an environment to personalize their way of working.On the front of electronic components availability  EVS manages to keep the balance between frictions in the supply chain and deliveries to the customer through increased  yet reliable delivery times. Until now  all orders have been shipped on time thanks to the huge efforts and the magic talents of several teams  adapting to the different combinations of components while refusing to compromise on quality.During first semester  EVS has also been successfully strengthening the team through external hiring in order to support the expected growth  mainly in R&D and Customer Services teams to further develop the solutions and in the US to better support key customers and channel partners in the region.NAB tradeshow was appreciated by all the industry with the opportunity to meet customers again “in real life”  engaging into fruitful conversations  and demonstrating for the first time in live situation for some customers the numerous new solutions and features proposed by EVS. The return to NAB was also special since celebrated through the NAB 2022 Best Of Show award for Neuron Protect which is the first NAB award for a Media Infrastructure product inside EVS.At the beginning of this year  EVS also enhanced and extended the leadership team with two new members  Alex Redfern as CTO and Xavier Orri as EVP Operations & Projects  to sustain the growth path engaged by the company. Two US colleagues - James Stellpflug as SVP Customer Success NALA and David Pinkel as SVP Sales North America - have also been promoted to further strengthen and drive the EVS teams in the Americas.Revenue in 1H22In 1H22  EVS revenue reached EUR 67.7 million: an increase of EUR 5.9 million or 9.5% compared to 1H21.At constant currency  revenue increased by 5.7% YoY.Revenue – EUR millions 1H22 1H21 1H22/1H21 Total reported 67 7 61 8 9.5% Total at constant currency 65 3 61 8 5.7% Total at constant currency and excluding big event rentals 59 6 56 6 5.3%Currency fluctuations primarily impact EVS revenues by the EUR/USD conversion  which can have a significant impact on our results even if EUR/USD fluctuations also impact the cost of our US operations and partially our cost of goods sold.In the first half of the year  (excl. Big Event Rentals) LSP represented 59% (47% in 1H21) of the revenue  LAB 41% (53% in 1H21). Comparisons to 2021 are impacted by post-COVID investments from our clients. Both LSP and LAB evolve in line with our expectations in 2022 and demonstrate the long-term growth patterns laid out in our PLAYForward strategic plan.Geographically  revenues (excl. big event rentals) are distributed in 1H22 as follows:Europe  Middle East and Africa (EMEA): EUR 28 7 million (EUR 32.1 million in 1H21) demonstrating a minor decline compared to 1H21  though benefiting from a strong order intake in 1H21 to secure further growth potential.Americas (NALA): EUR 25.6 million (EUR 15.8 million in 1H21)  underpinning the strong performance in that region since multiple quarters.Asia & Pacific (APAC): EUR 7.7 million (EUR 9.4 million in 1H21)  despite the slowdown in the region following COVID implications  demonstrating only a minor decline.First half 2022 resultsConsolidated gross margin was 67.7% for 1H22  compared to 68.9% in 1H21 explained by important investments in the operations & support department to ensure we continue to deliver quality support all over the world  in line with our growth patterns. There is a minor impact on the gross profit margin  given the increased importance of MediaInfra in the overall portfolio. However  the impact of cost price increases and inflation have been well modeled by the corresponding sales price increases and do not negatively affect our gross profit margin. EVS continues to keep the balance in this area.Operating expenses increased by 8% YoY explained by post-COVID spending patterns. There have also been significant investments in additional team members to fuel our future growth  but at the same time  EVS was able to launch an IAS38 evaluation for some R&D investments  so that the overall increase in team member costs is very limited.The 1H22 EBIT margin was 23.3%  compared to 24.9% in 1H21: the EBIT margin is dropping primarily following investments in the past 12 months to support our growth pattern.Income taxes are at EUR 1.9 million  compared to EUR 0.01 million last year: in 2021 EVS could still benefit from various tax latencies linked to prior years. The group net profit amounted to EUR 15 5 million in 1H22  compared to EUR 15.6 million in 1H21. Basic net profit per share amounted to EUR 1 15 in 1H22  a similar performance as in 1H21 (EUR 1 16).Team membersAt the end of June 2022  EVS employed 594 team members (FTE). This is an increase by 52 team members compared to the end of June 2021. This increase in team members reflects our continued investments in the growth of EVS. We expect only marginal increases in the remainder of the year 2022.Balance sheet and cash flow statementEVS continues to have a strong balance sheet with net cash position of EUR 44.2 million with low debt level (of which EUR 13.4 million related to IFRS 16) resulting in a total equity representing 74.3% of the total balance sheet as of the end of June 2022.Other intangible assets include mainly six months internal development costs capitalized during 2022 according to IAS 38 (Intangible assets).Lands and building mainly include the headquarters in Liège as well as the right of use for the offices abroad (IFRS16). Six months depreciations on intangible assets  lands and buildings (including the right of use assets) and other tangible assets reached EUR 3.4 million. Liabilities include EUR 16.8 million of financial debt (including long term and short-term portion of it)  mainly related to the lease liabilities for EUR 13.4 million and borrowings for EUR 3.3 million.Inventories amount to EUR 30.2 million and include around EUR 3.4 million value of Axon equipment.In the liabilities  long-term provisions include the provision for technical warranty on EVS products for labor and parts. The other amounts payables include mainly customer advances received and accruals (accrued charges and deferred income)The net cash from operating activities amounts to EUR 9.4 million end of 2Q22 compared to EUR 13.3 million end of 2Q21. On June 30  2022  cash and cash equivalents total EUR 60.9 million. This is a decrease compared to June 2021 mainly explained by the increase of the net cash used in investing activities mainly due to the investments in tangible and intangible assets (specifically in the internal development of intangible assets) together with the increase of the net cash used in financing activities mainly due to the higher amount of final dividends distributed during 2022.At the end of June 2022  there were 14 327 024 EVS shares outstanding  of which 908 014 were owned by the company. At the same date  138 832 warrants were outstanding with an average exercise price of EUR 28.90 and a maturity of December 2022 together with 158 250 warrants with an average exercise price of EUR 13.69 and a maturity of October 2026 and 158 600 warrants with an average exercise price of EUR 18.21 and a maturity of June 2027.Corporate updateDuring last General Assembly on May 17th  the shareholders have acknowledged the resignation of Philippe Mercelis and have appointed two new directors  Frédéric Vincent and Marco Miserez  both for a period of 4 years. The Board of Directors is currently composed of seven directors:Johan Deschuyffeleer   independent director & President (representing The House of Value BVBA);Michel Counson   managing director;Martin De Prycker   independent director (representing InnoConsult BVBA);Chantal De Vrieze   independent director (representing 7 Capital SRL);Frédéric Vincent   independent director;Marco Miserez   independent director; andAnne Cambier  independent director (representing Accompany You SRL)2H 2022 outlookThe secured revenue on June 30  2022 amounts to EUR 116.9 million  which is +36.9% growth compared to EUR 85.4 million of last year at the same date (excluding Big Events Rentals).In addition to secured revenue  EVS already won EUR 32.2 million of orders to be invoiced in 2023 and beyond (no revenue for Big Event Rentals has been secured for 2023 and beyond)  which represents an increase of 39.4% compared to EUR 23.1 million at the same date last year.Thanks to this continued strong order book evolution the revenue guidance for the full year 2022 is being increased from initial guidance of EUR 125 million and EUR 140 million to a new guidance of EUR 140 million and EUR 150 million.The gross margin percentage is expected to be negatively impacted following the investments done in the past 12 months to hire additional team members. We expect the impact caused by potential shortage and delay of component and raw material as well as the rising prices to be balanced off by the price increases modeled.Operational expenses continue to be closely managed and EVS expects an increase between 12-15% in the full year of 2022.GlossaryTerm Definition Secured revenue Revenue already recognized as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in the fiscal year Order book <date> Revenues planned to be recognized after the <date> based on current orders.

The Company’s IFRS accounting policies and methods are available in the 2021 annual report on www.evs.com  except for the accounting policy on intangible assets which include the capitalization of development cost for the first time (see note 5.10) as well as the new  amended or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC Interpretations that have been in effect since January 1  2022  which are listed hereunder:Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases: COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1April 2021).Amendments to IAS 16 Property  Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022).Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions  Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts — Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022).Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: Reference to the Conceptual Framework (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022).Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020 (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022.The adoption of these new  amended or revised pronouncements did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.NOTE 5.2.2: JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATESThe impact of the war in Ukraine on our activitiesGiven the nature and location of its operations and the fact that EVS does not currently have activities in Russia nor in Ukraine or with Russian companies  The Company does not foresee a direct impact of the Ukrainian conflict on its business.The impact current market volatility and macroeconomic developmentsThe impacts of the current market volatility and macroeconomic developments were taken into account by the Company to assess potential effects on EVS’s financial performance and the valuation of its assets and liabilities. In particular  key assumptions used in the calculation of the post employments obligations have been reviewed to ensure a proper valuation as per 30 June 2022.NOTE 5.3: SEGMENT REPORTINGFrom an operational point of view  the company is vertically integrated with the majority of its staff located in the headquarters in Belgium  including the R&D  production  marketing and administration departments. This explains why the majority of the investments and costs are located at the level of the Belgian parent company. Resources securing the customer facing interactions  like sales  operations and support profiles  are primarily hired within the respective regions. The foreign subsidiaries are primarily sales and representative offices. The Chief Operating Decision Maker  being the Executive Committee  reviews the operating results  operating plans  and makes resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis. Revenue related to products of the same nature (digital broadcast production equipment) are realized by commercial polyvalent teams. The company’s internal reporting is the reflection of the above-mentioned operational organization and is characterized by the strong integration of the activities of the company.By consequence  the company is composed of one segment according to the IFRS 8 definition  and the consolidated income statement of the group reflects this unique segment. All long-term assets are located in the parent company EVS Broadcast Equipment SA in Belgium.The company provides only one type of solution: solutions based on tapeless workflows with a consistent modular architecture. This is the product of EVS. There are no other significant classes of business  either singularly or in aggregate. Indeed  identical modules can meet the needs of different markets. Our customers themselves are often multi-markets. Providing information for each module is therefore not relevant for EVS.At the geographical level  our activities are divided into the following regions: Asia-Pacific (“APAC”)  Europe  Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)  and America (“NALA”). This division follows the organization of the commercial and support services within the group  which operate worldwide. A fourth region is dedicated to the worldwide events (“big event rentals”).The company provides additional information with a presentation of the revenue by market pillar: “Live Service provider”  “Live Audience Business” and “Big Event Rentals” for rental contracts relating to the big sporting events.Finally  sales are presented by nature: systems and services.5.3.1.

INFORMATION ON IMPORTANT CLIENTSOver the last 6 months  no external client of the company represented more than 10% of the revenue (this was same for the same period in 2021).NOTE 5.4: EQUITY SECURITIESThe number of treasury shares has changed as follows during the period  together with the outstanding warrants:2022 2021 Number of own shares at January 1 925 140 928 207 Acquisition of own shares on the market - - Sale of own shares on the market - - Allocation to Employees Profit Sharing Plans -17 126 -3 067 Sale related to Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) and other transactions - - Number of own shares at June 30 908 014 925 140 Outstanding warrants at June 30 455 682 325 832In 1H22  the Group did not repurchase own shares on the stock market. No shares were used to satisfy the exercise of warrants by employees.The Ordinary General Meeting of shareholders of May 17  2022  approved the allocation of 17 126 shares to EVS employees (grant of 56 shares to each staff member in proportion to their effective or assimilated time of occupation in 2021) as a reward for their contribution to the group successes.The expense recorded in the consolidated income statement amounts to 329 kEUR for the six-month period ended on June 30 2022.NOTE 5.5: DIVIDENDSThe Ordinary General Meeting of May 17  2022  approved the payment of a total gross dividend of EUR 1.50 per share for the year 2021.(EUR thousands) # Coupon Declaration date 2022 2021 - Final dividend for 2020(EUR 0.50 per share less treasury shares) 30 May 2021 - 6 699 - Interim dividend for 2021(EUR 0.50 per share less treasury shares) 31 Nov.2021 - 6 701 - Final dividend for 2021(EUR 1.00 per share less treasury shares) 32 May 2022 13 402 Total paid dividends 13 402 13 400EVS implemented the dividend policy announced by the end of 2021 distributing an interim dividend for 2021 in November 2021 of EUR 0.50 per share and a final dividend of EUR 1.00 per share for 2021. The total dividend of EUR 1.50 per share includes a EUR 0.50 exceptional dividend to honor the past commitments on dividend payout. A new dividend guidance has been issued early 2022 and is as following:In € per share per fiscal year 2022 2023 2024 Base dividend 1 10 1 10 1 10 Exceptional additional dividend 0 50 0 00 0 00 Total dividend 1 60 1 10 1 10NOTE 5.6: OTHER NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (EXPENSES)(EUR thousands) 1H22 1H21 - Fair value variation of financial instruments -169 -7 - Exchange results 1 955 268 - Other financial results 153 61 Other net financial income / (expenses) 1 939 322The functional currency of EVS Broadcast Equipment SA as well as all subsidiaries is the Euro  except for the EVS Inc. subsidiary  whose functional currency is the US dollar and Axon Digital Design LTD. subsidiary whose functional currency is the GBP (up till March of 2022  at which point in time the functional currency also became the Euro). The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements of EVS Group is the Euro. For more information on exchange rates  see also the note 5.9. The increase of the exchange result income is explained by the appreciation of USD and GBP comparing to Euro.The estimated fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to their fair book values in the balance sheet.Since 2022  EVS systematically measures the group’s anticipated exposure to transactional exchange risk  mainly relating to the EUR/USD risk. Given the group has a “long” position in USD and based on revenue forecasts  EVS hedges future USD net in-flows by forward or option foreign exchange contracts. The change in the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is recorded directly to the income statement (other financial results) since the Group does not apply hedge accounting on these transactions.The valuation techniques used are mainly based on spot rates  forward rates and interest rate curves.On June 30  2022  the group holds EUR/USD FX option contracts for a total notional amount of USD 9 million with monthly maturities between July 2022 and June 2023 at an average EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.0435. The fair value of those financial instruments on June 30  2022  amounts to EUR -0.1 million.NOTE 5.7: INCOME TAX EXPENSE(EUR thousands) 1H22 1H21 - Current tax (expense) / income -722 494 - Deferred tax (expense) / income -1.142 -438 Income tax expense -1 864 56Income taxes expense increased during the first half of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021 primarily following important tax latencies impacting the 2021 tax base.The effective tax rate for the period ended on June 30  2022  is 10.8% (-0.4% for same period in 2021).The evolution of effective tax rate is mainly explained by:The increase of the current tax mainly due to rise in the taxable profits. It must be noted that in the first half of 2021  a tax relief of EUR 0.7 million was received; andThe increase of the deferred tax expenses due to the high profit before tax impacting the recoverable tax loss for EUR 1.2 million together with the reversal of other temporary differences.NOTE 5.8: HEADCOUNT(in full time equivalents) At June 30 2022 594 2021 542 Variation +52NOTE 5.9: EXCHANGE RATESThe main exchange rate that influences the consolidated financial accounts is USD/EUR and GBP/EUR which has been taken into account as follows:Exchange rate USD/EUR Average 1H At June 30 2022 1.0937 1.0387 2021 1.2049 1.1884 Variation -9.23% -12.60%Exchange rate GBP/EUR Average 1H At June 30 2022 0.8420 0.8582 2021 0.8682 0.8580 Variation -3.02% 0.02%NOTE 5.10: INTANGIBLE ASSETSDuring 2022  intangible assets increased by EUR 3.9 million as a net movement of a capitalization of internal development costs of EUR 4.5 million less six months depreciations of EUR 0.6 million.At the beginning of the period  the Group identified internal development projects  that for the first time of EVS Broadcast Equipment’s history fulfilled all the conditions to be capitalized according to IAS 38 Intangible assets. This ability arises after the implementation of extensive business cases  where R&D together with the solutions and sales departments perform an end-to-end exercise whereby objectives  costs  market analysis and return are clearly identified.These internal development projects consist of software that will be commercialized at the end of the development period (expected return on investment is scheduled for 2024).Management performed an assessment related to the internal development projects and concluded that:It is technically feasible to complete the development of these software so that it will be available for the sale;The Group has the intention to complete the development of the software in order to sell it;The Group is able to sell the software once the development will end;The future economic benefits from the sales of the software have been identified and are in excess of the budgeted development costs;The Group secured the necessary financial resources together with the internal (and external) technical resources to complete the development of the software in order to sell it; andThe new established processes allow to the Group to measure reliably the expenditures attributable to the development of the software and therefore  attributable to the cost of the intangible assets.The capitalized costs during the first six months of 2022 include mainly the internal personnel costs and external consultants costs. These costs are only related to the development phase.Update of the accounting policy 2.11 related to the intangible assets (the following accounting policy will replace the accounting policy of the intangible assets in 2021 annual report).2.11. INTANGIBLE ASSETSIntangible assets acquired separatelyIntangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period  with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.Internally-generated intangible assets – research and development expenditureExpenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognized if  and only if  all of the following conditions have been demonstrated:The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or saleThe intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell itThe ability to use or sell the intangible assetHow the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefitsThe availability of adequate technical  financial  and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible assetThe ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its developmentWhere it is not possible to reliably distinguish between research or development costs  the costs are considered as being research and therefore  these costs do not qualify as an internally generated intangible asset.The amount initially recognized for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognized  development expenditure is recognized in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition  internally generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses  on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.Intangible assets acquired in a business combinationIntangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognized separately from goodwill are recognized initially at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). Subsequent to initial recognition  intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses  on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.Intangible assets with a finite useful life are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the duration of their economic useful life (3 years for software acquired for internal use and between 3 and 7 years for the other intangible assets) and reviewed for impairment testing each time there is a sign of impairment in the intangible asset.An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal  or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset  measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset  are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.NOTE 5.11: FINANCIAL LIABILITIES(EUR thousands) 2022 2021 Long term financial debts Bank loans 2 228 2 779 Long term lease liabilities 10 703 10 775 Amount due within 12 months (shown under current liabilities) Bank loans 1 100 1 095 Short term lease liabilities 2 739 2 633 Total financial debt (short and long-term) 16 770 17 282 The total financial debt is repayable as follows: - within one year 3 839 3 728 - after one year but no more than five 9 350 9 673 - more than five years 3 581 3 881On June 16  2020  a new loan of EUR 5.5 million has been negotiated with BNP Paribas Fortis in order to partially finance the acquisition of Axon. The repayment schedule foresees a first repayment of EUR 0.6 million in the last quarter of 2020 and annual installments of EUR 1.1 million between 2021 and 2024 with a final repayment of EUR 0.6 million in 2025 when the loan will mature. On June 2022  EVS paid EUR 0.6 million  interest included (the same was paid during the same period of 2021).During the first six months of 2022  lease liabilities variation includes a repayment of EUR 1.4 million (EUR 1.3 million for the same period in 2021)  excluding interest of EUR 0.3 million (EUR 0.2 million for the same period in 2021).On June 29  2020  a roll over credit line of EUR 5.0 million has been negotiated with Belfius bank in order to partially finance the acquisition of Axon. This amortizing credit line will end at the latest on 30/06/2025. As of this date  EVS has not used this credit facility.NOTE 5.12: OTHER LIABILITIESThe variation in other debts of – 1.2 million EUR during the first semester 2022 comes from the update of the principal assumptions used in determining pension obligations for the Group’s plans due to the high increase of the inflation during the period. No new actuarial valuation report as at 30 June 2022 was provided. It has been asked to our actuary AON to review the calculation as per December 31  2021 with those updated assumptions. The net liability has been updated and a full actuarial calculation will be performed at year-end.The main changes in the assumptions are the following:Salaries increase with the real inflation rate of 2021 (5 71%)LT inflation rate increases from 1 90% to 2 10%Salaries increase from 2 10% to 2 30% (caused by the inflation rate increase)Actuarial rate increases from 1 15% in January to 2 45% today.NOTE 5.13: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIESThe group enters into derivative transactions  principally forward and option currency contracts  with the purpose to secure its sales and purchases in foreign currencies against negative variations of these currencies. The group has transactional currency exposure arising from sales or purchases by operating entities in currencies other than the group’s functional currency. Foreign currency risk is described in note 5.12.1.The group’s main financial instruments  other than derivatives  comprise bank loans  finance leases and operating leases  cash and short-term deposits. The purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the group’s operations. The group has other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors  which arise directly from its operations. The group’s policy is  and has always been  that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. Credit risk is described in note 5.12.2.5.13.1 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKSince 2022  EVS systematically measures the group’s anticipated exposure to transactional exchange risk over six to eighteen months. In its current structure  the group’s exposure is mainly linked to the EUR/USD risk. The group invoices all clients in Euro  except in the United States where invoices are denominated in USD. Since the majority of operating expenses are denominated in Euro  the group has a “long” position in USD  i.e. all of the group’s activities generate globally a positive net cash flow in USD.On the basis of the forecasts and according to the market conditions  the group hedges a portion of the exchange rate risk on estimated net future flows  mainly through foreign exchange forward and option contracts. EVS does not apply hedge accounting according to IAS 39 for those transactions.Foreign exchange contracts are revalued at each closing at their market value. The generated exchange rate profit or loss is recorded in the “Other net financial income/(charges)” account in the consolidated income statement.The valuation techniques used are mainly based on spot rates  forward rates and interest rate curves.On June 30  2022  the group holds EUR/USD FX option contracts for total notional amount of USD 9 million with monthly maturities between July 2022 and June 2023 at an average EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.0435. The fair value of those financial instruments on June 30  2022  amounts to EUR -0.1 million.5.13.2 CREDIT RISKCredit exposure is controlled and reviewed regularly by the management.Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers  spread across many geographical areas. The evolution of the credit risk is monitored permanently. As of June 30  2022 and December 31  2021  it is assumed that the carrying amounts of those trade receivables are the most appropriate estimate to the fair value of those assets.The credit risk on financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.As of June 30  2022  the maximum amount the group could have to pay if these guarantees are called on is EUR 0.8 million (similar to EUR 0.8 million in December 2021).5.13.3 FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSThe estimated fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to their fair book value in the balance sheet considering (i) their short maturity or (ii) the fact that the interest rate applicable is in line with market conditions.NOTE 5.14: SUBSEQUENT EVENTSEVS announced on August 19th the signature of a large deal (more than USD 50 million) over a period of 10 years with a key customer in Nortth America.There were no other subsequent events that may have a material impact on the balance sheet or income statement of EVS.NOTE 5.15: RISK AND UNCERTAINTIESInvesting in the stock of EVS involves risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties relating to the remainder of the year 2022 are similar to the risks and uncertainties that have been identified by the management of the company and that are listed in the management report of the annual report (available at www.evs.com).In terms of new risks arising since the annual report of 2021  we highlight the potential impacts following the war in Ukraine. The war is not only impacting revenue streams in Russia and Ukraine  as EVS is carefully following up and respecting the sanctions in vigor. It is also potentially impacting the supply of components provided by that region.NOTE 5.16: RELATED PARTIES TRANSACTIONSDuring 1H 2022  the members of the executive management considered as related parties received a total amount of EUR 905.549 (646.765 for the same period in 1H2021). The increase is mainly explained by the additional members in 2022.Report of the statutory auditor on the accounting data presented in the semi-annual press release of EVS Broadcast Equipment SAWe have compared the accounting data presented in the semi-annual press release of EVS Broadcast Equipment SA with the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as at June 30  2022.
