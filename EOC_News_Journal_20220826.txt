In these circumstances we ensure we stay close to our clients by intensifying our contacts even further. Our existing and new clients maintained confidence in investing their wealth  as evidenced by strong total net inflows of €4.9 billion in assets under management. We’re seeing inflows both in the private as institutional segments.“Earlier in the year  we enhanced our financial and non-financial targets and capital strategy. We continue to focus on further profitable growth with full energy  both organic and inorganic  while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet. In addition  we’ve made good progress on implementing our sustainability strategy and developing our new inclusion & diversity policy.“I’d like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues for their commitment that enabled us to achieve this solid result in the first half of the year. I’m proud of their engagement and dedication to our clients – which they also appreciate greatly. I also want to thank our clients for their trust.”Client assets and assets under managementTotal client assets decreased in the first half year in the wake of the negative market performance to €118.5 billion (2021: €131.2 billion). Net assets under management (AuM) inflow was high  at €4.9 billion. Due to the negative market performance of €17.5 billion  overall AuM decreased to €99.6 billion (2021: €112.1 billion).Story continuesNet AuM inflows in the Private Clients remained robust  with €1.4 billion in the first half of the year. Net AuM inflows at Wholesale & Institutional Clients amounted to €3.5 billion. Client savings rose slightly to €11.9 billion (2021: €11.7 billion).Results in the first half of 2022Net profit was €48.2 million (H1 2021: €58.3 million). The decrease was mainly the result of a €9.9 million provision related to an interest-rate derivatives case  as reported in our Q1 trading update in May of this year.Commission income was up 15% to €201.3 million (H1 2021: €175.7 million)  partly as a result of the acquisition of a 70% stake in Belgian wealth manager Mercier Vanderlinden. Interest income fell to €69.7 million (H1 2021: €76.1 million)  mostly due to lower margins on mortgages and reduced revenues from early repayment fees.Operating expenses rose €19.2 million to €216.0 million (H1 2021: €196.8 million). This increase was partly due to the Mercier Vanderlinden acquisition (around €6 million)  as anticipated  and to higher staff costs.

Slowing fleet growth and new environmental regulations provide a strong offset to a potential short-term slowing of demand growth which combined with our charter coverage and superior fuel economics from our modern fleet will support continued healthy returns.“The Board of DirectorsGolden Ocean Group LimitedHamilton  BermudaAugust 25  2022Questions should be directed to:Ulrik Andersen: Chief Executive Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 53Peder Simonsen: Chief Financial Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 45The full report is available in the link below.Forward Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

(the “Company” or “Frontline”)  today reported unaudited results for the three and six months ended June 30  2022:HighlightsNet income of $47.1 million  or $0.23 per basic and diluted share for the second quarter of 2022.Adjusted net income of $42.5 million  or $0.21 per basic and diluted share for the second quarter of 2022.Declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share for the second quarter of 2022.Reported total operating revenues of $300.4 million for the second quarter of 2022.Reported spot TCEs for VLCCs  Suezmax tankers and LR2 tankers in the second quarter of 2022 were $16 400  $26 500 and $38 600 per day  respectively.For the third quarter of 2022  we estimate spot TCE on a load-to-discharge basis of $28 100 contracted for 73% of vessel days for VLCCs  $45 000 contracted for 73% of vessel days for Suezmax tankers and $46 200 contracted for 62% of vessel days for LR2 tankers.Announced the signing of a definitive combination agreement for a stock-for-stock combination between Frontline and Euronav NV (“Euronav”) (NYSE & Euronext: EURN) to create a leading global independent oil tanker operator which on a combined basis would own and operate 68 VLCCs and 56 Suezmax tankers  and 20 LR2/Aframax tankers.Took delivery of the VLCC newbuildings  Front Alta and Front Tweed  from Hyundai Heavy Industries (“HHI”) in April and June 2022  respectively.Entered into two senior secured term loan facilities in April and July 2022 for a total amount of up to $356.4 million at attractive terms to refinance two existing term loan facilities maturing in the first quarter of 2023.Lars H. Barstad  Chief Executive Officer of Frontline Management AS  commented:“Frontline’s fleet of LR2 tankers took center stage in the second quarter of 2022 during which period we achieved the highest quarterly TCE we have recorded on this vessel class. Sanctions on Russian oil and other products disrupted trade lanes for refined products globally  causing both refinery margins and freight rates to rise. Crude oil transport has also been affected  and Suezmax tankers have seen increased utilization and freight rates  throughout the second quarter.Story continuesFrontline is proud to show solid earnings in the second quarter and to be able to distribute dividends. We have over the last several quarters pointed to what we believe will be a cyclical up-turn for tankers  and this view has only been further cemented during the first half of the year. Supply and demand for oil and product transportation has gradually been tightening as the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic  and a pivotal point seems to have been found. With the lowest orderbook as a percentage of the fleet seen in decades  and oil supply and demand normalizing  we believe this bodes well for the years to come.Frontline announced on the 11th of July its intention for a stock-for-stock combination with Euronav  with full support from the respective Board of Directors  and we are moving diligently forward to what ultimately will create an unparalleled service offering to our customers and the largest listed tanker owner in the world.”Inger M. Klemp  Chief Financial Officer of Frontline Management AS  added:“In April and July 2022  we entered into two senior secured term loan facilities for a total amount of up to $356.4 million to refinance two existing term loan facilities with total balloon payments of $324.6 million maturing in the first quarter of 2023. The refinancing will reduce our borrowing costs and what we believe to be industry leading cash break even rates and maximize potential cash flow per share after debt service costs. We expect to refinance one further existing term loan facility with total balloon payments of $33.7 million due in the first quarter of 2023 prior to maturity.”Average daily time charter equivalents (""TCEs"")1($ per day) Spot TCE Spot TCE estimates % Covered Estimated average daily cash breakeven rates 2022 Q2 2022 Q1 2022 Q4 2021 2021 Q3 2022 2022 VLCC 16 000 16 400 15 700 16 500 15 300 28 100 73 % 24 900 SMAX 21 600 26 500 16 900 14 200 12 000 45 000 73 % 20 000 LR2 28 600 38 600 19 000 13 900 11 800 46 200 62 % 17 200The estimated average daily cash breakeven rates are the daily TCE rates our vessels must earn to cover operating expenses including dry docks  repayments of loans  interest on loans  bareboat hire  time charter hire and net general and administrative expenses for the remainder of the year.Spot estimates are provided on a load-to-discharge basis  whereby the Company recognizes revenues over time ratably from commencement of cargo loading until completion of discharge of cargo. The rates reported are for all contracted days up until the last contracted discharge of cargo for each vessel in the quarter. The actual rates to be earned in the third quarter of 2022 will depend on the number of additional days that we can contract  and more importantly the number of additional days that each vessel is laden. Therefore  a high number of ballast days at the end of the quarter will limit the amount of additional revenues to be booked on a load-to-discharge basis. Ballast days are days when a vessel is sailing without cargo and therefore  we are unable to recognize revenues on such days. Furthermore  when a vessel remains uncontracted at the end of the quarter  the Company will recognize certain costs during the uncontracted days up until the end of the period  whereas if a vessel is contracted  then certain costs can be deferred and recognized over the load-to-discharge period.The recognition of revenues on a load-to-discharge basis results in revenues being recognized over fewer days  but at a higher rate for those days. Over the life of a voyage there is no difference in the total revenues and costs to be recognized as compared to a discharge-to-discharge basis.When expressing TCE per day the Company uses the total available days  net of off hire days and not just the number of days the vessel is laden.The Board of DirectorsFrontline Ltd.Hamilton  BermudaAugust 24  2022Ola Lorentzon - Chairman and DirectorJohn Fredriksen - DirectorOle B.

In Sweden  we have continued to shoulder significant responsibility both in the care of COVID patients and in limiting the effects of the pandemic on individuals and society. For example  approximately 600 000 doses of COVID vaccine were administered to patients  in our Swedish facilities in particular to our nursing home residents. In addition  we continued to manage almost 20% of all COVID-related hospital care in the Stockholm area.Growth was strong in the 3 Nordic countries  particularly in Medicine  Surgery and Obstetrics (MSO) hospitalisations  up 14% on the previous year  excluding Germany. Consultations in primary care centres in Sweden  including teleconsultations  were up 16%. In France  full MSO inpatient hospital admissions fell by 4.1%  while day patient admissions rose by 3%. The same trend affects our Follow-up Care and Rehabilitation (FCR) activity with a 1.1% drop in inpatients and a 27.6% increase in day patients.Total investments for the period amounted to €217 million compared with €220 million last year. More than 40% of investments correspond to growth and digital investments. These investments are necessary to uphold our operational and medical excellence. The number of primary care centres has increased by 28% from 130 to 167 in 2022. We have opened our first 5 primary care centres in France and invested in 2 new surgical robots. We have also established capital and operational partnerships with the Resilience and NewCard start-ups. In January 2022  we launched Ramsay Services  a digital platform.Reported annual turnover is €4 301 million  up 6.9%. Adjusted for changes in the scope of consolidation and at constant exchange rates  turnover for the year ending June 30th 2022 is up with very solid organic turnover growth of 6.0%.Reported EBITDA increased by 2.3% to €658.4 million (prior year €643.8 million) with a margin of 15.3% (prior year 16.0%). EBITDA development was positively impacted by activity in Nordic countries  which compensated for increases in inflation and personnel costs. The revenue guarantee system put in place by the French government generated €99 million in income for the year ending June 30th 2022  compared with an income of €103 million for the year ending June 30th 2021.The group share of net profit is €118.4 million  benefiting from the increase in activity and improved results  representing 2.8% of turnover.Net financial debt at the end of June 30th 2022 amounts to €3 710 million  including €2 118 million of IFRS 16 liabilities.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“In 2022  for the first time  Ramsay Santé exceeded the threshold of 10 million patients treated in Europe in its various activities  within and outside its facilities  as well as in digital. During the year  the Group mobilised more than ever for the care of Covid patients  and reinforced its ability to treat all patients for all pathologies. In France  our commitment is reflected in the fact that 10% of patients admitted are beneficiaries of Universal Medical Coverage (CMU). The Group has also taken an innovative approach to human resources in France with the signing of an ambitious agreement on quality of life in the workplace. Financial results remain solid  with growth of 6.9% and a slightly lower EBITDA margin (15.3% under IFRS16 in 2022 vs. 16.0% in 2021). These results are due to sustained organic growth as well as acquisitions in Sweden  Norway and Denmark. This demonstrates the relevance of our strategy of consolidating our position as an integrated European health care operator and orchestrating coordinated care pathways  allowing us to guarantee quality and accessibility for all.”These provisional accounts were presented to the Board of Directors at its meeting on August 25th 2022. The audit process is well underway. The final financial statements for the year ending June 30th 2022 will be available to the public when the company's Universal Registration Document is published in late October 2022.Summary of resultsIn € million From 1 July 2021 to30 June 2022 Variation From 1 July 2020 to30 June 2021 Turnover 4 301.0 +6.9% 4 022.6 EBITDA (IFRS 16) 658.4 +2.3% 643.8 Underlying Operating Profit 281.1 +3.3% 272.0 As a % of turnover +6.5% -0.3 point +6.8% Operating Profit 291.2 +16.2% 250.6 Group share of Net Profit 118.4 65.0 Earnings per share (in €) 1.07 0.59Breakdown of revenue by operating segmentIn € million From 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022 From 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021 Variation Île-de-France 1 057.9 1 000.8 +5.7% Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes 579.6 561.7 +3.2% Hauts de France 393.4 380.6 +3.4% Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur 169.1 161.4 +4.8% Bourgogne Franche Comté 133.7 107.4 +24.5% Other regions 669.8 655.3 +2.2% Nordic countries 1 297.4 1 155.4 +12.3% Reported Turnover 4 301.0 4 022.6 +6.9% Of which:- Turnover on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates4 215.13 977.4+6.0% - Impact of acquisitions and disposals and exchange rate movements 85.9 45.2Note : The table above details the contributions of the various operating segments to the Group's consolidated turnover.Significant events of the financial year:Health crisis due to the COVID PandemicThe financial year ending June 30th 2022 was impacted by the ongoing health crisis due to the COVID pandemic in all countries where the Group operates.FranceIn France  private hospitals have maintained their action plans to combat the COVID epidemic and their level of investment in conjunction with and in support of public hospitals  in accordance with the national health plan.Ramsay Santé upheld its commitment to treating COVID patients with more than 10 000 COVID patients treated in France  including 4 500 in critical care. Like other hospital operators  Ramsay Santé has continued to be supported by measures implemented by the government. The main measures during the period concern:The revenue guaranteeGrants compensating for additional costs related to COVIDThe revenue guarantee covered the entire financial year for Medicine  Surgery and Obstetrics (MSO) and Follow-up Care and Rehabilitation (FCR). It was only in place for the first half of the year (July-December 2021) for Mental Health activities  given the reform of the financing of Mental Health activities (MH) towards an allocation model in force since January 1st 2022.The amount of the funding guarantee recognised by the Group for the year ending June 30th 2022 amounts to €99 million (€103 million for the previous year) and is reported in the income statement under “Other operating income”.In addition to the revenue guarantee  the government also adjusted the levels of grants usually paid to health care institutions in order to compensate for the additional costs related to the COVID crisis that would not otherwise be covered. These subsidies are reported in the income statement under “Other operating income” for €89.8 million (€72.3 million for the previous financial year). Given the time lag between when costs are incurred by facilities and notification by the Regional Health Authorities of the corresponding subsidies  a significant portion of the subsidies reported during the period corresponds to financing for additional costs incurred during the previous financial year  a situation similar to that of the same period last year. Of the total amount of funding recognised in the period  €27.5 million (€14.5 million in the previous year) corresponds to amounts received for the funding of additional costs incurred in the previous year.Outside FranceThe Group's facilities in Scandinavia played an active role in the care of COVID patients as well as in screening and vaccinating the population  backing up public institutions and in close collaboration with the supervisory authorities. Nevertheless  activity was impacted by the health crisis during the period  in particular for inpatient care in Sweden but also in Denmark and Norway where the authorities suspended admissions at the height of the spread of the virus from December 2021 to February 2022. Despite these periods of disruption  the overall activity level and profits were strong as activity was boosted during the periods when normal activity resumed.In Sweden  Sankt Göran Hospital and the Group-operated geriatric hospitals in Stockholm played a key role in managing the outbreak with over 100 beds dedicated to COVID patients. Sankt Göran  together with the Stockholm geriatric hospitals  treated almost 20% of all COVID patients in the Stockholm area throughout the pandemic. The Group contributed significantly to the screening and vaccination effort in Sweden and to screening in Norway.Whilst no support measures were implemented in Norway and Denmark  our facilities in Sweden received grants to cover additional operating costs. In total  the amount of aid received by our institutions in Sweden was €32.2 million in the period  compared to €61.5 million in the previous period.Scope of consolidationRamsay Santé finalised the acquisition of 10 entities in Scandinavia during the year. These acquisitions are complementary to the current business and expand the scope of the Group's services as well as its geographic footprint. In total  these acquisitions represented a net investment of €288.6 million.Furthermore  Ramsay Santé completed the acquisition of GHP Specialty Care AB (“GHP”) in May 2022  for an enterprise value of €238 million. In the 12 months ending December 2021  GHP's turnover amounted to €137 million. GHP employs 765 FTEs. This acquisition contributed €29 million in turnover and €1.9 million in EBITDA to Ramsay Santé's accounts in the year ended 30 June 2022.Indicative offer received by Ramsay Health Care LimitedOn April 20th 2022  Ramsay Générale de Santé noted the announcement by Ramsay Health Care Limited  its Australian reference shareholder listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange  confirming that it had received a non-binding and conditional indicative offer from a consortium of financial investors led by KKR to acquire 100% of the share capital of Ramsay Health Care Limited.On August 25th 2022  Ramsay Health Care Limited issued a further announcement stating that the consortium was continuing to consider the transaction and had confirmed the terms of its indicative offer  which remains subject to certain conditions  including the completion of due diligence of Ramsay Health Care Limited and access to non-public information relating to Ramsay Générale de Santé  and that the Board of Ramsay Générale de Santé had requested the usual information required in such circumstances from the consortium in order to assess the request for access to this non-public information.The full press release issued by Ramsay Health Care Limited can be viewed on the Ramsay Health Care Limited website (www.ramsayhealth.com).Comments on the annual accountsActivity and turnover:In the financial year ending June 30th 2022  Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated turnover of €4 301.0 million  compared with €4 022.6 million for the period from July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021  an increase of 6.9%. Please note that the financing guarantee scheme in the Group's accounts has no impact on reported turnover as it is reported in the income statement under “Other operating income”.On a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates  the Group’s turnover increased by 6.0% with one additional working day.Changes in the scope of consolidation are due to divestment of the German business and two clinics in France in the previous financial year  combined with acquisitions in the Nordic region over the last 12 months.For the financial year ending June 30th 2022  the overall activity of Ramsay Santé’s French entities continued to be impacted by the consequences of the COVID pandemic. The main effects were related to the cancellation of certain scheduled medical and surgical activities during the peaks of the pandemic but also from limiting the number of patients per room. In total  the number of patient admissions increased by 3.2% compared with last year. This increase is mainly related to comparatively lower volumes in 2020-2021  as the negative impact of the COVID pandemic on patients' willingness to access care recedes in our follow-up care  rehabilitation and mental health activities.The variation by business line breaks down as follows:+0.3% in medicine  surgery and obstetrics+23.8% in follow-up care and rehabilitation+11 4% in mental healthAs part of its public service missions  the Group recorded a 16.2% increase in the number of emergency room visits during the past year  with approximately 755 000 visits to our facilities in France.Organic turnover growth in Nordic countries for the year ending June 30th 2022 was +7.4% compared with last year. Organic turnover growth was boosted by both investments and new contracts  additional services related to COVID screening and vaccination  and continued positive turnover growth in the underlying business. Scandinavian business also benefited from the latest acquisitions  which contributed €66 million of additional turnover during the financial year  net of the impact of disposals (German business sold at the end of 2020).Resul ts :EBITDA reached €658.4 million for the financial year ending June 30th 2022  up 2.3% on a reported basis. The Group's EBITDA at 30 June 2022 includes 99.1 million related to the revenue guarantee system described in the paragraph “Significant events of the financial year” above  as well as cost compensations for COVID surcharges for France and Sweden. EBITDA was also positively impacted by the organic growth of the business  particularly in the Nordic region. On a comparable basis  at constant scope and exchange rates  EBITDA increased by 1.3% during the year.The EBITDA margin as a percentage of turnover was 15.3%  compared with 16.0% for the same period last year on a reported basis. On a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rates  the EBITDA margin dropped slightly from 16.2% to 15.4%.Underlying operating profit amounted to €281.1 million between July 1st 2021 and June 30th 2022 (or 6.5% of turnover)  up 3.3% on the previous year.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net income of €10.2 million for the period ending June 30th 2022  consisting mainly of gains on the disposal of vacant real estate assets  divestments of tangible and intangible assets  and release of provisions related to the disposal of Capio's business in Germany. From July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021  other non-current income and expenses represented a net expense of €21.4 million.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €123.5 million for the year ending June 30th 2022  compared with €123.2 million the previous year. This includes interest on Senior debt and  in accordance with IFRS 16  the Group recorded a financial interest expense of €72.3 million related to lease debt (€71.1 million the previous year).The Group’s share of net income for the period from July 1st 2021 to June 30th 2022 amounted to €118.4 million  or 2.8% of turnover  compared with €65.0 million for the period from July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021.Financing :Net financial debt on June 30th 2022 was €3 709.9 million compared with €3 230.5 million on June 30th 2021. Net debt includes €1 763.6 million in non-current borrowings and €35.4 million in current borrowings  offset by €132 5 million in cash and cash equivalents.The application of IFRS 16 to operating leases contributed €2 118.3 million to net financial debt at June 30th  of which €1 922.3 million was non-current lease debt and €196.0 million was current lease debt.During the first half of this fiscal year  Ramsay Santé carried out a Euro Private Placement bond issue for a total financing amount of €100 million on two tranches maturing in 2027 and 2028.The Group complies with all commitments relating to the financing documentation in place. The application of IFRS 16 has no effect on the methods used to calculate the financial aggregates referred to in these debt agreements.About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

9214,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/evs-reports-first-half-2022-043000258.html,EVS reports first half 2022 results,Publication on August 25  2022  before market openingRegulated and inside information – Press release first half 2022 resultsEVS Broadcast Equipment S.A...,Publication on August 25  2022  before market openingRegulated and inside information – Press release first half 2022 resultsEVS Broadcast Equipment S.A.: Euronext Brussels (EVS.BR)  Bloomberg (EVS BB)  Reuters (EVSB.BR)EVS reports first half 2022 resultsLiège  Belgium  August 25th  2022Growth mode continues resulting in an upgraded guidanceThe results of the 1st half of 2022 are fully supporting the growth trajectory that EVS is on. The fundamentals are all strong: a record-high order intake  a historical revenue  accompanied by a strong operating profit For the sake of clarity  this press release does not include the 10-year contract worth more than USD 50 million  that was signed in August 2022 and announced to the market on August 19th  2022.H1 Financial performanceRecord order intake of EUR 88.7 millionRevenue in the first six months of the year  amounts to EUR 67 7 million  + 9% YoY. BER revenue is of EUR 5 7 million  growing EUR 1 2 million in comparison to 1H21. Revenue excluding BER is at EUR 62.0 million growing EUR 4 7 million compared to the same period last year.Gross margin is growing with EUR 3.3 million compared to 1H21  though the overall gross margin percentage is eroding with 1 2Pts. This erosion is primarily the consequence of investments in additional resources to ensure quality support for our growing topline.Net profit amounts to EUR 15 5 million  leading to a diluted earnings per share of EUR 1 15 (equal to 1H21 results)OutlookThe secured revenue is at EUR 126 4 million  growing 29% compared to 1H21Based on the secured revenue at end of June 2022  the revenue guidance for the full year is upgraded from EUR 125-140 million to EUR 140-150 million. This upgrade assumes a normal final production cycle of the year  without any impact of shortage in components nor any important changes linked to the pricing of components.The order book evolution can be summarized as following: BER order book is for EUR 3 8 million  fully bookable in 2022 Order book excluding BER is for EUR 87 1 million  growing 70% in comparison to 1H21  of which EUR 32 2 million is for 2023 and beyond. This long-term order book is growing with 39%.The gross margin percentage is expected to be negatively impacted by the investments done in our operations and support organization (comparable impact to 1H22 results). The rising prices of products and inflation are well monitored and controlled through a permanent evaluation of our sales prices.The OPEX growth for the full year is adjusted to a range of 12-15%  as a consequence of inflation  growth investments and post-covid spending patterns.The 1st half results currently support our dividend guidance for the year 2022  meaning a dividend of EUR 1 1 for the full year 2022 and an exceptional dividend of EUR 0 5  leading to a total expected dividend of EUR 1 6 for the year. As a reminder  below is the guidance on dividend that EVS issued for the years 2022-2024* **.Story continuesIn € per share per fiscal year 2022 2023 2024 Base dividend 1 10 1 10 1 10 Exceptional additional dividend 0 50 0 00 0 00 Total dividend 1 60 1 10 1 10*subject to market conditions**subject to the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting of ShareholdersKey figuresEUR millions  except earnings per share expressed in EUR Reviewed 1H22 1H21 1H22/1H21 Revenue 67 7 61 8 5 9 Gross profit 45 8 42 6 3 2 Gross margin % 67 7% 68.9% -1 2% Operating profit – EBIT 15 7 15 4 0 3 Operating margin – EBIT % 23 3% 24.9% -1 6% Net profit (Group share) 15 5 15 6 -0 1 Basic earnings per share (Group share) 1 15 1 16 -0 01CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO comments:“I am very grateful to our customers  our team members and our channel partners for further supporting and enabling our growth mode. With H1 revenue and order intake indicators at their highest level ever  I am proud to say that our PLAYForward strategy is producing the expected results. Based on those strong H1 results  I am now more optimistic for our full year 2022 results. While we are still facing important challenges in our electronic component supply chain  we are now sufficiently confident to increase our earlier revenue guidance for 2022 of EUR 125 million to EUR 140 million to a new guidance of EUR 140 million to EUR 150 million.Our 2 main Market Pillars (Live Service Providers and Live Audience Business) continue to show strong revenue generation. Our third Market Pillar (Big Event Rental) will also generate the expected ‘big event year’ results in 2022 thanks to the major winter sporting events that took place early this year  and thanks to the major sporting events that will take place in the Middle East by the end of this year.In line with our PLAYForward strategy  we have been further increasing our sales  engineering and customer service team size in order to realize our growth ambitions. Our hiring efforts during H1 further accelerated and we have been able to hire over 70 new colleagues in various offices around the world  representing a 10+% increase of our overall team size. Our employer branding and reputation clearly helped us achieve such outstanding results.The high and global inflation has clearly a negative impact on our BOM (bill of material) costs and on our remuneration costs. We have started compensating for the impact of those increased costs by applying price increases. We expect that we will need to continue adapting our pricing to the raising inflation.Overall  I continue to feel cautiously optimistic about our future. While economic market conditions remain very challenging with high inflation  component shortages and with the war in Ukraine  I feel that our customers increasingly appreciate the reliability  performance and innovative edge of our solutions and services. This represents a sound basis for the future.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“Our results for this first semester of 2022 are very comforting and demonstrate that we are a company in growth mode. All our topline indicators support our ambition. Obviously  growth can only happen with accompanying investments: investments primarily in resources in sales  operations & support and R&D. The investments in R&D have been well controlled and modeled  allowing us to validate them as intangible assets and allowing EVS to depreciate the investment in time based on the validation of future benefits of the development of new features. Our balance sheet also remains very healthy with a very low debt level and a sound cash position. Based on these strong results  we are able to maintain our dividend policy defined earlier this year.”EVS Market Dynamics and customer winsDuring the first semester  EVS delivered successfully major winter events  serving the host broadcaster  as well as hundreds of right holders  including NBC. As every year  EVS also supported its customers (facility companies and broadcasters) delivering the NFL Superbowl: one of the most watched events on earth.The modernization projects continue to be on the agenda of our LAB customers. EVS plays a key role in the transformation and modernization of premium broadcast and media centres (representing our LAB customers) with a series of existing and new projects relying on its VIA platform and new IP-based Media Infrastructure. In this last category of solutions  EVS announced at NAB a major multi-million deal with Fox Sports US  selecting Media Infrastructure Strada flexible routing solution  as an additional proof point of the traction for the new EVS solutions and the success of the Axon integration within EVS.We observe a decrease of revenue for LAB customers in H1 compared to the same period in 2021. Depending on the nature of the deal  some LAB projects can take more than 2 years for full revenue recognition. The revenue recognition is based on the content of the deliveries and on the work in progress. This thus depends on the pace and structure of the transformation project. There will thus be variations  even across several years  based on the mix of LAB active projects. The effect has been amplified since EVS has been successful winning very significant deals in US in late 2019 and 2020. These projects are now being finalized or entering new phases with less revenues. Based on these key market references  EVS will now initiate the transformation in other regions  resulting in more normal size projects.Live Service Providers players continue to upgrade their portfolio of replay services to leverage the advantages of the combination of XT-VIA and LSM-VIA. With the end of support of previous generation of XT servers (XT3) nearing  we observe an acceleration of the upgrades for the LSPs both in terms of revenues and orders. As observed for previous generations  not all customers will convert before the end of support date. It also depends on the contract they sign with their customers and/or their investment cycles.LiveCeption Pure solution continues to be deployed in smaller OB Vans and venues thanks to our Channel Partners. The new MediaInfra Strada evolutive routing solution also made its entry within IP OB Vans in North America.New versions of solutions have been announced during H1 2022:Neuron supports a new application  called Neuron Protect  which fulfils the increasing demand for more secured solutions: higher level of redundancy on top of IP networks. It proves that EVS considers security as a top priority and provides new solution components to face the challenges faced by the industry. The new “Compress” version of Neuron offers new low-bitrate codec  JPEG-XS compression required for video transport in remote operations.With the addition of the new version of IP Core to Cerebrum  additional routing capabilities are offered making use of SDN to ensure fully secured orchestration of any IP-based video signals.The new version of “MediaCeption signature” offers a comprehensive set of content management applications combining advanced software and Web-based modules for even richer workflows from ingest to playout. With the RTBF deal announced in February 2022  EVS co-develops a future Flexible Control Room solution build on Cerebrum: the solution - embracing production automation - will support the broadcasters in their transformation to produce more efficiently with dynamic scaling during a production  while proposing an open solution optimized in terms of user experience for operators of all generations.LSM-VIA continues to evolve and integrate more and more features to ease and automate the tasks of EVS operators  offering them an environment to personalize their way of working.On the front of electronic components availability  EVS manages to keep the balance between frictions in the supply chain and deliveries to the customer through increased  yet reliable delivery times. Until now  all orders have been shipped on time thanks to the huge efforts and the magic talents of several teams  adapting to the different combinations of components while refusing to compromise on quality.During first semester  EVS has also been successfully strengthening the team through external hiring in order to support the expected growth  mainly in R&D and Customer Services teams to further develop the solutions and in the US to better support key customers and channel partners in the region.NAB tradeshow was appreciated by all the industry with the opportunity to meet customers again “in real life”  engaging into fruitful conversations  and demonstrating for the first time in live situation for some customers the numerous new solutions and features proposed by EVS. The return to NAB was also special since celebrated through the NAB 2022 Best Of Show award for Neuron Protect which is the first NAB award for a Media Infrastructure product inside EVS.At the beginning of this year  EVS also enhanced and extended the leadership team with two new members  Alex Redfern as CTO and Xavier Orri as EVP Operations & Projects  to sustain the growth path engaged by the company. Two US colleagues - James Stellpflug as SVP Customer Success NALA and David Pinkel as SVP Sales North America - have also been promoted to further strengthen and drive the EVS teams in the Americas.Revenue in 1H22In 1H22  EVS revenue reached EUR 67.7 million: an increase of EUR 5.9 million or 9.5% compared to 1H21.At constant currency  revenue increased by 5.7% YoY.Revenue – EUR millions 1H22 1H21 1H22/1H21 Total reported 67 7 61 8 9.5% Total at constant currency 65 3 61 8 5.7% Total at constant currency and excluding big event rentals 59 6 56 6 5.3%Currency fluctuations primarily impact EVS revenues by the EUR/USD conversion  which can have a significant impact on our results even if EUR/USD fluctuations also impact the cost of our US operations and partially our cost of goods sold.In the first half of the year  (excl. Big Event Rentals) LSP represented 59% (47% in 1H21) of the revenue  LAB 41% (53% in 1H21). Comparisons to 2021 are impacted by post-COVID investments from our clients. Both LSP and LAB evolve in line with our expectations in 2022 and demonstrate the long-term growth patterns laid out in our PLAYForward strategic plan.Geographically  revenues (excl. big event rentals) are distributed in 1H22 as follows:Europe  Middle East and Africa (EMEA): EUR 28 7 million (EUR 32.1 million in 1H21) demonstrating a minor decline compared to 1H21  though benefiting from a strong order intake in 1H21 to secure further growth potential.Americas (NALA): EUR 25.6 million (EUR 15.8 million in 1H21)  underpinning the strong performance in that region since multiple quarters.Asia & Pacific (APAC): EUR 7.7 million (EUR 9.4 million in 1H21)  despite the slowdown in the region following COVID implications  demonstrating only a minor decline.First half 2022 resultsConsolidated gross margin was 67.7% for 1H22  compared to 68.9% in 1H21 explained by important investments in the operations & support department to ensure we continue to deliver quality support all over the world  in line with our growth patterns. There is a minor impact on the gross profit margin  given the increased importance of MediaInfra in the overall portfolio. However  the impact of cost price increases and inflation have been well modeled by the corresponding sales price increases and do not negatively affect our gross profit margin. EVS continues to keep the balance in this area.Operating expenses increased by 8% YoY explained by post-COVID spending patterns. There have also been significant investments in additional team members to fuel our future growth  but at the same time  EVS was able to launch an IAS38 evaluation for some R&D investments  so that the overall increase in team member costs is very limited.The 1H22 EBIT margin was 23.3%  compared to 24.9% in 1H21: the EBIT margin is dropping primarily following investments in the past 12 months to support our growth pattern.Income taxes are at EUR 1.9 million  compared to EUR 0.01 million last year: in 2021 EVS could still benefit from various tax latencies linked to prior years. The group net profit amounted to EUR 15 5 million in 1H22  compared to EUR 15.6 million in 1H21. Basic net profit per share amounted to EUR 1 15 in 1H22  a similar performance as in 1H21 (EUR 1 16).Team membersAt the end of June 2022  EVS employed 594 team members (FTE). This is an increase by 52 team members compared to the end of June 2021. This increase in team members reflects our continued investments in the growth of EVS. We expect only marginal increases in the remainder of the year 2022.Balance sheet and cash flow statementEVS continues to have a strong balance sheet with net cash position of EUR 44.2 million with low debt level (of which EUR 13.4 million related to IFRS 16) resulting in a total equity representing 74.3% of the total balance sheet as of the end of June 2022.Other intangible assets include mainly six months internal development costs capitalized during 2022 according to IAS 38 (Intangible assets).Lands and building mainly include the headquarters in Liège as well as the right of use for the offices abroad (IFRS16). Six months depreciations on intangible assets  lands and buildings (including the right of use assets) and other tangible assets reached EUR 3.4 million. Liabilities include EUR 16.8 million of financial debt (including long term and short-term portion of it)  mainly related to the lease liabilities for EUR 13.4 million and borrowings for EUR 3.3 million.Inventories amount to EUR 30.2 million and include around EUR 3.4 million value of Axon equipment.In the liabilities  long-term provisions include the provision for technical warranty on EVS products for labor and parts. The other amounts payables include mainly customer advances received and accruals (accrued charges and deferred income)The net cash from operating activities amounts to EUR 9.4 million end of 2Q22 compared to EUR 13.3 million end of 2Q21. On June 30  2022  cash and cash equivalents total EUR 60.9 million. This is a decrease compared to June 2021 mainly explained by the increase of the net cash used in investing activities mainly due to the investments in tangible and intangible assets (specifically in the internal development of intangible assets) together with the increase of the net cash used in financing activities mainly due to the higher amount of final dividends distributed during 2022.At the end of June 2022  there were 14 327 024 EVS shares outstanding  of which 908 014 were owned by the company. At the same date  138 832 warrants were outstanding with an average exercise price of EUR 28.90 and a maturity of December 2022 together with 158 250 warrants with an average exercise price of EUR 13.69 and a maturity of October 2026 and 158 600 warrants with an average exercise price of EUR 18.21 and a maturity of June 2027.Corporate updateDuring last General Assembly on May 17th  the shareholders have acknowledged the resignation of Philippe Mercelis and have appointed two new directors  Frédéric Vincent and Marco Miserez  both for a period of 4 years. The Board of Directors is currently composed of seven directors:Johan Deschuyffeleer   independent director & President (representing The House of Value BVBA);Michel Counson   managing director;Martin De Prycker   independent director (representing InnoConsult BVBA);Chantal De Vrieze   independent director (representing 7 Capital SRL);Frédéric Vincent   independent director;Marco Miserez   independent director; andAnne Cambier  independent director (representing Accompany You SRL)2H 2022 outlookThe secured revenue on June 30  2022 amounts to EUR 116.9 million  which is +36.9% growth compared to EUR 85.4 million of last year at the same date (excluding Big Events Rentals).In addition to secured revenue  EVS already won EUR 32.2 million of orders to be invoiced in 2023 and beyond (no revenue for Big Event Rentals has been secured for 2023 and beyond)  which represents an increase of 39.4% compared to EUR 23.1 million at the same date last year.Thanks to this continued strong order book evolution the revenue guidance for the full year 2022 is being increased from initial guidance of EUR 125 million and EUR 140 million to a new guidance of EUR 140 million and EUR 150 million.The gross margin percentage is expected to be negatively impacted following the investments done in the past 12 months to hire additional team members. We expect the impact caused by potential shortage and delay of component and raw material as well as the rising prices to be balanced off by the price increases modeled.Operational expenses continue to be closely managed and EVS expects an increase between 12-15% in the full year of 2022.GlossaryTerm Definition Secured revenue Revenue already recognized as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in the fiscal year Order book <date> Revenues planned to be recognized after the <date> based on current orders.

The accounting framework and standards adopted by the European Commission can be accessed through the following link on the website: http://ec.europa.eu/finance/company-reporting/index_en.htm. The condensed interim financial statements of the Group for the 6 month-period ending June 30  2022  were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on August 19  2022.This interim report only provides an explanation of events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position and reporting since the last annual reporting period and should therefore be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ending on December 31  2021. The interim condensed financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.NOTE 5.2.1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODSThese condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting  as issued by the IASB  and as adopted by the EU. The accounting policies and methods adopted for the preparation of the Company's IFRS consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the 2021 consolidated financial statements. The Company’s IFRS accounting policies and methods are available in the 2021 annual report on www.evs.com  except for the accounting policy on intangible assets which include the capitalization of development cost for the first time (see note 5.10) as well as the new  amended or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC Interpretations that have been in effect since January 1  2022  which are listed hereunder:Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases: COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1April 2021).Amendments to IAS 16 Property  Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022).Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions  Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts — Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022).Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: Reference to the Conceptual Framework (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022).Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018–2020 (applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022.The adoption of these new  amended or revised pronouncements did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.NOTE 5.2.2: JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATESThe impact of the war in Ukraine on our activitiesGiven the nature and location of its operations and the fact that EVS does not currently have activities in Russia nor in Ukraine or with Russian companies  The Company does not foresee a direct impact of the Ukrainian conflict on its business.The impact current market volatility and macroeconomic developmentsThe impacts of the current market volatility and macroeconomic developments were taken into account by the Company to assess potential effects on EVS’s financial performance and the valuation of its assets and liabilities. In particular  key assumptions used in the calculation of the post employments obligations have been reviewed to ensure a proper valuation as per 30 June 2022.NOTE 5.3: SEGMENT REPORTINGFrom an operational point of view  the company is vertically integrated with the majority of its staff located in the headquarters in Belgium  including the R&D  production  marketing and administration departments. This explains why the majority of the investments and costs are located at the level of the Belgian parent company. Resources securing the customer facing interactions  like sales  operations and support profiles  are primarily hired within the respective regions. The foreign subsidiaries are primarily sales and representative offices. The Chief Operating Decision Maker  being the Executive Committee  reviews the operating results  operating plans  and makes resource allocation decisions on a company-wide basis. Revenue related to products of the same nature (digital broadcast production equipment) are realized by commercial polyvalent teams. The company’s internal reporting is the reflection of the above-mentioned operational organization and is characterized by the strong integration of the activities of the company.By consequence  the company is composed of one segment according to the IFRS 8 definition  and the consolidated income statement of the group reflects this unique segment. All long-term assets are located in the parent company EVS Broadcast Equipment SA in Belgium.The company provides only one type of solution: solutions based on tapeless workflows with a consistent modular architecture. This is the product of EVS. There are no other significant classes of business  either singularly or in aggregate. Indeed  identical modules can meet the needs of different markets. Our customers themselves are often multi-markets. Providing information for each module is therefore not relevant for EVS.At the geographical level  our activities are divided into the following regions: Asia-Pacific (“APAC”)  Europe  Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)  and America (“NALA”). This division follows the organization of the commercial and support services within the group  which operate worldwide. A fourth region is dedicated to the worldwide events (“big event rentals”).The company provides additional information with a presentation of the revenue by market pillar: “Live Service provider”  “Live Audience Business” and “Big Event Rentals” for rental contracts relating to the big sporting events.Finally  sales are presented by nature: systems and services.5.3.1.

INFORMATION ON IMPORTANT CLIENTSOver the last 6 months  no external client of the company represented more than 10% of the revenue (this was same for the same period in 2021).NOTE 5.4: EQUITY SECURITIESThe number of treasury shares has changed as follows during the period  together with the outstanding warrants:2022 2021 Number of own shares at January 1 925 140 928 207 Acquisition of own shares on the market - - Sale of own shares on the market - - Allocation to Employees Profit Sharing Plans -17 126 -3 067 Sale related to Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) and other transactions - - Number of own shares at June 30 908 014 925 140 Outstanding warrants at June 30 455 682 325 832In 1H22  the Group did not repurchase own shares on the stock market. No shares were used to satisfy the exercise of warrants by employees.The Ordinary General Meeting of shareholders of May 17  2022  approved the allocation of 17 126 shares to EVS employees (grant of 56 shares to each staff member in proportion to their effective or assimilated time of occupation in 2021) as a reward for their contribution to the group successes.The expense recorded in the consolidated income statement amounts to 329 kEUR for the six-month period ended on June 30 2022.NOTE 5.5: DIVIDENDSThe Ordinary General Meeting of May 17  2022  approved the payment of a total gross dividend of EUR 1.50 per share for the year 2021.(EUR thousands) # Coupon Declaration date 2022 2021 - Final dividend for 2020(EUR 0.50 per share less treasury shares) 30 May 2021 - 6 699 - Interim dividend for 2021(EUR 0.50 per share less treasury shares) 31 Nov.2021 - 6 701 - Final dividend for 2021(EUR 1.00 per share less treasury shares) 32 May 2022 13 402 Total paid dividends 13 402 13 400EVS implemented the dividend policy announced by the end of 2021 distributing an interim dividend for 2021 in November 2021 of EUR 0.50 per share and a final dividend of EUR 1.00 per share for 2021. The total dividend of EUR 1.50 per share includes a EUR 0.50 exceptional dividend to honor the past commitments on dividend payout. A new dividend guidance has been issued early 2022 and is as following:In € per share per fiscal year 2022 2023 2024 Base dividend 1 10 1 10 1 10 Exceptional additional dividend 0 50 0 00 0 00 Total dividend 1 60 1 10 1 10NOTE 5.6: OTHER NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (EXPENSES)(EUR thousands) 1H22 1H21 - Fair value variation of financial instruments -169 -7 - Exchange results 1 955 268 - Other financial results 153 61 Other net financial income / (expenses) 1 939 322The functional currency of EVS Broadcast Equipment SA as well as all subsidiaries is the Euro  except for the EVS Inc. subsidiary  whose functional currency is the US dollar and Axon Digital Design LTD. subsidiary whose functional currency is the GBP (up till March of 2022  at which point in time the functional currency also became the Euro). The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements of EVS Group is the Euro. For more information on exchange rates  see also the note 5.9. The increase of the exchange result income is explained by the appreciation of USD and GBP comparing to Euro.The estimated fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to their fair book values in the balance sheet.Since 2022  EVS systematically measures the group’s anticipated exposure to transactional exchange risk  mainly relating to the EUR/USD risk. Given the group has a “long” position in USD and based on revenue forecasts  EVS hedges future USD net in-flows by forward or option foreign exchange contracts. The change in the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is recorded directly to the income statement (other financial results) since the Group does not apply hedge accounting on these transactions.The valuation techniques used are mainly based on spot rates  forward rates and interest rate curves.On June 30  2022  the group holds EUR/USD FX option contracts for a total notional amount of USD 9 million with monthly maturities between July 2022 and June 2023 at an average EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.0435. The fair value of those financial instruments on June 30  2022  amounts to EUR -0.1 million.NOTE 5.7: INCOME TAX EXPENSE(EUR thousands) 1H22 1H21 - Current tax (expense) / income -722 494 - Deferred tax (expense) / income -1.142 -438 Income tax expense -1 864 56Income taxes expense increased during the first half of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021 primarily following important tax latencies impacting the 2021 tax base.The effective tax rate for the period ended on June 30  2022  is 10.8% (-0.4% for same period in 2021).The evolution of effective tax rate is mainly explained by:The increase of the current tax mainly due to rise in the taxable profits. It must be noted that in the first half of 2021  a tax relief of EUR 0.7 million was received; andThe increase of the deferred tax expenses due to the high profit before tax impacting the recoverable tax loss for EUR 1.2 million together with the reversal of other temporary differences.NOTE 5.8: HEADCOUNT(in full time equivalents) At June 30 2022 594 2021 542 Variation +52NOTE 5.9: EXCHANGE RATESThe main exchange rate that influences the consolidated financial accounts is USD/EUR and GBP/EUR which has been taken into account as follows:Exchange rate USD/EUR Average 1H At June 30 2022 1.0937 1.0387 2021 1.2049 1.1884 Variation -9.23% -12.60%Exchange rate GBP/EUR Average 1H At June 30 2022 0.8420 0.8582 2021 0.8682 0.8580 Variation -3.02% 0.02%NOTE 5.10: INTANGIBLE ASSETSDuring 2022  intangible assets increased by EUR 3.9 million as a net movement of a capitalization of internal development costs of EUR 4.5 million less six months depreciations of EUR 0.6 million.At the beginning of the period  the Group identified internal development projects  that for the first time of EVS Broadcast Equipment’s history fulfilled all the conditions to be capitalized according to IAS 38 Intangible assets. This ability arises after the implementation of extensive business cases  where R&D together with the solutions and sales departments perform an end-to-end exercise whereby objectives  costs  market analysis and return are clearly identified.These internal development projects consist of software that will be commercialized at the end of the development period (expected return on investment is scheduled for 2024).Management performed an assessment related to the internal development projects and concluded that:It is technically feasible to complete the development of these software so that it will be available for the sale;The Group has the intention to complete the development of the software in order to sell it;The Group is able to sell the software once the development will end;The future economic benefits from the sales of the software have been identified and are in excess of the budgeted development costs;The Group secured the necessary financial resources together with the internal (and external) technical resources to complete the development of the software in order to sell it; andThe new established processes allow to the Group to measure reliably the expenditures attributable to the development of the software and therefore  attributable to the cost of the intangible assets.The capitalized costs during the first six months of 2022 include mainly the internal personnel costs and external consultants costs. These costs are only related to the development phase.Update of the accounting policy 2.11 related to the intangible assets (the following accounting policy will replace the accounting policy of the intangible assets in 2021 annual report).2.11. INTANGIBLE ASSETSIntangible assets acquired separatelyIntangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period  with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.Internally-generated intangible assets – research and development expenditureExpenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognized if  and only if  all of the following conditions have been demonstrated:The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or saleThe intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell itThe ability to use or sell the intangible assetHow the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefitsThe availability of adequate technical  financial  and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible assetThe ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its developmentWhere it is not possible to reliably distinguish between research or development costs  the costs are considered as being research and therefore  these costs do not qualify as an internally generated intangible asset.The amount initially recognized for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognized  development expenditure is recognized in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition  internally generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses  on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.Intangible assets acquired in a business combinationIntangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognized separately from goodwill are recognized initially at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). Subsequent to initial recognition  intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses  on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.Intangible assets with a finite useful life are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the duration of their economic useful life (3 years for software acquired for internal use and between 3 and 7 years for the other intangible assets) and reviewed for impairment testing each time there is a sign of impairment in the intangible asset.An intangible asset is derecognized on disposal  or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset  measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset  are recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.NOTE 5.11: FINANCIAL LIABILITIES(EUR thousands) 2022 2021 Long term financial debts Bank loans 2 228 2 779 Long term lease liabilities 10 703 10 775 Amount due within 12 months (shown under current liabilities) Bank loans 1 100 1 095 Short term lease liabilities 2 739 2 633 Total financial debt (short and long-term) 16 770 17 282 The total financial debt is repayable as follows: - within one year 3 839 3 728 - after one year but no more than five 9 350 9 673 - more than five years 3 581 3 881On June 16  2020  a new loan of EUR 5.5 million has been negotiated with BNP Paribas Fortis in order to partially finance the acquisition of Axon. The repayment schedule foresees a first repayment of EUR 0.6 million in the last quarter of 2020 and annual installments of EUR 1.1 million between 2021 and 2024 with a final repayment of EUR 0.6 million in 2025 when the loan will mature. On June 2022  EVS paid EUR 0.6 million  interest included (the same was paid during the same period of 2021).During the first six months of 2022  lease liabilities variation includes a repayment of EUR 1.4 million (EUR 1.3 million for the same period in 2021)  excluding interest of EUR 0.3 million (EUR 0.2 million for the same period in 2021).On June 29  2020  a roll over credit line of EUR 5.0 million has been negotiated with Belfius bank in order to partially finance the acquisition of Axon. This amortizing credit line will end at the latest on 30/06/2025. As of this date  EVS has not used this credit facility.NOTE 5.12: OTHER LIABILITIESThe variation in other debts of – 1.2 million EUR during the first semester 2022 comes from the update of the principal assumptions used in determining pension obligations for the Group’s plans due to the high increase of the inflation during the period. No new actuarial valuation report as at 30 June 2022 was provided. It has been asked to our actuary AON to review the calculation as per December 31  2021 with those updated assumptions. The net liability has been updated and a full actuarial calculation will be performed at year-end.The main changes in the assumptions are the following:Salaries increase with the real inflation rate of 2021 (5 71%)LT inflation rate increases from 1 90% to 2 10%Salaries increase from 2 10% to 2 30% (caused by the inflation rate increase)Actuarial rate increases from 1 15% in January to 2 45% today.NOTE 5.13: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIESThe group enters into derivative transactions  principally forward and option currency contracts  with the purpose to secure its sales and purchases in foreign currencies against negative variations of these currencies. The group has transactional currency exposure arising from sales or purchases by operating entities in currencies other than the group’s functional currency. Foreign currency risk is described in note 5.12.1.The group’s main financial instruments  other than derivatives  comprise bank loans  finance leases and operating leases  cash and short-term deposits. The purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the group’s operations. The group has other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors  which arise directly from its operations. The group’s policy is  and has always been  that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. Credit risk is described in note 5.12.2.5.13.1 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKSince 2022  EVS systematically measures the group’s anticipated exposure to transactional exchange risk over six to eighteen months. In its current structure  the group’s exposure is mainly linked to the EUR/USD risk. The group invoices all clients in Euro  except in the United States where invoices are denominated in USD. Since the majority of operating expenses are denominated in Euro  the group has a “long” position in USD  i.e. all of the group’s activities generate globally a positive net cash flow in USD.On the basis of the forecasts and according to the market conditions  the group hedges a portion of the exchange rate risk on estimated net future flows  mainly through foreign exchange forward and option contracts. EVS does not apply hedge accounting according to IAS 39 for those transactions.Foreign exchange contracts are revalued at each closing at their market value. The generated exchange rate profit or loss is recorded in the “Other net financial income/(charges)” account in the consolidated income statement.The valuation techniques used are mainly based on spot rates  forward rates and interest rate curves.On June 30  2022  the group holds EUR/USD FX option contracts for total notional amount of USD 9 million with monthly maturities between July 2022 and June 2023 at an average EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.0435. The fair value of those financial instruments on June 30  2022  amounts to EUR -0.1 million.5.13.2 CREDIT RISKCredit exposure is controlled and reviewed regularly by the management.Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers  spread across many geographical areas. The evolution of the credit risk is monitored permanently. As of June 30  2022 and December 31  2021  it is assumed that the carrying amounts of those trade receivables are the most appropriate estimate to the fair value of those assets.The credit risk on financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.As of June 30  2022  the maximum amount the group could have to pay if these guarantees are called on is EUR 0.8 million (similar to EUR 0.8 million in December 2021).5.13.3 FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSThe estimated fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to their fair book value in the balance sheet considering (i) their short maturity or (ii) the fact that the interest rate applicable is in line with market conditions.NOTE 5.14: SUBSEQUENT EVENTSEVS announced on August 19th the signature of a large deal (more than USD 50 million) over a period of 10 years with a key customer in Nortth America.There were no other subsequent events that may have a material impact on the balance sheet or income statement of EVS.NOTE 5.15: RISK AND UNCERTAINTIESInvesting in the stock of EVS involves risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties relating to the remainder of the year 2022 are similar to the risks and uncertainties that have been identified by the management of the company and that are listed in the management report of the annual report (available at www.evs.com).In terms of new risks arising since the annual report of 2021  we highlight the potential impacts following the war in Ukraine. The war is not only impacting revenue streams in Russia and Ukraine  as EVS is carefully following up and respecting the sanctions in vigor. It is also potentially impacting the supply of components provided by that region.NOTE 5.16: RELATED PARTIES TRANSACTIONSDuring 1H 2022  the members of the executive management considered as related parties received a total amount of EUR 905.549 (646.765 for the same period in 1H2021). The increase is mainly explained by the additional members in 2022.Report of the statutory auditor on the accounting data presented in the semi-annual press release of EVS Broadcast Equipment SAWe have compared the accounting data presented in the semi-annual press release of EVS Broadcast Equipment SA with the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as at June 30  2022.

As part of the transaction  the Offeror also entered into master lease agreements relating to the towers and also agreed to  subject to the achievement of certain milestones  build and sell additional towers to Phoenix (all of these transactions  together the ""Towers Sales"") over the next several years.The Towers Sales have had several transformational impacts on the Group's business and the Proposed Amendments are intended to give the Group optimal flexibility to operate its business following such sale.As part of the Towers Sales and the resulting leaseback of the towers necessary to operate its business  the Group will incur (and expects to continue to incur) a substantial amount of lease liabilities  which following the implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases)  would be considered Indebtedness for the purposes of the Indentures and the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage and related calculations thereunder.Likewise  the Group has already contracted to make sales of additional towers that are currently under construction  which will result in the Group receiving more proceeds from towers sales in the future.Purchase PriceTender Offer for 2024 NotesNoteholders of the 2024 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions by the Early Participation Deadline will  to the extent their 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase and are eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment  receive consideration of US$995.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2024 Notes Total Consideration"")  which comprises consideration of US$952.50 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered (the ""2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration"")  plus consideration of US$30.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2024 Notes Early Tender Payment"")  plus the 2024 Notes Consent Payment. The 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment are subject to proration and therefore  any Noteholders that tender 2024 Notes and such tendered 2024 Notes are prorated  will be eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Total Consideration only for the portion of such tendered 2024 Notes that are accepted for purchase. The 2024 Notes Consent Payment is not subject to any proration  and therefore  Noteholders who timely tender their 2024 Notes (which will constitute a deemed consent to the Proposed Amendments)  will be eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment regardless of whether or not such tendered 2024 Notes are prorated. Noteholders of the 2024 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions after the Early Participation Deadline  but prior to the Expiration Deadline  will  to the extent their 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase  receive the 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration only  without the 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment. In all cases  Noteholders whose 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest on such Notes.Tender Offer for 2028 NotesNoteholders of the 2028 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions by the Early Participation Deadline will  to the extent their 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase and are eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment  receive consideration of US$832.50 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2028 Notes Total Consideration"")  which comprises consideration of US$785.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered (the ""2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration"")  plus consideration of US$30.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2028 Notes Early Tender Payment"")  plus the 2028 Notes Consent Payment. The 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment are subject to proration and therefore  any Noteholders that tender 2028 Notes and such tendered 2028 Notes are prorated  will be eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Total Consideration only for the portion of such tendered 2028 Notes that are accepted for purchase. The 2028 Notes Consent Payment is not subject to any proration  and therefore  Noteholders who timely tender their 2028 Notes (which will constitute a deemed consent to the Proposed Amendments)  will be eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment regardless of whether or not such tendered 2028 Notes are prorated. Noteholders of the 2028 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions after the Early Participation Deadline  but prior to the Expiration Deadline  will  to the extent their 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase  receive the 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration only  without the 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment. In all cases  Noteholders whose 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest on such Notes.In the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum  the 2024 Notes Total Consideration and the 2028 Notes Total Consideration are each referred to separately as the ""Total Tender Consideration""  the 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and the 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration are each referred to separately as an ""Tender Offer Consideration"" and the 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment and the 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment are each referred to separately as an ""Early Tender Payment"".Consent SolicitationsBefore the Early Participation Deadline  (i) holders of 2024 Notes that validly deliver their consent to the Proposed Amendments  either via a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction  and are eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment will be eligible to receive consideration in cash of US$12.50 per US$1 000 principal amount of 2024 Notes (the ""2024 Notes Consent Payment"") and (ii) holders of 2028 Notes that validly deliver their consent to the Proposed Amendments  either via a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction and are eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment  will be eligible to receive consideration in cash of US$17.50 per US$1 000 principal amount of 2028 Notes (the ""2028 Notes Consent Payment""). In the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum  the 2024 Notes Consent Payment and the 2028 Notes Consent Payment are each referred to separately as the ""Consent Payment"". The payment of the relevant Consent Payment is irrespective of whether such Notes are subject to proration pursuant to the Tender Offers  provided the applicable Relevant Conditions are satisfied and such Supplemental Indenture becomes effective. A valid tender of Notes under a Tender Instruction prior to the Early Participation Deadline will constitute a consent  and a Noteholder which validly tenders their Notes will receive the Total Tender Consideration (assuming they validly submit Tender Instructions before the Early Participation Deadline and are eligible to receive the Consent Payment) subject to proration of the relevant Tender Offer Consideration and Early Tender Payment. For the avoidance of doubt  there will be no proration applied to the consent solicitation and the payment of the Consent Payment and no Consent Payment will be made to any Noteholder who tenders their Notes after the Early Participation Deadline  unless they have submitted a valid Consent Only Instruction prior to such date.Noteholders may also submit a Consent Only Instruction and no Tender Instruction  in which case they will receive only the Consent Payment  provided the Consent Only Instruction is received prior to the Early Participation Deadline  the applicable Relevant Conditions are satisfied and the relevant Supplemental Indenture becomes effective  but not the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Tender Consideration. If the Early Participation Deadline is extended for either or both of the series of Notes  the Issuer reserves the right to execute and deliver the Supplemental Indentures at any time the relevant Required Consents are obtained and the relevant Supplemental Indenture will be effective upon execution but the Proposed Amendments will only become operative once the Consent Payment is made with respect to the relevant series of Notes and the Relevant Conditions are satisfied or waived. In such a scenario  the Consent Payment will only be paid to those Holders who validly consent before the receipt of the relevant Required Consents  as applicable.A Noteholder which takes no action to either submit a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction will receive no consideration with respect to the Offers  however  subject to the Relevant Conditions being satisfied for the applicable series  such Noteholder's Notes will be subject to the Proposed Amendments once the relevant Consent Payment is paid to the Noteholders  and the respective Supplemental Indenture becomes operative  of the applicable series which did deliver a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction.Indicative Timetable for the OffersDate and time (all times are New York time  unless otherwise stated) Event August 26  2022.........................................

As part of the transaction  the Offeror also entered into master lease agreements relating to the towers and also agreed to  subject to the achievement of certain milestones  build and sell additional towers to Phoenix (all of these transactions  together the ""Towers Sales"") over the next several years.The Towers Sales have had several transformational impacts on the Group's business and the Proposed Amendments are intended to give the Group optimal flexibility to operate its business following such sale.As part of the Towers Sales and the resulting leaseback of the towers necessary to operate its business  the Group will incur (and expects to continue to incur) a substantial amount of lease liabilities  which following the implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases)  would be considered Indebtedness for the purposes of the Indentures and the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage and related calculations thereunder.Likewise  the Group has already contracted to make sales of additional towers that are currently under construction  which will result in the Group receiving more proceeds from towers sales in the future.Purchase PriceTender Offer for 2024 NotesNoteholders of the 2024 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions by the Early Participation Deadline will  to the extent their 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase and are eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment  receive consideration of US$995.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2024 Notes Total Consideration"")  which comprises consideration of US$952.50 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered (the ""2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration"")  plus consideration of US$30.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2024 Notes Early Tender Payment"")  plus the 2024 Notes Consent Payment. The 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment are subject to proration and therefore  any Noteholders that tender 2024 Notes and such tendered 2024 Notes are prorated  will be eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Total Consideration only for the portion of such tendered 2024 Notes that are accepted for purchase. The 2024 Notes Consent Payment is not subject to any proration  and therefore  Noteholders who timely tender their 2024 Notes (which will constitute a deemed consent to the Proposed Amendments)  will be eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment regardless of whether or not such tendered 2024 Notes are prorated. Noteholders of the 2024 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions after the Early Participation Deadline  but prior to the Expiration Deadline  will  to the extent their 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase  receive the 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration only  without the 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment. In all cases  Noteholders whose 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest on such Notes.Tender Offer for 2028 NotesNoteholders of the 2028 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions by the Early Participation Deadline will  to the extent their 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase and are eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment  receive consideration of US$832.50 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2028 Notes Total Consideration"")  which comprises consideration of US$785.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered (the ""2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration"")  plus consideration of US$30.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2028 Notes Early Tender Payment"")  plus the 2028 Notes Consent Payment. The 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment are subject to proration and therefore  any Noteholders that tender 2028 Notes and such tendered 2028 Notes are prorated  will be eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Total Consideration only for the portion of such tendered 2028 Notes that are accepted for purchase. The 2028 Notes Consent Payment is not subject to any proration  and therefore  Noteholders who timely tender their 2028 Notes (which will constitute a deemed consent to the Proposed Amendments)  will be eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment regardless of whether or not such tendered 2028 Notes are prorated. Noteholders of the 2028 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions after the Early Participation Deadline  but prior to the Expiration Deadline  will  to the extent their 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase  receive the 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration only  without the 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment. In all cases  Noteholders whose 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest on such Notes.In the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum  the 2024 Notes Total Consideration and the 2028 Notes Total Consideration are each referred to separately as the ""Total Tender Consideration""  the 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and the 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration are each referred to separately as an ""Tender Offer Consideration"" and the 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment and the 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment are each referred to separately as an ""Early Tender Payment"".Consent SolicitationsBefore the Early Participation Deadline  (i) holders of 2024 Notes that validly deliver their consent to the Proposed Amendments  either via a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction  and are eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment will be eligible to receive consideration in cash of US$12.50 per US$1 000 principal amount of 2024 Notes (the ""2024 Notes Consent Payment"") and (ii) holders of 2028 Notes that validly deliver their consent to the Proposed Amendments  either via a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction and are eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment  will be eligible to receive consideration in cash of US$17.50 per US$1 000 principal amount of 2028 Notes (the ""2028 Notes Consent Payment""). In the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum  the 2024 Notes Consent Payment and the 2028 Notes Consent Payment are each referred to separately as the ""Consent Payment"". The payment of the relevant Consent Payment is irrespective of whether such Notes are subject to proration pursuant to the Tender Offers  provided the applicable Relevant Conditions are satisfied and such Supplemental Indenture becomes effective. A valid tender of Notes under a Tender Instruction prior to the Early Participation Deadline will constitute a consent  and a Noteholder which validly tenders their Notes will receive the Total Tender Consideration (assuming they validly submit Tender Instructions before the Early Participation Deadline and are eligible to receive the Consent Payment) subject to proration of the relevant Tender Offer Consideration and Early Tender Payment. For the avoidance of doubt  there will be no proration applied to the consent solicitation and the payment of the Consent Payment and no Consent Payment will be made to any Noteholder who tenders their Notes after the Early Participation Deadline  unless they have submitted a valid Consent Only Instruction prior to such date.Noteholders may also submit a Consent Only Instruction and no Tender Instruction  in which case they will receive only the Consent Payment  provided the Consent Only Instruction is received prior to the Early Participation Deadline  the applicable Relevant Conditions are satisfied and the relevant Supplemental Indenture becomes effective  but not the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Tender Consideration. If the Early Participation Deadline is extended for either or both of the series of Notes  the Issuer reserves the right to execute and deliver the Supplemental Indentures at any time the relevant Required Consents are obtained and the relevant Supplemental Indenture will be effective upon execution but the Proposed Amendments will only become operative once the Consent Payment is made with respect to the relevant series of Notes and the Relevant Conditions are satisfied or waived. In such a scenario  the Consent Payment will only be paid to those Holders who validly consent before the receipt of the relevant Required Consents  as applicable.A Noteholder which takes no action to either submit a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction will receive no consideration with respect to the Offers  however  subject to the Relevant Conditions being satisfied for the applicable series  such Noteholder's Notes will be subject to the Proposed Amendments once the relevant Consent Payment is paid to the Noteholders  and the respective Supplemental Indenture becomes operative  of the applicable series which did deliver a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction.Indicative Timetable for the OffersDate and time (all times are New York time  unless otherwise stated) Event August 26  2022.........................................

Luxembourg B-119.899 (the ""Company"") Important Notice to Shareholders of Xtrackers Adoption of the International Central Securities Depositary Model of Settlement 26 August 2022 The board of directors of the Company (the ""Board of Directors"") hereby informs the shareholders of the Company (the ""Shareholders"") that it has resolved to centralise the settlement of trading in Shares of all Sub-Funds of the Company in an International Central Securities Depositary (""ICSD"") structure ","LONDON  August 26  2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--XtrackersInvestment Company with Variable CapitalRegistered office: 49  avenue J.F. Kennedy  L-1855 Luxembourg R.C.S. Luxembourg B-119.899(the ""Company"")Important Notice to Shareholders of XtrackersAdoption of the International Central Securities Depositary Model of Settlement26 August 2022The board of directors of the Company (the ""Board of Directors"") hereby informs the shareholders of the Company (the ""Shareholders"") that it has resolved to centralise the settlement of trading in Shares of all Sub-Funds of the Company in an International Central Securities Depositary (""ICSD"") structure  as detailed below (the ""ICSD Settlement Model"") with effect from 3 October 2022 (the ""Effective Date"").Capitalised terms used in this notice shall have the same meaning ascribed to them in the latest version of the prospectus of the Company (the ""Prospectus"")  unless the context otherwise requires.Current Settlement ModelCurrently  the existing settlement model (the ""Current Settlement Model"") of the Sub-Funds involves settlement on multiple local central securities depositaries (""CSDs"") reflecting where the Sub-Funds are listed and traded. Each exchange typically operates its own CSD for settlement functions. Trading and settling Shares in the Sub-Funds under this structure involves having to move the Shares between various CSDs  which is complex  costly and inefficient. Examples of such local CSDs include (but are not limited to) the CREST system  Euroclear Netherlands  Clearstream Banking AG  Frankfurt/Main  SIS Sega Intersettle AG and Monte Titoli SPA. The Current Settlement Model of the Sub-Funds will no longer be operational as of close of business on 30 September 2022.The ICSD Settlement ModelThe key difference between the Current Settlement Model and the ICSD Settlement Model is that the ICSD Settlement Model provides centralised settlement in Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (""Euroclear"") and Clearstream Banking S.A.  Luxembourg (""Clearstream"" and  together with Euroclear  the ""International Central Securities Depositaries"") for shares traded across multiple stock exchanges.Story continuesBenefits of the ICSD Settlement ModelThere are number of anticipated benefits to the Company in transitioning to the ICSD Settlement Model  as follows:enhanced liquidity for investors and less liquidity fragmentation;improved settlement performance  due to inventory in each Sub-Fund being pooled in the ICSD structure  which offers a longer window of time for settlement of transactions and minimises the need to manually move the relevant shares between multiple local CSDs;enhancement of settlement process efficiency through longer operating hours of the ICSD  thus increasing the time in which trades can match and settle  and by minimising the operational complexity in the Current Settlement Model of having to arrange for Shares to be re-aligned between CSDs  which is complex  costly and time-consuming;reduction in inventory requirements and lower capital charges and overheads for market makers and broker dealers  which could ultimately support reduced trading costs for end investors;improved foreign exchange functionality on dividend payments; andassisting in the creation of a more efficient securities lending market for Shares.Accordingly  the Directors are of the view that the ICSD Settlement Model provides a more streamlined centralised settlement structure  which they expect will result in improved liquidity and spreads for investors and reduce risk in the settlement process relating to the Company and its Sub-Funds.Impact on Registered ShareholdersFor the Company  the main difference between the Current Settlement Model and the ICSD Settlement Model relates to the shareholders of record registered on the register of shareholders of the Company (the ""Shareholders Register"").Under the Current Settlement Model  only certain CSDs (e.g.  Clearstream Banking AG  Frankfurt/Main) or their nominees are registered as Shareholders in the Shareholders’ Registers. As a result  the Shareholders’ Register of the Company consists of a mix of nominees of Authorised Participants who maintain accounts with CSDs  as well as CSDs themselves or their nominees. Under the ICSD Settlement Model  all investors will be represented through a common depositary (the ""Common Depositary"") and the sole registered holder of all Shares in each Sub-Fund will be the common depositary nominee (the ""Common Depositary Nominee""). The Common Depositary has been appointed by the ICSD and its holding will represent the aggregate holdings of the investors through the ICSD.Under the Current Settlement Model those investors who do not have accounts with  and are not CSDs  hold their interests in Shares in the Sub-Funds through nominees and other intermediaries  which means that they are beneficial owners who do not hold legal title in the Shares. Investors who are not currently registered as Shareholders on the Shareholders’ Register and have a beneficial entitlement to Shares will continue to hold a beneficial interest in the same number of Shares in the same Sub-Fund(s) as they currently hold under the Current Settlement Model upon the adoption of the ICSD Settlement Model.Under the ICSD Settlement Model  Authorised Participants will continue to generate and instruct trades directly with the Company (as is the case under the Current Settlement Model).Impact on End InvestorsUnder the ICSD Settlement Model  the Common Depositary Nominee  together with the Common Depositary and the ICSDs  will be subject to contractual obligations to pass the beneficial interest and all associated rights of the registered Shareholder (i.e. the Common Depositary Nominee) in all Shares in each of the Sub-Funds to participants in the ICSD (who may be themselves underlying investors in the Sub-Fund(s) or CSDs  brokers or intermediaries holding directly or indirectly on behalf of underlying investors in the Sub-Fund(s).The Common Depositary Nominee will be subject to a contractual obligation to relay any notices of the Company (or any of its Sub-Funds) (such as shareholders meetings) and associated documentation issued by the Company to the Common Depositary  which will further be obliged to pass on such notices and documentation to the ICSDs. The applicable ICSD will in turn relay notices and associated documentation received from the Common Depositary to its participants in accordance with its rules and procedures. Similarly  each ICSD will be contractually bound to collate and transfer all votes received from its participants to the Common Depositary and the Common Depositary will in turn be contractually bound to collate and transfer all votes received from the applicable ICSDs to the Common Depositary Nominee  which will be contractually obliged to vote in accordance with such instructions.The Common Depositary Nominee  the Common Depositary and the ICSDs will also be contractually bound to pass any distributions received from the Company downstream to participants and/or their relevant nominees. In particular  upon instruction of the Common Depositary Nominee  any redemption proceeds and any dividends declared that are payable by the Company to the Common Depositary Nominee as Shareholder may be paid by the Company or its authorised agent directly to the applicable ICSD. If the Common Depositary Nominee receives any redemption proceeds or dividends from the Company or its authorised agent  the Common Depositary Nominee will arrange for such payments to be passed on to the relevant ICSD. The relevant ICSD will in turn pay any redemption proceeds and dividends received to the relevant participants of the ICSD.Under the ICSD Settlement Model  investors who are not participants in the ICSD will need to use a broker  nominee  custodian bank or other intermediary which is  directly or indirectly  a participant in the ICSD to trade and settle Shares  similar to the way investors under the Current Settlement Model use a broker or other intermediary which is a participant in the CSD for the market in which the investor intends to trade and settle. Investors are advised to consult with the entity relevant to them for further information in this regard.Adoption of the ICSD Settlement Model will not change the manner in which investments in the Sub-Funds are managed or any rights of investors other than those described herein.General InformationShareholders who subscribe for Shares in a Sub-Fund on the primary market and who do not agree with the Changes  are entitled to redeem their Shares in the relevant Sub-Fund in accordance with the Prospectus. Such redemptions shall be free of any Redemption Charge from the date of this notice until 5.00 p.m. (Luxembourg time) on 27 September 2022. Please note that the Company does not charge any redemption fee for the sale of Shares in the secondary market. Orders to sell Shares through a stock exchange can be placed via an authorised intermediary or stockbroker. Shareholders should note that orders in the secondary market may incur costs over which the Company has no control and to which the above exemption on redemption charges does not apply.Copies of the revised Prospectus (including detailed disclosures regarding settlement under the ICSD Settlement Model  together with a summary of the interaction between the Common Depositary and underlying investors) reflecting the Changes will be made available on the website of the Company (www.Xtrackers.com) on or around the Effective Date  and copies thereof may be obtained on request free of charge at the registered office of the Company or at the offices of foreign representatives  once available.Shareholders who have any queries or to whom any of the above is not clear should seek advice from their stockbroker  bank manager  legal advisor  accountant or other independent financial advisor.In particular  Shareholders should consult their own professional advisors as to the specific tax implications under the laws of the countries of their nationality  residence  domicile or incorporation and as to any cost or fee implications that may be applicable to them as a result of the Company’s implementation of the ICSD Settlement Model.Further information in relation to the implementation of the ICSD Settlement Model may be obtained from the legal entities mentioned under Contact information below  the offices of foreign representatives or by sending an email to Xtrackers@dws.com.Neither the contents of the Company’s website nor the contents of any other website accessible from hyperlinks on the Company’s website is incorporated into  or forms part of  this announcement.XtrackersThe Board of DirectorsContact informationXtrackers49  avenue J.F.

The consortium made a request for access to this information on 28 July 2022 and the Board of Directors of Ramsay Générale de Santé responded on 5 August 2022 by requesting that the consortium provide information customary in such circumstances in order to be able to assess this request.On 26 August 2022  Ramsay Health Care Limited issued a statement indicating that it had received a further letter from the consortium informing it that the consortium was withdrawing its initial indicative offer to acquire 100% of the share capital of Ramsay Health Care Limited for cash and was no longer seeking access to Ramsay Health's non-public information.The announcements state that the consortium has proposed an alternative structure to Ramsay Health Care Limited under which Ramsay Health Care Limited shareholders would receive  for their first 5 000 shares  a cash price of A$88 per share and  in excess of the first 5 000 shares  a cash price of A$78.20 and approximately 0.22 of a Ramsay Générale de Santé share  for each Ramsay Health Care Limited share.Ramsay Health Care Limited’s announcements also state that the alternative proposal was considered by the Ramsay Health Care Limited Board to be meaningfully inferior to the initial indicative offer and that the Board determined not to engage further in relation to the alternative proposal. Ramsay Health Care Limited has indicated that it remains open to discussions with the consortium to determine whether it can submit an improved binding proposal that is capable of recommendation by its board.Story continuesThe full press releases issued by Ramsay Health Care Limited can be viewed on the Ramsay Health Care Limited website (www.ramsayhealth.com).About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

Fred Shaw  Hamilton Lane's global head of operations  said the firm has been helping investors to understand that crypto and blockchain are not the same thing.""Blockchain is the underlying technology but (crypto) is only one use of it.""A Partners Group spokesperson said the firm was seeing the understanding of the difference between tokenisation and cryptocurrencies ""slowly improving"".ASSOCIATION RISKSCrypto woes caused a US private markets manager client to hold off on launching a tokenised fund earlier this year because of the reputational risk  but it now plans to go ahead soon  said Carlos Domingo  CEO of investment platform Securitize  which launched tokenised funds tracking two S&P indices late last year.Because of the risks associated with illiquid assets  many funds investing in such assets are only open to professional investors  requiring minimum investments of US$10 million.By using the blockchain technology  fund managers can offer fractions of these assets  for a fraction of the initial outlay.The tokens will enable secondary markets to develop  providing more liquidity  industry specialists say  though the Financial Stability Board has warned that this still leaves retail investors exposed to the underlying illiquid assets  which are difficult to exit quickly if prices fall.The technology can also cut costs for both asset managers and investors  the specialists say.Fund administrators and stock exchanges are trying to improve the market infrastructure to make it easier to offer tokenised funds.Euronext owns a stake in Luxembourg tokenisation platform Tokeny  and Singapore Exchange has a stake in ADDX  where Partners Group and Hamilton Lane launched their tokenised offerings.London Stock Exchange is working with fund technology firm FundAdminChain on a pilot for several tokenised funds.Hurdles remain. Arun Srivastava  partner at law firm Paul Hastings  said regulators may continue to remain unwilling to allow retail investors to invest in illiquid assets  whether tokenised or not.""To say 'we've got this blockchain product' sounds good and sounds like you're keeping up with the crypto world  but how is it any different or any better?""",neutral,0.05,0.59,0.36,mixed,0.1,0.09,0.81,True,English,"['Asset managers', 'fund tokens', 'crypto turmoil', 'US private markets manager client', 'two S&P indices', 'Mainstream asset manager abrdn', 'private markets investment firms', 'A Partners Group spokesperson', 'former investment manager', '15 per cent drop', 'aggressive rate hikes', 'major central banks', 'Financial Stability Board', 'Luxembourg tokenisation platform', 'London Stock Exchange', 'several tokenised funds', 'underlying illiquid assets', 'fund technology firm', 'investment platform', 'private equity', 'secondary markets', 'asset managers', 'stock exchanges', 'Singapore Exchange', 'underlying technology', 'fund managers', 'Fund administrators', 'tokenised offerings', 'wild moves', 'recent months', 'bite-sized units', 'small savers', 'one day', 'ultra-high inflation', 'other issues', 'Hamilton Lane', 'past year', 'rival Schroders', 'security offering', 'higher returns', 'Magnus Burkl', 'Oliver Wyman', 'close link', 'Fred Shaw', 'global head', 'same thing', 'one use', 'reputational risk', 'Carlos Domingo', 'minimum investments', 'initial outlay', 'market infrastructure', 'Arun Srivastava', 'Paul Hastings', 'high-risk assets', 'law firm', 'many funds', 'fund fractions', 'blockchain product', 'small investors', 'potential investors', 'professional investors', 'retail investors', 'crypto lender', 'ASSOCIATION RISKS', 'Crypto woes', 'industry specialists', 'crypto world', 'blockchain technology', 'cryptocurrencies', 'tokens', 'Bitcoin', 'space', 'minutes', 'June', 'sector', 'Celsius', 'tens', 'millions', 'dollars', 'products', 'source', 'matter', 'right', 'proponents', 'ambition', 'clients', 'leader', 'principal', 'consultants', 'operations', 'understanding', 'difference', 'CEO', 'Securitize', 'liquidity', 'prices', 'costs', 'Euronext', 'stake', 'Tokeny', 'ADDX', 'FundAdminChain', 'pilot', 'Hurdles', 'regulators']",2022-08-26,2022-08-26,channelnewsasia.com

However  the listed company segment is predicted to account for the highest share in 2031  owing to the growing popularity of the product in listed firms. Nonetheless  the start-ups segment is expected to register the highest CAGR of 16.2% during the forecast period. The segmental growth can be credited to an increase in the number of start-ups contributing majorly to the global equity management software market size.North American to retain domination over 2022-2031By Region  North America contributed notably toward the global equity management software market share in 2021  and is projected to continue its dominance during the forecast period. The region accounted for more than one-third of the global market share in 2021. The growth of the market in the region over the forecast timespan can be credited to growing product penetration in large  small  and medium-sized firms in countries such as the U.S. and Canada. However  the Asia-Pacific region is anticipated to record the fastest CAGR of 16.5% from 2022 to 2031. The growth of the regional market over the forecast period can be attributed to the large-scale use of end-to-end equity management software by giant firms as it offers high security and privacy.Enquire for Customization with Detailed Analysis of COVID-19 Impact in Report @ https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-for-customization/17017?reqfor=covidKey Benefits for StakeholdersThis report provides a quantitative analysis of the market segments  current trends  estimations  and dynamics of the equity management software market share from 2021 to 2031 to identify the prevailing equity management software market opportunity.The market research is offered along with information related to key drivers  restraints  and opportunities.Porter's five forces analysis highlights the potency of buyers and suppliers to enable stakeholders make profit-oriented business decisions and strengthen their supplier-buyer network.In-depth analysis of the equity management software market segmentation assists to determine the prevailing market opportunities.Major countries in each region are mapped according to their revenue contribution to the global equity management software market forecast.The report includes the analysis of the regional as well as global equity management software market trends  key players  market segments  application areas  and market growth strategies.Key Market SegmentsTypeBasic ($Under 50/Month)Standard ($50-100/Month)Senior ($Above 100/Month)Enterprise SizeLarge EnterprisesSmall and Medium-size EnterprisesApplicationPrivate CorporationStart-upsListed CompanyOthersBy RegionNorth America (U.S.  Canada)Europe (United Kingdom  Germany  France  Italy  Spain  Netherlands  Rest of Europe)Asia-Pacific (China  India  Japan  Australia  Singapore  Rest of Asia-Pacific)LAMEA (Latin America  Middle East  Africa)Major Market PlayersCartaCertent  Inc.CapdeskCapshare LLCAltvia Solutions  LLCGustLedgy AGEqvistaEuronext N.V.The report analyzes these key players in the global equity management software market.

This growth was realised despite a more prudent approach by e-commerce sector of which a number of major players have shifted their take-up focus towards 2024 and beyond.”Jan Van Geet continued: “The unstable energy markets have not only given a significant boost to our renewable energy revenue potential  it has also served as an accelerator in our tenants’ desire to switch to renewable energy consumption. Beyond the traditional stronghold countries of Germany and the Netherlands we are now initiating solar projects in almost all regions based on direct tenant demand.”Story continuesJan Van Geet added: “Although we have taken a more cautious approach to our land acquisitions during the first half of the year  an important side effect of these unstable energy markets is that it creates tremendous growth opportunities for us. After all  it accelerates the need for energy-inefficient industries to reinvent themselves and move to more sustainable and energy-efficient housing and operations. One of the side effects of this is that they are putting their old factories  mostly in prime locations  up for sale which consequently offers interesting brownfield redevelopment opportunities for VGP.""Jan Van Geet concluded: “A strong capital position is important  particularly as such highly attractive brownfield opportunities start to increasingly arise. The significant cash recycling through the completed and anticipated joint venture closings enhances our balance sheet and allows us the flexibility to best serve our whilst enabling us to create significant value for all stakeholders involved.”FINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTSNew leases signedAs at 30 June 2022  the signed and renewed rental income amounted to € 35.4 million (up 9.7% YTD).Leasing activity year-to-date has been strong across the board with increased demand from a broad range of tenants. From a geographical perspective  Germany contributed circa a third of new leases and particular strong activity was noted in Spain  The Netherlands and Slovakia.The increase was driven by 416 000 m² of new lease agreements signed  corresponding to € 22.4 million of new annualised rental income3  whilst during same period for a total of 173 500 m² of lease agreements were renewed and extended corresponding to € 9.3 million of annualised rental income (of which € 8.2 million related to the joint ventures4). Indexation accounted for € 3.6 million in the first half of 2022 (of which € 3.2 million related to the joint ventures²). Terminations represented a total of €1.0 million or 19 000 m²  of which € 0.8 million within the joint ventures’ portfolio.The signed annualised committed leases total € 281.1 million5 (equivalent to 4.9 million m² of lettable area)  a 9.7% increase since December 2021.The leasing activity after 30 June 2022 has resulted in an additional € 6.1 million of new contracts being signed bringing the total annualised committed rental income to € 287.8 million (+12.4% YTD).Construction activityA total of 40 projects under construction which will create 1 346 000 m² of future lettable area  representing € 88.1 million of annualised leases once built and fully let – the portfolio under construction is 87.4% pre-let as at 30 June 2022.During the first 6 months of 2022 a total of 17 projects were completed delivering 334 000 m² of lettable area  representing € 17.1 million of annualised committed leases. Several other projects currently under construction are scheduled for delivery in the coming months resulting in a delivery pipeline of >700 000m2 expected for H2 2022.During H1 we experienced additional increases of construction costs. First signs of stabilization have been noted towards the end of H1. The resulting effects on the development margins of the projects under construction were mitigated through a mix of higher rental income and yield changes.Land bankAcquisition of 1 55 million m² of development land and a further 3.25 million m2 committed subject to permits which brings the remaining total owned and committed land bank for development to 11.31 million m²  which supports more than 5.12 million m² of future lettable area.A further 601 000 m² of new land plots have been identified and are under negotiation and have a development potential of at least 254 000 m² of future lettable area. This brings the land bank of owned  committed  secured and/or under option to 11.91 million m2.The land bank includes an agreement to purchase 32 hectares of land in Petit-Couronne  near Rouen  the capital of Normandy (of which 50% was already acquired during the 1H 2022)  the first project of VGP in France. This brownfield project is expected to offer circa 150 000 m² of total gross lettable area  with construction works due to begin in 2023.Renewable EnergyA total solar power generation capacity of 120.9 MWp is currently installed or under construction through 89 roof-projects in 4 countries. As at 30 June 2022 this represents a total aggregate investment amount of € 48 million.In addition  40 solar power projects have been identified in four additional countries which equates to an additional power generation capacity of 53.7 MWp. For these projects we expect the installation works to commence in the coming months. The current total solar portfolio  including pipeline projects totals 174 MWp.Completion of the 3rd closing with the Second Joint Venture with Allianz Real EstateOn 16th of March 2022  VGP announced the successful third closing with its 50:50 joint venture  VGP European Logistics 2 (‘Second Joint Venture’). The transaction comprised 13 logistic buildings  including 9 buildings in 7 new VGP parks and another 4 newly completed logistic buildings which were developed in parks previously transferred to the Joint Second Venture. The transaction value was € 364 million6 and net proceeds from this transaction amounted to circa € 215.5 million. Following the completion of this third closing  the Second’s Joint Venture’s property portfolio consist of 32 completed buildings representing around 642 000 m² of lettable area  with an 99.8% occupancy rate.On 1 July 2022  two additional closings  one of each with the First and Second Joint Venture occurred for a total gross asset value of € 105 million and with gross cash proceeds for VGP in amount of€ 82 million.A final closing with the Third Joint Venture is anticipated during Q4 2022 upon completion of the Munich construction site  which is within its original time frame. The expected minimum gross proceeds of the transaction totals € 73 million.Finally  during Q4 ’22 VGP expects to sell a seed portfolio of completed projects to the Fourth Joint Venture.Capital and liquidity positionOn the 10th of January 2022  VGP announced the successful issuance of its second public benchmark green bond for an aggregate nominal amount of € 1.0 billion  in two tranches i.e.  a € 500 million 5-year bond tranche paying a coupon of 1.625% p.a. and maturing on 17 January 2027 and a € 500 million 8-year bond tranche paying a coupon of 2.250% p.a. and maturing on 17 January 2030. The proceeds from this issuance are being used to fund the majority pre-let development pipeline  the build out of renewable energy assets and the design and development of new green logistics and semi-industrial parks.Total cash balance as at 30 June 2022 stood at € 648.5 million and increased further on 1 July 2022 with € 82 million following the closings with the First and Second Joint Venture.In August 2022  VGP further strengthened its liquidity position by increasing its committed credit facilities with an additional € 100 million granted under similar terms as the existing credit facilities. As a result  the current committed credit facilities amount to € 300 million  all of which currently remain undrawn.Progress towards our Sustainable Development GoalsWe have made significant progress towards our Sustainable Development Goals and are on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and 50% gross reduction under scope 1 and 2 and 55% reduction in 'in use' scope 3 emissions by 2030.With regards to the sustainable building target  the Group targets BREEAM Excellent or DGNB Gold for all new constructions started up in 2022. Currently 61.2% of our portfolio has been certified.In order to allow transparent reporting on the progress on our ESG initiatives we will  in addition to our annual CDP disclosure  2022 GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark) participation and publication of our Corporate Responsibility Reporting in accordance with GRI Standards  participate in the S&P Global CSA 2022 and Sustainalytics 2022 analysis.OutlookAs a result of the strong rental and asset growth and +1 million m2 to be delivered in 2022  VGP’s (along with the JV’s) recurring rental income basis will increase to € 280 million within the next twelve months. This significantly increases the recurring cash generation and delivers an attractive return on the funds invested.VGP has currently been able to mostly mitigate the increased construction costs through a mix of higher rental income and yield compression. Any adverse change in any of the aforementioned components might not be fully offset and hence might have adverse effect on the development margins. We remain prudent and selective on any start-up of new projects to ensure that our development margins remain attractive.The Group opened its first office in Scandinavia with appointment of Kristoffer Kaae Stimpel as country manager for Denmark. The Group anticipates to be able to announce the opening of first office in Sweden in 2H 2022.Based on the combination of our increasing recurring cash flow  our inflation protected portfolio  our strategic land bank and partnership with Allianz Real Estate  in combination with attractive land acquisition opportunities in the markets along with renewable energy dynamics is expected to result in further – solid - NAV growth for VGP.Finally  the expected sale of the seed portfolio to the Fourth Joint Venture during Q4 '22 should further strengthen the Group’s balance sheet.KEY FINANCIAL METRICSOperations and results H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) Committed annualised rental income (€mm) 281.1 205.7 36.7% IFRS Operating profit (€mm) 190.5 240.0 (20.6)% IFRS net profit (€mm) 153.1 203.8 (24.9)% IFRS earnings per share (€ per share) 7.01 9.90 (29.2)%Portfolio and balance sheet 30 Jun 22 31 Dec 21 Change (%) Portfolio value  including joint venture at 100% (€mm) 6 534 5 746 13.7% Portfolio value  including joint venture at share (€mm) 4 656 4 084 14.0% Occupancy ratio of standing portfolio (%) 99 99 - EPRA NTA per share (€ per share) 106.97 106.93 0.0% IFRS NAV per share (€ per share) 99.81 99.65 0.2% Net financial debt (€mm) 1 713 1 159 47.8% Gearing7(%) 35.2 29.8 -AUDIO WEBCAST FOR INVESTORS AND ANALYSTSVGP will host an audio webcast at 11:00 (CEST) on 26 August 2022Webcast link:https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1563403&tp_key=c71da089b6 Click on the link above to attend the presentation from your laptop  tablet or mobile device.

""As two cities known for marching to the beat of their own drum  it feels full circle to welcome the Jameson Distillery on Tour to New York City and be a part of an initiative that enables fellow buskers to bring their music to the streets. Sharing a piece of where I come from with the city I now call home is something I will never forget. Together  we're celebrating the power of connection  whether with a fellow audience member or over a shared drink with friends.""The performance paid tribute to those committed to their craft — much like the legendary Irish whiskey-maker — surprising onlookers at the start of a two-week lineup featuring some of New York's very own talented buskers  including world-renowned bucket drummer  Jared ""Choclatt"" Crawford; the eclectic powerhouse with her violin  Joya Bravo; and the composer and songwriter  Justin Sutherland.This immersive experience is designed to widen both palates and social circles  providing a dedicated space for friends and new faces to come together through a shared exploration of Jameson's heritage and history.""This is the first time we are bringing Jameson's Distillery on Tour to the U.S.  and we couldn't think of a better spot to host this one-of-a-kind experience than Hudson Yards in New York City  a popular destination that attracts visitors from around the globe "" said Kelly Suhr  Senior Brand Director  Jameson Irish Whiskey.

That’s probably dropped to zero  he said.The business produces cement for small scale users mainly in the domestic market. Its plants are located in south west Ukraine  away from the front lines in the east of the country.Mr Manifold was speaking to reporters after the group reported bumper results for the first half of the year with sales and margins up despite the inflationary headwinds.In relation to Ukraine  a relatively small part of the overall group  Mr Manifold said operating a cement business with high fixed costs well below its capacity is probably costing the group money.“But it is the right thing to do as a corporate citizen ” he said.In contrast CRH has fully exited Russia  where it operated a business near St Petersburg.“We won’t be going back ” he said.Mr Manifold said the war is not causing economic dislocation in the wider central and eastern European region  an important market for CRH thanks to economic growth and the flood of EU structural funds.What this has done is solidified our sense of who we are as Europeans“(CRH) had seen no step back whatsoever” in investment in the rest of region  he said. In medium to longer term the effect of the invasion of Ukraine will be to pull the region closer to the European core  he said.""What this has done is solidified our sense of who we are as Europeans ” he said.Globally  CRH recorded robust growth in the first half of the year despite rising costs.Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) were $2.2bn (€2.2bn)  up 21pc on the same period last year. Group sales were 14pc ahead of the first half of 2021 at $15bn.The company anticipates full year Ebitda to reach $5.5bn in a “challenging cost environment”  an increase from $5bn recorded in 2021.Management said margins had been protected by its focus on a customer solutions strategy based on selling packages that integrate services and goods which are less price sensitive than traditional commodity materials supply.The company said resilient demand for infrastructure projects and repair  maintenance and improvement works would boost its US operations  by far the biggest contributor to group earnings.European materials sales were 14pc ahead of the same time last year  with the group attributing the rise to “strong pricing momentum across all products” to address the inflationary cost environment.The Irish businesses had a strong start to the year and was flattered by comparison to 2021’s Covid impacted activity.CRH shares were the biggest gainers on the Ftse-100 with a 3.4pc rise.

Click to enlargeInvestment Manager’s Report: LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERSTo the Shareholders of Pershing Square Holdings  Ltd:In the first half of 2022  Pershing Square Holdings generated NAV performance of negative 26.0%  and a slightly lower total shareholder return of negative 27.3% due to the widening of the discount to NAV at which PSH’s shares traded.5 PSH’s year-to-date NAV return through August 16  2022  was negative 10.8% compared to negative 8.8% for the S&P 500 index over the same period.6The Year to Date2022 has been an unusual and highly volatile year in the capital markets. This volatility has been driven by uncertainty associated with high levels of global inflation  central-bank-led increases in interest rates and related confusion about monetary policy  the risk of a possible recession  the war in Ukraine  political divisiveness and discord  and fear and unease about climate change and geopolitical risk. Each of these factors on their own could be a cause for a high degree of stock market volatility. When combined  uncertainty and volatility rule the markets.Our approach to investing capital is to find extremely durable  well-capitalized  high-quality growth companies that can survive any storm. If we are successful in our investment selection  we can largely ignore shorter-term factors that drive stock market movements and remain focused on our portfolio companies’ underlying business performance. As long as our companies continue to deliver the results we expect  we do not need to make any material adjustments to our portfolio’s composition. In other words  we can sail through the stormy seas with a focus on the long-term horizon.We don’t  however  ignore global events that create risk and uncertainty. While we try to consider every potential risk that could impact our portfolio companies and invest in businesses that can withstand these risks  the world is and will remain a highly uncertain place  so a high degree of vigilance will always remain appropriate. Staying knowledgeable about global macro and political events is important for assessing risk for our portfolio companies and in selecting new company investments. It also occasionally offers opportunities for profits from carefully selected hedging transactions.One of our strategy’s important competitive advantages is our ability to profit from unanticipated market events enabling us to generate large profits and liquidity from hedges during periods when equity prices are likely to decline substantially.Our investments in: (1) index and single-name credit default swaps before the Great Financial Crisis  (2) investment grade and high yield index CDS in the weeks prior to Covid impacting the markets  and (3) interest rate swaptions in late 2020 to the present day in light of our concerns that interest rates would rise more quickly and remain at higher levels than anticipated  are all good examples of the importance of our understanding and foreseeing the impact of global macro risks and hedging them when we can identify an asymmetric means to do so.If It Is So Obvious  Why Doesn’t Everyone Do It?While our approach to investing capital is logical and straightforward and has a long-term outperformance record  it is the rare investment manager that can implement such a strategy. Many of our colleagues in the industry have told us that they would prefer to invest as we do with their own money  but that their investors’ demands effectively prohibit such an approach.While many investors in funds claim to be long term  they require short-term liquidity from their managers. When managers oversee funds that can be withdrawn on short notice  they generally have no choice but to manage for the short term. Furthermore  most investors in funds are fiduciaries who are themselves held to short-term measurements of their own performance. So when the inevitable period of underperformance occurs due to broad-based market movements or otherwise  investors in funds redeem their capital  and their managers become forced sellers.The inherently short-term nature of the investment management industry is a large contributor to stock (and bond) market volatility. As many funds suffered substantial drawdowns earlier this year  they sold stocks to raise capital to meet redemptions  and reduced market exposure as their risk appetites declined.This pattern of reducing equity market exposure as stock markets decline occurs in every market disruption  but it is precisely the opposite of what long-term investors should do. It is axiomatic that the lower the price paid  the better one’s long-term returns. Yet  in each crisis and/or market drawdown  fund managers sell and reduce exposures  rather than increase exposures at more favorable valuations.The inverse is also true. Investors in funds generally commit more capital when funds are generating strong absolute performance. During the ebullient market which preceded this year’s decline  investors committed more capital to funds which put the money to work at higher valuations. Investments at higher valuations are destined to generate lower returns.Pershing Square Holdings’ closed-end fund structure and large insider ownership provide us with the ability to be a truly long-term investor in a world where the vast majority of fund managers are constrained to a shorter-term approach. Our long-term investment approach is one of our most important competitive advantages and a major contributor to our substantial outperformance over the last nearly 19 years.7 We believe that our even larger outperformance since early 2018 can be explained by our transition from a manager of shorter-term redeemable assets to a manager of effectively perpetual assets.Today  substantially all of Pershing Square’s assets under management are in PSH or represent capital invested in our private funds by affiliates of the investment manager.8 The permanency of our asset base allows for a truly long-term investment approach. We have not raised any net new equity capital in years so we are not exposed to the risk of raising capital at market peaks.Furthermore  we have been active in periodically returning capital when PSH is trading at a ‘double discount’ by repurchasing PSH shares opportunistically when our portfolio companies are trading at attractive valuations and PSH is trading at a wide discount to NAV. Our estimate of today’s ‘proforma NAV ’ PSH’s NAV assuming our portfolio companies were trading at their intrinsic value  is more than twice our current share price.9Our effectively perpetual capital is also a great recruitment tool for talent. The universe of firms where one can go to invest permanent capital is extremely small. For all of the above reasons  the most talented investors prefer to work for a firm that is able to implement a long-term investment approach.Our closed-end fund structure is also a competitive advantage in allowing us to access low-cost  investment grade leverage in the form of unsecured bonds without mark-to-market covenants on fixed rate terms. Of PSH’s total assets  19% is funded by long-term bonds with laddered maturities beginning five years from today until 2039 at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.1%.10 By using low-cost  long-term debt in place of one-fifth of our equity capital we have materially enhanced our ability to generate high rates of returns without  in our view  any meaningful change in our risk profile.In summary  our closed-end fund structure is an enormous competitive advantage for how we invest capital  recruit talent  and raise low-cost and low-risk unsecured bond leverage. It has  however  come with one negative externality. In recent years  PSH has traded at a large discount to its NAV.Discount to NAVIn a private fund or in an open-ended mutual fund which invests in liquid assets  investors are guaranteed to receive the net asset value of their holding when they redeem. The same is not true for a closed-end fund as investors are exposed to the risk that a closed-end fund’s share price trades at a greater discount to NAV when they exit than when they originally purchased their shares.Since late 2015  the beginning of a several-year period of underperformance  PSH began trading at a large discount to NAV which has widened over time. While this discount is an advantage when we buy back our shares  it is a disadvantage to a shareholder when they decide to sell. The substantial majority of our shares are owned by investors who purchased PSH at a discount to NAV which helps to mitigate the negative impact of the NAV discount on their returns. As long as one sells PSH at a similar discount to that when the shares were purchased  one’s return will approximate PSH’s underlying NAV performance.Our discount has persisted despite best-in-class performance and the aggressive steps we have taken to address it:Based on Bloomberg data (please see Appendix A)  PSH has the best five-year NAV return of the 100 largest closed end equity funds in the world  which includes funds ranging from $774 million to $16.6 billion in net asset value. 11PSH became a premium listed company on the LSE on May 2  2017 and joined the FTSE 100 on December 21  2020  which has led to increased index inclusion and demand for our shares.With the benefit of some new director additions  we have a best-in-class  independent  extremely knowledgeable  experienced  and diverse board.Affiliates of the manager have acquired large amounts of PSH shares in the open market and now own 25.5% of the company  12 which ranks among the largest inside ownership in the top 100 closed-end funds.which ranks among the largest inside ownership in the top 100 closed-end funds. PSH has repurchased 22.5% of its shares outstanding since its IPO  a total of 54 million shares at a price of $17.32 and an average discount of 27.1%.PSH initiated a dividend in 2019  and earlier this year announced a new dividend policy whereby dividends will increase over time with NAV.One would expect that with best-in-class performance and governance  the acquisition and ownership of more than one quarter of the company by the investment manager  an aggressive and opportunistic share repurchase program and a favorable dividend distribution policy  PSH’s NAV discount should have narrowed  but in fact the opposite has occurred. Why?The Supply of PSH Shares and Our Market CapPSH’s discount to NAV is directly related to the supply and demand for PSH shares. With respect to the supply of shares  the number of PSH shares has decreased due to buybacks by 22.5% since our IPO. Acquisitions of shares by affiliates of the investment manager reduced our public float by an additional 39 million shares or 16.3% 13 a 39% cumulative reduction in our public float since our IPO.PSH is the second largest closed-end fund in the world by NAV after Scottish Mortgage  and the third largest by market cap. One might ask  therefore  whether there is a correlation between the market cap of a closed-end fund and the discount at which the fund’s shares trade.Is Size a Contributor to the Discount?Based on the Bloomberg data  there does not seem to be any correlation between the size of a closed-end fund and its trading level relative to NAV. A number of the 15 largest closed-end equity funds trade at premiums to NAV  and the balance  other than PSH  trade at single-digit percentage discounts.PSH has vastly outperformed the other top 15 closed-end funds as well as the other 85 constituents over the last five years. PSH has outperformed 90 of the top 100 by more than 1 000 basis points per annum. The median and average discount to NAV for the top 100 equity closed-end funds with greater than a $1 billion market cap is 4% and 3% respectively compared with PSH’s current discount of 35%.Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (OTCPK:STMZF)  the largest fund on the list by market capitalization  is an interesting point of comparison. Despite its name  it like Pershing Square is a growth equity closed-end fund and also a FTSE 100 company. SMT has a long and volatile investment history beginning in 1909. PSH has substantially outperformed Scottish Mortgage over the last one-year (6% vs -29%)  three-year (27% vs 23% compounded annually) and five-year (24% vs 18% compounded annually) periods.14 Yet SMT trades at a 6% discount to NAV versus PSH’s 35% discount to NAV.While PSH charges higher fees than most other closed-end funds largely due to our incentive fees  our NAV outperformance record is net of all fees and expenses. PSH’s fee structure was not a barrier to raising $2.9 billion in PSH’s IPO  the largest IPO in Europe in 2014  as the shares were sold at NAV and the fee arrangement was understood by all investors.We have no plans to change our fees as our incentive and management fees are an important recruiting tool for our talent  who are responsible for our substantial outperformance. Pershing Square recruits investment team talent principally from private equity firms which also charge incentive fees. None of our investment team members would have joined Pershing Square and stayed if we did not continue to earn incentive fees.There appear to be only three other closed-end funds in the top 100 that charge management and incentive fees. One of these funds trade at a 10% premium to NAV and the other two trade at 12% and 19% discounts  which suggests that there is no clear relationship between the fee structure and the degree of NAV discount or premium.Demand for PSH SharesWhile PSH is managed by a U.S. manager and principally owns North American headquartered companies  it trades only on European exchanges  the LSE and Euronext Amsterdam. There are significant regulatory limitations in our ability to market PSH in various jurisdictions  including the U.S  a more logical market for a North American-centric fund run by a U.S. manager. Substantially all other closed-end funds that invest principally in North American equities are domiciled in the U.S. and therefore do not have restrictions on marketing in the U.S.The rest of world demand for PSH has mostly been driven by dedicated closed-end fund investors and to a lesser extent index funds that own the shares based on their index weightings.In summary  we have a demand problem compounded by certain marketing limitations.What Can We Do About It?There is no short-term solution to PSH’s discount problem. While a liquidation would eliminate the discount  offset somewhat by frictional costs  it would also eliminate the long-term opportunity for PSH to generate high levels of compound annual returns. We believe the long-term investment opportunity for PSH vastly outweighs the short-term profits that would come from a liquidation.We can  however  always do a better job marketing and informing investors about the existence of PSH. Despite the fact that PSH is the 78th largest company by market cap on the LSE  and would be 51st on the list if it traded at NAV  PSH is still relatively unknown by global investors. While Pershing Square  the investment manager  appears in numerous press articles nearly every business day  PSH is largely absent from the media. Even considering our marketing restrictions  we can still do more to inform investors about the existence of PSH and our investment opportunity.Could PSH Eventually List in the U.S.?As PSH grows in market capitalization and its ownership stakes in its portfolio companies increases  one can envision a world in which over time PSH becomes a controlling owner of one of more businesses that comprise the substantial majority of our assets and income. We expect to continually evaluate PSH and its operations  and consider whether in the future it may be able to operate not as an investment company in the U.S.  but rather as an operating company that could be listed in the U.S.How Should One Think about PSH?In economic substance  PSH is more akin to an investment holding company than a traditional passive owner of securities. We are often the largest  or one of the largest owners of our portfolio companies  particularly if passive index owners are ignored. We are known to be an active and engaged investor and often have board representation and/or considerable influence in the board room as a large and thoughtful owner.Why Have Some Fund Managers Avoided Investing in PSH?While PSH is owned by many investment managers  we believe these investors are principally dedicated and or specialized closed-end fund investors. Traditional investment managers often avoid investing in closed-end funds as they view doing so as effectively their giving up investment allocation decisions to a third party and paying fees for them to do so. For many years  many investment managers would not own shares in Berkshire Hathaway for similar reasons.Whether one invests in an operating company or a closed-end fund  however  ultimately the investor is giving up control of capital allocation decisions to the management of the company.We do not believe that closed-end funds should be an excluded asset class for that reason as long as the manager of the closed-end fund can generate attractive rates of long-term performance  net of the fees it charges  that are competitive with returns from other public operating company investments  with the caveat  of course  that the investors can’t simply replicate the performance of the closed-end fund by investing directly in the same underlying securities.In our 2020 letter to shareholders  we explain why PSH replication cannot be achieved by attempting to invest directly in the same securities we publicly disclose. To summarize  this is due to three principal factors:Investors in PSH get the benefit of our new  undisclosed investments at the price they were acquired by PSH before their eventual public disclosure impacts their price. Historically  the day-one trading price of our newly disclosed stake in a company typically has been substantially above our cost of acquisition. PSH replicators must pay the higher post disclosure price rather than our acquisition cost. These embedded gains inure to the benefit of PSH shareholders  and to an even greater extent when PSH is purchased at a discount to NAV. We do not disclose our hedging strategies in advance of their implementation. Our hedges have generated highly material gains for PSH that are not readily actionable or replicable by most investment managers. We are able to access long-term  low-cost investment grade debt without mark-to-market covenants  which materially reduces our cost of capital. Our access to covenant-light leverage is a difficult to replicate competitive advantage.While many investment managers avoid investing in funds that charge fees  the effective fee burden of PSH has been largely offset over time by our low-cost bond leverage (a weighted-average cost of 3.1%) that we have used in place of about 20% of our equity capital. In other words  investors in PSH receive a similar long-term NAV return to what they would have earned if they owned our underlying investments directly without leverage  as our use of bond financing roughly offsets our management and incentive fees.While some fund managers may choose not to invest in PSH because it is technically a closed-end fund  we believe that with the passage of time and continued strong performance  our tax and regulatory structure will be viewed as a competitive advantage and a reason to own PSH rather than a reason to avoid it.We chose the offshore closed-end fund structure for PSH with a full understanding of its marketing and other limitations. We did so because we believed that the offshore closed-end fund’s favorable tax structure (with no entity-level taxation) and investment flexibility versus other alternatives would give PSH long-term structural and competitive advantages in generating high rates of return over time.Today’s extraordinary discount of 35% makes PSH’s investment proposition that much more compelling  and should hopefully remove some of the traditional fund managers’ resistance to investing in closed-end funds.In summary  we believe that PSH is an excellent investment opportunity for both dedicated closed-end investors and the much larger universe of traditional investment managers because the typical reasons for an investment manager not including a closed-end fund in their portfolios don’t apply to PSH. We just need to do a better job getting the word out.Organizational UpdateThe Pershing Square investment team is intentionally small. Currently  we have eight team members including myself  and at peak  we had ten. The team operates extremely collaboratively. Each member of the team’s compensation is directly dependent on the performance of the overall portfolio rather than individual investments. Research on new investments is typically led by two members of the team  but vetted by the entire team. This structure has served us well over the years as it has aligned everyone’s incentives with Pershing Square’s long-term goals.The team has operated in an entirely non-hierarchical format with one exception. As portfolio manager  I get to make the final yes or no decision on investments and in determining the sizing of positions. With the benefit of effectively no turnover in the team over the last five or so years  our investment team is the most highly functioning it has ever been.I periodically get asked about succession planning at Pershing Square. At age 56  loving what I do and in excellent health  my principal risk is what can be deemed “pie truck risk ” that is  the risk I look the wrong way crossing the street and get smooshed by a pie truck.As a manager of perpetual capital  I am obligated to give some insight to our shareholders as to how we would operate if the pie truck ended my existence. I don’t believe in a committee approach to investing where a majority vote determines each portfolio decision. At the end of the day  someone needs to make the decision and be held accountable.I am pleased to announce that Ryan Israel  who joined Pershing Square from Goldman Sachs in March of 2009  will now become our Chief Investment Officer. I will continue as CEO and Portfolio Manager with continued control over ultimate decision making  but if the pie truck were to run me over tomorrow  Ryan would be my choice to manage the portfolio.We are extremely fortunate in having an investment team where each member would be a star at any other firm  and could if they wished  leave to launch their own firms. Most members of our investment team that have left Pershing Square in previous years have been successful in setting up their own firms  and the same would be true for our current team members.In selecting among our investment team for a CIO  I chose Ryan for a number of reasons. First  he is of exemplary character and is an extremely high-quality human being. He is a once-in-a-generation talent as an investor  not just in equities  but also in macro instruments. He is an excellent leader  teacher  communicator  and partner  and has the respect of each member of the investment team.As the longest-tenured member of the team  he has had the greatest opportunity to experience our profoundest successes and failures in dramatically different market environments and to learn from them. He has also had the opportunity to train most of our team members in our approach to investing.We have built a culture that requires extreme candor. Ryan is unafraid to challenge anyone including yours truly  and that is an extremely important quality in a CIO. Ryan is the right choice  and importantly  when I checked with each of the other team members  they all agreed.My decision to announce Ryan as CIO should in no way suggest to you that I am heading for the hills. I love this business and intend to stay active until they carry me out  and I am a heavy lift. I don’t expect that our investment team will function differently beginning the day after this announcement. Ryan has already for some time been unofficially serving in this role.It has been an extraordinary year filled with uncertainty  the tragic war in Ukraine  enormous capital markets volatility  and political divisiveness. Even more so in this environment  we feel extremely fortunate to have the backing of long-term investors who enable us to do our best work. We are perpetually extremely grateful.As always  please reach out to ir@persq.com if you have any questions for us.Sincerely William A.

Click to enlargeUniversal Music Group (OTCPK:UMGNF)Universal Music Group is the world’s leading music entertainment company  a high-quality  capital-light business that is led by a superb management team. UMG’s business can be best thought of as a rapidly growing royalty on the greater global consumption and monetization of music.We believe that UMG’s decades-long runway for growth remains underappreciated by investors. With increasing streaming penetration combined with the development of new services  platforms  and business models  UMG can grow revenues at an annual rate of 10% or so for more than a decade. High absolute levels of revenue growth coupled with UMG’s fixed cost base should allow UMG to significantly expand its operating margins over time  generating highly attractive earnings growth for the foreseeable future.UMG’s recent results support our longer-term view  as year-to-date  revenues and profits both increased at a mid-teens growth rate  well above analyst expectations and the company’s guidance during last year’s Capital Markets day. When viewed on a multi-year basis  UMG’s revenue growth has both been higher and more consistent than Warner Music Group  its most closely followed peer.We believe that music is the lowest-cost  highest-value form of entertainment. For a $10 monthly fee (and less in a family plan) one can listen to over 80 million songs. We expect music streaming to be highly resilient  even in a recessionary environment  as consumers forgo other expenses before cancelling their music subscriptions.While ad-supported streaming revenues can be more sensitive to advertising spend  UMG has maintained a high-teens growth rate year-to-date by consistently expanding its partnerships and renewing existing deals on more favorable terms. UMG is the pioneer in monetizing emerging platforms and first partnered with Facebook/Meta (META) in 2017 – a groundbreaking partnership at the time that served as a template for social media companies to begin paying music rightsholders through fixed payments.The company recently renewed its Meta deal  significantly expanding the terms to include revenue sharing components. We believe the new Meta deal will boost UMG’s growth over the coming years and represents a framework for future deals with other social media platforms. Over time  we expect the revenue from social media and other emerging platforms such as gaming and fitness to grow faster than traditional streaming and become a more material percentage of UMG’s revenue base.Music spending per capita is significantly below peak levels which were achieved in the late 1990s both on a nominal basis and when adjusted for inflation. Despite pervasive high levels of inflation in the global economy  streaming prices have stayed relatively constant since their introduction. While digital service providers recently began increasing prices in certain markets  we believe there is ample room to increase pricing in the coming years which will drive increased growth at UMG.While streaming has been the primary driver of music’s resurgence and will continue to be the primary driver of growth going forward  other revenue streams that were previously declining have also returned to growth. Physical music is experiencing a renaissance driven by vinyl demand. We believe that physical and digital collectibles provide an opportunity for UMG and its artists to better engage with and monetize their superfans.Bill recently joined the UMG board and we look forward to working even more closely with the company as an engaged long-term shareholder. Given its long runway for sustained earnings growth  we believe that UMG’s current valuation represents a significant discount to intrinsic value.Restaurant Brands (QSR)QSR’s franchised business model is a high-quality  capital-light  growing annuity that generates high-margin brand royalty fees from its four leading brands: Burger King  Tim Hortons  Popeyes  and Firehouse Subs.QSR is investing in each of its brands to position them for sustainable  long-term growth. As Canada reopened  Tim Hortons’ same-store sales returned to growth during the quarter compared to pre-COVID levels  driven by growth across all dayparts  formats  regions and product categories aside from hot beverage. The company is focused on executing the next phase of its “Back to Basics” plan by extending its beverage platform  capturing a greater share of afternoon foods and continuing its brand modernization. Longer-term  management believes it can sustainably grow same-store sales at a low-single-digit rate.At Burger King in the U.S.  the company also reported improved results and narrowed the gap to its peers. Recently-appointed Burger King U.S. President Tom Curtis and his team have begun to lay the foundation for a return to sustainable growth. We believe the company has a meaningful opportunity to reinvigorate growth and modernize its store base through a reinvestment plan. The company will be unveiling its “reclaim the flame” plan to franchisees next month.Burger King international  Popeyes  and Firehouse Brands continue to perform strongly  with comparable sales up more than 20% relative to pre-COVID levels.QSR’s franchised-based royalty model is particularly attractive in an inflationary environment. QSR’s revenues benefit when its franchisees increase prices  but its cost structure is not subject to the same inflationary pressures. QSR can continue to grow its business with minimal capital required as its franchisees open new units. Despite delayed permitting  higher material costs  and inflationary headwinds  QSR’s unit growth returned to its historic mid-single-digit growth rate last year.As a result of improving same-store sales growth coupled with strong unit growth  QSR’s earnings are now greater than prior to COVID and are growing at an attractive rate  in spite of significant industry-level inflation and same store sales that are just now recovering to pre-COVID levels.QSR continues to trade at a discount to its peers and its intrinsic value. The company has repurchased more than 3% of its shares outstanding over the last twelve months  which when coupled with its 4% dividend yield  enables QSR to return approximately 7% of its market capitalization to shareholders on an annual basis.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)Chipotle continued its impressive performance in 2022 driven by the ongoing recovery of in-restaurant sales  price increases to cover cost inflation  and successful menu innovation including pollo asado. During the second quarter  Chipotle continued to lead the restaurant industry in growth for both same-store sales (“SSS”) and new restaurants  with SSS growing 10% year-over-year or 30% on a three-year cumulative basis.On-premise sales grew 36% as consumers resumed pre-pandemic routines  while digital sales declined only 3%  continuing their persistence despite the growth of conventional sales. Chipotle remains on track to grow its store base by approximately 8% this year with a longer-term annual store growth aspiration of nearly 10% once current headwinds around construction  permitting  and supplies ease.We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs  management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings  marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost  and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers  some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives.Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact  with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter  up 0.8% year-over-year  and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S.  insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies.To accelerate Chipotle’s growth beyond the company’s continued strong results  management is focused on improving throughput for in-store orders  and increasing order accuracy and timeliness for digital orders. While Chipotle’s restaurants are staffed above 2019 levels  many current employees haven’t experienced optimal operations given pandemic-related disruptions and the high rate of employee turnover endemic to the restaurant industry.Management has rolled out a new labor deployment tool to develop staffing models and is instituting an operational initiative focused on excellent execution of the basics  the latter of which started to bear fruit in 2019 before it was interrupted by the pandemic. We continue to be impressed by Chipotle management’s continuous improvement initiatives  drive to create a superb customer experience and shareholder value creation.Hilton (HLT)Hilton is a high-quality  asset-light  high-margin business with significant long-term growth potential  led by a superb management team. The unforeseen arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a rapid and near-complete standstill in global travel  with RevPAR (the industry metric for same-store sales at a given hotel) down roughly 90% at the nadir of the pandemic. We increased our investment in Hilton during the pandemic as we believed the economic dislocation from COVID-19 would prove to be transient and that industry projections regarding the timeline for recovery were too pessimistic.From the moment the pandemic began  Hilton’s management team took decisive actions to ensure the company not only managed through what it knew would be a challenging period  but also positioned the company to generate improved margins  cash flows  and investment returns once the business recovered. In hindsight  Hilton’s experience with COVID-19 – the 100-year proverbial flood – affirmed the company’s unique high-quality  asset light  high-margin business model  and reinforced our belief that Hilton deserves a premium valuation.While Hilton entered 2022 impacted by the Omicron variant  results have vastly improved throughout the year asCOVID-19 has evolved towards a more endemic virus  and consumer behavior has adapted accordingly. In recent months  Hilton’s system-wide RevPAR has surpassed 2019 levels and continues to improve. Recent strength has been led by domestic leisure travel occasions as consumer spending continues to shift from goods to services.We expect demand to continue to strengthen from current levels as anticipated moderation in leisure occupancy is likely to be more than offset by improvements in corporate business transient and group business  both still below 2019 levels. Notably  the industrywide recovery is being led by an unprecedented surge in average daily rate (“ADR”).Historically a laggard during prior recessions  ADR has been buoyed by a strong consumer appetite to travel  a positive mix-shift from large corporations to small and medium-sized businesses  and broad and accelerating inflationary pressures (hotels can change room rates in real time). Hilton is well positioned to benefit from inflation as its fee-based business model benefits from rising ADRs while its cost base is largely fixed.The combined impact of Hilton’s net unit growth since the onset of the pandemic and the greater operational efficiencies has increased run-rate operating income to approximately 15% above 2019 operating income at similar levels of RevPAR. We expect Hilton to continue to deliver accelerated earnings growth for the foreseeable future  as industrywide occupancy continues to improve (still well below normal)  ADR remains elevated  and Hilton laps over easy comparative historical periods.Despite Hilton’s accelerated near-term growth prospects and attractive long-term earnings algorithm  the stock is attractively priced at a low-20s multiple of 2023 earnings. We find Hilton’s valuation to be compelling given its industry leading competitive position  superb management team  attractive long-term net unit growth algorithm  pricing power  and best-in-class capital return policy.Lowe’s is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential underpinned by a superb management team that is successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation.COVID-19 was a transformational event for the US housing market  causing homeowners to invest significantly in their homes as they shifted nearly all their daily activities to the home environment  including work  school  and leisure. The increased use of the home during COVID  in turn  increased the need for repair  maintenance and remodel activity  which significantly benefited Lowe’s same-store sales.As consumers return to spending more time and money on out-of-the home activities the near-term demand for certain Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) categories has decreased. Moderation in DIY demand combined with increased mortgage rates and decreased housing affordability has caused many market participants to become concerned that the home improvement industry may give up a significant part of their COVID pandemic sales gains.While we expect that there will be some near-term volatility and continued moderation of DIY demand  growth remains strong for projects requiring professional installation (the “Pro” business) due to a substantial backlog of projects undertaken during COVID  which should support industry growth in the near-term. In addition  we believe the medium-term growth outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong as demand is likely to normalize at a materially higher level as compared to the pre-COVID era.For the decade prior to COVID  home improvement industry sales were notably depressed relative to their long-term averages as a percentage of overall consumer spend and GDP and have only now returned to their longer-term historical levels.Moreover  we believe COVID has permanently renewed consumers’ focus  appreciation  and utilization of their homes  which combined with higher home equity values  strong consumer balance sheets  low levels of home inventory for sale and an aging housing stock that requires an increasing level of maintenance  will likely result in a structurally higher level of ongoing home industry spending in the future. In the most recent quarter demand strengthened throughout the quarter as DIY consumers returned from summer vacations and focused on less seasonal home improvement projects.While we believe the longer-term industry outlook remains strong  Lowe’s is likely to generate a strong level of earnings growth over a multi-year period even if the industry and macroeconomic environment is weaker due to management’s strong execution of the company’s ongoing business transformation.A combination of market share gains (primarily from improving e-commerce execution and improving share of wallet amongst Pro customers) and a multitude of idiosyncratic self-help initiatives (primarily focused on improving in-store labor productivity and reconfiguring Lowe’s for a market based delivery model) are driving Lowe’s transformation.Lowe’s operational transformation is further magnified by its aggressive share repurchase program  which is likely to see the company acquire a high-single-digit percentage of its market capitalization in this year alone. The materiality of Lowe’s Perpetual Productivity Initiative was on full display in their most recent quarter  whereby the company leveraged fixed expenses by 80 basis points  driving 10% earnings-per-share growth notwithstanding flat topline growth. The successful execution of Lowe’s continued business transformation should allow the company to generate accelerated earnings growth for the foreseeable future.Notwithstanding our view on Lowe’s attractive long-term earnings outlook  Lowe’s currently trades at only 15 times forward earnings  a low valuation for a business of this quality  and a substantial discount to its direct competitor. We believe the current valuation reflects investors negative sentiment regarding the US housing market and incorporates the possibility of a greater than expected revenue decline. We believe the current valuation is highly attractive and anticipate Lowe’s will generate high rates of returns from current levels if as we expect it continues to successfully execute the company’s transformation.Canadian Pacific Railway (CP)CP is a high-quality  inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (“KCS”)  we believe that CP’s prospects are bright.CP reported revenue growth of 7% in the second quarter as pricing and mix  fuel surcharge pass-throughs and foreign exchange more than offset a small decline in volumes. CP is leveraging the strong pricing environment to renew contracts at an average price increase of over 6%. Pricing directly benefits earnings as rails pass on increases in fuel and other expenses to customers through contractual fuel surcharges and CPI escalators. In addition to earnings growth  high inflation should help rail transportation take share from trucking and lead to incremental volume growth over time.Customers are choosing cheaper transportation solutions as prices rise  and CP’s mission-critical rail service is often the cheapest or only viable method for transporting heavy freight over long distances. High fuel prices and wage gains also disproportionally increase the cost of trucking  which is up to three times less fuel efficient and much more labor intensive than rail transportation.The demand outlook for CP continues to improve  especially given the current geopolitical environment. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting supply disruptions have boosted demand for Canadian exports such as grain and potash. Deglobalization has also increased the likelihood of major North American onshoring and energy production  which will accelerate CP’s volume growth in the future.Total volumes declined by 2% in the second quarter due to the smaller than average Canadian grain harvest  while volumes excluding grain increased by 5%. The grain headwind will flip to a tailwind in the fall as CP anticipates a normal grain crop  which supports management’s double-digit volume and revenue growth outlook for the second half of 2022.CP’s pending acquisition of KCS remains on track as the Surface Transportation Board’s likely approval approaches. Based on the Board’s updated procedural schedule  if all goes as expected  CP will gain operational control of KCS by the first quarter of 2023 at the latest. In the meantime  CP and KCS are preparing for synergies by holding productive discussions with potential customers  running proof of concept trains  and making capacity investments.By creating the only direct route from Canada to Mexico  the procompetitive merger offers shippers the unrivaled speed and service that is sorely needed to help ease supply chain congestion. We are confident in management’s ability to achieve its revenue and cost synergy targets and create value for all stakeholders.While CP’s year-to-date results reflect its strong business performance and favorable outlook  we believe CP’s current valuation represents a meaningful discount to intrinsic value in light of the company’s high-quality business model and long-term growth potential.The Howard Hughes Corporation (HHC)HHC’s portfolio of well-located residential land and income-producing commercial assets continues to demonstrate resilient performance despite recent macro concerns of a slowdown in the housing market. The company’s advantaged business model of owning master planned communities (“MPCs”) provides HHC substantial control over the planning and release of land for sale and development  enabling it to take a long-term approach to maximizing the value of its portfolio.As a result of its outright ownership of thousands of acres of conservatively financed land and a management team that combines superb capital allocation and development skills  the company is much less exposed to the cyclicality of standalone  smaller-scale real estate development companies.HHC’s MPCs are attractively located in low cost-of-living  low-tax states like Texas and Nevada that are benefiting from significant in-migration. As mortgage rates have increased  the relative affordability and higher quality of life found in Summerlin (Las Vegas  Nevada) and Bridgeland (Houston  Texas)  the company’s two MPCs with the substantial majority of remaining land sales  is highly appealing to prospective homebuyers. Although the pace of home sales has moderated from the post-pandemic surge experienced in 2021  housing inventory in HHC’s MPCs has been depleted and is near historical lows.Homebuilder demand for lots remains strong and the company is experiencing significant growth in pricing due to the supply-demand imbalance  as evidenced by the 25% year-over-year increase in the average price per acre sold this quarter. Likewise  the company is experiencing robust performance across the rest of its portfolio. In its income-producing operating assets  this quarter NOI increased 15% year-over-year driven by the lease-up of new developments and significant increases in rental rates. The pace of condo sales in Ward Village has remained consistently strong due to the unique appeal of the development’s location in Hawaii.HHC’s balance sheet is well insulated from the impact of rising interest rates. Approximately 83% of the company’s debt is either fixed or swapped to a fixed rate  and the company has limited near-term debt maturities with a substantial portion of its debt maturing in 2026 or later. Unlike traditional developers and homebuilders  the company is not dependent on external capital to fund development. Substantial cash generated from its operating assets  MPC land sales  and condo sales is more than sufficient to self-fund future development opportunities.While the company has made significant progress in simplifying its business and has a substantial runway for long-term value creation  we continue to believe its current share price is at a deep discount to its intrinsic value. The company has been able to capitalize on this discounted valuation by aggressively repurchasing its shares. Year to date  HHC has repurchased approximately 8% of its outstanding share count  funded by cash flow from operations and non-core asset sales.We believe HHC is extremely well positioned for the current inflationary environment due to its combination of high-quality real estate assets and a largely fixed-rate liability structure. We expect the company to benefit from substantial land price appreciation and rental income growth in the coming years.Fannie Mae (“FNMA” or “Fannie”) and Freddie Mac (“FMCC or “Freddie”) (together “the GSEs”)There have been no material updates for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2022. Both entities continue to build capital through retained earnings and now hold combined capital of $91 billion  up from nearly zero. As we have stated previously  as principally common shareholders (we own a small amount of preferred stock)  we own valuable perpetual options on both entities that over the long term we believe will be worth many multiples of today’s prices once re-privatization occurs.Exited PositionsDomino’s Pizza (DPZ)Since our last update  Domino’s near-term business performance has shown meaningful improvement  including three-year stacked growth for the second quarter of 17% in the U.S.  up 560 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven by the full impact of its recent pricing actions  operational changes leading to improved staffing and labor utilization  and the return of its signature Boost Week promotion. These positive developments caused a significant recovery in Domino’s share price and its valuation increased to more than 28 times our estimate of next twelve months’ earnings.In light of the company’s relatively high valuation in the context of a volatile market environment  we decided to exit our investment to raise cash for alternative investment opportunities.We have enormous respect for Domino’s and its management team led by Russell Weiner  and we expect the company to continue its long track record of success.Netflix (NFLX)In April  we announced that we exited our position in Netflix following the company’s first quarter results as management commentary and a required shift in the company’s business model toward ad-supported streaming caused us to lose confidence in our ability to predict the company’s future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty. While we have confidence in Netflix’s superb management team and their long-term record  we believed the dispersion of outcomes had widened such that it no longer met our requirements for a core holding. We discussed our decision to sell Netflix in detail in our April 20th letter to investors which you can read here.Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd (“PSTH”)On July 11th  PSTH announced that it would redeem its outstanding shares and liquidate as PSTH was unable to consummate a transaction that both met its investment criteria and was executable. PSTH returned its $4 billion of capital in trust to shareholders on July 26th. The PSTH liquidation is discussed in greater detail in the PSTH Liquidation section on page 42 of this report.Appendix B: Endnotes and Disclaimers - ENDNOTES TO COMPANY PERFORMANCE AND INVESTMENT MANAGER’S REPORTPerformance results are presented on a net-of-fees basis. Net returns include the reinvestment of all dividends  interest  and capital gains from underlying portfolio companies and reflect the deduction of  among other things  management fees  brokerage commissions  administrative expenses and accrued and/or crystallized performance allocation/fees (if any). Any positive impact on the Company’s performance due to share buybacks and the Tender Offer is reflected in the net returns. The Company’s performance is based on the dollar return for the specific period  including any and all dividends paid by the Company  calculated from the beginning of such period to the end of such period. Where the Company’s performance is presented with that of PSLP  performance results assume that an investor (i) has been invested in PSLP since inception  has not invested in Tranche G  and has participated in any “new issues ” as such term is defined under Rules 5130 and 5131 of FINRA and (II) invested in PSLP at its inception on January 1  2004 and converted to PSH at its inception on December 31  2012. Depending on the timing of an individual investor’s specific investment in the Company and/or PSLP  net performance for an individual investor may vary from the net performance as stated herein. PSLP's net performance results are presented as it is the Pershing Square fund with the longest track record and substantially the same investment strategy to the Company. The inception date for PSLP is January 1  2004. In 2004  Pershing Square earned a $1.5 million (approximately 3.9%) annual management fee and PSLP's general partner earned a performance allocation equal to 20% above a 6% hurdle from PSLP  in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreement of PSLP then in effect. That limited partnership agreement was later amended to provide for a 1.5% annual management fee and 20% performance allocation effective January 1  2005. The net returns for PSLP presented herein reflect the different fee arrangements in 2004  and subsequently  except that the performance of the tranche of interests subject to a 30% performance allocation and a 5% hard hurdle (non- cumulative) issued on January 1  2017 is not reflected in PSLP's returns. In addition  pursuant to a separate agreement  in 2004 the sole unaffiliated limited partner of PSLP paid Pershing Square an additional $840 000 for overhead expenses in connection with services provided unrelated to PSLP  which have not been taken into account in determining PSLP's net returns. To the extent that such overhead expenses had been included as fund expenses of PSLP  net returns would have been lower. The S&P 500 Total Return Index (""index"") has been selected for purposes of comparing the performance of an investment in the Company or PSLP  as applicable  with a well-known  broad-based equity benchmark. The statistical data regarding the index has been obtained from Bloomberg and the returns are calculated assuming all dividends are reinvested.

This report reflects the contributors and detractors to the performance of the portfolio of the Company. Other than bond interest expense  positions with contributions or detractions to performance of 50 basis points or more are listed separately  while positions with contributions or detractions to performance of less than 50 basis points are aggregated. The contributions and detractions to performance presented herein are based on gross returns which do not reflect the deduction of certain fees or expenses charged to the Company  including  without limitation  management fees and accrued performance allocation/ fees (if any). Inclusion of such fees and expenses would produce lower returns than presented here. In addition  at times  Pershing Square may engage in hedging transactions to seek to reduce risk in the portfolio  including investment- specific hedges that do not relate to the underlying securities of an issuer in which the Company is invested. For each issuer  the gross returns reflected herein (i) include only returns on the investment in the underlying issuer and the hedge positions that directly relate to the securities that reference the underlying issuer (e.g.  if the Company was long Issuer A stock and also purchased puts on Issuer A stock  the gross return reflects the profit/loss on the stock and the profit/loss on the put); (II) do not reflect the cost/ benefit of hedges that do not relate to the securities that reference the underlying issuer (e.g.  if the Company was long Issuer A stock and short Issuer B stock  the profit/loss on the Issuer B stock is not included in the gross returns attributable to the investment in Issuer A); and (III) do not reflect the cost/ benefit of portfolio hedges. Performance with respect to currency hedging related to a specific issuer is included in the overall performance attribution of such issuer. For all other currency derivatives  the long/short classification is determined by the non-USD leg of the derivative. For example  a long USD call/GBP put option position would be considered a short exposure  and a long USD put/GBP call option would be considered a long exposure. The contributors and detractors to the gross returns presented herein are for illustrative purposes only. The securities on this list may not have been held by the Company for the entire calendar year. All investments involve risk including the loss of principal.

Aug. 26  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published the updated Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidance granting preferential recommendation for specific flu vaccines in people age 65+ in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)  a journal highlighting the latest in public health news and communicating recommendations derived from science-based research.5Sanofi's Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) and Flublok® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) were among the flu vaccines preferentially recommended by the CDC ACIP for adults 65+. The recommendation included the use of specific flu vaccines for adults 65+ including higher dose vaccines. If none of these are available at the time of administration  people in this age group should get any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine instead.6Influenza disproportionately impacts the 65+ population  underrepresented communities  and people with co-morbidities such as diabetes  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and heart disease.7 Since 2010  the CDC estimates between 70% and 85% of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65+  and between 50% and 70% of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations have occurred among people in this age group.8 The ACIP flu vaccination guidance will ensure the high-risk population of adults 65+ are immunized with the vaccine best suited for their needs.Michael Greenberg  MD  MPHNorth America Medical Head of Vaccines at Sanofi""We remain committed to ensuring adults 65 and older have access to flu vaccines  demonstrated to protect them from what really matters  such as flu-related hospitalizations due to cardiovascular events and pneumonia. While the ACIP's guidance is a good first step  as a leader in flu vaccines  we believe more can be done to provide healthcare providers with additional guidance.""About Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) and Flublok® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine)Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent are indicated for immunization against disease caused by influenza A and B strains contained in the vaccine. Flublok Quadrivalent is given to people 18 years of age and older. Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent is given to people 65 years of age and older.1 2With protection against four flu strains  Fluzone High-Dose is the only influenza vaccine licensed for use in adults 65 years of age and older to have demonstrated superior efficacy in a randomized controlled trial versus a standard dose influenza vaccine for the prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza illness and the only influenza vaccine with 10 years of data demonstrating protection from flu and its related complications.2 3 a b In a meta-analysis of 15 published reports  including approximately 34 million people  those who received Fluzone High-Dose experienced approximately an 18% reduction in cardiorespiratory hospitalizations and 28% decrease in pneumonia hospitalizations  both of which are reductions above what the standard dose vaccines provided.3Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent builds on the legacy of the trivalent formulation  which was clinically proven to be 24.2% more effective at preventing flu than standard-dose Fluzone (Influenza Vaccine) in adults 65+.9 Based on data from Fluzone High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine)  side effects were slightly more frequent after vaccination with Fluzone High-Dose compared to a standard-dose vaccine.10The efficacy of trivalent formulation is relevant to Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent since both products are manufactured according to the same process and have overlapping compositions.2Flublok Quadrivalent is the first and only recombinant influenza vaccine for adults 18+ proven in a clinical study to be 30% more effective than a standard dose vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent [Influenza Vaccine]) at preventing flu infection in over 9 000 adults 50+.1 In adults 50+  the most common side effects were tenderness  and/or pain at the injection site; headache  and tiredness.1 The effectiveness of Flublok Quadrivalent was also judged by data from general day-to-day medical practice amongst more than 12 million adults 65 years and older  vaccination with Flublok Quadrivalent was compared to standard dose vaccines: this analysis of data captured during day-to-day medical practice of Medicare fee-for-service claims collected from during the 2019-2020 influenza season. A 5-vaccine relative effectiveness analysis showed Flublok Quadrivalent had 13.3% fewer flu-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits versus an egg-based standard dose quadrivalent flu vaccine. The other influenza vaccines evaluated within the study (Fluad  Fluzone High-Dose and Flucelvax Quadrivalent)  also showed fewer flu-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits (8.2%  6.8% and 2.8%  respectively) versus an egg-based standard dose quadrivalent flu vaccine. These data are based on one of three primary analyses. Two additional primary analyses were also conducted: two vaccine analyses comparing cell-derived inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine with an egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) and a quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) with IIV4.Specific characteristics of 2019-2020 season  such as varied strain circulation  may have impacted results. Study limitations include lack of access to information to confirm specific viral cases may have reduced the impact of comparisons made in the study and distortion caused by unlimited variables could have affected results. In addition  the study period was cut off at the end of February 2020 to avoid potential bias from the overlap between influenza season and the escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. This study was conducted by the FDA and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.aProven superiority in a clinical trial between Fluzone High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine) (trivalent formulation) and a standard-dose influenza vaccine2bIncludes 10 years of evidence (2009-2019) with Fluzone High-Dose (trivalent formulation)3Important Safety Information for Flublok® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) and Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine)Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine (including eggs or egg products for Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent). In addition  Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction after previous dose of any influenza vaccine.Tell your health care provider if you have ever had Guillain-Barré syndrome (severe muscle weakness) after a previous influenza vaccination.If Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent are given to people with a compromised immune system  including those receiving therapies that suppress the immune system  the immune response may be lower than expected.Vaccination with Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent may not protect all people who receive the vaccine.For Flublok Quadrivalent  in adults 18 through 49 years of age  the most common side effects were tenderness  and/or pain where you got the shot; headache  tiredness  muscle aches  and joint pain. In adults 50 years of age and older the most common side effects were tenderness  and/or pain where you got the shot; headache  and tiredness.For Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent  in adults 65 years of age and older  the most common side effects were pain  redness  and/or swelling where you got the shot; muscle aches  headache  and general discomfort.For Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent  other side effects may occur.Please see the Prescribing Information for Flublok Quadrivalent.

Inquire here: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchase-enquiry/17017The basic segment to dominate the global market in terms of revenue by 2031Based on the type  the basic (under $50/month) segment contributed to the highest market share in 2021  accounting for more than half of the global equity management software market. Reportedly  this segment is predicted to contribute majorly toward overall market share by 2031. The growth of the basic (under $50/month) segment over the forecast period can be attributed to the massive use of basic equity management software in small and medium-sized enterprises. However  the senior (above $100/month) segment is predicted to register the fastest CAGR of nearly 19.4% from 2022 to 2031. The segmental growth can be credited to the massive demand for senior (above $100/month) equity management software as it offers an all-in-one tool enabling firms to easily handle shareholder communication  organize meetings  and generate reports. The report also provides an overall analysis of the segments such as the standard ($50-$100/month) segment.The large enterprises segment to hold the major market share over 2022-2031On basis of enterprise size  the large enterprises segment accounted for the highest market share in 2021  contributing nearly three-fourths of the global equity management software market. The segmental expansion over the forecast timeline can be attributed to the massive demand for equity management software in large enterprises. However  the small and medium-sized enterprises segment is projected to record the highest CAGR of about 16.1% in 2031. The growth of the segment can be credited to an increase in employee efficiency in small and medium-sized firms through the use of equity management software.The private corporation segment to dominate the global market by 2031In terms of application  the private corporation segment contributed to the major share in 2021  accounting for one-third of the global market share. The growth of this segment can be attributed to a huge demand for equity management software in private corporations. However  the listed company segment is predicted to account for the highest share in 2031  owing to the growing popularity of the product in listed firms. Nonetheless  the start-ups segment is expected to register the highest CAGR of 16.2% during the forecast period. The segmental growth can be credited to an increase in the number of start-ups contributing majorly to the global equity management software market size.North American to retain domination over 2022-2031By Region  North America contributed notably toward the global equity management software market share in 2021  and is projected to continue its dominance during the forecast period. The region accounted for more than one-third of the global market share in 2021.
