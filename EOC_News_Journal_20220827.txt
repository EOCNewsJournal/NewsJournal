In the event that the Early Participation Deadline is extended  noteholders that validly tender prior to the expiry of the Early Participation Deadline  but after the receipt of the Required Consents (as described herein) may only be eligible to receive the Tender Offer Consideration and the Early Tender Payment  but would not be eligible to receive the Consent Payment.(3) Subject to proration as described herein.(4) Not subject to proration.The Noteholders have the option of only delivering their consent to the Proposed Amendments  in which case they are eligible to receive only the Consent Payment or tender their Notes (which will constitute a deemed consent to the Proposed Amendments)  in which case they are eligible to receive the Total Tender Consideration  including the Consent Payment  and such Consent Payment will be paid regardless of whether or not such tendered Notes will be prorated or not.

The Consent Payment is not subject to any proration.Transaction RationaleOn August 12  2022  the Offeror completed the sale of approximately 2 000 of its towers to Phoenix Tower International Chile SpA (""Phoenix""). As part of the transaction  the Offeror also entered into master lease agreements relating to the towers and also agreed to  subject to the achievement of certain milestones  build and sell additional towers to Phoenix (all of these transactions  together the ""Towers Sales"") over the next several years.The Towers Sales have had several transformational impacts on the Group's business and the Proposed Amendments are intended to give the Group optimal flexibility to operate its business following such sale.As part of the Towers Sales and the resulting leaseback of the towers necessary to operate its business  the Group will incur (and expects to continue to incur) a substantial amount of lease liabilities  which following the implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases)  would be considered Indebtedness for the purposes of the Indentures and the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage and related calculations thereunder.Likewise  the Group has already contracted to make sales of additional towers that are currently under construction  which will result in the Group receiving more proceeds from towers sales in the future.Purchase PriceTender Offer for 2024 NotesNoteholders of the 2024 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions by the Early Participation Deadline will  to the extent their 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase and are eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment  receive consideration of US$995.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2024 Notes Total Consideration"")  which comprises consideration of US$952.50 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered (the ""2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration"")  plus consideration of US$30.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2024 Notes Early Tender Payment"")  plus the 2024 Notes Consent Payment. The 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment are subject to proration and therefore  any Noteholders that tender 2024 Notes and such tendered 2024 Notes are prorated  will be eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Total Consideration only for the portion of such tendered 2024 Notes that are accepted for purchase. The 2024 Notes Consent Payment is not subject to any proration  and therefore  Noteholders who timely tender their 2024 Notes (which will constitute a deemed consent to the Proposed Amendments)  will be eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment regardless of whether or not such tendered 2024 Notes are prorated. Noteholders of the 2024 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions after the Early Participation Deadline  but prior to the Expiration Deadline  will  to the extent their 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase  receive the 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration only  without the 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment. In all cases  Noteholders whose 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest on such Notes.Tender Offer for 2028 NotesNoteholders of the 2028 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions by the Early Participation Deadline will  to the extent their 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase and are eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment  receive consideration of US$832.50 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2028 Notes Total Consideration"")  which comprises consideration of US$785.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered (the ""2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration"")  plus consideration of US$30.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2028 Notes Early Tender Payment"")  plus the 2028 Notes Consent Payment. The 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment are subject to proration and therefore  any Noteholders that tender 2028 Notes and such tendered 2028 Notes are prorated  will be eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Total Consideration only for the portion of such tendered 2028 Notes that are accepted for purchase. The 2028 Notes Consent Payment is not subject to any proration  and therefore  Noteholders who timely tender their 2028 Notes (which will constitute a deemed consent to the Proposed Amendments)  will be eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment regardless of whether or not such tendered 2028 Notes are prorated. Noteholders of the 2028 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions after the Early Participation Deadline  but prior to the Expiration Deadline  will  to the extent their 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase  receive the 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration only  without the 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment. In all cases  Noteholders whose 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest on such Notes.In the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum  the 2024 Notes Total Consideration and the 2028 Notes Total Consideration are each referred to separately as the ""Total Tender Consideration""  the 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and the 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration are each referred to separately as an ""Tender Offer Consideration"" and the 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment and the 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment are each referred to separately as an ""Early Tender Payment"".Consent SolicitationsBefore the Early Participation Deadline  (i) holders of 2024 Notes that validly deliver their consent to the Proposed Amendments  either via a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction  and are eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment will be eligible to receive consideration in cash of US$12.50 per US$1 000 principal amount of 2024 Notes (the ""2024 Notes Consent Payment"") and (ii) holders of 2028 Notes that validly deliver their consent to the Proposed Amendments  either via a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction and are eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment  will be eligible to receive consideration in cash of US$17.50 per US$1 000 principal amount of 2028 Notes (the ""2028 Notes Consent Payment""). In the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum  the 2024 Notes Consent Payment and the 2028 Notes Consent Payment are each referred to separately as the ""Consent Payment"". The payment of the relevant Consent Payment is irrespective of whether such Notes are subject to proration pursuant to the Tender Offers  provided the applicable Relevant Conditions are satisfied and such Supplemental Indenture becomes effective. A valid tender of Notes under a Tender Instruction prior to the Early Participation Deadline will constitute a consent  and a Noteholder which validly tenders their Notes will receive the Total Tender Consideration (assuming they validly submit Tender Instructions before the Early Participation Deadline and are eligible to receive the Consent Payment) subject to proration of the relevant Tender Offer Consideration and Early Tender Payment. For the avoidance of doubt  there will be no proration applied to the consent solicitation and the payment of the Consent Payment and no Consent Payment will be made to any Noteholder who tenders their Notes after the Early Participation Deadline  unless they have submitted a valid Consent Only Instruction prior to such date.Noteholders may also submit a Consent Only Instruction and no Tender Instruction  in which case they will receive only the Consent Payment  provided the Consent Only Instruction is received prior to the Early Participation Deadline  the applicable Relevant Conditions are satisfied and the relevant Supplemental Indenture becomes effective  but not the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Tender Consideration. If the Early Participation Deadline is extended for either or both of the series of Notes  the Issuer reserves the right to execute and deliver the Supplemental Indentures at any time the relevant Required Consents are obtained and the relevant Supplemental Indenture will be effective upon execution but the Proposed Amendments will only become operative once the Consent Payment is made with respect to the relevant series of Notes and the Relevant Conditions are satisfied or waived. In such a scenario  the Consent Payment will only be paid to those Holders who validly consent before the receipt of the relevant Required Consents  as applicable.A Noteholder which takes no action to either submit a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction will receive no consideration with respect to the Offers  however  subject to the Relevant Conditions being satisfied for the applicable series  such Noteholder's Notes will be subject to the Proposed Amendments once the relevant Consent Payment is paid to the Noteholders  and the respective Supplemental Indenture becomes operative  of the applicable series which did deliver a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction.Indicative Timetable for the OffersDate and time (all times are New York time  unless otherwise stated) Event August 26  2022.........................................

The Consent Payment is not subject to any proration.Transaction RationaleOn August 12  2022  the Offeror completed the sale of approximately 2 000 of its towers to Phoenix Tower International Chile SpA (""Phoenix""). As part of the transaction  the Offeror also entered into master lease agreements relating to the towers and also agreed to  subject to the achievement of certain milestones  build and sell additional towers to Phoenix (all of these transactions  together the ""Towers Sales"") over the next several years.The Towers Sales have had several transformational impacts on the Group's business and the Proposed Amendments are intended to give the Group optimal flexibility to operate its business following such sale.As part of the Towers Sales and the resulting leaseback of the towers necessary to operate its business  the Group will incur (and expects to continue to incur) a substantial amount of lease liabilities  which following the implementation of IFRS 16 (Leases)  would be considered Indebtedness for the purposes of the Indentures and the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage and related calculations thereunder.Likewise  the Group has already contracted to make sales of additional towers that are currently under construction  which will result in the Group receiving more proceeds from towers sales in the future.Purchase PriceTender Offer for 2024 NotesNoteholders of the 2024 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions by the Early Participation Deadline will  to the extent their 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase and are eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment  receive consideration of US$995.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2024 Notes Total Consideration"")  which comprises consideration of US$952.50 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered (the ""2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration"")  plus consideration of US$30.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2024 Notes Early Tender Payment"")  plus the 2024 Notes Consent Payment. The 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment are subject to proration and therefore  any Noteholders that tender 2024 Notes and such tendered 2024 Notes are prorated  will be eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Total Consideration only for the portion of such tendered 2024 Notes that are accepted for purchase. The 2024 Notes Consent Payment is not subject to any proration  and therefore  Noteholders who timely tender their 2024 Notes (which will constitute a deemed consent to the Proposed Amendments)  will be eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment regardless of whether or not such tendered 2024 Notes are prorated. Noteholders of the 2024 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions after the Early Participation Deadline  but prior to the Expiration Deadline  will  to the extent their 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase  receive the 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration only  without the 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment. In all cases  Noteholders whose 2024 Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest on such Notes.Tender Offer for 2028 NotesNoteholders of the 2028 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions by the Early Participation Deadline will  to the extent their 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase and are eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment  receive consideration of US$832.50 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2028 Notes Total Consideration"")  which comprises consideration of US$785.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered (the ""2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration"")  plus consideration of US$30.00 in cash per US$1 000 principal amount of the 2028 Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Participation Deadline (the ""2028 Notes Early Tender Payment"")  plus the 2028 Notes Consent Payment. The 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment are subject to proration and therefore  any Noteholders that tender 2028 Notes and such tendered 2028 Notes are prorated  will be eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Total Consideration only for the portion of such tendered 2028 Notes that are accepted for purchase. The 2028 Notes Consent Payment is not subject to any proration  and therefore  Noteholders who timely tender their 2028 Notes (which will constitute a deemed consent to the Proposed Amendments)  will be eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment regardless of whether or not such tendered 2028 Notes are prorated. Noteholders of the 2028 Notes that validly submit Tender Instructions after the Early Participation Deadline  but prior to the Expiration Deadline  will  to the extent their 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase  receive the 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration only  without the 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment. In all cases  Noteholders whose 2028 Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest on such Notes.In the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum  the 2024 Notes Total Consideration and the 2028 Notes Total Consideration are each referred to separately as the ""Total Tender Consideration""  the 2024 Notes Tender Offer Consideration and the 2028 Notes Tender Offer Consideration are each referred to separately as an ""Tender Offer Consideration"" and the 2024 Notes Early Tender Payment and the 2028 Notes Early Tender Payment are each referred to separately as an ""Early Tender Payment"".Consent SolicitationsBefore the Early Participation Deadline  (i) holders of 2024 Notes that validly deliver their consent to the Proposed Amendments  either via a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction  and are eligible to receive the 2024 Notes Consent Payment will be eligible to receive consideration in cash of US$12.50 per US$1 000 principal amount of 2024 Notes (the ""2024 Notes Consent Payment"") and (ii) holders of 2028 Notes that validly deliver their consent to the Proposed Amendments  either via a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction and are eligible to receive the 2028 Notes Consent Payment  will be eligible to receive consideration in cash of US$17.50 per US$1 000 principal amount of 2028 Notes (the ""2028 Notes Consent Payment""). In the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum  the 2024 Notes Consent Payment and the 2028 Notes Consent Payment are each referred to separately as the ""Consent Payment"". The payment of the relevant Consent Payment is irrespective of whether such Notes are subject to proration pursuant to the Tender Offers  provided the applicable Relevant Conditions are satisfied and such Supplemental Indenture becomes effective. A valid tender of Notes under a Tender Instruction prior to the Early Participation Deadline will constitute a consent  and a Noteholder which validly tenders their Notes will receive the Total Tender Consideration (assuming they validly submit Tender Instructions before the Early Participation Deadline and are eligible to receive the Consent Payment) subject to proration of the relevant Tender Offer Consideration and Early Tender Payment. For the avoidance of doubt  there will be no proration applied to the consent solicitation and the payment of the Consent Payment and no Consent Payment will be made to any Noteholder who tenders their Notes after the Early Participation Deadline  unless they have submitted a valid Consent Only Instruction prior to such date.Noteholders may also submit a Consent Only Instruction and no Tender Instruction  in which case they will receive only the Consent Payment  provided the Consent Only Instruction is received prior to the Early Participation Deadline  the applicable Relevant Conditions are satisfied and the relevant Supplemental Indenture becomes effective  but not the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Tender Consideration. If the Early Participation Deadline is extended for either or both of the series of Notes  the Issuer reserves the right to execute and deliver the Supplemental Indentures at any time the relevant Required Consents are obtained and the relevant Supplemental Indenture will be effective upon execution but the Proposed Amendments will only become operative once the Consent Payment is made with respect to the relevant series of Notes and the Relevant Conditions are satisfied or waived. In such a scenario  the Consent Payment will only be paid to those Holders who validly consent before the receipt of the relevant Required Consents  as applicable.A Noteholder which takes no action to either submit a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction will receive no consideration with respect to the Offers  however  subject to the Relevant Conditions being satisfied for the applicable series  such Noteholder's Notes will be subject to the Proposed Amendments once the relevant Consent Payment is paid to the Noteholders  and the respective Supplemental Indenture becomes operative  of the applicable series which did deliver a Tender Instruction or a Consent Only Instruction.Indicative Timetable for the OffersDate and time (all times are New York time  unless otherwise stated) Event August 26  2022.........................................

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File PhotoSummarySummary Companies Hamilton Lane  Partners Group considering more fund tokenisationAbrdn  Schroders looking at the sectorTokenisation of illiquid assets still risky  FSB saysLONDON  Aug 26 (Reuters) - Investors in crypto have endured wild moves in recent months  but this has not fazed asset managers who are preparing to use the blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies to break funds into bite-sized units  or tokens  to sell to small savers.Bitcoin fell 7.7% in the space of just a few minutes on one day last week  following a 15% drop on one day in June as aggressive rate hikes by major central banks and ultra-high inflation prompted investors to ditch high-risk assets. read moreThe sector is also facing other issues  with Celsius this week suing a former investment manager for losing or stealing tens of millions of dollars in assets before the crypto lender went bankrupt last month. read moreRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterHowever  private markets investment firms Hamilton Lane (HLNE.O) and Partners Group have tokenised funds in the past year and said they were considering further products.Mainstream asset manager abrdn (ABDN.L) hopes to launch a tokenised fund this year  according to a source familiar with the matter  and rival Schroders (SDR.L) is also investing in the sector.In such funds  tokens are issued through a security offering which gives the investor the right to participate.Blockchain allows the tokens  or fund fractions  to be securely managed  proponents say  and can help small investors to buy illiquid assets like private equity  which tend to offer higher returns but can be hard to trade in and out of quickly.""Every asset manager who has the ambition to offer private markets to their clients and be a leader in that space will look into blockchain technology "" said Magnus Burkl  principal at consultants Oliver Wyman.Some potential investors are  however  wary of the close link between the technology and cryptocurrencies. Fred Shaw  Hamilton Lane's global head of operations  said the firm has been helping investors to understand that crypto and blockchain are not the same thing.""Blockchain is the underlying technology but (crypto) is only one use of it.""A Partners Group spokesperson said the firm was seeing the understanding of the difference between tokenisation and cryptocurrencies ""slowly improving"".ASSOCIATION RISKSCrypto woes caused a U.S. private markets manager client to hold off on launching a tokenised fund earlier this year because of the reputational risk  but it now plans to go ahead soon  said Carlos Domingo  CEO of investment platform Securitize  which launched tokenised funds tracking two S&P indices late last year.Because of the risks associated with illiquid assets  many funds investing in such assets are only open to professional investors  requiring minimum investments of $10 million.By using the blockchain technology  fund managers can offer fractions of these assets  for a fraction of the initial outlay.The tokens will enable secondary markets to develop  providing more liquidity  industry specialists say  though the Financial Stability Board has warned that this still leaves retail investors exposed to the underlying illiquid assets  which are difficult to exit quickly if prices fall.The technology can also cut costs for both asset managers and investors  the specialists say.Fund administrators and stock exchanges are trying to improve the market infrastructure to make it easier to offer tokenised funds.Euronext owns a stake in Luxembourg tokenisation platform Tokeny  and Singapore Exchange has a stake in ADDX  where Partners Group and Hamilton Lane launched their tokenised offerings.London Stock Exchange (LSEG.L) is working with fund technology firm FundAdminChain on a pilot for several tokenised funds. read moreHurdles remain.

Fred Shaw  Hamilton Lane's global head of operations  said the firm has been helping investors to understand that crypto and blockchain are not the same thing.""Blockchain is the underlying technology but (crypto) is only one use of it.""Story continuesA Partners Group spokesperson said the firm was seeing the understanding of the difference between tokenisation and cryptocurrencies ""slowly improving"".ASSOCIATION RISKSCrypto woes caused a U.S. private markets manager client to hold off on launching a tokenised fund earlier this year because of the reputational risk  but it now plans to go ahead soon  said Carlos Domingo  CEO of investment platform Securitize  which launched tokenised funds tracking two S&P indices late last year.Because of the risks associated with illiquid assets  many funds investing in such assets are only open to professional investors  requiring minimum investments of $10 million.By using the blockchain technology  fund managers can offer fractions of these assets  for a fraction of the initial outlay.The tokens will enable secondary markets to develop  providing more liquidity  industry specialists say  though the Financial Stability Board has warned that this still leaves retail investors exposed to the underlying illiquid assets  which are difficult to exit quickly if prices fall.The technology can also cut costs for both asset managers and investors  the specialists say.Fund administrators and stock exchanges are trying to improve the market infrastructure to make it easier to offer tokenised funds.Euronext owns a stake in Luxembourg tokenisation platform Tokeny  and Singapore Exchange has a stake in ADDX  where Partners Group and Hamilton Lane launched their tokenised offerings.London Stock Exchange is working with fund technology firm FundAdminChain on a pilot for several tokenised funds.Hurdles remain. Arun Srivastava  partner at law firm Paul Hastings  said regulators may continue to remain unwilling to allow retail investors to invest in illiquid assets  whether tokenised or not.""To say 'we've got this blockchain product' sounds good and sounds like you're keeping up with the crypto world  but how is it any different or any better?""(Reporting by Carolyn Cohn; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",neutral,0.05,0.59,0.36,mixed,0.14,0.12,0.74,True,English,"['Asset managers', 'fund tokens', 'crypto turmoil', 'U.S. private markets manager client', 'two S&P indices', 'Mainstream asset manager abrdn', 'private markets investment firms', 'A Partners Group spokesperson', 'former investment manager', 'aggressive rate hikes', 'major central banks', 'Financial Stability Board', 'Luxembourg tokenisation platform', 'London Stock Exchange', 'several tokenised funds', 'underlying illiquid assets', 'fund technology firm', 'private equity', 'investment platform', 'secondary markets', 'asset managers', 'stock exchanges', 'Singapore Exchange', 'underlying technology', 'fund managers', 'Fund administrators', 'tokenised offerings', 'Carolyn Cohn', 'wild moves', 'recent months', 'bite-sized units', 'small savers', 'one day', 'ultra-high inflation', 'other issues', 'Hamilton Lane', 'past year', 'rival Schroders', 'security offering', 'higher returns', 'Magnus Burkl', 'Oliver Wyman', 'close link', 'Fred Shaw', 'global head', 'same thing', 'one use', 'reputational risk', 'Carlos Domingo', 'minimum investments', 'initial outlay', 'market infrastructure', 'Arun Srivastava', 'Paul Hastings', 'Emelia Sithole-Matarise', 'high-risk assets', 'law firm', 'many funds', 'fund fractions', 'blockchain product', 'small investors', 'potential investors', 'professional investors', 'retail investors', 'crypto lender', 'ASSOCIATION RISKS', 'Crypto woes', 'industry specialists', 'crypto world', 'blockchain technology', 'Reuters', 'cryptocurrencies', 'tokens', 'Bitcoin', 'space', 'minutes', '15% drop', 'June', 'sector', 'Celsius', 'tens', 'millions', 'dollars', 'products', 'source', 'matter', 'right', 'proponents', 'ambition', 'clients', 'leader', 'principal', 'consultants', 'operations', 'Story', 'understanding', 'difference', 'CEO', 'Securitize', 'liquidity', 'prices', 'costs', 'Euronext', 'stake', 'Tokeny', 'ADDX', 'FundAdminChain', 'pilot', 'Hurdles', 'regulators', 'Editing']",2022-08-26,2022-08-27,finance.yahoo.com

The consortium made a request for access to this information on 28 July 2022 and the Board of Directors of Ramsay Générale de Santé responded on 5 August 2022 by requesting that the consortium provide information customary in such circumstances in order to be able to assess this request.On 26 August 2022  Ramsay Health Care Limited issued a statement indicating that it had received a further letter from the consortium informing it that the consortium was withdrawing its initial indicative offer to acquire 100% of the share capital of Ramsay Health Care Limited for cash and was no longer seeking access to Ramsay Health's non-public information.The announcements state that the consortium has proposed an alternative structure to Ramsay Health Care Limited under which Ramsay Health Care Limited shareholders would receive  for their first 5 000 shares  a cash price of A$88 per share and  in excess of the first 5 000 shares  a cash price of A$78.20 and approximately 0.22 of a Ramsay Générale de Santé share  for each Ramsay Health Care Limited share.Ramsay Health Care Limited’s announcements also state that the alternative proposal was considered by the Ramsay Health Care Limited Board to be meaningfully inferior to the initial indicative offer and that the Board determined not to engage further in relation to the alternative proposal. Ramsay Health Care Limited has indicated that it remains open to discussions with the consortium to determine whether it can submit an improved binding proposal that is capable of recommendation by its board.Story continuesThe full press releases issued by Ramsay Health Care Limited can be viewed on the Ramsay Health Care Limited website (www.ramsayhealth.com).About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

Fred Shaw  Hamilton Lane's global head of operations  said the firm has been helping investors to understand that crypto and blockchain are not the same thing.""Blockchain is the underlying technology but (crypto) is only one use of it.""A Partners Group spokesperson said the firm was seeing the understanding of the difference between tokenisation and cryptocurrencies ""slowly improving"".ASSOCIATION RISKSCrypto woes caused a US private markets manager client to hold off on launching a tokenised fund earlier this year because of the reputational risk  but it now plans to go ahead soon  said Carlos Domingo  CEO of investment platform Securitize  which launched tokenised funds tracking two S&P indices late last year.Because of the risks associated with illiquid assets  many funds investing in such assets are only open to professional investors  requiring minimum investments of US$10 million.By using the blockchain technology  fund managers can offer fractions of these assets  for a fraction of the initial outlay.The tokens will enable secondary markets to develop  providing more liquidity  industry specialists say  though the Financial Stability Board has warned that this still leaves retail investors exposed to the underlying illiquid assets  which are difficult to exit quickly if prices fall.The technology can also cut costs for both asset managers and investors  the specialists say.Fund administrators and stock exchanges are trying to improve the market infrastructure to make it easier to offer tokenised funds.Euronext owns a stake in Luxembourg tokenisation platform Tokeny  and Singapore Exchange has a stake in ADDX  where Partners Group and Hamilton Lane launched their tokenised offerings.London Stock Exchange is working with fund technology firm FundAdminChain on a pilot for several tokenised funds.Hurdles remain. Arun Srivastava  partner at law firm Paul Hastings  said regulators may continue to remain unwilling to allow retail investors to invest in illiquid assets  whether tokenised or not.""To say 'we've got this blockchain product' sounds good and sounds like you're keeping up with the crypto world  but how is it any different or any better?""",neutral,0.05,0.59,0.36,mixed,0.1,0.09,0.81,True,English,"['Asset managers', 'fund tokens', 'crypto turmoil', 'US private markets manager client', 'two S&P indices', 'Mainstream asset manager abrdn', 'private markets investment firms', 'A Partners Group spokesperson', 'former investment manager', '15 per cent drop', 'aggressive rate hikes', 'major central banks', 'Financial Stability Board', 'Luxembourg tokenisation platform', 'London Stock Exchange', 'several tokenised funds', 'underlying illiquid assets', 'fund technology firm', 'investment platform', 'private equity', 'secondary markets', 'asset managers', 'stock exchanges', 'Singapore Exchange', 'underlying technology', 'fund managers', 'Fund administrators', 'tokenised offerings', 'wild moves', 'recent months', 'bite-sized units', 'small savers', 'one day', 'ultra-high inflation', 'other issues', 'Hamilton Lane', 'past year', 'rival Schroders', 'security offering', 'higher returns', 'Magnus Burkl', 'Oliver Wyman', 'close link', 'Fred Shaw', 'global head', 'same thing', 'one use', 'reputational risk', 'Carlos Domingo', 'minimum investments', 'initial outlay', 'market infrastructure', 'Arun Srivastava', 'Paul Hastings', 'high-risk assets', 'law firm', 'many funds', 'fund fractions', 'blockchain product', 'small investors', 'potential investors', 'professional investors', 'retail investors', 'crypto lender', 'ASSOCIATION RISKS', 'Crypto woes', 'industry specialists', 'crypto world', 'blockchain technology', 'cryptocurrencies', 'tokens', 'Bitcoin', 'space', 'minutes', 'June', 'sector', 'Celsius', 'tens', 'millions', 'dollars', 'products', 'source', 'matter', 'right', 'proponents', 'ambition', 'clients', 'leader', 'principal', 'consultants', 'operations', 'understanding', 'difference', 'CEO', 'Securitize', 'liquidity', 'prices', 'costs', 'Euronext', 'stake', 'Tokeny', 'ADDX', 'FundAdminChain', 'pilot', 'Hurdles', 'regulators']",2022-08-26,2022-08-27,channelnewsasia.com

Reportedly  this segment is predicted to contribute majorly toward overall market share by 2031. The growth of the basic (under $50/month) segment over the forecast period can be attributed to the massive use of basic equity management software in small and medium-sized enterprises. However  the senior (above $100/month) segment is predicted to register the fastest CAGR of nearly 19.4% from 2022 to 2031. The segmental growth can be credited to the massive demand for senior (above $100/month) equity management software as it offers an all-in-one tool enabling firms to easily handle shareholder communication  organize meetings  and generate reports. The report also provides an overall analysis of the segments such as the standard ($50-$100/month) segment.The large enterprises segment to hold the major market share over 2022-2031On basis of enterprise size  the large enterprises segment accounted for the highest market share in 2021  contributing nearly three-fourths of the global equity management software market.

The region accounted for more than one-third of the global market share in 2021. The growth of the market in the region over the forecast timespan can be credited to growing product penetration in large  small  and medium-sized firms in countries such as the U.S. and Canada.

This growth was realised despite a more prudent approach by e-commerce sector of which a number of major players have shifted their take-up focus towards 2024 and beyond.”Jan Van Geet continued: “The unstable energy markets have not only given a significant boost to our renewable energy revenue potential  it has also served as an accelerator in our tenants’ desire to switch to renewable energy consumption. Beyond the traditional stronghold countries of Germany and the Netherlands we are now initiating solar projects in almost all regions based on direct tenant demand.”Story continuesJan Van Geet added: “Although we have taken a more cautious approach to our land acquisitions during the first half of the year  an important side effect of these unstable energy markets is that it creates tremendous growth opportunities for us. After all  it accelerates the need for energy-inefficient industries to reinvent themselves and move to more sustainable and energy-efficient housing and operations. One of the side effects of this is that they are putting their old factories  mostly in prime locations  up for sale which consequently offers interesting brownfield redevelopment opportunities for VGP.""Jan Van Geet concluded: “A strong capital position is important  particularly as such highly attractive brownfield opportunities start to increasingly arise. The significant cash recycling through the completed and anticipated joint venture closings enhances our balance sheet and allows us the flexibility to best serve our whilst enabling us to create significant value for all stakeholders involved.”FINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTSNew leases signedAs at 30 June 2022  the signed and renewed rental income amounted to € 35.4 million (up 9.7% YTD).Leasing activity year-to-date has been strong across the board with increased demand from a broad range of tenants. From a geographical perspective  Germany contributed circa a third of new leases and particular strong activity was noted in Spain  The Netherlands and Slovakia.The increase was driven by 416 000 m² of new lease agreements signed  corresponding to € 22.4 million of new annualised rental income3  whilst during same period for a total of 173 500 m² of lease agreements were renewed and extended corresponding to € 9.3 million of annualised rental income (of which € 8.2 million related to the joint ventures4). Indexation accounted for € 3.6 million in the first half of 2022 (of which € 3.2 million related to the joint ventures²). Terminations represented a total of €1.0 million or 19 000 m²  of which € 0.8 million within the joint ventures’ portfolio.The signed annualised committed leases total € 281.1 million5 (equivalent to 4.9 million m² of lettable area)  a 9.7% increase since December 2021.The leasing activity after 30 June 2022 has resulted in an additional € 6.1 million of new contracts being signed bringing the total annualised committed rental income to € 287.8 million (+12.4% YTD).Construction activityA total of 40 projects under construction which will create 1 346 000 m² of future lettable area  representing € 88.1 million of annualised leases once built and fully let – the portfolio under construction is 87.4% pre-let as at 30 June 2022.During the first 6 months of 2022 a total of 17 projects were completed delivering 334 000 m² of lettable area  representing € 17.1 million of annualised committed leases. Several other projects currently under construction are scheduled for delivery in the coming months resulting in a delivery pipeline of >700 000m2 expected for H2 2022.During H1 we experienced additional increases of construction costs. First signs of stabilization have been noted towards the end of H1. The resulting effects on the development margins of the projects under construction were mitigated through a mix of higher rental income and yield changes.Land bankAcquisition of 1 55 million m² of development land and a further 3.25 million m2 committed subject to permits which brings the remaining total owned and committed land bank for development to 11.31 million m²  which supports more than 5.12 million m² of future lettable area.A further 601 000 m² of new land plots have been identified and are under negotiation and have a development potential of at least 254 000 m² of future lettable area. This brings the land bank of owned  committed  secured and/or under option to 11.91 million m2.The land bank includes an agreement to purchase 32 hectares of land in Petit-Couronne  near Rouen  the capital of Normandy (of which 50% was already acquired during the 1H 2022)  the first project of VGP in France. This brownfield project is expected to offer circa 150 000 m² of total gross lettable area  with construction works due to begin in 2023.Renewable EnergyA total solar power generation capacity of 120.9 MWp is currently installed or under construction through 89 roof-projects in 4 countries. As at 30 June 2022 this represents a total aggregate investment amount of € 48 million.In addition  40 solar power projects have been identified in four additional countries which equates to an additional power generation capacity of 53.7 MWp. For these projects we expect the installation works to commence in the coming months. The current total solar portfolio  including pipeline projects totals 174 MWp.Completion of the 3rd closing with the Second Joint Venture with Allianz Real EstateOn 16th of March 2022  VGP announced the successful third closing with its 50:50 joint venture  VGP European Logistics 2 (‘Second Joint Venture’). The transaction comprised 13 logistic buildings  including 9 buildings in 7 new VGP parks and another 4 newly completed logistic buildings which were developed in parks previously transferred to the Joint Second Venture. The transaction value was € 364 million6 and net proceeds from this transaction amounted to circa € 215.5 million. Following the completion of this third closing  the Second’s Joint Venture’s property portfolio consist of 32 completed buildings representing around 642 000 m² of lettable area  with an 99.8% occupancy rate.On 1 July 2022  two additional closings  one of each with the First and Second Joint Venture occurred for a total gross asset value of € 105 million and with gross cash proceeds for VGP in amount of€ 82 million.A final closing with the Third Joint Venture is anticipated during Q4 2022 upon completion of the Munich construction site  which is within its original time frame. The expected minimum gross proceeds of the transaction totals € 73 million.Finally  during Q4 ’22 VGP expects to sell a seed portfolio of completed projects to the Fourth Joint Venture.Capital and liquidity positionOn the 10th of January 2022  VGP announced the successful issuance of its second public benchmark green bond for an aggregate nominal amount of € 1.0 billion  in two tranches i.e.  a € 500 million 5-year bond tranche paying a coupon of 1.625% p.a. and maturing on 17 January 2027 and a € 500 million 8-year bond tranche paying a coupon of 2.250% p.a. and maturing on 17 January 2030. The proceeds from this issuance are being used to fund the majority pre-let development pipeline  the build out of renewable energy assets and the design and development of new green logistics and semi-industrial parks.Total cash balance as at 30 June 2022 stood at € 648.5 million and increased further on 1 July 2022 with € 82 million following the closings with the First and Second Joint Venture.In August 2022  VGP further strengthened its liquidity position by increasing its committed credit facilities with an additional € 100 million granted under similar terms as the existing credit facilities. As a result  the current committed credit facilities amount to € 300 million  all of which currently remain undrawn.Progress towards our Sustainable Development GoalsWe have made significant progress towards our Sustainable Development Goals and are on track to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and 50% gross reduction under scope 1 and 2 and 55% reduction in 'in use' scope 3 emissions by 2030.With regards to the sustainable building target  the Group targets BREEAM Excellent or DGNB Gold for all new constructions started up in 2022. Currently 61.2% of our portfolio has been certified.In order to allow transparent reporting on the progress on our ESG initiatives we will  in addition to our annual CDP disclosure  2022 GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark) participation and publication of our Corporate Responsibility Reporting in accordance with GRI Standards  participate in the S&P Global CSA 2022 and Sustainalytics 2022 analysis.OutlookAs a result of the strong rental and asset growth and +1 million m2 to be delivered in 2022  VGP’s (along with the JV’s) recurring rental income basis will increase to € 280 million within the next twelve months. This significantly increases the recurring cash generation and delivers an attractive return on the funds invested.VGP has currently been able to mostly mitigate the increased construction costs through a mix of higher rental income and yield compression. Any adverse change in any of the aforementioned components might not be fully offset and hence might have adverse effect on the development margins. We remain prudent and selective on any start-up of new projects to ensure that our development margins remain attractive.The Group opened its first office in Scandinavia with appointment of Kristoffer Kaae Stimpel as country manager for Denmark. The Group anticipates to be able to announce the opening of first office in Sweden in 2H 2022.Based on the combination of our increasing recurring cash flow  our inflation protected portfolio  our strategic land bank and partnership with Allianz Real Estate  in combination with attractive land acquisition opportunities in the markets along with renewable energy dynamics is expected to result in further – solid - NAV growth for VGP.Finally  the expected sale of the seed portfolio to the Fourth Joint Venture during Q4 '22 should further strengthen the Group’s balance sheet.KEY FINANCIAL METRICSOperations and results H1 2022 H1 2021 Change (%) Committed annualised rental income (€mm) 281.1 205.7 36.7% IFRS Operating profit (€mm) 190.5 240.0 (20.6)% IFRS net profit (€mm) 153.1 203.8 (24.9)% IFRS earnings per share (€ per share) 7.01 9.90 (29.2)%Portfolio and balance sheet 30 Jun 22 31 Dec 21 Change (%) Portfolio value  including joint venture at 100% (€mm) 6 534 5 746 13.7% Portfolio value  including joint venture at share (€mm) 4 656 4 084 14.0% Occupancy ratio of standing portfolio (%) 99 99 - EPRA NTA per share (€ per share) 106.97 106.93 0.0% IFRS NAV per share (€ per share) 99.81 99.65 0.2% Net financial debt (€mm) 1 713 1 159 47.8% Gearing7(%) 35.2 29.8 -AUDIO WEBCAST FOR INVESTORS AND ANALYSTSVGP will host an audio webcast at 11:00 (CEST) on 26 August 2022Webcast link:https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1563403&tp_key=c71da089b6 Click on the link above to attend the presentation from your laptop  tablet or mobile device.

Its plants are located in south west Ukraine  away from the front lines in the east of the country.Mr Manifold was speaking to reporters after the group reported bumper results for the first half of the year with sales and margins up despite the inflationary headwinds.In relation to Ukraine  a relatively small part of the overall group  Mr Manifold said operating a cement business with high fixed costs well below its capacity is probably costing the group money.“But it is the right thing to do as a corporate citizen ” he said.In contrast CRH has fully exited Russia  where it operated a business near St Petersburg.“We won’t be going back ” he said.Mr Manifold said the war is not causing economic dislocation in the wider central and eastern European region  an important market for CRH thanks to economic growth and the flood of EU structural funds.What this has done is solidified our sense of who we are as Europeans“(CRH) had seen no step back whatsoever” in investment in the rest of region  he said. In medium to longer term the effect of the invasion of Ukraine will be to pull the region closer to the European core  he said.""What this has done is solidified our sense of who we are as Europeans ” he said.Globally  CRH recorded robust growth in the first half of the year despite rising costs.Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) were $2.2bn (€2.2bn)  up 21pc on the same period last year. Group sales were 14pc ahead of the first half of 2021 at $15bn.The company anticipates full year Ebitda to reach $5.5bn in a “challenging cost environment”  an increase from $5bn recorded in 2021.Management said margins had been protected by its focus on a customer solutions strategy based on selling packages that integrate services and goods which are less price sensitive than traditional commodity materials supply.The company said resilient demand for infrastructure projects and repair  maintenance and improvement works would boost its US operations  by far the biggest contributor to group earnings.European materials sales were 14pc ahead of the same time last year  with the group attributing the rise to “strong pricing momentum across all products” to address the inflationary cost environment.The Irish businesses had a strong start to the year and was flattered by comparison to 2021’s Covid impacted activity.CRH shares were the biggest gainers on the Ftse-100 with a 3.4pc rise.

Click to enlargeInvestment Manager’s Report: LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERSTo the Shareholders of Pershing Square Holdings  Ltd:In the first half of 2022  Pershing Square Holdings generated NAV performance of negative 26.0%  and a slightly lower total shareholder return of negative 27.3% due to the widening of the discount to NAV at which PSH’s shares traded.5 PSH’s year-to-date NAV return through August 16  2022  was negative 10.8% compared to negative 8.8% for the S&P 500 index over the same period.6The Year to Date2022 has been an unusual and highly volatile year in the capital markets. This volatility has been driven by uncertainty associated with high levels of global inflation  central-bank-led increases in interest rates and related confusion about monetary policy  the risk of a possible recession  the war in Ukraine  political divisiveness and discord  and fear and unease about climate change and geopolitical risk. Each of these factors on their own could be a cause for a high degree of stock market volatility. When combined  uncertainty and volatility rule the markets.Our approach to investing capital is to find extremely durable  well-capitalized  high-quality growth companies that can survive any storm. If we are successful in our investment selection  we can largely ignore shorter-term factors that drive stock market movements and remain focused on our portfolio companies’ underlying business performance. As long as our companies continue to deliver the results we expect  we do not need to make any material adjustments to our portfolio’s composition. In other words  we can sail through the stormy seas with a focus on the long-term horizon.We don’t  however  ignore global events that create risk and uncertainty. While we try to consider every potential risk that could impact our portfolio companies and invest in businesses that can withstand these risks  the world is and will remain a highly uncertain place  so a high degree of vigilance will always remain appropriate. Staying knowledgeable about global macro and political events is important for assessing risk for our portfolio companies and in selecting new company investments. It also occasionally offers opportunities for profits from carefully selected hedging transactions.One of our strategy’s important competitive advantages is our ability to profit from unanticipated market events enabling us to generate large profits and liquidity from hedges during periods when equity prices are likely to decline substantially.Our investments in: (1) index and single-name credit default swaps before the Great Financial Crisis  (2) investment grade and high yield index CDS in the weeks prior to Covid impacting the markets  and (3) interest rate swaptions in late 2020 to the present day in light of our concerns that interest rates would rise more quickly and remain at higher levels than anticipated  are all good examples of the importance of our understanding and foreseeing the impact of global macro risks and hedging them when we can identify an asymmetric means to do so.If It Is So Obvious  Why Doesn’t Everyone Do It?While our approach to investing capital is logical and straightforward and has a long-term outperformance record  it is the rare investment manager that can implement such a strategy. Many of our colleagues in the industry have told us that they would prefer to invest as we do with their own money  but that their investors’ demands effectively prohibit such an approach.While many investors in funds claim to be long term  they require short-term liquidity from their managers. When managers oversee funds that can be withdrawn on short notice  they generally have no choice but to manage for the short term. Furthermore  most investors in funds are fiduciaries who are themselves held to short-term measurements of their own performance. So when the inevitable period of underperformance occurs due to broad-based market movements or otherwise  investors in funds redeem their capital  and their managers become forced sellers.The inherently short-term nature of the investment management industry is a large contributor to stock (and bond) market volatility. As many funds suffered substantial drawdowns earlier this year  they sold stocks to raise capital to meet redemptions  and reduced market exposure as their risk appetites declined.This pattern of reducing equity market exposure as stock markets decline occurs in every market disruption  but it is precisely the opposite of what long-term investors should do. It is axiomatic that the lower the price paid  the better one’s long-term returns. Yet  in each crisis and/or market drawdown  fund managers sell and reduce exposures  rather than increase exposures at more favorable valuations.The inverse is also true. Investors in funds generally commit more capital when funds are generating strong absolute performance. During the ebullient market which preceded this year’s decline  investors committed more capital to funds which put the money to work at higher valuations. Investments at higher valuations are destined to generate lower returns.Pershing Square Holdings’ closed-end fund structure and large insider ownership provide us with the ability to be a truly long-term investor in a world where the vast majority of fund managers are constrained to a shorter-term approach. Our long-term investment approach is one of our most important competitive advantages and a major contributor to our substantial outperformance over the last nearly 19 years.7 We believe that our even larger outperformance since early 2018 can be explained by our transition from a manager of shorter-term redeemable assets to a manager of effectively perpetual assets.Today  substantially all of Pershing Square’s assets under management are in PSH or represent capital invested in our private funds by affiliates of the investment manager.8 The permanency of our asset base allows for a truly long-term investment approach. We have not raised any net new equity capital in years so we are not exposed to the risk of raising capital at market peaks.Furthermore  we have been active in periodically returning capital when PSH is trading at a ‘double discount’ by repurchasing PSH shares opportunistically when our portfolio companies are trading at attractive valuations and PSH is trading at a wide discount to NAV. Our estimate of today’s ‘proforma NAV ’ PSH’s NAV assuming our portfolio companies were trading at their intrinsic value  is more than twice our current share price.9Our effectively perpetual capital is also a great recruitment tool for talent. The universe of firms where one can go to invest permanent capital is extremely small. For all of the above reasons  the most talented investors prefer to work for a firm that is able to implement a long-term investment approach.Our closed-end fund structure is also a competitive advantage in allowing us to access low-cost  investment grade leverage in the form of unsecured bonds without mark-to-market covenants on fixed rate terms. Of PSH’s total assets  19% is funded by long-term bonds with laddered maturities beginning five years from today until 2039 at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.1%.10 By using low-cost  long-term debt in place of one-fifth of our equity capital we have materially enhanced our ability to generate high rates of returns without  in our view  any meaningful change in our risk profile.In summary  our closed-end fund structure is an enormous competitive advantage for how we invest capital  recruit talent  and raise low-cost and low-risk unsecured bond leverage. It has  however  come with one negative externality. In recent years  PSH has traded at a large discount to its NAV.Discount to NAVIn a private fund or in an open-ended mutual fund which invests in liquid assets  investors are guaranteed to receive the net asset value of their holding when they redeem. The same is not true for a closed-end fund as investors are exposed to the risk that a closed-end fund’s share price trades at a greater discount to NAV when they exit than when they originally purchased their shares.Since late 2015  the beginning of a several-year period of underperformance  PSH began trading at a large discount to NAV which has widened over time. While this discount is an advantage when we buy back our shares  it is a disadvantage to a shareholder when they decide to sell. The substantial majority of our shares are owned by investors who purchased PSH at a discount to NAV which helps to mitigate the negative impact of the NAV discount on their returns. As long as one sells PSH at a similar discount to that when the shares were purchased  one’s return will approximate PSH’s underlying NAV performance.Our discount has persisted despite best-in-class performance and the aggressive steps we have taken to address it:Based on Bloomberg data (please see Appendix A)  PSH has the best five-year NAV return of the 100 largest closed end equity funds in the world  which includes funds ranging from $774 million to $16.6 billion in net asset value. 11PSH became a premium listed company on the LSE on May 2  2017 and joined the FTSE 100 on December 21  2020  which has led to increased index inclusion and demand for our shares.With the benefit of some new director additions  we have a best-in-class  independent  extremely knowledgeable  experienced  and diverse board.Affiliates of the manager have acquired large amounts of PSH shares in the open market and now own 25.5% of the company  12 which ranks among the largest inside ownership in the top 100 closed-end funds.which ranks among the largest inside ownership in the top 100 closed-end funds. PSH has repurchased 22.5% of its shares outstanding since its IPO  a total of 54 million shares at a price of $17.32 and an average discount of 27.1%.PSH initiated a dividend in 2019  and earlier this year announced a new dividend policy whereby dividends will increase over time with NAV.One would expect that with best-in-class performance and governance  the acquisition and ownership of more than one quarter of the company by the investment manager  an aggressive and opportunistic share repurchase program and a favorable dividend distribution policy  PSH’s NAV discount should have narrowed  but in fact the opposite has occurred. Why?The Supply of PSH Shares and Our Market CapPSH’s discount to NAV is directly related to the supply and demand for PSH shares. With respect to the supply of shares  the number of PSH shares has decreased due to buybacks by 22.5% since our IPO. Acquisitions of shares by affiliates of the investment manager reduced our public float by an additional 39 million shares or 16.3% 13 a 39% cumulative reduction in our public float since our IPO.PSH is the second largest closed-end fund in the world by NAV after Scottish Mortgage  and the third largest by market cap. One might ask  therefore  whether there is a correlation between the market cap of a closed-end fund and the discount at which the fund’s shares trade.Is Size a Contributor to the Discount?Based on the Bloomberg data  there does not seem to be any correlation between the size of a closed-end fund and its trading level relative to NAV. A number of the 15 largest closed-end equity funds trade at premiums to NAV  and the balance  other than PSH  trade at single-digit percentage discounts.PSH has vastly outperformed the other top 15 closed-end funds as well as the other 85 constituents over the last five years. PSH has outperformed 90 of the top 100 by more than 1 000 basis points per annum. The median and average discount to NAV for the top 100 equity closed-end funds with greater than a $1 billion market cap is 4% and 3% respectively compared with PSH’s current discount of 35%.Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (OTCPK:STMZF)  the largest fund on the list by market capitalization  is an interesting point of comparison. Despite its name  it like Pershing Square is a growth equity closed-end fund and also a FTSE 100 company. SMT has a long and volatile investment history beginning in 1909. PSH has substantially outperformed Scottish Mortgage over the last one-year (6% vs -29%)  three-year (27% vs 23% compounded annually) and five-year (24% vs 18% compounded annually) periods.14 Yet SMT trades at a 6% discount to NAV versus PSH’s 35% discount to NAV.While PSH charges higher fees than most other closed-end funds largely due to our incentive fees  our NAV outperformance record is net of all fees and expenses. PSH’s fee structure was not a barrier to raising $2.9 billion in PSH’s IPO  the largest IPO in Europe in 2014  as the shares were sold at NAV and the fee arrangement was understood by all investors.We have no plans to change our fees as our incentive and management fees are an important recruiting tool for our talent  who are responsible for our substantial outperformance. Pershing Square recruits investment team talent principally from private equity firms which also charge incentive fees. None of our investment team members would have joined Pershing Square and stayed if we did not continue to earn incentive fees.There appear to be only three other closed-end funds in the top 100 that charge management and incentive fees. One of these funds trade at a 10% premium to NAV and the other two trade at 12% and 19% discounts  which suggests that there is no clear relationship between the fee structure and the degree of NAV discount or premium.Demand for PSH SharesWhile PSH is managed by a U.S. manager and principally owns North American headquartered companies  it trades only on European exchanges  the LSE and Euronext Amsterdam. There are significant regulatory limitations in our ability to market PSH in various jurisdictions  including the U.S  a more logical market for a North American-centric fund run by a U.S. manager. Substantially all other closed-end funds that invest principally in North American equities are domiciled in the U.S. and therefore do not have restrictions on marketing in the U.S.The rest of world demand for PSH has mostly been driven by dedicated closed-end fund investors and to a lesser extent index funds that own the shares based on their index weightings.In summary  we have a demand problem compounded by certain marketing limitations.What Can We Do About It?There is no short-term solution to PSH’s discount problem. While a liquidation would eliminate the discount  offset somewhat by frictional costs  it would also eliminate the long-term opportunity for PSH to generate high levels of compound annual returns. We believe the long-term investment opportunity for PSH vastly outweighs the short-term profits that would come from a liquidation.We can  however  always do a better job marketing and informing investors about the existence of PSH. Despite the fact that PSH is the 78th largest company by market cap on the LSE  and would be 51st on the list if it traded at NAV  PSH is still relatively unknown by global investors. While Pershing Square  the investment manager  appears in numerous press articles nearly every business day  PSH is largely absent from the media. Even considering our marketing restrictions  we can still do more to inform investors about the existence of PSH and our investment opportunity.Could PSH Eventually List in the U.S.?As PSH grows in market capitalization and its ownership stakes in its portfolio companies increases  one can envision a world in which over time PSH becomes a controlling owner of one of more businesses that comprise the substantial majority of our assets and income. We expect to continually evaluate PSH and its operations  and consider whether in the future it may be able to operate not as an investment company in the U.S.  but rather as an operating company that could be listed in the U.S.How Should One Think about PSH?In economic substance  PSH is more akin to an investment holding company than a traditional passive owner of securities. We are often the largest  or one of the largest owners of our portfolio companies  particularly if passive index owners are ignored. We are known to be an active and engaged investor and often have board representation and/or considerable influence in the board room as a large and thoughtful owner.Why Have Some Fund Managers Avoided Investing in PSH?While PSH is owned by many investment managers  we believe these investors are principally dedicated and or specialized closed-end fund investors. Traditional investment managers often avoid investing in closed-end funds as they view doing so as effectively their giving up investment allocation decisions to a third party and paying fees for them to do so. For many years  many investment managers would not own shares in Berkshire Hathaway for similar reasons.Whether one invests in an operating company or a closed-end fund  however  ultimately the investor is giving up control of capital allocation decisions to the management of the company.We do not believe that closed-end funds should be an excluded asset class for that reason as long as the manager of the closed-end fund can generate attractive rates of long-term performance  net of the fees it charges  that are competitive with returns from other public operating company investments  with the caveat  of course  that the investors can’t simply replicate the performance of the closed-end fund by investing directly in the same underlying securities.In our 2020 letter to shareholders  we explain why PSH replication cannot be achieved by attempting to invest directly in the same securities we publicly disclose. To summarize  this is due to three principal factors:Investors in PSH get the benefit of our new  undisclosed investments at the price they were acquired by PSH before their eventual public disclosure impacts their price. Historically  the day-one trading price of our newly disclosed stake in a company typically has been substantially above our cost of acquisition. PSH replicators must pay the higher post disclosure price rather than our acquisition cost. These embedded gains inure to the benefit of PSH shareholders  and to an even greater extent when PSH is purchased at a discount to NAV. We do not disclose our hedging strategies in advance of their implementation. Our hedges have generated highly material gains for PSH that are not readily actionable or replicable by most investment managers. We are able to access long-term  low-cost investment grade debt without mark-to-market covenants  which materially reduces our cost of capital. Our access to covenant-light leverage is a difficult to replicate competitive advantage.While many investment managers avoid investing in funds that charge fees  the effective fee burden of PSH has been largely offset over time by our low-cost bond leverage (a weighted-average cost of 3.1%) that we have used in place of about 20% of our equity capital. In other words  investors in PSH receive a similar long-term NAV return to what they would have earned if they owned our underlying investments directly without leverage  as our use of bond financing roughly offsets our management and incentive fees.While some fund managers may choose not to invest in PSH because it is technically a closed-end fund  we believe that with the passage of time and continued strong performance  our tax and regulatory structure will be viewed as a competitive advantage and a reason to own PSH rather than a reason to avoid it.We chose the offshore closed-end fund structure for PSH with a full understanding of its marketing and other limitations. We did so because we believed that the offshore closed-end fund’s favorable tax structure (with no entity-level taxation) and investment flexibility versus other alternatives would give PSH long-term structural and competitive advantages in generating high rates of return over time.Today’s extraordinary discount of 35% makes PSH’s investment proposition that much more compelling  and should hopefully remove some of the traditional fund managers’ resistance to investing in closed-end funds.In summary  we believe that PSH is an excellent investment opportunity for both dedicated closed-end investors and the much larger universe of traditional investment managers because the typical reasons for an investment manager not including a closed-end fund in their portfolios don’t apply to PSH. We just need to do a better job getting the word out.Organizational UpdateThe Pershing Square investment team is intentionally small. Currently  we have eight team members including myself  and at peak  we had ten. The team operates extremely collaboratively. Each member of the team’s compensation is directly dependent on the performance of the overall portfolio rather than individual investments. Research on new investments is typically led by two members of the team  but vetted by the entire team. This structure has served us well over the years as it has aligned everyone’s incentives with Pershing Square’s long-term goals.The team has operated in an entirely non-hierarchical format with one exception. As portfolio manager  I get to make the final yes or no decision on investments and in determining the sizing of positions. With the benefit of effectively no turnover in the team over the last five or so years  our investment team is the most highly functioning it has ever been.I periodically get asked about succession planning at Pershing Square. At age 56  loving what I do and in excellent health  my principal risk is what can be deemed “pie truck risk ” that is  the risk I look the wrong way crossing the street and get smooshed by a pie truck.As a manager of perpetual capital  I am obligated to give some insight to our shareholders as to how we would operate if the pie truck ended my existence. I don’t believe in a committee approach to investing where a majority vote determines each portfolio decision. At the end of the day  someone needs to make the decision and be held accountable.I am pleased to announce that Ryan Israel  who joined Pershing Square from Goldman Sachs in March of 2009  will now become our Chief Investment Officer. I will continue as CEO and Portfolio Manager with continued control over ultimate decision making  but if the pie truck were to run me over tomorrow  Ryan would be my choice to manage the portfolio.We are extremely fortunate in having an investment team where each member would be a star at any other firm  and could if they wished  leave to launch their own firms. Most members of our investment team that have left Pershing Square in previous years have been successful in setting up their own firms  and the same would be true for our current team members.In selecting among our investment team for a CIO  I chose Ryan for a number of reasons. First  he is of exemplary character and is an extremely high-quality human being. He is a once-in-a-generation talent as an investor  not just in equities  but also in macro instruments. He is an excellent leader  teacher  communicator  and partner  and has the respect of each member of the investment team.As the longest-tenured member of the team  he has had the greatest opportunity to experience our profoundest successes and failures in dramatically different market environments and to learn from them. He has also had the opportunity to train most of our team members in our approach to investing.We have built a culture that requires extreme candor. Ryan is unafraid to challenge anyone including yours truly  and that is an extremely important quality in a CIO. Ryan is the right choice  and importantly  when I checked with each of the other team members  they all agreed.My decision to announce Ryan as CIO should in no way suggest to you that I am heading for the hills. I love this business and intend to stay active until they carry me out  and I am a heavy lift. I don’t expect that our investment team will function differently beginning the day after this announcement. Ryan has already for some time been unofficially serving in this role.It has been an extraordinary year filled with uncertainty  the tragic war in Ukraine  enormous capital markets volatility  and political divisiveness. Even more so in this environment  we feel extremely fortunate to have the backing of long-term investors who enable us to do our best work. We are perpetually extremely grateful.As always  please reach out to ir@persq.com if you have any questions for us.Sincerely William A.

Click to enlargeUniversal Music Group (OTCPK:UMGNF)Universal Music Group is the world’s leading music entertainment company  a high-quality  capital-light business that is led by a superb management team. UMG’s business can be best thought of as a rapidly growing royalty on the greater global consumption and monetization of music.We believe that UMG’s decades-long runway for growth remains underappreciated by investors. With increasing streaming penetration combined with the development of new services  platforms  and business models  UMG can grow revenues at an annual rate of 10% or so for more than a decade. High absolute levels of revenue growth coupled with UMG’s fixed cost base should allow UMG to significantly expand its operating margins over time  generating highly attractive earnings growth for the foreseeable future.UMG’s recent results support our longer-term view  as year-to-date  revenues and profits both increased at a mid-teens growth rate  well above analyst expectations and the company’s guidance during last year’s Capital Markets day. When viewed on a multi-year basis  UMG’s revenue growth has both been higher and more consistent than Warner Music Group  its most closely followed peer.We believe that music is the lowest-cost  highest-value form of entertainment. For a $10 monthly fee (and less in a family plan) one can listen to over 80 million songs. We expect music streaming to be highly resilient  even in a recessionary environment  as consumers forgo other expenses before cancelling their music subscriptions.While ad-supported streaming revenues can be more sensitive to advertising spend  UMG has maintained a high-teens growth rate year-to-date by consistently expanding its partnerships and renewing existing deals on more favorable terms. UMG is the pioneer in monetizing emerging platforms and first partnered with Facebook/Meta (META) in 2017 – a groundbreaking partnership at the time that served as a template for social media companies to begin paying music rightsholders through fixed payments.The company recently renewed its Meta deal  significantly expanding the terms to include revenue sharing components. We believe the new Meta deal will boost UMG’s growth over the coming years and represents a framework for future deals with other social media platforms. Over time  we expect the revenue from social media and other emerging platforms such as gaming and fitness to grow faster than traditional streaming and become a more material percentage of UMG’s revenue base.Music spending per capita is significantly below peak levels which were achieved in the late 1990s both on a nominal basis and when adjusted for inflation. Despite pervasive high levels of inflation in the global economy  streaming prices have stayed relatively constant since their introduction. While digital service providers recently began increasing prices in certain markets  we believe there is ample room to increase pricing in the coming years which will drive increased growth at UMG.While streaming has been the primary driver of music’s resurgence and will continue to be the primary driver of growth going forward  other revenue streams that were previously declining have also returned to growth. Physical music is experiencing a renaissance driven by vinyl demand. We believe that physical and digital collectibles provide an opportunity for UMG and its artists to better engage with and monetize their superfans.Bill recently joined the UMG board and we look forward to working even more closely with the company as an engaged long-term shareholder. Given its long runway for sustained earnings growth  we believe that UMG’s current valuation represents a significant discount to intrinsic value.Restaurant Brands (QSR)QSR’s franchised business model is a high-quality  capital-light  growing annuity that generates high-margin brand royalty fees from its four leading brands: Burger King  Tim Hortons  Popeyes  and Firehouse Subs.QSR is investing in each of its brands to position them for sustainable  long-term growth. As Canada reopened  Tim Hortons’ same-store sales returned to growth during the quarter compared to pre-COVID levels  driven by growth across all dayparts  formats  regions and product categories aside from hot beverage. The company is focused on executing the next phase of its “Back to Basics” plan by extending its beverage platform  capturing a greater share of afternoon foods and continuing its brand modernization. Longer-term  management believes it can sustainably grow same-store sales at a low-single-digit rate.At Burger King in the U.S.  the company also reported improved results and narrowed the gap to its peers. Recently-appointed Burger King U.S. President Tom Curtis and his team have begun to lay the foundation for a return to sustainable growth. We believe the company has a meaningful opportunity to reinvigorate growth and modernize its store base through a reinvestment plan. The company will be unveiling its “reclaim the flame” plan to franchisees next month.Burger King international  Popeyes  and Firehouse Brands continue to perform strongly  with comparable sales up more than 20% relative to pre-COVID levels.QSR’s franchised-based royalty model is particularly attractive in an inflationary environment. QSR’s revenues benefit when its franchisees increase prices  but its cost structure is not subject to the same inflationary pressures. QSR can continue to grow its business with minimal capital required as its franchisees open new units. Despite delayed permitting  higher material costs  and inflationary headwinds  QSR’s unit growth returned to its historic mid-single-digit growth rate last year.As a result of improving same-store sales growth coupled with strong unit growth  QSR’s earnings are now greater than prior to COVID and are growing at an attractive rate  in spite of significant industry-level inflation and same store sales that are just now recovering to pre-COVID levels.QSR continues to trade at a discount to its peers and its intrinsic value. The company has repurchased more than 3% of its shares outstanding over the last twelve months  which when coupled with its 4% dividend yield  enables QSR to return approximately 7% of its market capitalization to shareholders on an annual basis.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)Chipotle continued its impressive performance in 2022 driven by the ongoing recovery of in-restaurant sales  price increases to cover cost inflation  and successful menu innovation including pollo asado. During the second quarter  Chipotle continued to lead the restaurant industry in growth for both same-store sales (“SSS”) and new restaurants  with SSS growing 10% year-over-year or 30% on a three-year cumulative basis.On-premise sales grew 36% as consumers resumed pre-pandemic routines  while digital sales declined only 3%  continuing their persistence despite the growth of conventional sales. Chipotle remains on track to grow its store base by approximately 8% this year with a longer-term annual store growth aspiration of nearly 10% once current headwinds around construction  permitting  and supplies ease.We believe Chipotle is one of the best-positioned consumer companies for the current inflationary world. Given significant inflation in food and labor costs  management has planned a menu price increase of approximately 4% for August following a similarly-sized price increase in March. The company has tremendous pricing power due to the superb quality of its food which is priced at a discount to many competitors with inferior offerings  marketing focused on food quality and freshness rather than cost  and a customer base that over-indexes to higher-income consumers  some of whom are trading down from pricier alternatives.Chipotle’s economic model remains firmly intact  with restaurant-level margins in excess of 25% in the second quarter  up 0.8% year-over-year  and a consistent level of profitability expected for the current quarter. The company is debt-free and generates nearly all its sales in the U.S.  insulating its earnings from the foreign currency headwinds facing many other large consumer companies.To accelerate Chipotle’s growth beyond the company’s continued strong results  management is focused on improving throughput for in-store orders  and increasing order accuracy and timeliness for digital orders. While Chipotle’s restaurants are staffed above 2019 levels  many current employees haven’t experienced optimal operations given pandemic-related disruptions and the high rate of employee turnover endemic to the restaurant industry.Management has rolled out a new labor deployment tool to develop staffing models and is instituting an operational initiative focused on excellent execution of the basics  the latter of which started to bear fruit in 2019 before it was interrupted by the pandemic. We continue to be impressed by Chipotle management’s continuous improvement initiatives  drive to create a superb customer experience and shareholder value creation.Hilton (HLT)Hilton is a high-quality  asset-light  high-margin business with significant long-term growth potential  led by a superb management team. The unforeseen arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a rapid and near-complete standstill in global travel  with RevPAR (the industry metric for same-store sales at a given hotel) down roughly 90% at the nadir of the pandemic. We increased our investment in Hilton during the pandemic as we believed the economic dislocation from COVID-19 would prove to be transient and that industry projections regarding the timeline for recovery were too pessimistic.From the moment the pandemic began  Hilton’s management team took decisive actions to ensure the company not only managed through what it knew would be a challenging period  but also positioned the company to generate improved margins  cash flows  and investment returns once the business recovered. In hindsight  Hilton’s experience with COVID-19 – the 100-year proverbial flood – affirmed the company’s unique high-quality  asset light  high-margin business model  and reinforced our belief that Hilton deserves a premium valuation.While Hilton entered 2022 impacted by the Omicron variant  results have vastly improved throughout the year asCOVID-19 has evolved towards a more endemic virus  and consumer behavior has adapted accordingly. In recent months  Hilton’s system-wide RevPAR has surpassed 2019 levels and continues to improve. Recent strength has been led by domestic leisure travel occasions as consumer spending continues to shift from goods to services.We expect demand to continue to strengthen from current levels as anticipated moderation in leisure occupancy is likely to be more than offset by improvements in corporate business transient and group business  both still below 2019 levels. Notably  the industrywide recovery is being led by an unprecedented surge in average daily rate (“ADR”).Historically a laggard during prior recessions  ADR has been buoyed by a strong consumer appetite to travel  a positive mix-shift from large corporations to small and medium-sized businesses  and broad and accelerating inflationary pressures (hotels can change room rates in real time). Hilton is well positioned to benefit from inflation as its fee-based business model benefits from rising ADRs while its cost base is largely fixed.The combined impact of Hilton’s net unit growth since the onset of the pandemic and the greater operational efficiencies has increased run-rate operating income to approximately 15% above 2019 operating income at similar levels of RevPAR. We expect Hilton to continue to deliver accelerated earnings growth for the foreseeable future  as industrywide occupancy continues to improve (still well below normal)  ADR remains elevated  and Hilton laps over easy comparative historical periods.Despite Hilton’s accelerated near-term growth prospects and attractive long-term earnings algorithm  the stock is attractively priced at a low-20s multiple of 2023 earnings. We find Hilton’s valuation to be compelling given its industry leading competitive position  superb management team  attractive long-term net unit growth algorithm  pricing power  and best-in-class capital return policy.Lowe’s is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential underpinned by a superb management team that is successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation.COVID-19 was a transformational event for the US housing market  causing homeowners to invest significantly in their homes as they shifted nearly all their daily activities to the home environment  including work  school  and leisure. The increased use of the home during COVID  in turn  increased the need for repair  maintenance and remodel activity  which significantly benefited Lowe’s same-store sales.As consumers return to spending more time and money on out-of-the home activities the near-term demand for certain Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) categories has decreased. Moderation in DIY demand combined with increased mortgage rates and decreased housing affordability has caused many market participants to become concerned that the home improvement industry may give up a significant part of their COVID pandemic sales gains.While we expect that there will be some near-term volatility and continued moderation of DIY demand  growth remains strong for projects requiring professional installation (the “Pro” business) due to a substantial backlog of projects undertaken during COVID  which should support industry growth in the near-term. In addition  we believe the medium-term growth outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong as demand is likely to normalize at a materially higher level as compared to the pre-COVID era.For the decade prior to COVID  home improvement industry sales were notably depressed relative to their long-term averages as a percentage of overall consumer spend and GDP and have only now returned to their longer-term historical levels.Moreover  we believe COVID has permanently renewed consumers’ focus  appreciation  and utilization of their homes  which combined with higher home equity values  strong consumer balance sheets  low levels of home inventory for sale and an aging housing stock that requires an increasing level of maintenance  will likely result in a structurally higher level of ongoing home industry spending in the future. In the most recent quarter demand strengthened throughout the quarter as DIY consumers returned from summer vacations and focused on less seasonal home improvement projects.While we believe the longer-term industry outlook remains strong  Lowe’s is likely to generate a strong level of earnings growth over a multi-year period even if the industry and macroeconomic environment is weaker due to management’s strong execution of the company’s ongoing business transformation.A combination of market share gains (primarily from improving e-commerce execution and improving share of wallet amongst Pro customers) and a multitude of idiosyncratic self-help initiatives (primarily focused on improving in-store labor productivity and reconfiguring Lowe’s for a market based delivery model) are driving Lowe’s transformation.Lowe’s operational transformation is further magnified by its aggressive share repurchase program  which is likely to see the company acquire a high-single-digit percentage of its market capitalization in this year alone. The materiality of Lowe’s Perpetual Productivity Initiative was on full display in their most recent quarter  whereby the company leveraged fixed expenses by 80 basis points  driving 10% earnings-per-share growth notwithstanding flat topline growth. The successful execution of Lowe’s continued business transformation should allow the company to generate accelerated earnings growth for the foreseeable future.Notwithstanding our view on Lowe’s attractive long-term earnings outlook  Lowe’s currently trades at only 15 times forward earnings  a low valuation for a business of this quality  and a substantial discount to its direct competitor. We believe the current valuation reflects investors negative sentiment regarding the US housing market and incorporates the possibility of a greater than expected revenue decline. We believe the current valuation is highly attractive and anticipate Lowe’s will generate high rates of returns from current levels if as we expect it continues to successfully execute the company’s transformation.Canadian Pacific Railway (CP)CP is a high-quality  inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (“KCS”)  we believe that CP’s prospects are bright.CP reported revenue growth of 7% in the second quarter as pricing and mix  fuel surcharge pass-throughs and foreign exchange more than offset a small decline in volumes. CP is leveraging the strong pricing environment to renew contracts at an average price increase of over 6%. Pricing directly benefits earnings as rails pass on increases in fuel and other expenses to customers through contractual fuel surcharges and CPI escalators. In addition to earnings growth  high inflation should help rail transportation take share from trucking and lead to incremental volume growth over time.Customers are choosing cheaper transportation solutions as prices rise  and CP’s mission-critical rail service is often the cheapest or only viable method for transporting heavy freight over long distances. High fuel prices and wage gains also disproportionally increase the cost of trucking  which is up to three times less fuel efficient and much more labor intensive than rail transportation.The demand outlook for CP continues to improve  especially given the current geopolitical environment. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting supply disruptions have boosted demand for Canadian exports such as grain and potash. Deglobalization has also increased the likelihood of major North American onshoring and energy production  which will accelerate CP’s volume growth in the future.Total volumes declined by 2% in the second quarter due to the smaller than average Canadian grain harvest  while volumes excluding grain increased by 5%. The grain headwind will flip to a tailwind in the fall as CP anticipates a normal grain crop  which supports management’s double-digit volume and revenue growth outlook for the second half of 2022.CP’s pending acquisition of KCS remains on track as the Surface Transportation Board’s likely approval approaches. Based on the Board’s updated procedural schedule  if all goes as expected  CP will gain operational control of KCS by the first quarter of 2023 at the latest. In the meantime  CP and KCS are preparing for synergies by holding productive discussions with potential customers  running proof of concept trains  and making capacity investments.By creating the only direct route from Canada to Mexico  the procompetitive merger offers shippers the unrivaled speed and service that is sorely needed to help ease supply chain congestion. We are confident in management’s ability to achieve its revenue and cost synergy targets and create value for all stakeholders.While CP’s year-to-date results reflect its strong business performance and favorable outlook  we believe CP’s current valuation represents a meaningful discount to intrinsic value in light of the company’s high-quality business model and long-term growth potential.The Howard Hughes Corporation (HHC)HHC’s portfolio of well-located residential land and income-producing commercial assets continues to demonstrate resilient performance despite recent macro concerns of a slowdown in the housing market. The company’s advantaged business model of owning master planned communities (“MPCs”) provides HHC substantial control over the planning and release of land for sale and development  enabling it to take a long-term approach to maximizing the value of its portfolio.As a result of its outright ownership of thousands of acres of conservatively financed land and a management team that combines superb capital allocation and development skills  the company is much less exposed to the cyclicality of standalone  smaller-scale real estate development companies.HHC’s MPCs are attractively located in low cost-of-living  low-tax states like Texas and Nevada that are benefiting from significant in-migration. As mortgage rates have increased  the relative affordability and higher quality of life found in Summerlin (Las Vegas  Nevada) and Bridgeland (Houston  Texas)  the company’s two MPCs with the substantial majority of remaining land sales  is highly appealing to prospective homebuyers. Although the pace of home sales has moderated from the post-pandemic surge experienced in 2021  housing inventory in HHC’s MPCs has been depleted and is near historical lows.Homebuilder demand for lots remains strong and the company is experiencing significant growth in pricing due to the supply-demand imbalance  as evidenced by the 25% year-over-year increase in the average price per acre sold this quarter. Likewise  the company is experiencing robust performance across the rest of its portfolio. In its income-producing operating assets  this quarter NOI increased 15% year-over-year driven by the lease-up of new developments and significant increases in rental rates. The pace of condo sales in Ward Village has remained consistently strong due to the unique appeal of the development’s location in Hawaii.HHC’s balance sheet is well insulated from the impact of rising interest rates. Approximately 83% of the company’s debt is either fixed or swapped to a fixed rate  and the company has limited near-term debt maturities with a substantial portion of its debt maturing in 2026 or later. Unlike traditional developers and homebuilders  the company is not dependent on external capital to fund development. Substantial cash generated from its operating assets  MPC land sales  and condo sales is more than sufficient to self-fund future development opportunities.While the company has made significant progress in simplifying its business and has a substantial runway for long-term value creation  we continue to believe its current share price is at a deep discount to its intrinsic value. The company has been able to capitalize on this discounted valuation by aggressively repurchasing its shares. Year to date  HHC has repurchased approximately 8% of its outstanding share count  funded by cash flow from operations and non-core asset sales.We believe HHC is extremely well positioned for the current inflationary environment due to its combination of high-quality real estate assets and a largely fixed-rate liability structure. We expect the company to benefit from substantial land price appreciation and rental income growth in the coming years.Fannie Mae (“FNMA” or “Fannie”) and Freddie Mac (“FMCC or “Freddie”) (together “the GSEs”)There have been no material updates for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2022. Both entities continue to build capital through retained earnings and now hold combined capital of $91 billion  up from nearly zero. As we have stated previously  as principally common shareholders (we own a small amount of preferred stock)  we own valuable perpetual options on both entities that over the long term we believe will be worth many multiples of today’s prices once re-privatization occurs.Exited PositionsDomino’s Pizza (DPZ)Since our last update  Domino’s near-term business performance has shown meaningful improvement  including three-year stacked growth for the second quarter of 17% in the U.S.  up 560 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven by the full impact of its recent pricing actions  operational changes leading to improved staffing and labor utilization  and the return of its signature Boost Week promotion. These positive developments caused a significant recovery in Domino’s share price and its valuation increased to more than 28 times our estimate of next twelve months’ earnings.In light of the company’s relatively high valuation in the context of a volatile market environment  we decided to exit our investment to raise cash for alternative investment opportunities.We have enormous respect for Domino’s and its management team led by Russell Weiner  and we expect the company to continue its long track record of success.Netflix (NFLX)In April  we announced that we exited our position in Netflix following the company’s first quarter results as management commentary and a required shift in the company’s business model toward ad-supported streaming caused us to lose confidence in our ability to predict the company’s future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty. While we have confidence in Netflix’s superb management team and their long-term record  we believed the dispersion of outcomes had widened such that it no longer met our requirements for a core holding. We discussed our decision to sell Netflix in detail in our April 20th letter to investors which you can read here.Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd (“PSTH”)On July 11th  PSTH announced that it would redeem its outstanding shares and liquidate as PSTH was unable to consummate a transaction that both met its investment criteria and was executable. PSTH returned its $4 billion of capital in trust to shareholders on July 26th. The PSTH liquidation is discussed in greater detail in the PSTH Liquidation section on page 42 of this report.Appendix B: Endnotes and Disclaimers - ENDNOTES TO COMPANY PERFORMANCE AND INVESTMENT MANAGER’S REPORTPerformance results are presented on a net-of-fees basis. Net returns include the reinvestment of all dividends  interest  and capital gains from underlying portfolio companies and reflect the deduction of  among other things  management fees  brokerage commissions  administrative expenses and accrued and/or crystallized performance allocation/fees (if any). Any positive impact on the Company’s performance due to share buybacks and the Tender Offer is reflected in the net returns. The Company’s performance is based on the dollar return for the specific period  including any and all dividends paid by the Company  calculated from the beginning of such period to the end of such period. Where the Company’s performance is presented with that of PSLP  performance results assume that an investor (i) has been invested in PSLP since inception  has not invested in Tranche G  and has participated in any “new issues ” as such term is defined under Rules 5130 and 5131 of FINRA and (II) invested in PSLP at its inception on January 1  2004 and converted to PSH at its inception on December 31  2012. Depending on the timing of an individual investor’s specific investment in the Company and/or PSLP  net performance for an individual investor may vary from the net performance as stated herein. PSLP's net performance results are presented as it is the Pershing Square fund with the longest track record and substantially the same investment strategy to the Company. The inception date for PSLP is January 1  2004. In 2004  Pershing Square earned a $1.5 million (approximately 3.9%) annual management fee and PSLP's general partner earned a performance allocation equal to 20% above a 6% hurdle from PSLP  in accordance with the terms of the limited partnership agreement of PSLP then in effect. That limited partnership agreement was later amended to provide for a 1.5% annual management fee and 20% performance allocation effective January 1  2005. The net returns for PSLP presented herein reflect the different fee arrangements in 2004  and subsequently  except that the performance of the tranche of interests subject to a 30% performance allocation and a 5% hard hurdle (non- cumulative) issued on January 1  2017 is not reflected in PSLP's returns. In addition  pursuant to a separate agreement  in 2004 the sole unaffiliated limited partner of PSLP paid Pershing Square an additional $840 000 for overhead expenses in connection with services provided unrelated to PSLP  which have not been taken into account in determining PSLP's net returns. To the extent that such overhead expenses had been included as fund expenses of PSLP  net returns would have been lower. The S&P 500 Total Return Index (""index"") has been selected for purposes of comparing the performance of an investment in the Company or PSLP  as applicable  with a well-known  broad-based equity benchmark. The statistical data regarding the index has been obtained from Bloomberg and the returns are calculated assuming all dividends are reinvested.

For each issuer  the gross returns reflected herein (i) include only returns on the investment in the underlying issuer and the hedge positions that directly relate to the securities that reference the underlying issuer (e.g.  if the Company was long Issuer A stock and also purchased puts on Issuer A stock  the gross return reflects the profit/loss on the stock and the profit/loss on the put); (II) do not reflect the cost/ benefit of hedges that do not relate to the securities that reference the underlying issuer (e.g.  if the Company was long Issuer A stock and short Issuer B stock  the profit/loss on the Issuer B stock is not included in the gross returns attributable to the investment in Issuer A); and (III) do not reflect the cost/ benefit of portfolio hedges. Performance with respect to currency hedging related to a specific issuer is included in the overall performance attribution of such issuer. For all other currency derivatives  the long/short classification is determined by the non-USD leg of the derivative. For example  a long USD call/GBP put option position would be considered a short exposure  and a long USD put/GBP call option would be considered a long exposure. The contributors and detractors to the gross returns presented herein are for illustrative purposes only.

Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent is given to people 65 years of age and older.1 2With protection against four flu strains  Fluzone High-Dose is the only influenza vaccine licensed for use in adults 65 years of age and older to have demonstrated superior efficacy in a randomized controlled trial versus a standard dose influenza vaccine for the prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza illness and the only influenza vaccine with 10 years of data demonstrating protection from flu and its related complications.2 3 a b In a meta-analysis of 15 published reports  including approximately 34 million people  those who received Fluzone High-Dose experienced approximately an 18% reduction in cardiorespiratory hospitalizations and 28% decrease in pneumonia hospitalizations  both of which are reductions above what the standard dose vaccines provided.3Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent builds on the legacy of the trivalent formulation  which was clinically proven to be 24.2% more effective at preventing flu than standard-dose Fluzone (Influenza Vaccine) in adults 65+.9 Based on data from Fluzone High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine)  side effects were slightly more frequent after vaccination with Fluzone High-Dose compared to a standard-dose vaccine.10The efficacy of trivalent formulation is relevant to Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent since both products are manufactured according to the same process and have overlapping compositions.2Flublok Quadrivalent is the first and only recombinant influenza vaccine for adults 18+ proven in a clinical study to be 30% more effective than a standard dose vaccine (Fluarix Quadrivalent [Influenza Vaccine]) at preventing flu infection in over 9 000 adults 50+.1 In adults 50+  the most common side effects were tenderness  and/or pain at the injection site; headache  and tiredness.1 The effectiveness of Flublok Quadrivalent was also judged by data from general day-to-day medical practice amongst more than 12 million adults 65 years and older  vaccination with Flublok Quadrivalent was compared to standard dose vaccines: this analysis of data captured during day-to-day medical practice of Medicare fee-for-service claims collected from during the 2019-2020 influenza season. A 5-vaccine relative effectiveness analysis showed Flublok Quadrivalent had 13.3% fewer flu-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits versus an egg-based standard dose quadrivalent flu vaccine. The other influenza vaccines evaluated within the study (Fluad  Fluzone High-Dose and Flucelvax Quadrivalent)  also showed fewer flu-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits (8.2%  6.8% and 2.8%  respectively) versus an egg-based standard dose quadrivalent flu vaccine. These data are based on one of three primary analyses. Two additional primary analyses were also conducted: two vaccine analyses comparing cell-derived inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine with an egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) and a quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) with IIV4.Specific characteristics of 2019-2020 season  such as varied strain circulation  may have impacted results. Study limitations include lack of access to information to confirm specific viral cases may have reduced the impact of comparisons made in the study and distortion caused by unlimited variables could have affected results. In addition  the study period was cut off at the end of February 2020 to avoid potential bias from the overlap between influenza season and the escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. This study was conducted by the FDA and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.aProven superiority in a clinical trial between Fluzone High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine) (trivalent formulation) and a standard-dose influenza vaccine2bIncludes 10 years of evidence (2009-2019) with Fluzone High-Dose (trivalent formulation)3Important Safety Information for Flublok® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) and Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine)Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine (including eggs or egg products for Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent). In addition  Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction after previous dose of any influenza vaccine.Tell your health care provider if you have ever had Guillain-Barré syndrome (severe muscle weakness) after a previous influenza vaccination.If Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent are given to people with a compromised immune system  including those receiving therapies that suppress the immune system  the immune response may be lower than expected.Vaccination with Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent may not protect all people who receive the vaccine.For Flublok Quadrivalent  in adults 18 through 49 years of age  the most common side effects were tenderness  and/or pain where you got the shot; headache  tiredness  muscle aches  and joint pain. In adults 50 years of age and older the most common side effects were tenderness  and/or pain where you got the shot; headache  and tiredness.For Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent  in adults 65 years of age and older  the most common side effects were pain  redness  and/or swelling where you got the shot; muscle aches  headache  and general discomfort.For Flublok Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent  other side effects may occur.Please see the Prescribing Information for Flublok Quadrivalent.

Reportedly  this segment is predicted to contribute majorly toward overall market share by 2031. The growth of the basic (under $50/month) segment over the forecast period can be attributed to the massive use of basic equity management software in small and medium-sized enterprises. However  the senior (above $100/month) segment is predicted to register the fastest CAGR of nearly 19.4% from 2022 to 2031. The segmental growth can be credited to the massive demand for senior (above $100/month) equity management software as it offers an all-in-one tool enabling firms to easily handle shareholder communication  organize meetings  and generate reports. The report also provides an overall analysis of the segments such as the standard ($50-$100/month) segment.The large enterprises segment to hold the major market share over 2022-2031On basis of enterprise size  the large enterprises segment accounted for the highest market share in 2021  contributing nearly three-fourths of the global equity management software market.

Increased foreign fund inflows should help lower the federal funding costs.,"Mumbai: India's inclusion to the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index may be imminent  said people familiar with the matter  as sanctions against Russia opened the door after years of dithering to make the country a part of it.An inclusion would bring in estimated inflows of $30-40 billion to India as investments made based on the composition of the index  said top bond dealers. Increased foreign fund inflows should help lower the federal funding costs.The market seems to be taking a cue already. The benchmark bond closed at 7.21% Friday versus 7.29% a day earlier on expectations of a higher demand for securities. ""We see sentiment changing in the local market due to the renewed buzz over India's index inclusion "" said Sandeep Yadav  head of fixed income at DSP Mutual Fund . ""While passive flows may come after formal index inclusion which may take time  active investors will step in well before.""JPMorgan is seeking investor views on including India in the index  the Financial Times reported on Thursday.JPMorgan declined to comment.Russia's exit has necessitated the situation  where global investors are revisiting their strategy to reduce the risk of their index-linked investments getting concentrated. Global assets worth $842 billion are reportedly benchmarked against JPMorgan's indices.Russia had a 0.89% weight in the EMBIG Diversified index  and 1.03% in the ESG version of the index in March  when global sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war resulted in its removal from the benchmark.""With Russia now removed from the index  the GBI-EM Global Diversified is concentrated in a few markets "" Goldman Sachs said in a report last week. ""Given its high nominal yields  depth and size  we think India would be welcomed by investors from a diversification perspective "" it said.India's bond market is one of the largest in the emerging market pack with a market size of around $1 trillion. Capital controls clubbed with market access and operational issues have thwarted any move for including India in global bond indices.""A renewed speculation over global bond index inclusion pulled the benchmark yields down "" said Naveen Singh  head of trading atPD. ""It may gain momentum if foreign portfolio investors show interest in Indian bonds without the need of Euroclear settlements.""Euroclear  a global bond settlement platform  operates in 49 countries. Unlike India  none of them have capital gains tax on bond transactions.Abolition of capital-gain liabilities was billed as the easiest path towards having Indian debt listed on Euroclear. However  there are opposition to giving tax exemption for international investors.The index provider is said to be now checking appetite for onshore investment that can bypass Euroclearability ""Investors who were averse to including India in the index without Euroclear are now taking a relook due to concentration risk and higher yields especially after Russia's exit "" said the head of treasury of a large foreign bank.The outstanding bonds under the Fully Accessible Route are now about Rs 22.07 lakh crore  spread across 21 series  show data from the Clearing Corporation of India .
