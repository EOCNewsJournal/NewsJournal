Increased foreign fund inflows should help lower the federal funding costs.,"Mumbai: India's inclusion to the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index may be imminent  said people familiar with the matter  as sanctions against Russia opened the door after years of dithering to make the country a part of it.An inclusion would bring in estimated inflows of $30-40 billion to India as investments made based on the composition of the index  said top bond dealers. Increased foreign fund inflows should help lower the federal funding costs.The market seems to be taking a cue already. The benchmark bond closed at 7.21% Friday versus 7.29% a day earlier on expectations of a higher demand for securities. ""We see sentiment changing in the local market due to the renewed buzz over India's index inclusion "" said Sandeep Yadav  head of fixed income at DSP Mutual Fund . ""While passive flows may come after formal index inclusion which may take time  active investors will step in well before.""JPMorgan is seeking investor views on including India in the index  the Financial Times reported on Thursday.JPMorgan declined to comment.Russia's exit has necessitated the situation  where global investors are revisiting their strategy to reduce the risk of their index-linked investments getting concentrated. Global assets worth $842 billion are reportedly benchmarked against JPMorgan's indices.Russia had a 0.89% weight in the EMBIG Diversified index  and 1.03% in the ESG version of the index in March  when global sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war resulted in its removal from the benchmark.""With Russia now removed from the index  the GBI-EM Global Diversified is concentrated in a few markets "" Goldman Sachs said in a report last week. ""Given its high nominal yields  depth and size  we think India would be welcomed by investors from a diversification perspective "" it said.India's bond market is one of the largest in the emerging market pack with a market size of around $1 trillion. Capital controls clubbed with market access and operational issues have thwarted any move for including India in global bond indices.""A renewed speculation over global bond index inclusion pulled the benchmark yields down "" said Naveen Singh  head of trading atPD. ""It may gain momentum if foreign portfolio investors show interest in Indian bonds without the need of Euroclear settlements.""Euroclear  a global bond settlement platform  operates in 49 countries. Unlike India  none of them have capital gains tax on bond transactions.Abolition of capital-gain liabilities was billed as the easiest path towards having Indian debt listed on Euroclear. However  there are opposition to giving tax exemption for international investors.The index provider is said to be now checking appetite for onshore investment that can bypass Euroclearability ""Investors who were averse to including India in the index without Euroclear are now taking a relook due to concentration risk and higher yields especially after Russia's exit "" said the head of treasury of a large foreign bank.The outstanding bonds under the Fully Accessible Route are now about Rs 22.07 lakh crore  spread across 21 series  show data from the Clearing Corporation of India .
