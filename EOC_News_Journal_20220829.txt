9275,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-explains-why-india-should-pursue-inclusion-in-global-bond-indices-9100201.html,MC Explains: Why India should pursue inclusion in global bond indices,Global bond indices help investors track the movement in bonds in multiple jurisdictions and aid in relative comparisons. Indices perform the important function of being a benchmark to investments by mutual funds ,The issue of including India’s sovereign bonds in global indices has become a play that has stretched out beyond curtain calls. Talks between the Central government  index holders and investors have risen and ebbed like a Mexican wave in a sports stadium with no conclusion in sight.Every time regulators or investors jawbone on this  the market reacts vehemently. Why is it a big deal for India to be added to global bond indices? What purpose do these indices serve? We answer these and other questions:What is a global bond index?The basic purpose of an index is to track the movement of a financial instrument on which it is based. Global bond indices help investors track the movement in bonds in multiple jurisdictions and aid in relative comparisons. Indices perform the important function of being a benchmark to investments by mutual funds  pension funds and other large investors that typically prefer to hold onto investments for longer periods. In other words  indices are guides to investments.In the equity markets  there are sectoral indices  besides the main ones that track the most-traded stocks. In the bond market  there are indices that track high-yield risky bonds  emerging market bonds and government bonds.Why is inclusion in global bond indices critical?Global investors find it difficult and cumbersome to track bond markets in multiple countries. This is where bond indices come in handy. Investors track key indices globally to make investment decisions.More importantly  global funds seek to either match or outperform the returns of indices. This serves as motivation to increase or cut investments in a particular bond market.Inclusion in these indices makes such decision-making easier for investors. But above all that  index inclusion would mean a steady stream of dollar inflows from passively managed funds.Global funds dedicated to investing in specific indices typically persist with their investments even during crisis times. Therefore  for an emerging market economy such as India that is starved for capital  index inclusion guarantees a certain amount of dollar inflows regularly.What are the criteria for inclusion in bond indices?Index holders or financial firms that manage bond indices have a series of criteria for countries wanting their bonds to be included in them. They must meet parameters on liquidity  safety  and returns.The size of the market  sovereign rating  and ease of access are the main asks from index holders. The FTSE spells out a long list of conditions for inclusion in its emerging market bond index.They include no capital controls  foreign exchange liquidity  robust hedging availability and fair tax policies. Yet another ask is settlement of investments in international clearing houses such as Euroclear. JP Morgan insists that trades be settled in Euroclear for inclusion in its emerging market bond indices.The Indian sovereign bond market ticks all the boxes in terms of liquidity  safety and even returns. However  the tax policy does not meet the criteria for settlement in Euroclear. This makes entry into bond indices that insist on Euroclear settlement difficult.Even if settlement is allowed in domestic clearing houses  the process is cumbersome for foreign investors. This may put them off investments  according to bond market participants.Further  the government is not willing to exempt foreign investors from capital gains tax because it would be discriminatory for domestic investors.While these issues persist  index holders could make an exception or offer to be lenient on a criterion if a country reflects strength on several other parameters. Strong investor interest could also sway opinion on inclusion  which seems to be the case for India.What are the odds of India getting included in bond indices?There are several issues that impede bond inclusion such as the capital gains tax policy. But global investors have pressed ahead  indicating an interest in India’s fixed income market.The Reserve Bank of India’s move to allow foreign investors unbridled access to select bonds has also boosted sentiment. Some of these bonds will become eligible to be included in global indices next year.Resolution is expected on some operational issues such as settlement of investment in global clearing houses. This would pave the way for Indian bonds to be included in JPM GBI-EM Global Diversified Index and the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index. While the timeline for inclusion is unclear  some investors expect this to happen over the next 2-3 months.How will India benefit from inclusion?The benefits of inclusion in global bond indices are many. It makes investment decisions easy and that results in a steady stream of foreign inflows into domestic markets. Passive funds tend to allocate investments to a specific market based on indices and such funds are stable. Further  inclusion in global indices would strengthen a key investor base: foreign institutional investors. FIIs provide the much-needed liquidity and churn in the domestic bond market. The overall share of foreign investors is still low and the local bond market is dominated by domestic banks.Greater participation would mean that bond yields could be kept in check and the RBI may not have to face the dilemma of stepping in as a buyer to reduce the government’s borrowing cost. A steady flow of dollars also keeps the exchange rate from depreciating too much.Global bond index inclusion is indeed a salivating prospect for India. But the key to cash in on investor optimism is to hasten the process of inclusion.,neutral,0.03,0.93,0.04,mixed,0.16,0.14,0.7,True,English,"['global bond indices', 'MC Explains', 'India', 'inclusion', 'JPM GBI-EM Global Diversified Index', 'The Indian sovereign bond market', 'Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index', 'capital gains tax policy', 'emerging market bond index', 'emerging market bond indices', 'emerging market economy', 'The Reserve Bank', 'robust hedging availability', 'fair tax policies', 'international clearing houses', 'next 2-3 months', 'fixed income market', 'global clearing houses', 'particular bond market', 'bond market participants', 'domestic clearing houses', 'key investor base', 'global bond index', 'domestic bond market', 'emerging market bonds', 'Strong investor interest', 'high-yield risky bonds', 'global bond indices', 'other large investors', 'foreign institutional investors', 'several other parameters', 'foreign exchange liquidity', 'The FTSE', 'Indian bonds', 'sovereign rating', 'specific market', 'bond markets', 'sovereign bonds', 'global indices', 'index holders', 'other questions', 'other words', 'capital controls', 'domestic markets', 'key indices', 'Global investors', 'global funds', 'foreign inflows', 'domestic investors', 'several issues', 'foreign investors', 'bond inclusion', 'curtain calls', 'Mexican wave', 'sports stadium', 'big deal', 'financial instrument', 'multiple jurisdictions', 'relative comparisons', 'important function', 'longer periods', 'equity markets', 'traded stocks', 'steady stream', 'dollar inflows', 'crisis times', 'financial firms', 'long list', 'JP Morgan', 'overall share', 'sectoral indices', 'specific indices', 'index inclusion', 'mutual funds', 'pension funds', 'Passive funds', 'Central government', 'investment decisions', 'operational issues', 'basic purpose', 'multiple countries', 'main asks', 'unbridled access', 'government bonds', 'Euroclear settlement', 'play', 'Talks', 'conclusion', 'sight', 'regulators', 'movement', 'benchmark', 'investments', 'guides', 'returns', 'motivation', 'decision-making', 'amount', 'criteria', 'series', 'safety', 'size', 'ease', 'conditions', 'trades', 'boxes', 'terms', 'entry', 'process', 'exception', 'criterion', 'country', 'strength', 'opinion', 'case', 'odds', 'sentiment', 'Resolution', 'way', 'timeline', 'benefits', 'Further', 'FIIs']",2022-08-29,2022-08-29,moneycontrol.com

An offer is made only by means of the offer memorandum dated 23 June 2022 (the “Offer Memorandum”).

Following the Boskalis Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on 24 August 2022  discussions were resumed and Boskalis and HAL are pleased to announce that they have reached an agreement on an addendum to the Transaction Protocol (the “Addendum”). All terms of the Offer remain the same as announced on 24 June 2022 and as set out in the Offer Memorandum  as supplemented by the Addendum and set out in this announcement.Story continuesIncrease Offer PriceThe Offeror hereby increases the Offer Price from EUR 32.00 to EUR 33.00 (cum dividend) in cash per Share (the “Increased Offer Price”). This is the final Offer Price.The Increased Offer Price plus the EUR 0.50 cash dividend paid by Boskalis after the Initial Announcement (i.e.  EUR 33.50 in cash per Share) represents:a premium of approx. 32% to the closing price per Share on Euronext Amsterdam on the Reference Date (being 9 March 2022  the last trading date prior to the Initial Announcement);a premium of approx. 33% to the volume-weighted average closing price per Share on Euronext Amsterdam for the one month period prior to and including the Reference Date; anda premium of approx. 32% to the volume-weighted average closing price per Share on Euronext Amsterdam for the three month period prior to and including the Reference Date.The Increased Offer Price will be paid for all Tendered Shares once the Offer is declared unconditional  irrespective whether those Shares were tendered prior to or after today during the Acceptance Period. The Offeror will pay the Increased Offer Price fully through readily available cash resources.In the aggregate  the Offeror  HAL Investments and Stichting Hyacinth currently own Shares representing approximately 55.6% of the issued share capital of Boskalis.(Post-)Acceptance PeriodIn light of the increase of the Offer Price and pursuant to article 15  paragraph 9 of the Decree  the Acceptance Period is extended by operation of law. The Acceptance Period will now expire on Tuesday 6 September 2022  at 17:40 hours CET.The relevant custodian  bank or stockbroker may set an earlier deadline for communication by Shareholders in order to permit the custodian  bank or stockbroker to communicate the acceptances to the Settlement Agent in a timely manner. Accordingly  Shareholders should contact such financial intermediary to obtain information about the deadline by which such Shareholder must send instructions to the financial intermediary to accept the Offer.A Post-Acceptance Period of up to two weeks will be announced upon the Offer being declared unconditional.Boskalis Boards unanimously recommend Shareholders to tender their Shares under the OfferThe Boards  without the participation of Mr. J. van Wiechen  have frequently discussed the developments in connection with the Offer and the key items in connection therewith throughout the process. Consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the Boards  with the support of their outside financial and legal advisors  have carefully reviewed the Increased Offer Price  together with the other provisions of the Transaction Protocol  in particular the Non-Financial Covenants and the Post-Offer Restructuring (the Post-Offer Restructuring together with the Offer and the Buy-Out  the “Transaction”). After due and careful consideration  the Boards unanimously consider the Transaction to be in the interest of Boskalis  to adequately service the interests of Boskalis’ stakeholders and to promote the sustainable success of Boskalis. The Boards have furthermore unanimously concluded that the Increased Offer Price is fair  from a financial point of view  to the Shareholders (other than HAL) and that the increase of the Offer Price is such that it is convincing and warrants a recommendation to the Shareholders.Accordingly  the Boards unanimously recommend to the Shareholders to accept the Offer and to tender their Shares under the Offer.In light of his membership of the executive board of HAL  Mr. J. van Wiechen has not participated in any deliberations and decision-making by the Supervisory Board in respect of the Transaction. Accordingly  all references to the Boards are to the Boards excluding Mr. J. van Wiechen.Fairness OpinionsIn view of the Increased Offer Price  the Boards requested their respective financial advisers to update their valuation analyses as per the date of the Addendum and to each issue a fairness opinion on that basis. Based on the outcomes of their respective analyses  both financial advisers confirmed that the value ranges indicated as per the date of the Position Statement remain unchanged as per today.On 28 August 2022  the Board of Management received a written fairness opinion from AXECO Corporate Finance and the Supervisory Board received a separate written fairness opinion from Rabobank (the “Fairness Opinions”) in each case to the effect that  as of such date and subject to the qualifications  limitations  and assumptions set forth in each Fairness Opinion  (i) the Increased Offer Price is fair  from a financial point of view  to the Shareholders (other than HAL) in connection with the Offer and (ii) the Share Sale Price is fair  from a financial point of view  to Company Holdco in connection with the Share Sale.The full text of the Fairness Opinions  each of which sets forth the assumptions made  procedures followed  matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the Fairness Opinions  will be published by Boskalis on https://boskalis.com/ir/hal-offer.html.Members of the Boards will tender their SharesMr. Berdowski (CEO of Boskalis) and Mr. Heijermans (member of Boskalis’ Board of Management)  together holding 125 000 Shares (representing approx. 0.1% of the total number of Shares)  have committed to tender all their Shares under the Offer during the Acceptance Period. These members of the Boards did not receive any information from the Offeror or Boskalis relevant for a Shareholder in connection with the Offer that is not included in the Offer Memorandum or this press release  and they will tender their Shares under the Offer on the same terms (including price) and conditions as the other Shareholders.Post-Offer Restructuring and cooperation by BoskalisIf  following completion of the Offer  HAL  alone or together with its Affiliates  holds for its own account at least 95% of the Shares (and provided that there are no outstanding Protective Preference Shares)  HAL will commence statutory buy-out proceedings to acquire the remaining Shares. Reference is made to section 5.9(b) (Buy-Out  Delisting and amendment of the Articles of Association as per Delisting) of the Offer Memorandum.In light of the fact that the Offeror’s willingness to pay the Increased Offer Price is predicated on Boskalis agreeing to support and cooperate with the Post-Offer Restructuring  Boskalis is willing to support and cooperate with the Post-Offer Restructuring in accordance with the terms of the Addendum.HAL and Boskalis have agreed in the Addendum that  subject to the Offer having been completed and HAL and HAL’s Affiliates holding in the aggregate less than 95% but at least 85% of the Shares (the “Post-Offer Restructuring Range”)  the Offeror or HAL Investments may notify Boskalis that it wishes to implement the Post-Offer Merger or  with Boskalis’ consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld  conditioned or delayed)  an alternative Delisting structure (the Post-Offer Merger or such agreed alternative Delisting structure  the “Post-Offer Restructuring”). Boskalis and HAL will jointly review and assess all aspects of the Post-Offer Merger  including  but not limited to  change of control  regulatory and tax consequences. Boskalis has reserved the right to further consider the Post-Offer Merger as well as any alternative Delisting structure with a view to seek the best possible Delisting structure for Boskalis and its stakeholders  including its Minority Shareholders. If and to the extent  following completion of the Offer  (i) the Boards are of the view that an alternative Delisting structure would be preferable taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances and the interests of the Company and its stakeholders  in accordance with their fiduciary duties or (ii) HAL proposes an alternative Delisting structure  Boskalis and HAL shall jointly review and assess all aspects of such alternative (including the consequences for HAL  Boskalis and its stakeholders) and shall consider such alternative in good faith with a view to optimizing the structure  it being understood that if no agreement is reached on such alternative the Post-Offer Merger will be implemented if the Post-Offer Restructuring Range is met and the Offeror or HAL Investments notifies Boskalis.Boskalis has undertaken to  subject to the Post-Offer Restructuring Range being met  fully cooperate with the Post-Offer Restructuring and the implementation thereof without delay  including by convening an extraordinary general meeting to be held at such date after the Settlement Date as reasonably requested by HAL Investments or the Offeror (the “Post-Settlement EGM”) for the adoption of any resolutions necessary or advisable in connection with the Post-Offer Restructuring (the “Resolutions”). The Boards unanimously recommend the Shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions. HAL will cause all Shares held by HAL on the record date of the Post-Settlement EGM to be voted in favour of the Resolutions.In case of the “Post-Offer Merger”  Boskalis would implement a legal triangular merger (the “Triangular Merger”) with two of its to be newly incorporated subsidiaries (“Company Holdco” as direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Boskalis and “Company Sub” as direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Company Holdco). Upon the Triangular Merger becoming effective  Shareholders will be allotted shares in the capital of Company Holdco in a 1:1 exchange ratio. Once the Triangular Merger is implemented  the Boskalis listing entity will have ceased to exist and its listing will terminate. Subsequently  Company Holdco would sell and transfer to the Offeror or  if so designated by the Offeror or HAL Investments  HAL Investments or any Affiliate of HAL Investments  all issued and outstanding shares in the capital of Company Sub (the “Share Sale”). The purchase price in the Share Sale (to be paid partly in cash and partly in the form of a loan note) would be equal to the Increased Offer Price multiplied by the number of Shares immediately prior to the Triangular Merger (the “Share Sale Price”). Following completion of the Share Sale  Company Holdco would be dissolved and liquidated. It is intended that an advance liquidation distribution will be made on or about the date of the completion of the Share Sale resulting in a payment per share in the capital of Company Holdco to the fullest extent possible equal to the Increased Offer Price  without any interest and less applicable withholding taxes or other taxes.Although the amount per Company Holdco share of the advance liquidation distribution in the Post-Offer Merger (if implemented) would to the fullest extent possible be equal to the Increased Offer Price  such advance liquidation distribution will generally be subject to 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax to the extent it exceeds Company Holdco’s average paid-in capital recognised for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes. The Increased Offer Price paid for Shares tendered under the Offer will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax. As a result  the consideration per Share to be received by non-tendering Shareholders in the Post-Offer Merger (if implemented) after deduction and withholding of the applicable Dutch dividend withholding tax may be significantly less than the Increased Offer Price. Reference is made to section 5.10(d) (Tax treatment of distributions) of the Offer Memorandum.Boskalis Investor Relations:Martijn L.D.
