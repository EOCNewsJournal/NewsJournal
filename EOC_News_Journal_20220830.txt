Following the Boskalis Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on 24 August 2022  discussions were resumed and Boskalis and HAL are pleased to announce that they have reached an agreement on an addendum to the Transaction Protocol (the “Addendum”). All terms of the Offer remain the same as announced on 24 June 2022 and as set out in the Offer Memorandum  as supplemented by the Addendum and set out in this announcement.Story continuesIncrease Offer PriceThe Offeror hereby increases the Offer Price from EUR 32.00 to EUR 33.00 (cum dividend) in cash per Share (the “Increased Offer Price”). This is the final Offer Price.The Increased Offer Price plus the EUR 0.50 cash dividend paid by Boskalis after the Initial Announcement (i.e.  EUR 33.50 in cash per Share) represents:a premium of approx. 32% to the closing price per Share on Euronext Amsterdam on the Reference Date (being 9 March 2022  the last trading date prior to the Initial Announcement);a premium of approx. 33% to the volume-weighted average closing price per Share on Euronext Amsterdam for the one month period prior to and including the Reference Date; anda premium of approx. 32% to the volume-weighted average closing price per Share on Euronext Amsterdam for the three month period prior to and including the Reference Date.The Increased Offer Price will be paid for all Tendered Shares once the Offer is declared unconditional  irrespective whether those Shares were tendered prior to or after today during the Acceptance Period. The Offeror will pay the Increased Offer Price fully through readily available cash resources.In the aggregate  the Offeror  HAL Investments and Stichting Hyacinth currently own Shares representing approximately 55.6% of the issued share capital of Boskalis.(Post-)Acceptance PeriodIn light of the increase of the Offer Price and pursuant to article 15  paragraph 9 of the Decree  the Acceptance Period is extended by operation of law. The Acceptance Period will now expire on Tuesday 6 September 2022  at 17:40 hours CET.The relevant custodian  bank or stockbroker may set an earlier deadline for communication by Shareholders in order to permit the custodian  bank or stockbroker to communicate the acceptances to the Settlement Agent in a timely manner. Accordingly  Shareholders should contact such financial intermediary to obtain information about the deadline by which such Shareholder must send instructions to the financial intermediary to accept the Offer.A Post-Acceptance Period of up to two weeks will be announced upon the Offer being declared unconditional.Boskalis Boards unanimously recommend Shareholders to tender their Shares under the OfferThe Boards  without the participation of Mr. J. van Wiechen  have frequently discussed the developments in connection with the Offer and the key items in connection therewith throughout the process. Consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities  the Boards  with the support of their outside financial and legal advisors  have carefully reviewed the Increased Offer Price  together with the other provisions of the Transaction Protocol  in particular the Non-Financial Covenants and the Post-Offer Restructuring (the Post-Offer Restructuring together with the Offer and the Buy-Out  the “Transaction”). After due and careful consideration  the Boards unanimously consider the Transaction to be in the interest of Boskalis  to adequately service the interests of Boskalis’ stakeholders and to promote the sustainable success of Boskalis. The Boards have furthermore unanimously concluded that the Increased Offer Price is fair  from a financial point of view  to the Shareholders (other than HAL) and that the increase of the Offer Price is such that it is convincing and warrants a recommendation to the Shareholders.Accordingly  the Boards unanimously recommend to the Shareholders to accept the Offer and to tender their Shares under the Offer.In light of his membership of the executive board of HAL  Mr. J. van Wiechen has not participated in any deliberations and decision-making by the Supervisory Board in respect of the Transaction. Accordingly  all references to the Boards are to the Boards excluding Mr. J. van Wiechen.Fairness OpinionsIn view of the Increased Offer Price  the Boards requested their respective financial advisers to update their valuation analyses as per the date of the Addendum and to each issue a fairness opinion on that basis. Based on the outcomes of their respective analyses  both financial advisers confirmed that the value ranges indicated as per the date of the Position Statement remain unchanged as per today.On 28 August 2022  the Board of Management received a written fairness opinion from AXECO Corporate Finance and the Supervisory Board received a separate written fairness opinion from Rabobank (the “Fairness Opinions”) in each case to the effect that  as of such date and subject to the qualifications  limitations  and assumptions set forth in each Fairness Opinion  (i) the Increased Offer Price is fair  from a financial point of view  to the Shareholders (other than HAL) in connection with the Offer and (ii) the Share Sale Price is fair  from a financial point of view  to Company Holdco in connection with the Share Sale.The full text of the Fairness Opinions  each of which sets forth the assumptions made  procedures followed  matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the Fairness Opinions  will be published by Boskalis on https://boskalis.com/ir/hal-offer.html.Members of the Boards will tender their SharesMr. Berdowski (CEO of Boskalis) and Mr. Heijermans (member of Boskalis’ Board of Management)  together holding 125 000 Shares (representing approx. 0.1% of the total number of Shares)  have committed to tender all their Shares under the Offer during the Acceptance Period. These members of the Boards did not receive any information from the Offeror or Boskalis relevant for a Shareholder in connection with the Offer that is not included in the Offer Memorandum or this press release  and they will tender their Shares under the Offer on the same terms (including price) and conditions as the other Shareholders.Post-Offer Restructuring and cooperation by BoskalisIf  following completion of the Offer  HAL  alone or together with its Affiliates  holds for its own account at least 95% of the Shares (and provided that there are no outstanding Protective Preference Shares)  HAL will commence statutory buy-out proceedings to acquire the remaining Shares. Reference is made to section 5.9(b) (Buy-Out  Delisting and amendment of the Articles of Association as per Delisting) of the Offer Memorandum.In light of the fact that the Offeror’s willingness to pay the Increased Offer Price is predicated on Boskalis agreeing to support and cooperate with the Post-Offer Restructuring  Boskalis is willing to support and cooperate with the Post-Offer Restructuring in accordance with the terms of the Addendum.HAL and Boskalis have agreed in the Addendum that  subject to the Offer having been completed and HAL and HAL’s Affiliates holding in the aggregate less than 95% but at least 85% of the Shares (the “Post-Offer Restructuring Range”)  the Offeror or HAL Investments may notify Boskalis that it wishes to implement the Post-Offer Merger or  with Boskalis’ consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld  conditioned or delayed)  an alternative Delisting structure (the Post-Offer Merger or such agreed alternative Delisting structure  the “Post-Offer Restructuring”). Boskalis and HAL will jointly review and assess all aspects of the Post-Offer Merger  including  but not limited to  change of control  regulatory and tax consequences. Boskalis has reserved the right to further consider the Post-Offer Merger as well as any alternative Delisting structure with a view to seek the best possible Delisting structure for Boskalis and its stakeholders  including its Minority Shareholders. If and to the extent  following completion of the Offer  (i) the Boards are of the view that an alternative Delisting structure would be preferable taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances and the interests of the Company and its stakeholders  in accordance with their fiduciary duties or (ii) HAL proposes an alternative Delisting structure  Boskalis and HAL shall jointly review and assess all aspects of such alternative (including the consequences for HAL  Boskalis and its stakeholders) and shall consider such alternative in good faith with a view to optimizing the structure  it being understood that if no agreement is reached on such alternative the Post-Offer Merger will be implemented if the Post-Offer Restructuring Range is met and the Offeror or HAL Investments notifies Boskalis.Boskalis has undertaken to  subject to the Post-Offer Restructuring Range being met  fully cooperate with the Post-Offer Restructuring and the implementation thereof without delay  including by convening an extraordinary general meeting to be held at such date after the Settlement Date as reasonably requested by HAL Investments or the Offeror (the “Post-Settlement EGM”) for the adoption of any resolutions necessary or advisable in connection with the Post-Offer Restructuring (the “Resolutions”). The Boards unanimously recommend the Shareholders to vote in favour of the Resolutions. HAL will cause all Shares held by HAL on the record date of the Post-Settlement EGM to be voted in favour of the Resolutions.In case of the “Post-Offer Merger”  Boskalis would implement a legal triangular merger (the “Triangular Merger”) with two of its to be newly incorporated subsidiaries (“Company Holdco” as direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Boskalis and “Company Sub” as direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Company Holdco). Upon the Triangular Merger becoming effective  Shareholders will be allotted shares in the capital of Company Holdco in a 1:1 exchange ratio. Once the Triangular Merger is implemented  the Boskalis listing entity will have ceased to exist and its listing will terminate. Subsequently  Company Holdco would sell and transfer to the Offeror or  if so designated by the Offeror or HAL Investments  HAL Investments or any Affiliate of HAL Investments  all issued and outstanding shares in the capital of Company Sub (the “Share Sale”). The purchase price in the Share Sale (to be paid partly in cash and partly in the form of a loan note) would be equal to the Increased Offer Price multiplied by the number of Shares immediately prior to the Triangular Merger (the “Share Sale Price”). Following completion of the Share Sale  Company Holdco would be dissolved and liquidated. It is intended that an advance liquidation distribution will be made on or about the date of the completion of the Share Sale resulting in a payment per share in the capital of Company Holdco to the fullest extent possible equal to the Increased Offer Price  without any interest and less applicable withholding taxes or other taxes.Although the amount per Company Holdco share of the advance liquidation distribution in the Post-Offer Merger (if implemented) would to the fullest extent possible be equal to the Increased Offer Price  such advance liquidation distribution will generally be subject to 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax to the extent it exceeds Company Holdco’s average paid-in capital recognised for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes. The Increased Offer Price paid for Shares tendered under the Offer will not be subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax.

9295,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/mc-explains-why-india-should-pursue-inclusion-in-global-bond-indices-9100201.html,MC Explains | Why India should pursue inclusion in global bond indices,Several issues impede Indiaâs inclusion in global bond indices  such as the capital gains tax policy.,The issue of including India’s sovereign bonds in global indices has become a play that has stretched out beyond curtain calls. Talks between the Central government  index holders and investors have risen and ebbed like a Mexican wave in a sports stadium with no conclusion in sight.Every time regulators or investors jawbone on this  the market reacts vehemently. Why is it a big deal for India to be added to global bond indices? What purpose do these indices serve? We answer these and other questions:What is a global bond index?The basic purpose of an index is to track the movement of a financial instrument on which it is based. Global bond indices help investors track the movement in bonds in multiple jurisdictions and aid in relative comparisons. Indices perform the important function of being a benchmark to investments by mutual funds  pension funds and other large investors that typically prefer to hold onto investments for longer periods. In other words  indices are guides to investments.In the equity markets  there are sectoral indices  besides the main ones that track the most-traded stocks. In the bond market  there are indices that track high-yield risky bonds  emerging market bonds and government bonds.Why is inclusion in global bond indices critical?Global investors find it difficult and cumbersome to track bond markets in multiple countries. This is where bond indices come in handy. Investors track key indices globally to make investment decisions.More importantly  global funds seek to either match or outperform the returns of indices. This serves as motivation to increase or cut investments in a particular bond market.Inclusion in these indices makes such decision-making easier for investors. But above all that  index inclusion would mean a steady stream of dollar inflows from passively managed funds.Global funds dedicated to investing in specific indices typically persist with their investments even during crisis times. Therefore  for an emerging market economy such as India that is starved for capital  index inclusion guarantees a certain amount of dollar inflows regularly.What are the criteria for inclusion in bond indices?Index holders or financial firms that manage bond indices have a series of criteria for countries wanting their bonds to be included in them. They must meet parameters on liquidity  safety  and returns.The size of the market  sovereign rating  and ease of access are the main asks from index holders. The FTSE spells out a long list of conditions for inclusion in its emerging market bond index.They include no capital controls  foreign exchange liquidity  robust hedging availability and fair tax policies. Yet another ask is settlement of investments in international clearing houses such as Euroclear. JP Morgan insists that trades be settled in Euroclear for inclusion in its emerging market bond indices.The Indian sovereign bond market ticks all the boxes in terms of liquidity  safety and even returns. However  the tax policy does not meet the criteria for settlement in Euroclear. This makes entry into bond indices that insist on Euroclear settlement difficult.Even if settlement is allowed in domestic clearing houses  the process is cumbersome for foreign investors. This may put them off investments  according to bond market participants.Further  the government is not willing to exempt foreign investors from capital gains tax because it would be discriminatory for domestic investors.While these issues persist  index holders could make an exception or offer to be lenient on a criterion if a country reflects strength on several other parameters. Strong investor interest could also sway opinion on inclusion  which seems to be the case for India.What are the odds of India getting included in bond indices?There are several issues that impede bond inclusion such as the capital gains tax policy. But global investors have pressed ahead  indicating an interest in India’s fixed income market.The Reserve Bank of India’s move to allow foreign investors unbridled access to select bonds has also boosted sentiment. Some of these bonds will become eligible to be included in global indices next year.Resolution is expected on some operational issues such as settlement of investment in global clearing houses. This would pave the way for Indian bonds to be included in JPM GBI-EM Global Diversified Index and the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index. While the timeline for inclusion is unclear  some investors expect this to happen over the next 2-3 months.How will India benefit from inclusion?The benefits of inclusion in global bond indices are many. It makes investment decisions easy and that results in a steady stream of foreign inflows into domestic markets. Passive funds tend to allocate investments to a specific market based on indices and such funds are stable. Further  inclusion in global indices would strengthen a key investor base: foreign institutional investors. FIIs provide the much-needed liquidity and churn in the domestic bond market. The overall share of foreign investors is still low and the local bond market is dominated by domestic banks.Greater participation would mean that bond yields could be kept in check and the RBI may not have to face the dilemma of stepping in as a buyer to reduce the government’s borrowing cost. A steady flow of dollars also keeps the exchange rate from depreciating too much.Global bond index inclusion is indeed a salivating prospect for India. But the key to cash in on investor optimism is to hasten the process of inclusion.,neutral,0.08,0.83,0.09,mixed,0.16,0.14,0.7,True,English,"['global bond indices', 'MC Explains', 'India', 'inclusion', 'JPM GBI-EM Global Diversified Index', 'The Indian sovereign bond market', 'Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index', 'capital gains tax policy', 'emerging market bond index', 'emerging market bond indices', 'emerging market economy', 'The Reserve Bank', 'robust hedging availability', 'fair tax policies', 'international clearing houses', 'next 2-3 months', 'fixed income market', 'global clearing houses', 'particular bond market', 'bond market participants', 'domestic clearing houses', 'key investor base', 'global bond index', 'domestic bond market', 'emerging market bonds', 'Strong investor interest', 'high-yield risky bonds', 'global bond indices', 'other large investors', 'foreign institutional investors', 'several other parameters', 'foreign exchange liquidity', 'The FTSE', 'Indian bonds', 'sovereign rating', 'specific market', 'bond markets', 'sovereign bonds', 'global indices', 'index holders', 'other questions', 'other words', 'capital controls', 'domestic markets', 'key indices', 'Global investors', 'global funds', 'foreign inflows', 'domestic investors', 'several issues', 'foreign investors', 'bond inclusion', 'curtain calls', 'Mexican wave', 'sports stadium', 'big deal', 'financial instrument', 'multiple jurisdictions', 'relative comparisons', 'important function', 'longer periods', 'equity markets', 'traded stocks', 'steady stream', 'dollar inflows', 'crisis times', 'financial firms', 'long list', 'JP Morgan', 'overall share', 'sectoral indices', 'specific indices', 'index inclusion', 'mutual funds', 'pension funds', 'Passive funds', 'Central government', 'investment decisions', 'operational issues', 'basic purpose', 'multiple countries', 'main asks', 'unbridled access', 'government bonds', 'Euroclear settlement', 'play', 'Talks', 'conclusion', 'sight', 'regulators', 'movement', 'benchmark', 'investments', 'guides', 'returns', 'motivation', 'decision-making', 'amount', 'criteria', 'series', 'safety', 'size', 'ease', 'conditions', 'trades', 'boxes', 'terms', 'entry', 'process', 'exception', 'criterion', 'country', 'strength', 'opinion', 'case', 'odds', 'sentiment', 'Resolution', 'way', 'timeline', 'benefits', 'Further', 'FIIs']",2022-08-29,2022-08-30,moneycontrol.com

The work to underpin digitisation dovetails with the objectives of open finance by exposing a wider range of financial products and services to the transformative impact of third-party data sharing.Amongst securities markets players  there are a number of debates on the future market architecture taking place. They include the reduction in settlement cycles  technology rails like Central Bank Digital Currency  and the proportion of business taking place in traditional ‘market hours’ versus 24/7 markets.Digitisation will be an important precursor and enabler of these developments – and investors  advisors and other stakeholders across the UK stand to benefit.Fully digitising the City will be transformative but it will require a careful  co-ordinated and inclusive approach to ensure stability  security and operational efficiency.Richard Fenner  Euroclear,neutral,0.1,0.88,0.03,mixed,0.61,0.22,0.17,True,English,"['Letters', 'Innovation', 'City', 'The UK Secondary Capital Raising Review recommendations', 'Central Bank Digital Currency', 'UK financial services sector', 'capital raising processes', 'single digital register', 'publicly traded companies', 'third-party data sharing', 'future market architecture', 'traditional ‘market hours', 'securities markets players', 'other important possibilities', 'financial products', '24/7 markets', 'important precursor', 'other stakeholders', 'next PM', 'energy crisis', 'share certificates', 'open finance', 'wider range', 'transformative impact', 'settlement cycles', 'technology rails', 'careful, co-ordinated', 'inclusive approach', 'operational efficiency', 'Richard Fenner', 'Chancellor Zahawi', 'Nadhim Zahawi', 'Letters', 'Innovation', 'City', 'acceptance', 'raft', 'improvements', 'move', 'digitisation', 'shares', 'shareholdings', 'work', 'objectives', 'number', 'debates', 'place', 'reduction', 'proportion', 'business', 'enabler', 'developments', 'investors', 'advisors', 'stability', 'security', 'Euroclear']",2022-08-30,2022-08-30,cityam.com

(Euronext Growth: ALONX  Nasdaq First North: ONXEO)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of innovative drugs targeting tumor DNA Damage Response (DDR) in particular against rare or resistant forms of cancer ,"Last day of trading on the First North Growth market on November 8  2022Listing on Euronext Growth Paris remains unchangedPARIS  August 30  2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Onxeo S.A. (Euronext Growth: ALONX  Nasdaq First North: ONXEO)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of innovative drugs targeting tumor DNA Damage Response (DDR) in particular against rare or resistant forms of cancer  today announced that Nasdaq approved the removal of shares from First North Growth trading.Delisting/removal of sharesAs announced on August 17  2022  the Combined General Meeting of Onxeo SA has approved that the Company’s shares are to be delisted and removed from trading on Nasdaq’s First North Growth market.Onxeo has subsequently applied for and received  by letter dated August 29  approval by Nasdaq Copenhagen that Onxeo shares are removed from trading on First North Growth. Shareholders holding Onxeo shares denominated in DKK and currently tradable on First North Growth (the ""Danish Onxeo shares"") are referred to as ""Danish shareholders"". These shares are issued via Euronext Securities (formerly VP Securities) in Denmark.As a primary listing  Onxeo shares are listed for trading on Euronext Growth Paris  a multilateral trading facility. These shares denominated in euros (the ""French Onxeo shares"") are issued via Euroclear Bank N.V.Both the French Onxeo shares and the Danish Onxeo shares are registered with the same security identification number ISIN FR0010095596. The rights attached to the Danish Onxeo shares and the French Onxeo shares are the same.In accordance with Nasdaq Rulebook  Danish Onxeo shares will remain tradable on First North Growth  subject to availability of counterparties  for a period until November 8  2022. After this period  they will be removed from trading and Onxeo will provide that these shares  issued via Euronext Securities  are exchanged for French Onxeo shares  issued via Euroclear and freely tradable on Euronext Growth  Paris.Story continuesExchange of sharesFollowing the last day of trading on and removal from First North Growth  which will happen November 8  2022  the Company is expecting to instruct Nordea Danmark  subsidiary of Nordea Bank Abp  Finland (""Nordea"")  to exchange the Company’s Danish Onxeo shares with the Company’s French Onxeo shares  as Nordea holds such number of French Onxeo shares equal to and as basis for the issued Danish Onxeo shares.Danish shareholders will receive one French Onxeo Share in exchange of each Danish Onxeo Share they hold. These shares  issued via Euroclear  will be deposited (by book entry) in a custody account that can contain Euroclear issued securities. For most  if not all  Danish shareholders this will constitute a foreign security and be placed in a foreign custody account. Danish shareholders’ banks holding the current custody account for shares in Euronext Securities are expected to have custody accounts for foreign securities with correspondent banks in which to hold the French Onxeo shares.The exchange will be made with Onxeo discharging the cost and fees of Nordea that would normally be the cost of a Danish Shareholder requesting to convert/exchange a Danish Onxeo Share with a French Onxeo Share.The expected timetable after the removal from trading for the expected exchange of shares will be announced as soon as the detailed timetable has been agreed with Nordea  acting as the share issuing agent of Onxeo.TaxThe Danish Onxeo shareholders are advised to seek independent tax advise based on the individual shareholders circumstances. However  based on existing case law an exchange of shares with identical shareholder rights (economical rights and voting rights) should as a main rule be tax-exempt. Against this background  it is Onxeo’s view that the proposed expected exchange of the Danish Onxeo shares with French Onxeo shares should be tax-exempt as the shares have identical rights for the shareholders towards the company  same ISIN and only differ by way of denomination (EUR/DKK) and the marketplace where the shares are admitted for trading (Euronext Growth/First North Growth).Investors objecting to the share exchangeOnxeo is not seeking shareholders’ consent for the exchange of Danish Onxeo shares with French Onxeo share  because this operation is expected to be executed to provide Danish shareholders with the best possible and cheapest solution to maintain a share that can be traded on a trading platform.In case Danish Onxeo Shareholders do not accept a share exchange  they will need to give their custody bank written notice hereof no later than November 8  2022  5 pm CET. As a result  they will remain holders of Danish Onxeo shares and Onxeo will seek to have such remaining Danish Onxeo shares de-registered from Euronext Securities. Upon deregistration  these Danish Onxeo shares will be cancelled and replaced by a physical certificate (the ""Yellow Certificate"") that will allow shareholders to receive French Onxeo shares from Nordea if and when they decide  at their own cost. If Danish Onxeo Shareholders objecting to the automatic exchange fail to collect (and ultimately convert) their Yellow Certificate granted to them at the de-registration  they would lose the possibility to trade their Onxeo shares.For further information  shareholders are invited to consult the Frequently asked questions relating to the withdrawal of the Company from the Nasdaq First North market in Copenhagen  available on the Company's website  in the General Meetings section. Shareholders may also contact Onxeo’s investors’ relations team by email at investors@onxeo.com.About OnxeoOnxeo (Euronext Growth Paris  NASDAQ First North Growth Copenhagen: ONXEO) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing innovative oncology drugs targeting tumor DNA-binding functions through unique mechanisms of action in the sought-after field of DNA Damage Response (DDR).

PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-stereoisomer of pioglitazone which has reduced PPARγ activity but retains non-genomic thiazolidinedione (TZD) actions.“Pioglitazone has a good record of efficacy in NASH with 6 clinical trials in NASH patients to-date having demonstrated substantial benefits on liver histology that compare favorably to other oral molecules in development ” said Stephen Harrison  MD  President  Summit Clinical Research. “DESTINY-1 was designed to show that PXL065 could achieve a similar efficacy profile as PPARγ targets  but with reduced adverse effects of body weight increase and edema. As the principal investigator of this important trial  I am pleased by the data we’ve seen so far and am looking forward to reviewing the pending histology results soon.”“The data we’ve seen to-date support our hypothesis – that deuterium modification of the pioglitazone R-enantiomer produces differentiated pharmacology – by reducing PPARγ activity and related adverse effects while retaining aspects of pioglitazone-like efficacy ” said Pascale Fouqueray  MD  PhD  Executive Vice President  Clinical Development and Regulatory Affairs at Poxel. “Positive effects on liver fat content and a well-recognized biomarker of fibrogenesis are reassuring. We are excited to soon review the histology results from this study.”“These Phase 2 results in NASH are an important milestone for Poxel and add to our track record of executing successful clinical trials. With the addition of the histology data from the DESTINY-1 trial  PXL065 could be advanced into a pivotal Phase 3 program for NASH – representing a large unmet need and market opportunity ” stated Thomas Kuhn  Chief Executive Officer of Poxel. “Today’s results also validate the concept of the d-TZD platform  which could be utilized in additional diseases such as ALD. We remain fully committed to improve the health and well-being of patients through the development of innovative treatments for serious chronic metabolic diseases.”Summary of Phase 2 NASH (DESTINY-1) PXL065 Study ResultsDESTINY-1 is a Phase 2  36-week  randomized  dose-ranging  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of PXL065 in patients with noncirrhotic biopsy-proven NASH across multiple clinical sites in the US. The primary endpoint of the study measured the relative change in the percentage of liver fat content based on magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). The study also assessed the effects of PXL065 on liver histology and other metabolic and non-metabolic biomarkers. Histology results are expected in September.Top-line results available at present include:117 subjects were randomized to one of 4 daily (QD) treatment arms (7.5 mg  15 mg  22.5 mg  placebo).The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved: a statistically significant (p=0.024 to p=0.008) mean relative decrease vs. placebo of 21% to 25% in liver fat content from baseline to 36 weeks was observed at all PXL065 doses. 40% of patients who received PXL065 at the 22.5 mg dose achieved a >30% relative reduction in liver fat content.Non-invasive biomarker results to-date included: dose-dependent decreases in fibrogenesis markers Pro-C3 (significant vs. placebo at the 22.5 mg dose; p=0.02) and enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) index. Trends in least-square mean ALT decreases up to 18.4 IU/L vs. baseline were observed. However  this parameter did not reach statistical significance. Further data analysis is ongoing.There was no dose dependent increase in body weight: a minimal least-square mean increase of 0.68 kg was observed at the top dose of 22.5 mg vs. placebo. The incidence of edema did not show an observed treatment or dose relation when compared to placebo. With respect to other safety measures  PXL065 was observed to be generally safe and well tolerated; the number of patients presenting with treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were similar among all groups including placebo without dose effect.As predicted  pharmacokinetic measurements showed dose-proportional drug levels with the desired degree of higher exposure to the pioglitazone R-stereoisomer and reduced exposure to the (PPARg active) S-stereoisomer.Additional data from histology results are expected in September. The full Phase 2 results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting.About PXL065PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone. Although pioglitazone is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of NASH  it is the most extensively studied drug for NASH and has demonstrated “resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis” in a Phase 4 trial1. Pioglitazone is the only drug recommended for biopsy-proven NASH patients by the Practice Guidelines published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)2. Pioglitazone’s off-label use for NASH  however  has been limited due to the PPARγ-related side effects  which include weight gain  bone fractures and fluid retention.Pioglitazone is a 1:1 mixture of two mirror-image compounds (R- and S-stereoisomers) that interconvert in vivo. Using deuterium  Poxel stabilized each stereoisomer and characterized their different pharmacological properties. In in vitro studies  PXL065 has been shown to target non-genomic pathways including mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4). In preclinical animal models  PXL065 exhibits the anti-inflammatory and NASH activity associated with pioglitazone with little or no weight gain or fluid retention  side effects which are associated with the S-stereoisomer3. NASH Phase 2 (DESTINY 1 trial) results available to-date show statistically significant effects of PXL065 on liver fat content and a biomarker of liver fibrogenesis. Relative to published data for pioglitazone  reduced potential for weight gain and edema was also evident. Based upon preclinical  Phase 1 and preliminary Phase 2 results to date  Poxel believes that PXL065 may have a better therapeutic profile than pioglitazone for NASH and may also have suitable properties for further development in other indications including adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).About NASHNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolic disease with no clear disease origin that is quickly becoming a worldwide epidemic.

Fred Shaw  Hamilton Lane's global head of operations  said the firm has been helping investors to understand that crypto and blockchain are not the same thing.""Blockchain is the underlying technology but (crypto) is only one use of it.""A Partners Group spokesperson said the firm was seeing the understanding of the difference between tokenisation and cryptocurrencies ""slowly improving"".Association RisksCrypto troubles caused a US private markets manager client to hold off on launching a tokenised fund earlier this year because of the reputational risk  but it now plans to go ahead soon  said Carlos Domingo  CEO of investment platform Securitize  which launched tokenised funds tracking two S&P indices late last year.Because of the risks associated with illiquid assets  many funds investing in such assets are only open to professional investors  requiring minimum investments of $10 million.By using the blockchain technology  fund managers can offer fractions of these assets  for a fraction of the initial outlay.The tokens will enable secondary markets to develop  providing more liquidity  industry specialists say  though the Financial Stability Board has warned that this still leaves retail investors exposed to the underlying illiquid assets  which are difficult to exit quickly if prices fall.The technology can also cut costs for both asset managers and investors  the specialists say.Fund administrators and stock exchanges are trying to improve the market infrastructure to make it easier to offer tokenised funds.Euronext owns a stake in Luxembourg tokenisation platform Tokeny  and Singapore Exchange has a stake in ADDX  where Partners Group and Hamilton Lane launched their tokenised offerings.London Stock Exchange is working with fund technology firm FundAdminChain on a pilot for several tokenised funds.Hurdles remain. Arun Srivastava  partner at law firm Paul Hastings  said regulators may continue to remain unwilling to allow retail investors to invest in illiquid assets  whether tokenised or not.""To say 'we've got this blockchain product' sounds good and sounds like you're keeping up with the crypto world  but how is it any different or any better?""",neutral,0.04,0.77,0.2,mixed,0.1,0.09,0.81,True,English,"['Small Byte-Sized Funds', 'Asset Managers', 'Crypto Winter', 'US private markets manager client', 'two S&P indices', 'Mainstream asset manager abrdn', 'private markets investment firms', 'A Partners Group spokesperson', 'fund technology firm FundAdminChain', 'former investment manager', 'investment platform Securitize', '15 per cent drop', 'aggressive rate hikes', 'major central banks', 'Financial Stability Board', 'Luxembourg tokenisation platform', 'London Stock Exchange', 'several tokenised funds', 'underlying illiquid assets', 'private equity', 'secondary markets', 'underlying technology', 'stock exchanges', 'Singapore Exchange', 'Asset managers', 'fund managers', 'Fund administrators', 'tokenised offerings', 'wild moves', 'recent months', 'bite-sized units', 'small savers', 'one day', 'ultra-high inflation', 'other issues', 'Hamilton Lane', 'past year', 'rival Schroders', 'security offering', 'higher returns', 'Magnus Burkl', 'Oliver Wyman', 'close link', 'Fred Shaw', 'global head', 'same thing', 'one use', 'reputational risk', 'Carlos Domingo', 'minimum investments', 'initial outlay', 'market infrastructure', 'Arun Srivastava', 'law firm', 'Paul Hastings', 'fund fractions', 'high-risk assets', 'many funds', 'crypto turmoil', 'blockchain technology', 'crypto lender', 'Crypto troubles', 'blockchain product', 'crypto world', 'small investors', 'potential investors', 'professional investors', 'retail investors', 'Association Risks', 'industry specialists', 'fund tokens', 'cryptocurrencies', 'Bitcoin', 'space', 'minutes', 'June', 'sector', 'Celsius', 'tens', 'millions', 'dollars', 'products', 'source', 'matter', 'right', 'proponents', 'ambition', 'clients', 'leader', 'principal', 'consultants', 'operations', 'understanding', 'difference', 'CEO', 'liquidity', 'prices', 'costs', 'Euronext', 'stake', 'Tokeny', 'ADDX', 'pilot', 'Hurdles', 'regulators']",2022-08-30,2022-08-30,ndtv.com

Aug. 30  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Orange and Equinix announced today a collaboration to expand the Orange Telco Cloud footprint  using Equinix's Bare Metal as a Service capability—Equinix Metal®—to speed the deployment of Orange's New Generation International Network.

Three locations will be deployed by the end of this year: Amsterdam  Madrid and Seattle.The advancement of network-based services  largely driven by evolving customer requirements around speed of deployment and flexibility  is compelling network providers to deploy a new class of connectivity and infrastructure platform. Indeed  the Equinix 2022 Global Tech Trends Survey found 72% of companies surveyed around the world are planning to expand in the next 12 months  despite economic concerns and supply chain challenges—and they're relying on digital strategies to achieve that.By integrating with Equinix's automated dedicated Bare Metal as a Service located in proximity to its existing networks at Equinix  Orange can quickly meet customer demand for growth  deploying in weeks from inception (instead of months).Courtney Munroe  Vice President for Telecommunications Research at IDC  commented: ""This partnership between Orange and Equinix is a smart move enabling Orange to enhance its existing platform and its ability to facilitate reliable  agile digital capabilities for its customers—all while being able to more quickly meet customer demand by using Equinix Metal. IDC research shows that enterprises look to Telcos and digital infrastructure providers as key partners for hybrid IT infrastructure and cloud networking requirements. Furthermore  the enhanced Telco Cloud Platform will improve Orange's operational efficiency  and flexibility  and most importantly will allow it to offer enhanced low latency performance and on-demand requirements for enterprises around the world.""Leveraging Equinix Metal  Orange accelerates its next-generation services without the up-front CAPEX or complexities of global supply chains  while retaining full choice and control over IT infrastructure and digital transformation projects.""We are delighted to partner with Equinix to deploy Orange Telco Cloud PoPs technology on top of Equinix Metal "" explained Jean-Luc Vuillemin  Executive Vice President  International Networks at Orange.

(Euronext Growth: ALONX  Nasdaq First North: ONXEO)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of innovative drugs targeting tumor DNA Damage Response (DDR) in particular against rare or resistant forms of cancer ,"Last day of trading on the First North Growth market on November 8  2022Listing on Euronext Growth Paris remains unchangedPARIS  August 30  2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Onxeo S.A. (Euronext Growth: ALONX  Nasdaq First North: ONXEO)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of innovative drugs targeting tumor DNA Damage Response (DDR) in particular against rare or resistant forms of cancer  today announced that Nasdaq approved the removal of shares from First North Growth trading.Delisting/removal of sharesAs announced on August 17  2022  the Combined General Meeting of Onxeo SA has approved that the Company’s shares are to be delisted and removed from trading on Nasdaq’s First North Growth market.Onxeo has subsequently applied for and received  by letter dated August 29  approval by Nasdaq Copenhagen that Onxeo shares are removed from trading on First North Growth. Shareholders holding Onxeo shares denominated in DKK and currently tradable on First North Growth (the ""Danish Onxeo shares"") are referred to as ""Danish shareholders"". These shares are issued via Euronext Securities (formerly VP Securities) in Denmark.As a primary listing  Onxeo shares are listed for trading on Euronext Growth Paris  a multilateral trading facility. These shares denominated in euros (the ""French Onxeo shares"") are issued via Euroclear Bank N.V.Both the French Onxeo shares and the Danish Onxeo shares are registered with the same security identification number ISIN FR0010095596. The rights attached to the Danish Onxeo shares and the French Onxeo shares are the same.In accordance with Nasdaq Rulebook  Danish Onxeo shares will remain tradable on First North Growth  subject to availability of counterparties  for a period until November 8  2022. After this period  they will be removed from trading and Onxeo will provide that these shares  issued via Euronext Securities  are exchanged for French Onxeo shares  issued via Euroclear and freely tradable on Euronext Growth  Paris.Story continuesExchange of sharesFollowing the last day of trading on and removal from First North Growth  which will happen November 8  2022  the Company is expecting to instruct Nordea Danmark  subsidiary of Nordea Bank Abp  Finland (""Nordea"")  to exchange the Company’s Danish Onxeo shares with the Company’s French Onxeo shares  as Nordea holds such number of French Onxeo shares equal to and as basis for the issued Danish Onxeo shares.Danish shareholders will receive one French Onxeo Share in exchange of each Danish Onxeo Share they hold. These shares  issued via Euroclear  will be deposited (by book entry) in a custody account that can contain Euroclear issued securities. For most  if not all  Danish shareholders this will constitute a foreign security and be placed in a foreign custody account. Danish shareholders’ banks holding the current custody account for shares in Euronext Securities are expected to have custody accounts for foreign securities with correspondent banks in which to hold the French Onxeo shares.The exchange will be made with Onxeo discharging the cost and fees of Nordea that would normally be the cost of a Danish Shareholder requesting to convert/exchange a Danish Onxeo Share with a French Onxeo Share.The expected timetable after the removal from trading for the expected exchange of shares will be announced as soon as the detailed timetable has been agreed with Nordea  acting as the share issuing agent of Onxeo.TaxThe Danish Onxeo shareholders are advised to seek independent tax advise based on the individual shareholders circumstances. However  based on existing case law an exchange of shares with identical shareholder rights (economical rights and voting rights) should as a main rule be tax-exempt. Against this background  it is Onxeo’s view that the proposed expected exchange of the Danish Onxeo shares with French Onxeo shares should be tax-exempt as the shares have identical rights for the shareholders towards the company  same ISIN and only differ by way of denomination (EUR/DKK) and the marketplace where the shares are admitted for trading (Euronext Growth/First North Growth).Investors objecting to the share exchangeOnxeo is not seeking shareholders’ consent for the exchange of Danish Onxeo shares with French Onxeo share  because this operation is expected to be executed to provide Danish shareholders with the best possible and cheapest solution to maintain a share that can be traded on a trading platform.In case Danish Onxeo Shareholders do not accept a share exchange  they will need to give their custody bank written notice hereof no later than November 8  2022  5 pm CET. As a result  they will remain holders of Danish Onxeo shares and Onxeo will seek to have such remaining Danish Onxeo shares de-registered from Euronext Securities. Upon deregistration  these Danish Onxeo shares will be cancelled and replaced by a physical certificate (the ""Yellow Certificate"") that will allow shareholders to receive French Onxeo shares from Nordea if and when they decide  at their own cost. If Danish Onxeo Shareholders objecting to the automatic exchange fail to collect (and ultimately convert) their Yellow Certificate granted to them at the de-registration  they would lose the possibility to trade their Onxeo shares.For further information  shareholders are invited to consult the Frequently asked questions relating to the withdrawal of the Company from the Nasdaq First North market in Copenhagen  available on the Company's website  in the General Meetings section. Shareholders may also contact Onxeo’s investors’ relations team by email at investors@onxeo.com.About OnxeoOnxeo (Euronext Growth Paris  NASDAQ First North Growth Copenhagen: ONXEO) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing innovative oncology drugs targeting tumor DNA-binding functions through unique mechanisms of action in the sought-after field of DNA Damage Response (DDR).
