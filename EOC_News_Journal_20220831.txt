The work to underpin digitisation dovetails with the objectives of open finance by exposing a wider range of financial products and services to the transformative impact of third-party data sharing.Amongst securities markets players  there are a number of debates on the future market architecture taking place. They include the reduction in settlement cycles  technology rails like Central Bank Digital Currency  and the proportion of business taking place in traditional ‘market hours’ versus 24/7 markets.Digitisation will be an important precursor and enabler of these developments – and investors  advisors and other stakeholders across the UK stand to benefit.Fully digitising the City will be transformative but it will require a careful  co-ordinated and inclusive approach to ensure stability  security and operational efficiency.Richard Fenner  Euroclear,neutral,0.1,0.88,0.03,mixed,0.61,0.22,0.17,True,English,"['Letters', 'Innovation', 'City', 'The UK Secondary Capital Raising Review recommendations', 'Central Bank Digital Currency', 'UK financial services sector', 'capital raising processes', 'single digital register', 'publicly traded companies', 'third-party data sharing', 'future market architecture', 'traditional ‘market hours', 'securities markets players', 'other important possibilities', 'financial products', '24/7 markets', 'important precursor', 'other stakeholders', 'next PM', 'energy crisis', 'share certificates', 'open finance', 'wider range', 'transformative impact', 'settlement cycles', 'technology rails', 'careful, co-ordinated', 'inclusive approach', 'operational efficiency', 'Richard Fenner', 'Chancellor Zahawi', 'Nadhim Zahawi', 'Letters', 'Innovation', 'City', 'acceptance', 'raft', 'improvements', 'move', 'digitisation', 'shares', 'shareholdings', 'work', 'objectives', 'number', 'debates', 'place', 'reduction', 'proportion', 'business', 'enabler', 'developments', 'investors', 'advisors', 'stability', 'security', 'Euroclear']",2022-08-30,2022-08-31,cityam.com

NINDS is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the United States. The two publications describe the novel pathogenic mechanism of HERV-K in sporadic ALS and confirm the rationale for the therapeutic relevance of GeNeuro's antibody to neutralize this neurotoxic protein.Annals of Neurology is an official journal of the American Neurological Association. The online publications and their hard copy version in the last issue of the journal (HERV-K envelope in spinal fluid of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is toxic - Steiner et al  & Antibody response to HML-2 may be protective in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - Garcia-Montojo et al. - Annals of Neurology) present preclinical data showing that HERV-K/HML-2 Envelope protein (HERV-K ENV) is present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of sporadic ALS patients  leads to neuronal cell injury and death  and targets a now identified cellular receptor. The studies also show that the neurotoxic properties of the HERV-K ENV protein from ALS patients’ CSF are neutralized by GeNeuro’s anti-HERV-K ENV antibody and that  in patients with sporadic ALS  higher levels of autoantibodies targeting the HERV-K ENV protein are associated with a longer survival.Click here to read the full press releaseAbout GeNeuroGeNeuro‘s mission is to develop safe and effective treatments against neurological disorders and autoimmune diseases  such as multiple sclerosis  by neutralizing causal factors encoded by HERVs  which represent 8% of human DNA.GeNeuro is based in Geneva  Switzerland and has R&D facilities in Lyon  France.

PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-stereoisomer of pioglitazone which has reduced PPARγ activity but retains non-genomic thiazolidinedione (TZD) actions.“Pioglitazone has a good record of efficacy in NASH with 6 clinical trials in NASH patients to-date having demonstrated substantial benefits on liver histology that compare favorably to other oral molecules in development ” said Stephen Harrison  MD  President  Summit Clinical Research. “DESTINY-1 was designed to show that PXL065 could achieve a similar efficacy profile as PPARγ targets  but with reduced adverse effects of body weight increase and edema. As the principal investigator of this important trial  I am pleased by the data we’ve seen so far and am looking forward to reviewing the pending histology results soon.”“The data we’ve seen to-date support our hypothesis – that deuterium modification of the pioglitazone R-enantiomer produces differentiated pharmacology – by reducing PPARγ activity and related adverse effects while retaining aspects of pioglitazone-like efficacy ” said Pascale Fouqueray  MD  PhD  Executive Vice President  Clinical Development and Regulatory Affairs at Poxel. “Positive effects on liver fat content and a well-recognized biomarker of fibrogenesis are reassuring. We are excited to soon review the histology results from this study.”“These Phase 2 results in NASH are an important milestone for Poxel and add to our track record of executing successful clinical trials. With the addition of the histology data from the DESTINY-1 trial  PXL065 could be advanced into a pivotal Phase 3 program for NASH – representing a large unmet need and market opportunity ” stated Thomas Kuhn  Chief Executive Officer of Poxel. “Today’s results also validate the concept of the d-TZD platform  which could be utilized in additional diseases such as ALD. We remain fully committed to improve the health and well-being of patients through the development of innovative treatments for serious chronic metabolic diseases.”Summary of Phase 2 NASH (DESTINY-1) PXL065 Study ResultsDESTINY-1 is a Phase 2  36-week  randomized  dose-ranging  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of PXL065 in patients with noncirrhotic biopsy-proven NASH across multiple clinical sites in the US. The primary endpoint of the study measured the relative change in the percentage of liver fat content based on magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). The study also assessed the effects of PXL065 on liver histology and other metabolic and non-metabolic biomarkers. Histology results are expected in September.Top-line results available at present include:117 subjects were randomized to one of 4 daily (QD) treatment arms (7.5 mg  15 mg  22.5 mg  placebo).The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved: a statistically significant (p=0.024 to p=0.008) mean relative decrease vs. placebo of 21% to 25% in liver fat content from baseline to 36 weeks was observed at all PXL065 doses. 40% of patients who received PXL065 at the 22.5 mg dose achieved a >30% relative reduction in liver fat content.Non-invasive biomarker results to-date included: dose-dependent decreases in fibrogenesis markers Pro-C3 (significant vs. placebo at the 22.5 mg dose; p=0.02) and enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) index. Trends in least-square mean ALT decreases up to 18.4 IU/L vs. baseline were observed. However  this parameter did not reach statistical significance. Further data analysis is ongoing.There was no dose dependent increase in body weight: a minimal least-square mean increase of 0.68 kg was observed at the top dose of 22.5 mg vs. placebo. The incidence of edema did not show an observed treatment or dose relation when compared to placebo. With respect to other safety measures  PXL065 was observed to be generally safe and well tolerated; the number of patients presenting with treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were similar among all groups including placebo without dose effect.As predicted  pharmacokinetic measurements showed dose-proportional drug levels with the desired degree of higher exposure to the pioglitazone R-stereoisomer and reduced exposure to the (PPARg active) S-stereoisomer.Additional data from histology results are expected in September. The full Phase 2 results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting.About PXL065PXL065 is a novel  proprietary deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone. Although pioglitazone is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of NASH  it is the most extensively studied drug for NASH and has demonstrated “resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis” in a Phase 4 trial1. Pioglitazone is the only drug recommended for biopsy-proven NASH patients by the Practice Guidelines published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)2. Pioglitazone’s off-label use for NASH  however  has been limited due to the PPARγ-related side effects  which include weight gain  bone fractures and fluid retention.Pioglitazone is a 1:1 mixture of two mirror-image compounds (R- and S-stereoisomers) that interconvert in vivo. Using deuterium  Poxel stabilized each stereoisomer and characterized their different pharmacological properties. In in vitro studies  PXL065 has been shown to target non-genomic pathways including mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4). In preclinical animal models  PXL065 exhibits the anti-inflammatory and NASH activity associated with pioglitazone with little or no weight gain or fluid retention  side effects which are associated with the S-stereoisomer3. NASH Phase 2 (DESTINY 1 trial) results available to-date show statistically significant effects of PXL065 on liver fat content and a biomarker of liver fibrogenesis. Relative to published data for pioglitazone  reduced potential for weight gain and edema was also evident. Based upon preclinical  Phase 1 and preliminary Phase 2 results to date  Poxel believes that PXL065 may have a better therapeutic profile than pioglitazone for NASH and may also have suitable properties for further development in other indications including adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).About NASHNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolic disease with no clear disease origin that is quickly becoming a worldwide epidemic. It is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver causing inflammation and fibrosis. The disease can be silent for a long period of time  but once it accelerates  severe damage and liver cirrhosis can occur  which can significantly impact liver function or can even result in liver failure or liver cancer. Typical risk factors for NASH include obesity  elevated levels of blood lipids (such as cholesterol and triglycerides) and type 2 diabetes. Currently no curative or specific therapies are available.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. Poxel has clinical and earlier-stage programs from its adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator and deuterated TZD platforms targeting chronic and rare metabolic diseases. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) met its primary endpoint in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). PXL770  a first-in-class direct AMPK activator  has successfully completed a Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of NASH  which met its objectives. For the rare inherited metabolic disorder  adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)  the company intends to initiate Phase 2a proof of concept studies with PXL065 and PXL770 in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). TWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)  Poxel’s first-in-class lead product that targets mitochondrial dysfunction  is approved and marketed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan. Poxel expects to receive from Sumitomo Pharma royalties and sales-based payments. Poxel has a strategic partnership with Sumitomo Pharma for Imeglimin in Japan  China  South Korea  Taiwan and nine other Southeast Asian countries. The Company intends to generate further growth through strategic partnerships and pipeline development.

It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people.

Fred Shaw  Hamilton Lane's global head of operations  said the firm has been helping investors to understand that crypto and blockchain are not the same thing.""Blockchain is the underlying technology but (crypto) is only one use of it.""A Partners Group spokesperson said the firm was seeing the understanding of the difference between tokenisation and cryptocurrencies ""slowly improving"".Association RisksCrypto troubles caused a US private markets manager client to hold off on launching a tokenised fund earlier this year because of the reputational risk  but it now plans to go ahead soon  said Carlos Domingo  CEO of investment platform Securitize  which launched tokenised funds tracking two S&P indices late last year.Because of the risks associated with illiquid assets  many funds investing in such assets are only open to professional investors  requiring minimum investments of $10 million.By using the blockchain technology  fund managers can offer fractions of these assets  for a fraction of the initial outlay.The tokens will enable secondary markets to develop  providing more liquidity  industry specialists say  though the Financial Stability Board has warned that this still leaves retail investors exposed to the underlying illiquid assets  which are difficult to exit quickly if prices fall.The technology can also cut costs for both asset managers and investors  the specialists say.Fund administrators and stock exchanges are trying to improve the market infrastructure to make it easier to offer tokenised funds.Euronext owns a stake in Luxembourg tokenisation platform Tokeny  and Singapore Exchange has a stake in ADDX  where Partners Group and Hamilton Lane launched their tokenised offerings.London Stock Exchange is working with fund technology firm FundAdminChain on a pilot for several tokenised funds.Hurdles remain. Arun Srivastava  partner at law firm Paul Hastings  said regulators may continue to remain unwilling to allow retail investors to invest in illiquid assets  whether tokenised or not.""To say 'we've got this blockchain product' sounds good and sounds like you're keeping up with the crypto world  but how is it any different or any better?""",neutral,0.04,0.77,0.2,mixed,0.1,0.09,0.81,True,English,"['Small Byte-Sized Funds', 'Asset Managers', 'Crypto Winter', 'US private markets manager client', 'two S&P indices', 'Mainstream asset manager abrdn', 'private markets investment firms', 'A Partners Group spokesperson', 'fund technology firm FundAdminChain', 'former investment manager', 'investment platform Securitize', '15 per cent drop', 'aggressive rate hikes', 'major central banks', 'Financial Stability Board', 'Luxembourg tokenisation platform', 'London Stock Exchange', 'several tokenised funds', 'underlying illiquid assets', 'private equity', 'secondary markets', 'underlying technology', 'stock exchanges', 'Singapore Exchange', 'Asset managers', 'fund managers', 'Fund administrators', 'tokenised offerings', 'wild moves', 'recent months', 'bite-sized units', 'small savers', 'one day', 'ultra-high inflation', 'other issues', 'Hamilton Lane', 'past year', 'rival Schroders', 'security offering', 'higher returns', 'Magnus Burkl', 'Oliver Wyman', 'close link', 'Fred Shaw', 'global head', 'same thing', 'one use', 'reputational risk', 'Carlos Domingo', 'minimum investments', 'initial outlay', 'market infrastructure', 'Arun Srivastava', 'law firm', 'Paul Hastings', 'fund fractions', 'high-risk assets', 'many funds', 'crypto turmoil', 'blockchain technology', 'crypto lender', 'Crypto troubles', 'blockchain product', 'crypto world', 'small investors', 'potential investors', 'professional investors', 'retail investors', 'Association Risks', 'industry specialists', 'fund tokens', 'cryptocurrencies', 'Bitcoin', 'space', 'minutes', 'June', 'sector', 'Celsius', 'tens', 'millions', 'dollars', 'products', 'source', 'matter', 'right', 'proponents', 'ambition', 'clients', 'leader', 'principal', 'consultants', 'operations', 'understanding', 'difference', 'CEO', 'liquidity', 'prices', 'costs', 'Euronext', 'stake', 'Tokeny', 'ADDX', 'pilot', 'Hurdles', 'regulators']",2022-08-30,2022-08-31,ndtv.com

The U.S. Food...,"Sanofi - Aventis GroupeXenpozymeTM (olipudase alfa-rpcp) approved by FDA as first disease-specific treatment for ASMD (non-CNS manifestations)Paris  August 31  2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved XenpozymeTM (olipudase alfa-rpcp) for the treatment of non-central nervous system (non-CNS) manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) in adult and pediatric patients. Xenpozyme is the first therapy indicated specifically for the treatment of ASMD  and is currently the only approved treatment for this disease.Bill SiboldExecutive Vice President  Head  Specialty Care at Sanofi“Sanofi teams have been dedicated to bringing hope to patients living with ASMD and their families. This is a devastating and extremely rare disease that affects both children and adults. The approval of Xenpozyme represents the culmination of bold work done in research and development  and our unwavering commitment to this historically overlooked community.”ASMD  historically known as Niemann-Pick disease types A  A/B  and B  is an extremely rare  progressive genetic disease with significant morbidity and mortality. It has been estimated that there are fewer than 120 patients diagnosed with ASMD in the U.S. Approximately two-thirds of patients with ASMD in the U.S. are pediatric. Signs and symptoms of ASMD can present in infancy  childhood  or adulthood  and may include enlarged spleen or liver  difficulty breathing  lung infections  and unusual bruising or bleeding  among other disease manifestations. Until now  management of ASMD included supportive care to address the impact of individual symptoms and careful monitoring to detect potential disease complications.David GuyParent to Kaila  age 16  living with ASMD“As young parents  it was initially devastating to me and my wife when our daughter  Kaila  received her diagnosis of ASMD. We faced so many unknowns when we first heard the diagnosis: what does this mean  how will this affect her  and most importantly what hope is there for a treatment option? We were grateful to find hope when we enrolled Kaila in the clinical trials for olipudase alfa.”Story continuesIn the U.S.  Xenpozyme received Breakthrough Therapy designation  which expedites the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. The FDA evaluated Xenpozyme under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions.. In March 2022  Xenpozyme was approved in Japan under the SAKIGAKE (or “pioneer”) designation  marking the first approval for olipudase alfa anywhere in the world. In June 2022  the European Commission (EC) approved Xenpozyme for use in Europe.ASMD represents a spectrum of disease  with two types that may represent opposite ends of a continuum referred to as ASMD type A and ASMD type B. ASMD type A/B is an intermediate form that includes varying degrees of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.ASCEND and ASCEND-Peds clinical trials showed that Xenpozyme improved lung function and reduced spleen and liver volumes in adults and childrenThe approval is based on positive data from the ASCEND and ASCEND-Peds clinical trials  in which Xenpozyme showed clinically relevant improvement in lung function (as measured by diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide  or DLco) and platelet count  and reduction of spleen and liver volumes  with a demonstrated safety profile.Melissa WassersteinMD  Pediatric Genetic Medicine  Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore“ASMD is an extremely rare  progressive  and potentially fatal genetic disease that impacts children and adults around the world. Until now  those living with ASMD have had no FDA-approved treatment to combat this devastating condition. I’m proud of the work that has been done and look forward to witnessing the impact that this treatment may have on those living with ASMD.”The ASCEND trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Xenpozyme; 31 adult patients with ASMD type A/B or type B were randomized to receive Xenpozyme or placebo for 52 weeks (primary analysis). In the trial  Xenpozyme improved lung function  assessed as the percent change from baseline to Week 52 in predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco)  and reduced spleen volume  evaluated as percent change from baseline in multiples of normal (MN).Twelve (12) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean change in percent predicted DLco from baseline (49.1%) to Week 52 (59.4%). This change represents a 23.9% relative improvement compared to a 3% improvement in DLco from baseline in the 17 patients from the placebo group (48.5%) to Week 52 (49.9%). The difference between the two arms (20.9%) was nominally statistically significant (p=0.0003).Thirteen (13) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean reduction in spleen volume by 38.9% from baseline (11.5 MN) to Week 52 (7.2 MN) compared to a mean increase by 0.5% for the 17 patients in the placebo group from baseline (11.2 MN) to Week 52 (11.2 MN). The difference between the two arms (39.4%) was nominally statistically significant (p<0.0001).Twelve (12) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean reduction in liver volume by 26.5% from baseline (1.4 MN) to Week 52 (1.0 MN) compared to a mean decrease of 1.8% for the 17 patients in the placebo group from baseline (1.6 MN) to Week 52 (1.6 MN). The difference between the two arms (24.7%) was nominally statistically significant (p<0.0001).Thirteen (13) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean improvement in platelet count by 18.3% from baseline (109.3x10 9 /L) to Week 52 (126.4x10 9 /L) compared to increase by 2.7% for the 16 patients in the placebo group from baseline (115.6x10 9 /L) to Week 52 (120.2x10 9 /L). The difference between the two arms (15.6%) was nominally statistically significant (p=0.0280).All ASCEND patients treated with Xenpozyme showed improvement in key endpoints (DLco and spleen and liver volume).Most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in adults (incidence ≥10%) were headache  cough  diarrhea  hypotension  and ocular hyperemia.The single-arm ASCEND-Peds trial studied 8 pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age with ASMD type A/B or type B who all received Xenpozyme  with a primary objective of evaluating the safety and tolerability of Xenpozyme for 64 weeks. All patients completed the study and continued in an extension trial. The ASCEND-Peds trial also explored efficacy endpoints of progressive lung disease  spleen and liver enlargement  and platelet count. After one year of treatment (52 weeks):Three (3) patients who were able to perform the test at baseline treated with Xenpozyme had a mean relative improvement of 45.9% in percent predicted DLco from baseline (48.5%) to Week 52 (70.9%) (children over the age of five were assessed if they were able to perform the test).Eight (8) patients treated with Xenpozyme had mean reduction in spleen volume by 46.7% from baseline (18.3 MN) to Week 52 (9.5 MN).Eight (8) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean reduction in liver volume by 38.1% from baseline (2.5 MN) to Week 52 (1.6 MN).Seven (7) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean improvement in platelet count by 37.6% from baseline (136.7x10 9 /L; n=8) to Week 52 (184.5x10 9 /L).Serious adverse reactions of anaphylactic reaction were reported in 2 (25%) Xenpozyme-treated pediatric patients.Treatment-related serious adverse reactions  hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  and infusion associated reactions occurred within 24 hours of infusion and were observed in a higher percentage of pediatric patients than in adult patients.Most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in pediatric patients (incidence ≥20%) were pyrexia  cough  diarrhea  rhinitis  abdominal pain  vomiting  headache  urticaria  nausea  rash  arthralgia  pruritus  fatigue  and pharyngitis.A scientific innovation for patients living with ASMDXenpozyme  a hydrolytic lysosomal sphingomyelin-specific enzyme replacement therapy  is designed to replace deficient or defective acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)  an enzyme that allows for the breakdown of the lipid sphingomyelin. In individuals with ASMD  the deficiency in the ASM enzyme leads to sphingomyelin accumulation in various tissues. Xenpozyme is not expected to cross the blood-brain barrier or modulate CNS manifestations of ASMD. Xenpozyme has not been studied in patients with ASMD type A.Xenpozyme is adminstered intravenously every two weeks  and its administration requires a dose escalation phase followed by a maintenance phase.Xenpozyme is expected to be available in the U.S. in the coming weeks. The U.S. list price  or wholesale acquisition cost  of Xenpozyme is $7 142.00 per vial. Actual patient out-of-pocket costs may be lower  as the list price does not reflect insurance coverage  co-pay support for eligible patients  or financial assistance from patient support programs.Sanofi is committed to helping eligible U.S. patients access the support they need and to help reduce barriers throughout their treatment journey. As part of its commitment to treatment access and affordability for innovative therapies  Sanofi provides disease education  financial and co-pay assistance programs  and other support services to eligible patients.

This contract covers a period of 30 years from the commissioning of the facility  scheduled for 2026.The hydroelectric production of the Maripa-Soula power plant is estimated at 12.7 gigawatt hours per year  making it possible to supply nearly 11 000 local inhabitants. It will replace the current production  as expensive as it is carbon-intensive  relying on the annual importation of 6 million liters of diesel necessary for the electrical consumption of Maripa-Soula  which is transported by boat  then by truck and finally by canoe to this very isolated commune.The project implies an emission reduction of more than 18 000 tonnes of CO 2 each year.The impacts of this run-of-river hydroelectric plant will be offset by the implementation of particularly ambitious environmental measures. Indeed  more than €1.1 million will be invested in a programme to preserve the surrounding forest  the creation of a fish spawning area  and ecological monitoring (fauna  flora  sediments and water quality) upstream and downstream of the facility.""We are very happy to be able to complete this new project  result of a long process initiated by all our teams on site. The hydroelectric plant will meet the energy needs of the town of Maripa-Soula with a local and clean resource. The entire Maroni valley should benefit from the positive spin-offs of the upcoming project "" said Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.Story continuesSerge Anelli  mayor of Maripa-Soula  adds: ""The implementation of this hydroelectric power station fully meets the objectives of ecological transition of the municipality: it will significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the municipality by offering the inhabitants of Maripa-Soula electricity produced from a local and renewable resource. Moreover  it will improve the quality of electricity supply to the population and create local jobs. This is a project that the town has been waiting for and that I have been advocating for several years. I am very happy to see it come to fruition.""Next on the agenda: First half 2022 results  on September 28  2022 (before market opening)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in the renewable energy sector.
