9357,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-xenpozymetm-olipudase-alfa-183000990.html,Press Release: XenpozymeTM (olipudase alfa-rpcp) approved by FDA as first disease-specific treatment for ASMD (non-CNS manifestations),XenpozymeTM (olipudase alfa-rpcp) approved by FDA as first disease-specific treatment for ASMD (non-CNS manifestations) Paris  August 31  2022. The U.S. Food...,"Sanofi - Aventis GroupeXenpozymeTM (olipudase alfa-rpcp) approved by FDA as first disease-specific treatment for ASMD (non-CNS manifestations)Paris  August 31  2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved XenpozymeTM (olipudase alfa-rpcp) for the treatment of non-central nervous system (non-CNS) manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) in adult and pediatric patients. Xenpozyme is the first therapy indicated specifically for the treatment of ASMD  and is currently the only approved treatment for this disease.Bill SiboldExecutive Vice President  Head  Specialty Care at Sanofi“Sanofi teams have been dedicated to bringing hope to patients living with ASMD and their families. This is a devastating and extremely rare disease that affects both children and adults. The approval of Xenpozyme represents the culmination of bold work done in research and development  and our unwavering commitment to this historically overlooked community.”ASMD  historically known as Niemann-Pick disease types A  A/B  and B  is an extremely rare  progressive genetic disease with significant morbidity and mortality. It has been estimated that there are fewer than 120 patients diagnosed with ASMD in the U.S. Approximately two-thirds of patients with ASMD in the U.S. are pediatric. Signs and symptoms of ASMD can present in infancy  childhood  or adulthood  and may include enlarged spleen or liver  difficulty breathing  lung infections  and unusual bruising or bleeding  among other disease manifestations. Until now  management of ASMD included supportive care to address the impact of individual symptoms and careful monitoring to detect potential disease complications.David GuyParent to Kaila  age 16  living with ASMD“As young parents  it was initially devastating to me and my wife when our daughter  Kaila  received her diagnosis of ASMD. We faced so many unknowns when we first heard the diagnosis: what does this mean  how will this affect her  and most importantly what hope is there for a treatment option? We were grateful to find hope when we enrolled Kaila in the clinical trials for olipudase alfa.”Story continuesIn the U.S.  Xenpozyme received Breakthrough Therapy designation  which expedites the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. The FDA evaluated Xenpozyme under Priority Review  which is reserved for medicines that represent potentially significant improvements in efficacy or safety in treating serious conditions.. In March 2022  Xenpozyme was approved in Japan under the SAKIGAKE (or “pioneer”) designation  marking the first approval for olipudase alfa anywhere in the world. In June 2022  the European Commission (EC) approved Xenpozyme for use in Europe.ASMD represents a spectrum of disease  with two types that may represent opposite ends of a continuum referred to as ASMD type A and ASMD type B. ASMD type A/B is an intermediate form that includes varying degrees of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.ASCEND and ASCEND-Peds clinical trials showed that Xenpozyme improved lung function and reduced spleen and liver volumes in adults and childrenThe approval is based on positive data from the ASCEND and ASCEND-Peds clinical trials  in which Xenpozyme showed clinically relevant improvement in lung function (as measured by diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide  or DLco) and platelet count  and reduction of spleen and liver volumes  with a demonstrated safety profile.Melissa WassersteinMD  Pediatric Genetic Medicine  Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore“ASMD is an extremely rare  progressive  and potentially fatal genetic disease that impacts children and adults around the world. Until now  those living with ASMD have had no FDA-approved treatment to combat this devastating condition. I’m proud of the work that has been done and look forward to witnessing the impact that this treatment may have on those living with ASMD.”The ASCEND trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Xenpozyme; 31 adult patients with ASMD type A/B or type B were randomized to receive Xenpozyme or placebo for 52 weeks (primary analysis). In the trial  Xenpozyme improved lung function  assessed as the percent change from baseline to Week 52 in predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco)  and reduced spleen volume  evaluated as percent change from baseline in multiples of normal (MN).Twelve (12) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean change in percent predicted DLco from baseline (49.1%) to Week 52 (59.4%). This change represents a 23.9% relative improvement compared to a 3% improvement in DLco from baseline in the 17 patients from the placebo group (48.5%) to Week 52 (49.9%). The difference between the two arms (20.9%) was nominally statistically significant (p=0.0003).Thirteen (13) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean reduction in spleen volume by 38.9% from baseline (11.5 MN) to Week 52 (7.2 MN) compared to a mean increase by 0.5% for the 17 patients in the placebo group from baseline (11.2 MN) to Week 52 (11.2 MN). The difference between the two arms (39.4%) was nominally statistically significant (p<0.0001).Twelve (12) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean reduction in liver volume by 26.5% from baseline (1.4 MN) to Week 52 (1.0 MN) compared to a mean decrease of 1.8% for the 17 patients in the placebo group from baseline (1.6 MN) to Week 52 (1.6 MN). The difference between the two arms (24.7%) was nominally statistically significant (p<0.0001).Thirteen (13) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean improvement in platelet count by 18.3% from baseline (109.3x10 9 /L) to Week 52 (126.4x10 9 /L) compared to increase by 2.7% for the 16 patients in the placebo group from baseline (115.6x10 9 /L) to Week 52 (120.2x10 9 /L). The difference between the two arms (15.6%) was nominally statistically significant (p=0.0280).All ASCEND patients treated with Xenpozyme showed improvement in key endpoints (DLco and spleen and liver volume).Most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in adults (incidence ≥10%) were headache  cough  diarrhea  hypotension  and ocular hyperemia.The single-arm ASCEND-Peds trial studied 8 pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age with ASMD type A/B or type B who all received Xenpozyme  with a primary objective of evaluating the safety and tolerability of Xenpozyme for 64 weeks. All patients completed the study and continued in an extension trial. The ASCEND-Peds trial also explored efficacy endpoints of progressive lung disease  spleen and liver enlargement  and platelet count. After one year of treatment (52 weeks):Three (3) patients who were able to perform the test at baseline treated with Xenpozyme had a mean relative improvement of 45.9% in percent predicted DLco from baseline (48.5%) to Week 52 (70.9%) (children over the age of five were assessed if they were able to perform the test).Eight (8) patients treated with Xenpozyme had mean reduction in spleen volume by 46.7% from baseline (18.3 MN) to Week 52 (9.5 MN).Eight (8) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean reduction in liver volume by 38.1% from baseline (2.5 MN) to Week 52 (1.6 MN).Seven (7) patients treated with Xenpozyme had a mean improvement in platelet count by 37.6% from baseline (136.7x10 9 /L; n=8) to Week 52 (184.5x10 9 /L).Serious adverse reactions of anaphylactic reaction were reported in 2 (25%) Xenpozyme-treated pediatric patients.Treatment-related serious adverse reactions  hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  and infusion associated reactions occurred within 24 hours of infusion and were observed in a higher percentage of pediatric patients than in adult patients.Most frequently reported adverse drug reactions in pediatric patients (incidence ≥20%) were pyrexia  cough  diarrhea  rhinitis  abdominal pain  vomiting  headache  urticaria  nausea  rash  arthralgia  pruritus  fatigue  and pharyngitis.A scientific innovation for patients living with ASMDXenpozyme  a hydrolytic lysosomal sphingomyelin-specific enzyme replacement therapy  is designed to replace deficient or defective acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)  an enzyme that allows for the breakdown of the lipid sphingomyelin. In individuals with ASMD  the deficiency in the ASM enzyme leads to sphingomyelin accumulation in various tissues. Xenpozyme is not expected to cross the blood-brain barrier or modulate CNS manifestations of ASMD. Xenpozyme has not been studied in patients with ASMD type A.Xenpozyme is adminstered intravenously every two weeks  and its administration requires a dose escalation phase followed by a maintenance phase.Xenpozyme is expected to be available in the U.S. in the coming weeks. The U.S. list price  or wholesale acquisition cost  of Xenpozyme is $7 142.00 per vial. Actual patient out-of-pocket costs may be lower  as the list price does not reflect insurance coverage  co-pay support for eligible patients  or financial assistance from patient support programs.Sanofi is committed to helping eligible U.S. patients access the support they need and to help reduce barriers throughout their treatment journey. As part of its commitment to treatment access and affordability for innovative therapies  Sanofi provides disease education  financial and co-pay assistance programs  and other support services to eligible patients.

9378,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/inclusion-of-indian-bonds-in-the-jp-morgan-index-faces-hurdles-9114801.html,Inclusion of Indian bonds in the JP Morgan index faces hurdles,For  even as Indian government bonds are amongst the most liquid globally  a cap on foreign ownership of government bonds  and complicated tax issues for foreign investors may act as the wet blanket.,Representative imageBy sounding out big investors on adding India to its emerging-market bond index  JPMorgan may have kindled hopes – yet again-- of including Indian government bonds  known as G-Secs. But while the prospect of being included in a global debt index raises optimism  what matters more is whether or not international investors find India to be an appealing market.For  even as Indian government bonds are amongst the most liquid globally  a cap on foreign ownership of government bonds  and complicated tax issues for foreign investors may act as the wet blanket.Last week  the Wall Street bank said it was seeking opinions from investors on whether to include the country's sovereign bonds in JPMorgan's GBI-EM Global Diversified Bond Index. This move sparked a bond rally and reignited rumours of massive inflows that would help the country finance its current account and fiscal deficits.India’s $1 trillion sovereign bond market is one of the biggest emerging markets not to be part of any global index.JPMorgan’s latest move comes even as the inclusion has been stalled for months. Reportedly  over the past two years  the finance ministry and RBI have met with index managers of at least three global benchmark indices  viz Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index and JP Morgan GBI EM Index  for India’s inclusion  but the index providers have been wary.For one  the controversial capital gains tax on foreign investors had been a major deterrent since India has been opposed to providing any kind of tax waiver even if it delays its goal of getting its bonds included in global bond indexes. Under existing rules  an overseas investor is required to pay a 30% short-term capital gains tax if a listed bond is sold within 12 months. Domestic investors  in contrast  pay short-term capital gains tax on debt investments based on their tax slabs and 4% cess.According to Madhavi Arora  lead economist at Emkay Global Financial Services  global investors want India to list its bonds on international clearing platforms -like the most popular global bond settlement platform Euroclear  which help settle securities transactions. And all clearing houses  including Euroclear  have pressed India to exempt the transactions from taxes in order for it to happen and to prevent compliance concerns. For instance  although Euroclear is active in 49 countries  none of them impose capital gains taxes on bond trades made through its platform. Since JP Morgan insists that trades be settled in Euroclear for inclusion in its emerging market bond indices  the fact that Indian authorities are refraining from abolishing the capital gains tax  could mean that the inclusion may not happen anytime soon  she adds.Secondly  the depth of a country’s debt markets is also an important criterion for inclusion and reportedly  that’s the other concern of JPMorgan. Despite RBI’s recent efforts to broaden the investor bases through Retail Direct Scheme and the unbridled access to select bonds  JPMorgan is concerned that the G-Sec markets have been traditionally dominated by large institutional investors like insurance companies  debt mutual funds and banks.Despite the eligibility to hold $32 billion worth of G-Secs  the FPI holding of the most liquid and highly rated debt instrument is a mere 28% (as on 26 August 2022)  according to the Clearing Corporation of India data. This is why  according to Mahendra Jajoo  Chief Investment Officer - Fixed Income at Mirae Asset Investment Managers---what is more important than the index inclusion is whether foreign investors consider India as an attractive market for debt. The existing limits of government and corporate debt for foreign investors  after all  has remained underutilized for the better part of the last 2 years. According to Jajoo  in a competitive world  a positive macro environment combined with a monetary policy that provides an incentive compared to other competing markets  for example Brazil or Mexico  is relevant.Still  the fact that Indian bonds are getting pulled up on the radar of an international index means that India follows a liberal regulatory regime and possesses enough liquidity in its bond markets.While the JPMorgan consultation is expected to be complete by next month with the announcement of an official proposal expected in October  according to FT  the other major index provider FTSE Russell had placed Indian government bonds on a watch list in 2021 for possible inclusion. Although  unlike JP Morgan  FTSE Russell declined to comment on India’s assessment status  these moves could force global investors to take greater interest in bonds  say experts.And expectations are already running high. If India is included in the indices  there can be two types of foreign investor flows: Index tracker passive inflows and active investors’ inflows  says Neeraj Gambhir  Group Executive –Treasury  Markets & Wholesale Banking Products at Axis Bank. While India's weight in the index will influence passive inflows  additional flows will depend on the involvement of active investors  who  according to him  may inject $30 to $40 billion annually if India is included in JPMorgan's bond index.Others are hoping India's resolve to craft consistent tax policies and well-defined entry and exit criteria over a period of time  should also help in increasing global index providers’ confidence in domestic markets.For instance  the inclusion (in JPMorgan's index)  even if it happens at a later part of the year  would be beneficial  says Teresa John  lead economist at Nirmal Bang. She adds that besides attracting funds at a time when FPI flows have languished lately  the move could also soften bond yields at the margin  which has been an RBI concern lately  despite the fact the weight assigned to India at the time of inclusion may not be high and the flows are likely to come in a trickle rather than a flood.(Indrajit Basu is an India-based business/technology journalist with over 25 years of experience in international and local publications.

This contract covers a period of 30 years from the commissioning of the facility  scheduled for 2026.The hydroelectric production of the Maripa-Soula power plant is estimated at 12.7 gigawatt hours per year  making it possible to supply nearly 11 000 local inhabitants. It will replace the current production  as expensive as it is carbon-intensive  relying on the annual importation of 6 million liters of diesel necessary for the electrical consumption of Maripa-Soula  which is transported by boat  then by truck and finally by canoe to this very isolated commune.The project implies an emission reduction of more than 18 000 tonnes of CO 2 each year.The impacts of this run-of-river hydroelectric plant will be offset by the implementation of particularly ambitious environmental measures. Indeed  more than €1.1 million will be invested in a programme to preserve the surrounding forest  the creation of a fish spawning area  and ecological monitoring (fauna  flora  sediments and water quality) upstream and downstream of the facility.""We are very happy to be able to complete this new project  result of a long process initiated by all our teams on site. The hydroelectric plant will meet the energy needs of the town of Maripa-Soula with a local and clean resource. The entire Maroni valley should benefit from the positive spin-offs of the upcoming project "" said Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia.Story continuesSerge Anelli  mayor of Maripa-Soula  adds: ""The implementation of this hydroelectric power station fully meets the objectives of ecological transition of the municipality: it will significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the municipality by offering the inhabitants of Maripa-Soula electricity produced from a local and renewable resource. Moreover  it will improve the quality of electricity supply to the population and create local jobs. This is a project that the town has been waiting for and that I have been advocating for several years. I am very happy to see it come to fruition.""Next on the agenda: First half 2022 results  on September 28  2022 (before market opening)About Voltalia (www.voltalia.com) Voltalia is an international player in the renewable energy sector.

The test  developed by SkylineDx together with the Mayo Clinic (US)  aims to predict a melanoma patient’s risk of nodal metastasis and may help safely forgo an invasive surgery  which is now often performed to determine metastatic spread of the cancer for staging purposes. In approximately 80% of surgeries  the biopsy comes back negative for metastasis  where it does not further impact the patient pathway. Merlin Assay provides a more personalized insight  identifying patients with a low-risk tumor that could avoid the surgery2. The Merlin Assay will be commercialized in Europe by Biocartis as a CE-IVD marked manual kit  ahead of the launch of an Idylla™ version of the test which is under development.Biocartis and SkylineDx  a Dutch (Rotterdam) and US (San Diego  California) based private biotechnology company  announced their partnership agreement on 22 April 2021. Under the terms of the partnership agreement  SkylineDx is leading the development of the Merlin Assay on Idylla™  while Biocartis is leading the commercialization in Europe through its growing Idylla™ network. As part of the commercialization in Europe  Biocartis will now also commercialize the CE-IVD marked manual kit  ahead of the Idylla™ version of the Merlin Assay. In the US  the test is already available as a Laboratory Developed Test serviced from SkylineDx’ CAP/CLIA laboratory. SkylineDx received Medicare reimbursement for the test in May 2022.Story continuesHerman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “We are very excited to start commercialization in Europe of SkylineDx’s CE-IVD marked manual kit of the Merlin Assay. This manual kit is based on a well-established qPCR method that can easily run in molecular diagnostic laboratories. Although it’s the first time we are commercializing a partner test ahead of an Idylla™ version of the test  this version of the Merlin Assay may offer our European customer base of large molecular diagnostic labs already a clear added value to help improve outcomes for melanoma patients. Once completed  the Idylla™ version of the Merlin Assay is expected to allow an even broader access for melanoma patients across Europe  with reduced time to results.”Dharminder Chahal  Chief Executive Officer of SkylineDx  replied: “Launching the Merlin Assay as a CE-IVD marked manual kit in Europe signifies a major milestone in making our diagnostic solutions available to patients globally. We are looking forward to enter this new phase of our partnership with Biocartis.”--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

It benefited from the integration of the €6.3m contribution from BTN de Haas (consolidated since July 2021). Organic revenue growth reached 7% on a like-for-like basis. The positive sales trend over the period was due to the price increases recorded by the Group to offset higher purchase prices as well as continued good sales momentum. Within this division  the Vital Concept nutrition activity grew by more than 15% in H1  contributing to the division's overall growth of 67%. Given the current period of drought  farmers are likely to supplement livestock feed in the coming months  thus boosting the outlook in the months ahead.The horse and landscape diversification markets enjoyed continued good sales trends  up by 17% and 22% respectively.The Farming Nutrition business (9% of H1 revenue)  marketed under the Alphatech brand  saw revenue increase by a sharp 14% to €5.5m.

These positive trends together with continued strong sales momentum offer good visibility on future performance  after a successful first half of the year and a good start to the third quarter.In terms of growth drivers  WINFARM should also benefit in the second half of the year from the acquisition of the Kabelis Group companies  which were included in the consolidation scope from 1 August 2022. After the integration of Kabelis  the Group's Landscape and Green Space business should generate full-year revenue of nearly €21 million. This transformative acquisition will create a major player on one of France's most promising markets  and a leader in Brittany  Normandy and Pays-de-Loire.The efforts already underway in the Farming Nutrition business are expected to continue during the second half of the year. The Group's ambition in this activity is to widen the gap in relation to the competition by enhancing product quality to meet the needs of an exacting customer base.Next publication: 2022 half-year results  6 October 2022 after the market closes.About WINFARMFounded in Loudéac  in the heart of Brittany  in the early 1990s  WINFARM is now the French leader in distance selling for the agricultural world.

Plans are under development to complete all current assay transfers in the course of 2023. The gradual product transfers to the fully automated ML2 line will further unlock economies of scale and reduce manufacturing costs.ISO 27001 certification – Post the reporting period  ISO 27001 certification achievement announced on 24 August 2022 for Biocartis for the design  development  maintenance  service provision and support of the Idylla™ platform and associated customer-facing software.Management team – Biocartis aligned its organizational structure to deliver on its strategic priorities and has appointed  effective as from 1 September 2022: Global Head of Partnering: Madhushree (Madhu) Ghosh  PhD  MS  will join Biocartis as Global Head of Partnering. Dr. Ghosh brings a wealth of experience to successful commercial and strategic team leadership in global strategic alliance management  P/L business unit leadership and IVD and CDx product development for in excess of 20 years spent in molecular diagnostics and clinical assay development with a focus on Next Generation Sequencing  real-time PCR  multiplex PCR  oncology and infectious disease diagnostics. Previously  Dr. Ghosh held senior roles at Thermo Fisher Scientific  NeoGenomics Laboratories Inc.  QIAGEN  and AltheaDx. Global Head of Sales: David Dejans  previously Head of Sales Europe and Distributor markets  will move into the role of Global Head of Sales.Financial highlightsTotal operating income – Total operating income amounted to EUR 26.8m compared to EUR 23.1m last year. Product revenues increased by 10% from EUR 18.5m in H1 2021 to EUR 20.3m in H1 2022. Within product sales  cartridge sales revenues increased by 11.6%. Excluding the revenue from the sale of Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 tests 9 that continue to trend downward  cartridge revenues increased 38%. Revenues from Idylla™ instrument sales amounted to EUR 3.8m (H1 2021: EUR 3.7m). The majority of the 102 net new instruments were placed under reagent rental agreements as opposed to H1 2021 during which immediately recognized capital sales accounted for most of the 189 net placements. Collaboration revenues  almost entirely from R&D services provided to partners  increased by EUR 2.6m to EUR 5.1m.Idylla™ cartridge average sales price (ASP) – During H1 2022  Idylla™ oncology cartridge ASP increased by 8% to EUR 113  resulting from a growing contribution of the Idylla™ GeneFusion Assay 10 (RUO) and from higher sales from the US where pricing is generally higher than in Europe and other parts of the world. The overall ASP in H1 2022 stood at EUR 103  up from EUR 95 in H1 2021 because of the increased ASP in oncology and a lower contribution of lower priced SARS-CoV-2 tests.Gross margin – Gross margin on products significantly increased  from 8% in H1 2021 to 32% in H1 2022. Last year  the gross margin was impacted by a higher cartridge COGS (Costs of Goods Sold) because production volumes were lower than expected as the pandemic caused a global shortage of reagent supplies. Moreover  the lower revenues from SARS-CoV-2 tests that have a significantly lower ASP than the other assays  also contributes to an improved gross margin. The total gross profit amounted to EUR 6.6m  or EUR 5.2m more than in H1 2021.OPEX – Total operating expenses (excluding cost of sales) of EUR 37.7m in H1 2022 decreased by EUR 1.4m from EUR 39.1m in H1 2021. EUR 4.1m lower spending in R&D was partly offset by the post-pandemic normalization of commercial activities  the impact of the 2021 restructuring of the US commercial operations and by global inflation.Net cash flow and cash position – The operating cash burn of EUR 19.2m (H1 2021: EUR 28.8m) was complemented by working capital investments of EUR 0.6m and a scheduled investment of EUR 1.0m to fund the operations of the Chinese joint venture WondfoCartis. Financial cash flows included EUR 3.1m interest payments and the repayment of EUR 8.6m borrowings  including EUR 6.0m drawn on working capital facilities at the end of 2021. The net cash outflow amounted to EUR 35.5m and resulted in a net cash position of EUR 19.7m. EUR 15m of credit facilities were undrawn and remain fully available awaiting the closing of the refinancing.KEY FIGURES H1 2022The tables below show an overview of the key figures and a breakdown of operating income for H1 2022 and H1 2021.

We are actively evaluating many promising potential product candidates. Our strategic objective is to pursue opportunities to repurpose and reformulate medicines that offer meaningful improvements for patients  physicians  and payors. With cash and cash equivalents of €57 687 million at 30 June 2022  Hyloris remains well-capitalized to advance all value-added assets and execute on this accretive business strategy to expand its portfolio to 30 product candidates and marketed products by 2024.“Story continuesMr Van Rompay continued  “During the first six months of 2022  via our commercial partners  we further enlarged our commercial footprint including the first launches in the European market for Maxigesic IV and pursued the roll-out of Sotalol IV for the US market.”MARKETED AND COMMERCIAL-STAGE PROGRAMSSotalol IV is a novel  patented  intravenous formulation of Sotalol for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias developed for the US.During the first six months of 2022  the partner expanded medical and sales teams in order to accelerate commercial roll-out  inclusion in hospital drug formularies and clinical education of hospital staff.Additional Value-Driving ProgramsMaxigesic® IV is a novel  unique combination  intravenous formulation for the treatment of post-operative pain and is currently licensed to partners covering over 100 countries across the globe.During the first six months of 2022  the geographical base where Maxigesic IV is approved has been broadened to 40 countries and additional marketing authorizations have been granted in Italy  Norway  Greece  Indonesia  Oman  Netherlands  Portugal  Finland  Bahrain  Kosovo  Singapore and Hong-Kong.Marketing authorisations are pending in several additional countries including Canada  Mexico and the US.Maxigesic® IV (for the US):In July  the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informed Hyloris’ development partner  AFT Pharmaceuticals  via a Complete Response Letter (CRL)  that it was unable to complete its review of the NDA for Maxigesic® IV and provided specific recommendations needed to address the application’s deficiency. Importantly  the agency did not report any issues related to data generated during Maxigesic® IV’s clinical development program  and the deficiency is confined solely to the Quality section of the application dossier and related to drug product packaging. Hyloris will generate additional data on extractables and leachables from the packaging components to respond to the FDA’s information request. Both parties remain committed to Maxigesic® IV and ensuring the product fulfils its commercial potential in the US. Additional studies as requested by FDA are under preparation and expected to begin in Q4 2022 and will take a few months to complete. Upon completion of these studies  the submission to FDA will be made.Other Developments Related to Maxigesic® IV:Additional patents were granted across multiple jurisdictions including Japan  Singapore  Canada  Mexico  China and the US  which range in exclusivity from 2035-2038.R&D UPDATECardiovascular ProgramsAspirin IV US is a first-in-class intravenous (IV) formulation of acetylsalicylic acid that could significantly improve treatment outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes  or ACS). Hyloris and its partner have completed the clinical phase of the study to assess the pharmacokinetics of this product candidate. Hyloris has contracted with a manufacturing organization to produce registration batches in preparation for an NDA submission to the FDA.Milrinone is a novel  patented  extended-release capsule that has been developed for twice-a-day  convenient oral dosing for end-stage heart failure (HF) patients with an implanted left ventricular assist device (LVAD) who have developed right HF. The extended-release formulation of milrinone in an oral form would provide a steady and predictable exposure of milrinone as well as allow for longer term use in a capsule form. The Company reported it held a successful Type C meeting with the FDA  confirming development plans for an extended-release milrinone capsule in this patient population with a high unmet need.Additional Value-Driving R&D ProgramsTranexamic Acid Oral Mouth Rinse program (HY-004): The program is being developed for patients on anti-coagulant therapies undergoing dental procedures that have a risk of bleeding complication  is progressing to a Phase 3 clinical trial after positive data reported from healthy subjects undergoing tooth extraction.AlenuraTM: Hyloris’ partner has written and soon will submit to FDA several protocols for the next clinical trials as part of the development of AlenuraTM  a first-line drug treatment for acute pain in interstitial cystitis /bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). The first of these clinical trials should start later this year.Miconazole/DB: Hyloris is co-developing a topical synergistic combination treatment for Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (rVVC)  a condition that affects nearly 10 % of women during their lifetime. MCZ/DB has a strong scientific and business rationale. A Phase 2 clinical trial is ongoing and recruitment should be completed by the end of the year.Other programs: These added-value programs are on track as planned as stated six months ago. Several discussions are being held with regulatory agencies to confirm and validate development plans.FINANCE AND OPERATIONAL UPDATESuccessfully raised a total of €17.8 million in gross proceeds  from new and existing  local and international investors  through (1) an equity offering by means of a private placement via an accelerated bookbuild and (2) execution of transaction warrants.

The increase was mainly driven by costs related to outsourced and internal product development activities  driven by ongoing pipeline expansion and further development of current product candidates.Cash PositionThe Group maintains its strong cash position  with a current cash and cash equivalents totalled €57 687 thousand on 30 June 2022  compared to €53 465 thousand on 30 June 2021.A net increase of €7 675 thousand in cash and cash equivalents was recorded for the six-month period ending 30 June 2022  compared to a net decrease of €10 934 thousand during the first half-year of 2021. The net increase was mainly driven by net proceeds from a capital transaction of €17 169 thousand off set by (1) net cash out generated from operating activities of €6 401 thousand and (2) cash out due to partial reimbursement of shareholders’ loans and payment of interests of €2 324 thousand. This is compared to a net cash outflow for the same period in 2021 of €10 934 thousand  driven by the net operational cash burn of €9 282 thousand  impacted by one-time other expenses  and committed milestone investments in joint ventures (net cash used in investing activities).Business OutlookPipeline expansion : The Company re-stated that its goal remains to add four new reformulated or repurposed product candidates by the end of 2022 in line with its goal to build a portfolio of 30 products and product candidates by 2024.Commercial products:i) Maxigesic IV  ex-US: continue roll-out in Europe and Rest of the Worldii) Maxigesic IV for the US: Submit requested additional information to the US FDA in support of the new drug application (NDA)iii) Sotalol IV: accelerate roll-out in the USWith cash and cash equivalents of €57.7 million at 30 June 2022  the Company believes that it is well-capitalised to advance all current pipeline assets as planned and execute its current business plan with the expectation to expand the portfolio to 30 product candidates - and marketed products by 2024.UPCOMING PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL CALENDAR FOR 202316 March 2023 Full Year 2022 Financial Results and Business UpdateAbout Hyloris PharmaceuticalsHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

Magnolo#P1535Notes to editors:About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.1In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy2  3 In January 2022  bimekizumab received marketing authorization in Japan for the treatment of plaque psoriasis  generalized pustular psoriasis and psoriatic erythroderma in patients who are not sufficiently responding to existing treatments.4 In February and March 2022  bimekizumab was approved in Canada and Australia  respectively  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.5 6Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S. and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).About CIMZIA® in the U.S.CIMZIA® is the only Fc-free  PEGylated anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor). CIMZIA has a high affinity for human TNF-alpha  selectively neutralizing the pathophysiological effects of TNF-alpha.CIMZIA is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PSO) in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.CIMZIA is also indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA)  adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS)  and adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation.In addition  CIMZIA is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease (CD) and maintaining clinical response in adult patients with moderately to severely active disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. See important safety information including risk of serious bacterial  viral and fungal infections and tuberculosis below.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION about CIMZIA in the U.S.CONTRAINDICATIONSCIMZIA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to certolizumab pegol or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema  anaphylaxis  serum sickness  and urticaria.SERIOUS INFECTIONSPatients treated with CIMZIA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.Discontinue CIMZIA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.Reported infections include:Active tuberculosis (TB)  including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before CIMZIA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to CIMZIA use.Invasive fungal infections  including histoplasmosis  coccidioidomycosis  candidiasis  aspergillosis  blastomycosis  and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated  rather than localized  disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.Bacterial  viral  and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens  including Legionella and Listeria.Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with CIMZIA prior to initiating therapy in the following patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to TB; with a history of opportunistic infection; who resided in or traveled in regions where mycoses are endemic; with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIMZIA  including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.Do not start CIMZIA during an active infection  including localized infections.Patients older than 65 years  patients with co-morbid conditions  and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants may be at greater risk of infection.If an infection develops  monitor carefully and initiate appropriate therapy.MALIGNANCYLymphoma and other malignancies  some fatal  have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers  of which CIMZIA is a member. CIMZIA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.Consider the risks and benefits of CIMZIA treatment prior to initiating or continuing therapy in a patient with known malignancy.In clinical trials  more cases of malignancies were observed among CIMZIA-treated patients compared to control patients.In CIMZIA clinical trials  there was an approximately 2-fold higher rate of lymphoma than expected in the general U.S. population. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis  particularly those with highly active disease  are at a higher risk of lymphoma than the general population.Malignancies  some fatal  have been reported among children  adolescents  and young adults being treated with TNF blockers. Approximately half of the cases were lymphoma  while the rest were other types of malignancies  including rare types associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not usually seen in this patient population.Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL)  a rare type of T-cell lymphoma  have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers  including CIMZIA. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis  and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. Carefully assess the risks and benefits of treating with CIMZIA in these patient types.Cases of acute and chronic leukemia were reported with TNF blocker use.HEART FAILUREWorsening and new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported with TNF blockers. Exercise caution and monitor carefully.HYPERSENSITIVITYAngioedema  anaphylaxis  dyspnea  hypotension  rash  serum sickness  and urticaria have been reported following CIMZIA administration. If a serious allergic reaction occurs  stop CIMZIA and institute appropriate therapy. The needle shield inside the removable cap of the CIMZIA prefilled syringe contains a plastic derivative of natural rubber latex which may cause an allergic reaction in individuals sensitive to latex.HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATIONUse of TNF blockers  including CIMZIA  may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases have been fatal.Test patients for HBV infection before initiating treatment with CIMZIA.Exercise caution in patients who are carriers of HBV and monitor them before and during CIMZIA treatment.Discontinue CIMZIA and begin antiviral therapy in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Exercise caution when resuming CIMZIA after HBV treatment.NEUROLOGIC REACTIONSTNF blockers  including CIMZIA  have been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system and peripheral demyelinating diseases  including multiple sclerosis  seizure disorder  optic neuritis  peripheral neuropathy  and Guillain-Barré syndrome.HEMATOLOGIC REACTIONSRare reports of pancytopenia  including aplastic anemia  have been reported with TNF blockers. Medically significant cytopenia has been infrequently reported with CIMZIA.Consider stopping CIMZIA if significant hematologic abnormalities occur.DRUG INTERACTIONSDo not use CIMZIA in combination with other biological DMARDS.AUTOIMMUNITYTreatment with CIMZIA may result in the formation of autoantibodies and  rarely  in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop.IMMUNIZATIONSPatients on CIMZIA should not receive live or live-attenuated vaccines.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions in CIMZIA clinical trials (≥8%) were: upper respiratory infections (18%)  rash (9%)  and urinary tract infections (8%).For full prescribing information  please visithttps://www.ucb.com/_up/ucb_com_products/documents/Cimzia_09_11_2019_en.pdfCIMZIA® is a registered trademark of the UCB Group of Companies.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14Email: antje.witte@ucb.comU.S. Immunology CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.404.226.7591Email: nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB.

(“CoolCo” or “the Company”) interim results for the first half of 2022 (""1H 2022"") include consolidated successor period and combined predecessor period results which on an aggregate basis represent the first half results  and should not be interpreted as individual quarterly results.Highlights and subsequent eventsCoolCo generated aggregate operating income of $53.4 million and net income of $40.9 million for 1H  of which $27.7 million and $23.2 million respectively relates to predecessor period operations.Achieved average Daily Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"") 1 of $59 100 per day during 1H  comfortably exceeding the all-in cash breakeven for the fleet of around $50 000 per day.Cash and cash equivalents of $77.3 million and Contractual Debt 1 of $787.0 million as of June 30  2022.Generated Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $67.0 million for 1H.Raised $275 million in an upsized private placement on January 27  2022 and listed on the Euronext Growth Oslo market on February 22  2022.Appointed dedicated management team in March 2022.Acquisition of all eight Tri-Fuel Diesel Electric (""TFDE"") vessels together with The Cool Pool Limited completed by early April 2022.Fixed a LNG carrier on a 12-month charter at $120k per day commencing April 2022.Acquired management organization responsible for the technical and commercial management of LNG carriers and the provision of such services to third parties on June 30  2022  concluding the formation of CoolCo.During August 2022  we fixed another 12-month charter agreement at around $140 000 per day commencing early September 2022.Financial Results OverviewThe formation and funding of CoolCo and its acquisition of the eight TFDE LNG carriers  The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"") was completed in a phased process. It commenced with the funding of CoolCo on January 27  2022 and concluded with the acquisition of the LNG carrier and FSRU management organization on June 30  2022. Results for the six months commencing January 1  2022 and ending June 30  2022 have therefore been split between the period prior to the funding of CoolCo and various staggered acquisitions (the ""Predecessor"" period) and subsequent to the various staggered acquisitions of such vessels and management entities (together the ""Successor"" period).Story continuesThe commentary below is based on financial information for the aggregate of the Predecessor and Successor reporting periods  otherwise reflected as 1H 2022. CoolCo reports operating income of $53.4 million  net income of $40.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $67.0 million for 1H 2022.Financial SummaryThe table below sets forth certain key financial information for 1H 2022  split between Successor and Predecessor periods.(in thousands of $  except TCE) Successor Predecessor 1H 2022 Total operating revenues 56 892 43 851 100 743 Operating income 25 631 27 728 53 359 Net income 17 659 23 244 40 903 Adjusted EBITDA1 33 527 33 473 67 000 Average daily TCE1 (to the closest $100) 60 500 57 100 59 1001H 2022 Time and voyage charter revenues net of Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses amounted to $85.5 million  of which $49.5 million and $36.1 million related to Successor and Predecessor period operations  respectively  resulting in a 1H 2022 average daily TCE1 of $59 100 per day with utilization for the period at 98%.CoolCo recognized vessel and other management fee revenue of $6.6 million for the Predecessor period in respect of management services provided to 21 third-party owned LNG Carriers and FSRUs .1H 2022 vessel operating expenses were $21.4 million  of which Predecessor period operations incurred $8.1 million net of $2.3 million insurance claim proceeds specific to a Hull and Machinery claim related to Ice  resulting in lower than average daily operating cost for our TFDE vessels of approximately $15 000 per day.Administrative expenses for 1H 2022 totaled $8.1 million consisting of a combination of third-party vessel management expenses and corporate overheads.CoolCo's depreciation policy for the eight TFDE vessels  based on management's current best estimates  is to adopt a useful life expectancy of 30 years which is lower than that adopted during the Predecessor period and by most publicly listed industry peers. As a result  depreciation amounts in Successor and Predecessor periods are not comparable.Interest expense of $11.4 million includes $6.7m for the Successor period related to interest on the sustainable-linked six-vessel $570 million bank financing facility and variable interest entities (""VIEs"") debt from the sale and leaseback facilities  together with amortization of debt related transactions costs and guarantee fees.Other financial items of $0.7 million for 1H 2022 includes commitment fees and other financial charges.Net income attributable to non-controlling interests of $0.8 million during the successor period relates to our two consolidated lessor VIEs entities (Ice and Kelvin).Our cash and cash equivalents balances were $77.3 million as of June 30  2022  excluding restricted cash for VIEs related to sale and leaseback facilities in respect of Ice and Kelvin.Operational ReviewCoolCo's fleet of eight TFDE vessels have performed well with no technical off-hire recorded. 1H 2022 fleet utilization was 98%.In February 2022  Frost commenced her previously announced 5-year charter. In April 2022  a 12-month charter commenced at a rate of around $120k per day  20% higher than the prior charter agreed within the last 12 months for our fleet (in October 2021) and twice the rate the vessel earned on its prior 12-month charter. In June 2022  one of our vessels entered the spot market where she continued to trade over the summer months. The vessel subsequently secured a highly attractive 12-month charter rate at around $140 000 per day commencing early September 2022. Another vessel will conclude her 12-month charter in October 2022  positioning her well to secure attractive new business ahead of the winter months. No dry docks are scheduled for 2022 with the next vessel (Seal) is scheduled to dock no later than September 2023.Financing and LiquidityAs of June 30  2022  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $77.3 million and total short and long-term debt of $688.9 million. The outstanding Contractual Debt1 in respect of the six vessel bank financing facility (the ""$570 million bank facility"")  maturing in March 2027  amounted to $560.1 million and in respect of the two sale and leaseback facilities (Ice and Kelvin)  maturing in January 2025  amounted to $226.9 million. Total CoolCo Contractual Debt1 stood at $787.0 million.Revenue backlog1 from shipping fixtures to date amounts to $351 million as at June 30  2022 with around 86% based on fixed and floating rate charters and 14% in optional backlog.Corporate and Other MattersAs at June 30  2022  CoolCo had 40 010 000 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  16 000 817 were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd.  12 510 000 were owned by Golar LNG Limited and 11 499 183 were publicly owned.LNG Market ReviewThe year commenced with the Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") at $30.50/MMBtu  the Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $23.47/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $91 000 per day. By mid-January TTF exceeded JKM with the TTF premium to JKM attributable to Russian restrictions on spot purchased gas flows to Europe. Ships lifting destination flexible US and African cargoes originally bound for Asia were re-routed to Europe in response  reducing journey times for those cargos by around two thirds  freeing up vessels and putting downward pressure on spot shipping rates. By mid-February the market had softened to the point that some sub-lessors were electing to keep their vessels open rather than charter them out with negative round-trip economics.The outbreak of war on February 24  2022 further worsened LNG price differentials with TTF briefly exceeding $70/MMBtu whilst JKM traded at around $50/MMBtu  pulling more vessels into Europe and adding further downward pressure to ton miles. Securing LNG  regasification capacity  and vessels to deliver that LNG quickly became the priority of European end users under pressure to reduce their dependence on Russian piped gas. Prompt and time charter vessel availability began to diminish and rates improved as a bullish sentiment returned to the market. CoolCo took this opportunity to fix Seal on a 12-month charter at $120 000 per day  up from quoted rates in the sub-$80k per day region for similar business a few weeks earlier. In addition to charterers no longer willing to risk security of supply  two other factors emerged in support of improved shipping rates. As more US cargoes headed for Europe  congestion at the fully utilized European receiving terminals began to increase. Although ton miles had fallen  ton-time was increasing. Secondly  higher gas prices further bifurcated the market between newer more efficient vessels and older less efficient steam vessels that use/lose more LNG. The hire rate differential attributable to these efficiencies nearly doubled  benefiting TFDE vessels which were amongst the more efficient vessels available at the time.Over subsequent months  declining vessel availability continued to push rates higher in a counter-seasonal rally with TFDE spot rates reaching $100k per day in early June  whilst 12-month rates held steady at around $120k per day. An explosion at Freeport LNG in the US on June 8  2022 and the consequent temporary loss of 15 million tons of LNG capacity released the vessels serving this facility into the short-term market. TFDE spot rates dropped by close to 30% the following week. Incremental volumes from the start up and ramp up of operations at Calcasieu Pass and Coral FLNG in Mozambique will not come close to replacing the volumes lost from Freeport. Spot rates continued to fall as a result  with TFDE rates dropping to $50k per day by June 30. The fall in 12-month rates was more muted and rates remained well above $100k per day  indicating unchanged market expectations of tight shipping supply over the winter when Freeport is expected to begin ramping up again.OutlookWith very little tonnage on offer by independent owners  no uncommitted vessels scheduled for delivery for the rest of the year and charterers prioritizing shipping coverage  we expect that the market will quickly tighten when Freeport returns to service and relets are pulled back ahead of winter. We are seeing early signs of this today with TFDE spot rates recovering to around $70k per day and 12-month TFDE rates approaching twice the spot rate. Into 2023  around 38 vessels are scheduled to deliver  only three of which are uncommitted. A new environmental regulatory regime which will impede the operations of older  less efficient steam vessels that collectively make up over 30% of the global LNG fleet will also come into force. This will most likely cut the speed of these steam ships  especially in periods of high demand such as winters  effectively adding ton miles.At almost 40% of the on the water fleet  the order book looks sizeable however it remains insufficient to replace aging steam vessels and ship the next wave of volumes scheduled to start delivery in late 2024. Newbuild prices are now reaching $250 million and it is increasingly difficult to secure a 2026 delivery slot. Cost uncertainties mean that shipyards are reluctant to take orders for vessels that would deliver after 2026. Meanwhile  record high LNG prices set the scene for the most bullish environment for new LNG projects in a decade. Europe’s urgent need to pivot away from unreliable Russian piped gas and its decision to include gas in the EU Taxonomy of green fuels is giving energy companies and utilities the confidence to enter into long term offtake agreements that will underpin these projects. These projects will generate a steady stream of new LNG volumes to be shipped over the decades ahead and CoolCo expects its vessels to be well positioned to connect this cleaner  more secure energy with demand.1 Refer to 'Appendix A' - Non-GAAP financial measures and definitions'.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements which reflect management’s current expectations  estimates and projections about its operations.

Magnolo#P1535Notes to editors:About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.1In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy2  3 In January 2022  bimekizumab received marketing authorization in Japan for the treatment of plaque psoriasis  generalized pustular psoriasis and psoriatic erythroderma in patients who are not sufficiently responding to existing treatments.4 In February and March 2022  bimekizumab was approved in Canada and Australia  respectively  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.5 6Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S. and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).About CIMZIA® in the U.S.CIMZIA® is the only Fc-free  PEGylated anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor). CIMZIA has a high affinity for human TNF-alpha  selectively neutralizing the pathophysiological effects of TNF-alpha.CIMZIA is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PSO) in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.CIMZIA is also indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA)  adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS)  and adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation.In addition  CIMZIA is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease (CD) and maintaining clinical response in adult patients with moderately to severely active disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. See important safety information including risk of serious bacterial  viral and fungal infections and tuberculosis below.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION about CIMZIA in the U.S.CONTRAINDICATIONSCIMZIA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to certolizumab pegol or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema  anaphylaxis  serum sickness  and urticaria.SERIOUS INFECTIONSPatients treated with CIMZIA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.Discontinue CIMZIA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.Reported infections include:Active tuberculosis (TB)  including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before CIMZIA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to CIMZIA use.Invasive fungal infections  including histoplasmosis  coccidioidomycosis  candidiasis  aspergillosis  blastomycosis  and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated  rather than localized  disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.Bacterial  viral  and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens  including Legionella and Listeria.Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with CIMZIA prior to initiating therapy in the following patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to TB; with a history of opportunistic infection; who resided in or traveled in regions where mycoses are endemic; with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIMZIA  including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.Do not start CIMZIA during an active infection  including localized infections.Patients older than 65 years  patients with co-morbid conditions  and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants may be at greater risk of infection.If an infection develops  monitor carefully and initiate appropriate therapy.MALIGNANCYLymphoma and other malignancies  some fatal  have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers  of which CIMZIA is a member. CIMZIA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.Consider the risks and benefits of CIMZIA treatment prior to initiating or continuing therapy in a patient with known malignancy.In clinical trials  more cases of malignancies were observed among CIMZIA-treated patients compared to control patients.In CIMZIA clinical trials  there was an approximately 2-fold higher rate of lymphoma than expected in the general U.S. population. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis  particularly those with highly active disease  are at a higher risk of lymphoma than the general population.Malignancies  some fatal  have been reported among children  adolescents  and young adults being treated with TNF blockers. Approximately half of the cases were lymphoma  while the rest were other types of malignancies  including rare types associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not usually seen in this patient population.Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL)  a rare type of T-cell lymphoma  have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers  including CIMZIA. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis  and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. Carefully assess the risks and benefits of treating with CIMZIA in these patient types.Cases of acute and chronic leukemia were reported with TNF blocker use.HEART FAILUREWorsening and new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported with TNF blockers. Exercise caution and monitor carefully.HYPERSENSITIVITYAngioedema  anaphylaxis  dyspnea  hypotension  rash  serum sickness  and urticaria have been reported following CIMZIA administration. If a serious allergic reaction occurs  stop CIMZIA and institute appropriate therapy. The needle shield inside the removable cap of the CIMZIA prefilled syringe contains a plastic derivative of natural rubber latex which may cause an allergic reaction in individuals sensitive to latex.HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATIONUse of TNF blockers  including CIMZIA  may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases have been fatal.Test patients for HBV infection before initiating treatment with CIMZIA.Exercise caution in patients who are carriers of HBV and monitor them before and during CIMZIA treatment.Discontinue CIMZIA and begin antiviral therapy in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Exercise caution when resuming CIMZIA after HBV treatment.NEUROLOGIC REACTIONSTNF blockers  including CIMZIA  have been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system and peripheral demyelinating diseases  including multiple sclerosis  seizure disorder  optic neuritis  peripheral neuropathy  and Guillain-Barré syndrome.HEMATOLOGIC REACTIONSRare reports of pancytopenia  including aplastic anemia  have been reported with TNF blockers. Medically significant cytopenia has been infrequently reported with CIMZIA.Consider stopping CIMZIA if significant hematologic abnormalities occur.DRUG INTERACTIONSDo not use CIMZIA in combination with other biological DMARDS.AUTOIMMUNITYTreatment with CIMZIA may result in the formation of autoantibodies and  rarely  in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop.IMMUNIZATIONSPatients on CIMZIA should not receive live or live-attenuated vaccines.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions in CIMZIA clinical trials (≥8%) were: upper respiratory infections (18%)  rash (9%)  and urinary tract infections (8%).For full prescribing information  please visithttps://www.ucb.com/_up/ucb_com_products/documents/Cimzia_09_11_2019_en.pdfCIMZIA® is a registered trademark of the UCB Group of Companies.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14Email: [email protected]U.S. Immunology CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.404.226.7591Email: [email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

PARIS  Sept 1 (Reuters) - Euronext wheat edged lower on Thursday as economic jitters fuelled a slide in Chicago grains and wider financial markets ,"Updates with closing price  SwedenPARIS  Sept 1 (Reuters) - Euronext wheat edged lower on Thursday as economic jitters fuelled a slide in Chicago grains and wider financial markets  outweighing support from a weaker euro.Signs of increased competition from Russian and Ukrainian grain  following months of war disruption to Black Sea trade  were also curbing wheat prices  traders said.December milling wheat BL2Z2 on the Paris-based Euronext exchange closed 0.9% lower at 321.50 euros ($319.99) a tonne.The contract had risen to a four-week high on Tuesday  buoyed by concerns about U.S. and European corn crops  before retreating as investors fretted about interest rate rises to curb inflation and the risk of a resulting recession. GRA/EUChicago wheat Wv1 was down about 2.5% as a new 20-year high for the dollar weighed on U.S. commodities.

The lighting upgrade is part of the Fraser Group’s ‘elevation strategy’ to develop a unique model within the UK fitness industry and offer an unparalleled class and gym experience for Everlast members and visitors which is both inclusive and immersive.,"Guildford  UK– Signify (Euronext: LIGHT)  the world leader in lighting  has been appointed by Frasers Group to design and supply the lighting for all 69 Everlast Gyms across the UK. The lighting upgrade is part of the Fraser Group’s ‘elevation strategy’ to develop a unique model within the UK fitness industry and offer an unparalleled class and gym experience for Everlast members and visitors which is both inclusive and immersive.In addition  designing the gyms with LED lighting dramatically cuts the energy consumption by about 80%  when compared to the traditional technologies that were deployed earlier. Added controls will help manage and reduce energy consumption by creating and managing uniform light schedules for all 69 gyms from a single dashboard  reducing operational costs  ensuring compliance  and efficiently planning maintenance.Professional LED lighting enhances experienceEverlast gyms at Denton  Shirebrook and Preston have already been upgraded and offer members a variety of different environments – or ‘innovative zones’ – to train in  creating unique gym experiences. Contemporary luminaries from the Modular range distribute a soft yet functional light that is designed for hospitality venues  public  retail and other large spaces. These lights use minimalist design principles that add to the visual appeal of the space. To compliment this  the Keyline range  from the Philips portfolio  creates chevrons  lines and squares in the ceiling  directing members to the different zones and identifying the individual areas.Connected lighting control system for flexibility and intelligent operationAs part of the redesign  the Interact connected lighting system  which includes multisite management capability  provides centralised lighting control for all the gyms. Agreed scenes and schedules ensure a consistent look and feel  as well as providing increased visibility  flexibility  and control of the lights. The cloud-based platform collects data from all light points via a connected lighting infrastructure and is displayed on a centralised dashboard. This enables better comparison  monitoring and management of lighting across multiple locations for improved efficiency.Designed for the circular economyThe gyms also feature tailor-made pendant and projector lights which are 3D printed luminaires designed and developed to suit the exact needs of each individual location. These fixtures are made of 100% recyclable polycarbonate material  which is also lightweight and therefore cheaper to transport. The luminaires are serviceable and offer the ability to prolong the technical and economic lifetime of the product after it has been put into service.""The first of our elevated sites in Denton  Preston and Shirebrook reflect our ambitions for Everlast Gyms and perfectly demonstrate the gym experience we aim to bring to all of our members throughout the UK ” commented Daniel Summerson  Managing Director of Everlast Gyms  Frasers Group. “We needed to make sure that the lighting added to the look and feel of the club  while also keeping the facility environmentally friendly. It has been great to switch on these solutions and I am looking forward to working with Signify on the roll-out across the UK  with Nottingham to be the next gym to have the upgraded experience for members.""Daniel Maskell  National Sales Manager  Signify UK&I  added: ""The design of the gyms  combined with the ‘innovative zones’  makes this a very exciting project for us at Signify as it ensures that lighting plays a key role in the entire experience. The LED solutions and the connected lighting system that we have installed make Everlast gyms the venue of choice for many. A positive impact on the environment is another huge benefit for the gyms: the upgrade to LED lighting reduces energy consumption  while the implementation of 3D printed technology further reduces Everlast gyms’ carbon footprint. The gyms really make a statement to the fitness industry  and we are looking forward to working with Everlast on the rest of their gyms across the UK.""",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,positive,0.87,0.11,0.02,True,English,"['lighting solutions', 'Everlast gym', 'Signify', 'UK', 'soft yet functional light', 'Everlast gyms’ carbon footprint', 'Connected lighting control system', 'other large spaces', '100% recyclable polycarbonate material', 'National Sales Manager', '3D printed technology', 'connected lighting infrastructure', 'connected lighting system', 'minimalist design principles', 'multisite management capability', '3D printed luminaires', 'unique gym experiences', 'uniform light schedules', 'Professional LED lighting', 'centralised lighting control', 'UK fitness industry', 'Signify UK&I', 'unique model', 'light points', 'centralised dashboard', 'next gym', 'world leader', 'Frasers Group', 'Fraser Group', 'elevation strategy', 'unparalleled class', 'energy consumption', 'traditional technologies', 'single dashboard', 'operational costs', 'different environments', 'innovative zones', 'Contemporary luminaries', 'Modular range', 'hospitality venues', 'visual appeal', 'Keyline range', 'Philips portfolio', 'different zones', 'individual areas', 'intelligent operation', 'Agreed scenes', 'cloud-based platform', 'multiple locations', 'circular economy', 'tailor-made pendant', 'exact needs', 'individual location', 'economic lifetime', 'elevated sites', 'Daniel Summerson', 'Managing Director', 'Daniel Maskell', 'key role', 'positive impact', 'huge benefit', 'LED solutions', '69 Everlast Gyms', 'entire experience', 'lighting upgrade', 'consistent look', 'projector lights', 'Everlast members', '69 gyms', 'Guildford', 'Euronext', 'part', 'visitors', 'addition', 'controls', 'compliance', 'maintenance', 'Denton', 'Shirebrook', 'Preston', 'variety', 'public', 'retail', 'chevrons', 'lines', 'squares', 'ceiling', 'flexibility', 'redesign', 'Interact', 'feel', 'increased', 'visibility', 'data', 'comparison', 'monitoring', 'efficiency', 'fixtures', 'technical', 'product', 'service', 'ambitions', 'club', 'facility', 'roll-out', 'Nottingham', 'upgraded', 'choice', 'implementation', 'statement']",2022-09-01,2022-09-01,voltimum.co.uk
