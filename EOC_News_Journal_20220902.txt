The test  developed by SkylineDx together with the Mayo Clinic (US)  aims to predict a melanoma patient’s risk of nodal metastasis and may help safely forgo an invasive surgery  which is now often performed to determine metastatic spread of the cancer for staging purposes. In approximately 80% of surgeries  the biopsy comes back negative for metastasis  where it does not further impact the patient pathway. Merlin Assay provides a more personalized insight  identifying patients with a low-risk tumor that could avoid the surgery2. The Merlin Assay will be commercialized in Europe by Biocartis as a CE-IVD marked manual kit  ahead of the launch of an Idylla™ version of the test which is under development.Biocartis and SkylineDx  a Dutch (Rotterdam) and US (San Diego  California) based private biotechnology company  announced their partnership agreement on 22 April 2021. Under the terms of the partnership agreement  SkylineDx is leading the development of the Merlin Assay on Idylla™  while Biocartis is leading the commercialization in Europe through its growing Idylla™ network. As part of the commercialization in Europe  Biocartis will now also commercialize the CE-IVD marked manual kit  ahead of the Idylla™ version of the Merlin Assay. In the US  the test is already available as a Laboratory Developed Test serviced from SkylineDx’ CAP/CLIA laboratory. SkylineDx received Medicare reimbursement for the test in May 2022.Story continuesHerman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “We are very excited to start commercialization in Europe of SkylineDx’s CE-IVD marked manual kit of the Merlin Assay. This manual kit is based on a well-established qPCR method that can easily run in molecular diagnostic laboratories. Although it’s the first time we are commercializing a partner test ahead of an Idylla™ version of the test  this version of the Merlin Assay may offer our European customer base of large molecular diagnostic labs already a clear added value to help improve outcomes for melanoma patients. Once completed  the Idylla™ version of the Merlin Assay is expected to allow an even broader access for melanoma patients across Europe  with reduced time to results.”Dharminder Chahal  Chief Executive Officer of SkylineDx  replied: “Launching the Merlin Assay as a CE-IVD marked manual kit in Europe signifies a major milestone in making our diagnostic solutions available to patients globally. We are looking forward to enter this new phase of our partnership with Biocartis.”--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

It benefited from the integration of the €6.3m contribution from BTN de Haas (consolidated since July 2021). Organic revenue growth reached 7% on a like-for-like basis. The positive sales trend over the period was due to the price increases recorded by the Group to offset higher purchase prices as well as continued good sales momentum. Within this division  the Vital Concept nutrition activity grew by more than 15% in H1  contributing to the division's overall growth of 67%. Given the current period of drought  farmers are likely to supplement livestock feed in the coming months  thus boosting the outlook in the months ahead.The horse and landscape diversification markets enjoyed continued good sales trends  up by 17% and 22% respectively.The Farming Nutrition business (9% of H1 revenue)  marketed under the Alphatech brand  saw revenue increase by a sharp 14% to €5.5m. The roll-out of a dynamic sales plan underpinned by an increase in commercial resources and teams began to show results  with a significant increase in sales in the Middle East in particular  a priority area of development for the Group.Story continuesEXCELLENT VISIBILITY FOR 2022Despite pressure on raw material costs at the start of the year  which affected the entire agricultural sector  the Group showed a capacity to smoothly pass on the purchase price increases recorded during the period while retaining its customer portfolio. These positive trends together with continued strong sales momentum offer good visibility on future performance  after a successful first half of the year and a good start to the third quarter.In terms of growth drivers  WINFARM should also benefit in the second half of the year from the acquisition of the Kabelis Group companies  which were included in the consolidation scope from 1 August 2022. After the integration of Kabelis  the Group's Landscape and Green Space business should generate full-year revenue of nearly €21 million. This transformative acquisition will create a major player on one of France's most promising markets  and a leader in Brittany  Normandy and Pays-de-Loire.The efforts already underway in the Farming Nutrition business are expected to continue during the second half of the year. The Group's ambition in this activity is to widen the gap in relation to the competition by enhancing product quality to meet the needs of an exacting customer base.Next publication: 2022 half-year results  6 October 2022 after the market closes.About WINFARMFounded in Loudéac  in the heart of Brittany  in the early 1990s  WINFARM is now the French leader in distance selling for the agricultural world.

Cartridge revenue in our core oncology business grew by 35% year-on-year  and the gross margin on products increased to 32%. Despite the expected decrease of Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 product sales  we almost quadrupled gross profit to EUR 6.6m during the first half of the year  fueled by increased average selling prices of cartridges in oncology and economies of scale in our cartridge manufacturing. We are on track to deliver on our objectives for the entire year  and also made important progress in securing future growth. We are particularly proud of the extended partnership with AstraZeneca for the development of a companion diagnostic for its blockbuster Tagrisso®. Furthermore  we were very pleased to announce that we entered into several financing arrangements with the support of certain holders of our convertible bonds. These will  upon successful completion  strengthen our cash position with approximately EUR 66m and fundamentally improve our financing structure.""Story continuesKEY MESSAGES H1 2022Product revenue of EUR 20.3m (H1 2021: EUR 18.5m)  of which EUR 16.5m from 153k cartridges sold and EUR 3.8m from instrument rentals and sales: EUR 14.4m cartridge revenue in oncology (+35% year-on-year)  double-digit growth across all regions  led by the US  both in cartridge volumes as in Average Selling price (ASP) The contribution of COVID-19 testing to cartridge revenues decreased to EUR 1.7m as both volumes and pricing continued to reduce.

The gradual product transfers to the fully automated ML2 line will further unlock economies of scale and reduce manufacturing costs.ISO 27001 certification – Post the reporting period  ISO 27001 certification achievement announced on 24 August 2022 for Biocartis for the design  development  maintenance  service provision and support of the Idylla™ platform and associated customer-facing software.Management team – Biocartis aligned its organizational structure to deliver on its strategic priorities and has appointed  effective as from 1 September 2022: Global Head of Partnering: Madhushree (Madhu) Ghosh  PhD  MS  will join Biocartis as Global Head of Partnering. Dr. Ghosh brings a wealth of experience to successful commercial and strategic team leadership in global strategic alliance management  P/L business unit leadership and IVD and CDx product development for in excess of 20 years spent in molecular diagnostics and clinical assay development with a focus on Next Generation Sequencing  real-time PCR  multiplex PCR  oncology and infectious disease diagnostics. Previously  Dr. Ghosh held senior roles at Thermo Fisher Scientific  NeoGenomics Laboratories Inc.  QIAGEN  and AltheaDx. Global Head of Sales: David Dejans  previously Head of Sales Europe and Distributor markets  will move into the role of Global Head of Sales.Financial highlightsTotal operating income – Total operating income amounted to EUR 26.8m compared to EUR 23.1m last year. Product revenues increased by 10% from EUR 18.5m in H1 2021 to EUR 20.3m in H1 2022. Within product sales  cartridge sales revenues increased by 11.6%. Excluding the revenue from the sale of Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 tests 9 that continue to trend downward  cartridge revenues increased 38%. Revenues from Idylla™ instrument sales amounted to EUR 3.8m (H1 2021: EUR 3.7m). The majority of the 102 net new instruments were placed under reagent rental agreements as opposed to H1 2021 during which immediately recognized capital sales accounted for most of the 189 net placements. Collaboration revenues  almost entirely from R&D services provided to partners  increased by EUR 2.6m to EUR 5.1m.Idylla™ cartridge average sales price (ASP) – During H1 2022  Idylla™ oncology cartridge ASP increased by 8% to EUR 113  resulting from a growing contribution of the Idylla™ GeneFusion Assay 10 (RUO) and from higher sales from the US where pricing is generally higher than in Europe and other parts of the world. The overall ASP in H1 2022 stood at EUR 103  up from EUR 95 in H1 2021 because of the increased ASP in oncology and a lower contribution of lower priced SARS-CoV-2 tests.Gross margin – Gross margin on products significantly increased  from 8% in H1 2021 to 32% in H1 2022. Last year  the gross margin was impacted by a higher cartridge COGS (Costs of Goods Sold) because production volumes were lower than expected as the pandemic caused a global shortage of reagent supplies. Moreover  the lower revenues from SARS-CoV-2 tests that have a significantly lower ASP than the other assays  also contributes to an improved gross margin. The total gross profit amounted to EUR 6.6m  or EUR 5.2m more than in H1 2021.OPEX – Total operating expenses (excluding cost of sales) of EUR 37.7m in H1 2022 decreased by EUR 1.4m from EUR 39.1m in H1 2021. EUR 4.1m lower spending in R&D was partly offset by the post-pandemic normalization of commercial activities  the impact of the 2021 restructuring of the US commercial operations and by global inflation.Net cash flow and cash position – The operating cash burn of EUR 19.2m (H1 2021: EUR 28.8m) was complemented by working capital investments of EUR 0.6m and a scheduled investment of EUR 1.0m to fund the operations of the Chinese joint venture WondfoCartis. Financial cash flows included EUR 3.1m interest payments and the repayment of EUR 8.6m borrowings  including EUR 6.0m drawn on working capital facilities at the end of 2021. The net cash outflow amounted to EUR 35.5m and resulted in a net cash position of EUR 19.7m. EUR 15m of credit facilities were undrawn and remain fully available awaiting the closing of the refinancing.KEY FIGURES H1 2022The tables below show an overview of the key figures and a breakdown of operating income for H1 2022 and H1 2021.

We are actively evaluating many promising potential product candidates. Our strategic objective is to pursue opportunities to repurpose and reformulate medicines that offer meaningful improvements for patients  physicians  and payors. With cash and cash equivalents of €57 687 million at 30 June 2022  Hyloris remains well-capitalized to advance all value-added assets and execute on this accretive business strategy to expand its portfolio to 30 product candidates and marketed products by 2024.“Story continuesMr Van Rompay continued  “During the first six months of 2022  via our commercial partners  we further enlarged our commercial footprint including the first launches in the European market for Maxigesic IV and pursued the roll-out of Sotalol IV for the US market.”MARKETED AND COMMERCIAL-STAGE PROGRAMSSotalol IV is a novel  patented  intravenous formulation of Sotalol for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias developed for the US.During the first six months of 2022  the partner expanded medical and sales teams in order to accelerate commercial roll-out  inclusion in hospital drug formularies and clinical education of hospital staff.Additional Value-Driving ProgramsMaxigesic® IV is a novel  unique combination  intravenous formulation for the treatment of post-operative pain and is currently licensed to partners covering over 100 countries across the globe.During the first six months of 2022  the geographical base where Maxigesic IV is approved has been broadened to 40 countries and additional marketing authorizations have been granted in Italy  Norway  Greece  Indonesia  Oman  Netherlands  Portugal  Finland  Bahrain  Kosovo  Singapore and Hong-Kong.Marketing authorisations are pending in several additional countries including Canada  Mexico and the US.Maxigesic® IV (for the US):In July  the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informed Hyloris’ development partner  AFT Pharmaceuticals  via a Complete Response Letter (CRL)  that it was unable to complete its review of the NDA for Maxigesic® IV and provided specific recommendations needed to address the application’s deficiency. Importantly  the agency did not report any issues related to data generated during Maxigesic® IV’s clinical development program  and the deficiency is confined solely to the Quality section of the application dossier and related to drug product packaging. Hyloris will generate additional data on extractables and leachables from the packaging components to respond to the FDA’s information request. Both parties remain committed to Maxigesic® IV and ensuring the product fulfils its commercial potential in the US. Additional studies as requested by FDA are under preparation and expected to begin in Q4 2022 and will take a few months to complete. Upon completion of these studies  the submission to FDA will be made.Other Developments Related to Maxigesic® IV:Additional patents were granted across multiple jurisdictions including Japan  Singapore  Canada  Mexico  China and the US  which range in exclusivity from 2035-2038.R&D UPDATECardiovascular ProgramsAspirin IV US is a first-in-class intravenous (IV) formulation of acetylsalicylic acid that could significantly improve treatment outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes  or ACS). Hyloris and its partner have completed the clinical phase of the study to assess the pharmacokinetics of this product candidate. Hyloris has contracted with a manufacturing organization to produce registration batches in preparation for an NDA submission to the FDA.Milrinone is a novel  patented  extended-release capsule that has been developed for twice-a-day  convenient oral dosing for end-stage heart failure (HF) patients with an implanted left ventricular assist device (LVAD) who have developed right HF. The extended-release formulation of milrinone in an oral form would provide a steady and predictable exposure of milrinone as well as allow for longer term use in a capsule form. The Company reported it held a successful Type C meeting with the FDA  confirming development plans for an extended-release milrinone capsule in this patient population with a high unmet need.Additional Value-Driving R&D ProgramsTranexamic Acid Oral Mouth Rinse program (HY-004): The program is being developed for patients on anti-coagulant therapies undergoing dental procedures that have a risk of bleeding complication  is progressing to a Phase 3 clinical trial after positive data reported from healthy subjects undergoing tooth extraction.AlenuraTM: Hyloris’ partner has written and soon will submit to FDA several protocols for the next clinical trials as part of the development of AlenuraTM  a first-line drug treatment for acute pain in interstitial cystitis /bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). The first of these clinical trials should start later this year.Miconazole/DB: Hyloris is co-developing a topical synergistic combination treatment for Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (rVVC)  a condition that affects nearly 10 % of women during their lifetime. MCZ/DB has a strong scientific and business rationale. A Phase 2 clinical trial is ongoing and recruitment should be completed by the end of the year.Other programs: These added-value programs are on track as planned as stated six months ago. Several discussions are being held with regulatory agencies to confirm and validate development plans.FINANCE AND OPERATIONAL UPDATESuccessfully raised a total of €17.8 million in gross proceeds  from new and existing  local and international investors  through (1) an equity offering by means of a private placement via an accelerated bookbuild and (2) execution of transaction warrants.

The continuous growth is mainly driven by royalty related income from commercialized products and research and development (R&D) services rendered by the Company.ResultsThe Company realized a net loss of €4 942 thousand for the six-month period ending 30 June 2022  compared to a net loss of €8 240 thousand for the first half-year of 2021  which is approximately 40% lower compared to last year.While last year net loss was mainly driven by the renegotiation and unwinding of the license agreements with the Alter Pharma Group (one-off Other Operating expenses of €5.7 million)  in the first half of this year the net loss is mainly resulting from the increase in R&D expenditure.R&D expenditure during the first six months of 2022 amounted to €4 712 thousand  compared to €1 560 thousand for the first half-year of 2021. The increase was mainly driven by costs related to outsourced and internal product development activities  driven by ongoing pipeline expansion and further development of current product candidates.Cash PositionThe Group maintains its strong cash position  with a current cash and cash equivalents totalled €57 687 thousand on 30 June 2022  compared to €53 465 thousand on 30 June 2021.A net increase of €7 675 thousand in cash and cash equivalents was recorded for the six-month period ending 30 June 2022  compared to a net decrease of €10 934 thousand during the first half-year of 2021. The net increase was mainly driven by net proceeds from a capital transaction of €17 169 thousand off set by (1) net cash out generated from operating activities of €6 401 thousand and (2) cash out due to partial reimbursement of shareholders’ loans and payment of interests of €2 324 thousand. This is compared to a net cash outflow for the same period in 2021 of €10 934 thousand  driven by the net operational cash burn of €9 282 thousand  impacted by one-time other expenses  and committed milestone investments in joint ventures (net cash used in investing activities).Business OutlookPipeline expansion : The Company re-stated that its goal remains to add four new reformulated or repurposed product candidates by the end of 2022 in line with its goal to build a portfolio of 30 products and product candidates by 2024.Commercial products:i) Maxigesic IV  ex-US: continue roll-out in Europe and Rest of the Worldii) Maxigesic IV for the US: Submit requested additional information to the US FDA in support of the new drug application (NDA)iii) Sotalol IV: accelerate roll-out in the USWith cash and cash equivalents of €57.7 million at 30 June 2022  the Company believes that it is well-capitalised to advance all current pipeline assets as planned and execute its current business plan with the expectation to expand the portfolio to 30 product candidates - and marketed products by 2024.UPCOMING PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL CALENDAR FOR 202316 March 2023 Full Year 2022 Financial Results and Business UpdateAbout Hyloris PharmaceuticalsHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

Magnolo#P1535Notes to editors:About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.1In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy2  3 In January 2022  bimekizumab received marketing authorization in Japan for the treatment of plaque psoriasis  generalized pustular psoriasis and psoriatic erythroderma in patients who are not sufficiently responding to existing treatments.4 In February and March 2022  bimekizumab was approved in Canada and Australia  respectively  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.5 6Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S. and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).About CIMZIA® in the U.S.CIMZIA® is the only Fc-free  PEGylated anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor). CIMZIA has a high affinity for human TNF-alpha  selectively neutralizing the pathophysiological effects of TNF-alpha.CIMZIA is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PSO) in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.CIMZIA is also indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA)  adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS)  and adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation.In addition  CIMZIA is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease (CD) and maintaining clinical response in adult patients with moderately to severely active disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. See important safety information including risk of serious bacterial  viral and fungal infections and tuberculosis below.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION about CIMZIA in the U.S.CONTRAINDICATIONSCIMZIA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to certolizumab pegol or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema  anaphylaxis  serum sickness  and urticaria.SERIOUS INFECTIONSPatients treated with CIMZIA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.Discontinue CIMZIA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.Reported infections include:Active tuberculosis (TB)  including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before CIMZIA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to CIMZIA use.Invasive fungal infections  including histoplasmosis  coccidioidomycosis  candidiasis  aspergillosis  blastomycosis  and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated  rather than localized  disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.Bacterial  viral  and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens  including Legionella and Listeria.Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with CIMZIA prior to initiating therapy in the following patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to TB; with a history of opportunistic infection; who resided in or traveled in regions where mycoses are endemic; with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIMZIA  including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.Do not start CIMZIA during an active infection  including localized infections.Patients older than 65 years  patients with co-morbid conditions  and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants may be at greater risk of infection.If an infection develops  monitor carefully and initiate appropriate therapy.MALIGNANCYLymphoma and other malignancies  some fatal  have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers  of which CIMZIA is a member. CIMZIA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.Consider the risks and benefits of CIMZIA treatment prior to initiating or continuing therapy in a patient with known malignancy.In clinical trials  more cases of malignancies were observed among CIMZIA-treated patients compared to control patients.In CIMZIA clinical trials  there was an approximately 2-fold higher rate of lymphoma than expected in the general U.S. population. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis  particularly those with highly active disease  are at a higher risk of lymphoma than the general population.Malignancies  some fatal  have been reported among children  adolescents  and young adults being treated with TNF blockers. Approximately half of the cases were lymphoma  while the rest were other types of malignancies  including rare types associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not usually seen in this patient population.Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL)  a rare type of T-cell lymphoma  have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers  including CIMZIA. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis  and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. Carefully assess the risks and benefits of treating with CIMZIA in these patient types.Cases of acute and chronic leukemia were reported with TNF blocker use.HEART FAILUREWorsening and new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported with TNF blockers. Exercise caution and monitor carefully.HYPERSENSITIVITYAngioedema  anaphylaxis  dyspnea  hypotension  rash  serum sickness  and urticaria have been reported following CIMZIA administration. If a serious allergic reaction occurs  stop CIMZIA and institute appropriate therapy. The needle shield inside the removable cap of the CIMZIA prefilled syringe contains a plastic derivative of natural rubber latex which may cause an allergic reaction in individuals sensitive to latex.HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATIONUse of TNF blockers  including CIMZIA  may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases have been fatal.Test patients for HBV infection before initiating treatment with CIMZIA.Exercise caution in patients who are carriers of HBV and monitor them before and during CIMZIA treatment.Discontinue CIMZIA and begin antiviral therapy in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Exercise caution when resuming CIMZIA after HBV treatment.NEUROLOGIC REACTIONSTNF blockers  including CIMZIA  have been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system and peripheral demyelinating diseases  including multiple sclerosis  seizure disorder  optic neuritis  peripheral neuropathy  and Guillain-Barré syndrome.HEMATOLOGIC REACTIONSRare reports of pancytopenia  including aplastic anemia  have been reported with TNF blockers. Medically significant cytopenia has been infrequently reported with CIMZIA.Consider stopping CIMZIA if significant hematologic abnormalities occur.DRUG INTERACTIONSDo not use CIMZIA in combination with other biological DMARDS.AUTOIMMUNITYTreatment with CIMZIA may result in the formation of autoantibodies and  rarely  in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop.IMMUNIZATIONSPatients on CIMZIA should not receive live or live-attenuated vaccines.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions in CIMZIA clinical trials (≥8%) were: upper respiratory infections (18%)  rash (9%)  and urinary tract infections (8%).For full prescribing information  please visithttps://www.ucb.com/_up/ucb_com_products/documents/Cimzia_09_11_2019_en.pdfCIMZIA® is a registered trademark of the UCB Group of Companies.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14Email: antje.witte@ucb.comU.S. Immunology CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.404.226.7591Email: nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

(“CoolCo” or “the Company”) interim results for the first half of 2022 (""1H 2022"") include consolidated successor period and combined predecessor period results which on an aggregate basis represent the first half results  and should not be interpreted as individual quarterly results.Highlights and subsequent eventsCoolCo generated aggregate operating income of $53.4 million and net income of $40.9 million for 1H  of which $27.7 million and $23.2 million respectively relates to predecessor period operations.Achieved average Daily Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"") 1 of $59 100 per day during 1H  comfortably exceeding the all-in cash breakeven for the fleet of around $50 000 per day.Cash and cash equivalents of $77.3 million and Contractual Debt 1 of $787.0 million as of June 30  2022.Generated Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $67.0 million for 1H.Raised $275 million in an upsized private placement on January 27  2022 and listed on the Euronext Growth Oslo market on February 22  2022.Appointed dedicated management team in March 2022.Acquisition of all eight Tri-Fuel Diesel Electric (""TFDE"") vessels together with The Cool Pool Limited completed by early April 2022.Fixed a LNG carrier on a 12-month charter at $120k per day commencing April 2022.Acquired management organization responsible for the technical and commercial management of LNG carriers and the provision of such services to third parties on June 30  2022  concluding the formation of CoolCo.During August 2022  we fixed another 12-month charter agreement at around $140 000 per day commencing early September 2022.Financial Results OverviewThe formation and funding of CoolCo and its acquisition of the eight TFDE LNG carriers  The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"") was completed in a phased process. It commenced with the funding of CoolCo on January 27  2022 and concluded with the acquisition of the LNG carrier and FSRU management organization on June 30  2022. Results for the six months commencing January 1  2022 and ending June 30  2022 have therefore been split between the period prior to the funding of CoolCo and various staggered acquisitions (the ""Predecessor"" period) and subsequent to the various staggered acquisitions of such vessels and management entities (together the ""Successor"" period).Story continuesThe commentary below is based on financial information for the aggregate of the Predecessor and Successor reporting periods  otherwise reflected as 1H 2022. CoolCo reports operating income of $53.4 million  net income of $40.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $67.0 million for 1H 2022.Financial SummaryThe table below sets forth certain key financial information for 1H 2022  split between Successor and Predecessor periods.(in thousands of $  except TCE) Successor Predecessor 1H 2022 Total operating revenues 56 892 43 851 100 743 Operating income 25 631 27 728 53 359 Net income 17 659 23 244 40 903 Adjusted EBITDA1 33 527 33 473 67 000 Average daily TCE1 (to the closest $100) 60 500 57 100 59 1001H 2022 Time and voyage charter revenues net of Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses amounted to $85.5 million  of which $49.5 million and $36.1 million related to Successor and Predecessor period operations  respectively  resulting in a 1H 2022 average daily TCE1 of $59 100 per day with utilization for the period at 98%.CoolCo recognized vessel and other management fee revenue of $6.6 million for the Predecessor period in respect of management services provided to 21 third-party owned LNG Carriers and FSRUs .1H 2022 vessel operating expenses were $21.4 million  of which Predecessor period operations incurred $8.1 million net of $2.3 million insurance claim proceeds specific to a Hull and Machinery claim related to Ice  resulting in lower than average daily operating cost for our TFDE vessels of approximately $15 000 per day.Administrative expenses for 1H 2022 totaled $8.1 million consisting of a combination of third-party vessel management expenses and corporate overheads.CoolCo's depreciation policy for the eight TFDE vessels  based on management's current best estimates  is to adopt a useful life expectancy of 30 years which is lower than that adopted during the Predecessor period and by most publicly listed industry peers. As a result  depreciation amounts in Successor and Predecessor periods are not comparable.Interest expense of $11.4 million includes $6.7m for the Successor period related to interest on the sustainable-linked six-vessel $570 million bank financing facility and variable interest entities (""VIEs"") debt from the sale and leaseback facilities  together with amortization of debt related transactions costs and guarantee fees.Other financial items of $0.7 million for 1H 2022 includes commitment fees and other financial charges.Net income attributable to non-controlling interests of $0.8 million during the successor period relates to our two consolidated lessor VIEs entities (Ice and Kelvin).Our cash and cash equivalents balances were $77.3 million as of June 30  2022  excluding restricted cash for VIEs related to sale and leaseback facilities in respect of Ice and Kelvin.Operational ReviewCoolCo's fleet of eight TFDE vessels have performed well with no technical off-hire recorded. 1H 2022 fleet utilization was 98%.In February 2022  Frost commenced her previously announced 5-year charter. In April 2022  a 12-month charter commenced at a rate of around $120k per day  20% higher than the prior charter agreed within the last 12 months for our fleet (in October 2021) and twice the rate the vessel earned on its prior 12-month charter. In June 2022  one of our vessels entered the spot market where she continued to trade over the summer months. The vessel subsequently secured a highly attractive 12-month charter rate at around $140 000 per day commencing early September 2022. Another vessel will conclude her 12-month charter in October 2022  positioning her well to secure attractive new business ahead of the winter months. No dry docks are scheduled for 2022 with the next vessel (Seal) is scheduled to dock no later than September 2023.Financing and LiquidityAs of June 30  2022  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $77.3 million and total short and long-term debt of $688.9 million. The outstanding Contractual Debt1 in respect of the six vessel bank financing facility (the ""$570 million bank facility"")  maturing in March 2027  amounted to $560.1 million and in respect of the two sale and leaseback facilities (Ice and Kelvin)  maturing in January 2025  amounted to $226.9 million. Total CoolCo Contractual Debt1 stood at $787.0 million.Revenue backlog1 from shipping fixtures to date amounts to $351 million as at June 30  2022 with around 86% based on fixed and floating rate charters and 14% in optional backlog.Corporate and Other MattersAs at June 30  2022  CoolCo had 40 010 000 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  16 000 817 were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd.  12 510 000 were owned by Golar LNG Limited and 11 499 183 were publicly owned.LNG Market ReviewThe year commenced with the Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") at $30.50/MMBtu  the Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $23.47/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $91 000 per day. By mid-January TTF exceeded JKM with the TTF premium to JKM attributable to Russian restrictions on spot purchased gas flows to Europe. Ships lifting destination flexible US and African cargoes originally bound for Asia were re-routed to Europe in response  reducing journey times for those cargos by around two thirds  freeing up vessels and putting downward pressure on spot shipping rates. By mid-February the market had softened to the point that some sub-lessors were electing to keep their vessels open rather than charter them out with negative round-trip economics.The outbreak of war on February 24  2022 further worsened LNG price differentials with TTF briefly exceeding $70/MMBtu whilst JKM traded at around $50/MMBtu  pulling more vessels into Europe and adding further downward pressure to ton miles. Securing LNG  regasification capacity  and vessels to deliver that LNG quickly became the priority of European end users under pressure to reduce their dependence on Russian piped gas. Prompt and time charter vessel availability began to diminish and rates improved as a bullish sentiment returned to the market. CoolCo took this opportunity to fix Seal on a 12-month charter at $120 000 per day  up from quoted rates in the sub-$80k per day region for similar business a few weeks earlier. In addition to charterers no longer willing to risk security of supply  two other factors emerged in support of improved shipping rates. As more US cargoes headed for Europe  congestion at the fully utilized European receiving terminals began to increase. Although ton miles had fallen  ton-time was increasing. Secondly  higher gas prices further bifurcated the market between newer more efficient vessels and older less efficient steam vessels that use/lose more LNG. The hire rate differential attributable to these efficiencies nearly doubled  benefiting TFDE vessels which were amongst the more efficient vessels available at the time.Over subsequent months  declining vessel availability continued to push rates higher in a counter-seasonal rally with TFDE spot rates reaching $100k per day in early June  whilst 12-month rates held steady at around $120k per day. An explosion at Freeport LNG in the US on June 8  2022 and the consequent temporary loss of 15 million tons of LNG capacity released the vessels serving this facility into the short-term market. TFDE spot rates dropped by close to 30% the following week. Incremental volumes from the start up and ramp up of operations at Calcasieu Pass and Coral FLNG in Mozambique will not come close to replacing the volumes lost from Freeport. Spot rates continued to fall as a result  with TFDE rates dropping to $50k per day by June 30. The fall in 12-month rates was more muted and rates remained well above $100k per day  indicating unchanged market expectations of tight shipping supply over the winter when Freeport is expected to begin ramping up again.OutlookWith very little tonnage on offer by independent owners  no uncommitted vessels scheduled for delivery for the rest of the year and charterers prioritizing shipping coverage  we expect that the market will quickly tighten when Freeport returns to service and relets are pulled back ahead of winter. We are seeing early signs of this today with TFDE spot rates recovering to around $70k per day and 12-month TFDE rates approaching twice the spot rate. Into 2023  around 38 vessels are scheduled to deliver  only three of which are uncommitted. A new environmental regulatory regime which will impede the operations of older  less efficient steam vessels that collectively make up over 30% of the global LNG fleet will also come into force. This will most likely cut the speed of these steam ships  especially in periods of high demand such as winters  effectively adding ton miles.At almost 40% of the on the water fleet  the order book looks sizeable however it remains insufficient to replace aging steam vessels and ship the next wave of volumes scheduled to start delivery in late 2024. Newbuild prices are now reaching $250 million and it is increasingly difficult to secure a 2026 delivery slot. Cost uncertainties mean that shipyards are reluctant to take orders for vessels that would deliver after 2026. Meanwhile  record high LNG prices set the scene for the most bullish environment for new LNG projects in a decade. Europe’s urgent need to pivot away from unreliable Russian piped gas and its decision to include gas in the EU Taxonomy of green fuels is giving energy companies and utilities the confidence to enter into long term offtake agreements that will underpin these projects. These projects will generate a steady stream of new LNG volumes to be shipped over the decades ahead and CoolCo expects its vessels to be well positioned to connect this cleaner  more secure energy with demand.1 Refer to 'Appendix A' - Non-GAAP financial measures and definitions'.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements which reflect management’s current expectations  estimates and projections about its operations.

Magnolo#P1535Notes to editors:About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.1In August 2021  bimekizumab was approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy2  3 In January 2022  bimekizumab received marketing authorization in Japan for the treatment of plaque psoriasis  generalized pustular psoriasis and psoriatic erythroderma in patients who are not sufficiently responding to existing treatments.4 In February and March 2022  bimekizumab was approved in Canada and Australia  respectively  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.5 6Bimekizumab is an investigational product; its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S. and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).About CIMZIA® in the U.S.CIMZIA® is the only Fc-free  PEGylated anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor). CIMZIA has a high affinity for human TNF-alpha  selectively neutralizing the pathophysiological effects of TNF-alpha.CIMZIA is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PSO) in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.CIMZIA is also indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA)  adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS)  and adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation.In addition  CIMZIA is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease (CD) and maintaining clinical response in adult patients with moderately to severely active disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. See important safety information including risk of serious bacterial  viral and fungal infections and tuberculosis below.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION about CIMZIA in the U.S.CONTRAINDICATIONSCIMZIA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to certolizumab pegol or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included angioedema  anaphylaxis  serum sickness  and urticaria.SERIOUS INFECTIONSPatients treated with CIMZIA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.Discontinue CIMZIA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.Reported infections include:Active tuberculosis (TB)  including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before CIMZIA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to CIMZIA use.Invasive fungal infections  including histoplasmosis  coccidioidomycosis  candidiasis  aspergillosis  blastomycosis  and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated  rather than localized  disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.Bacterial  viral  and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens  including Legionella and Listeria.Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with CIMZIA prior to initiating therapy in the following patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to TB; with a history of opportunistic infection; who resided in or traveled in regions where mycoses are endemic; with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIMZIA  including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.Do not start CIMZIA during an active infection  including localized infections.Patients older than 65 years  patients with co-morbid conditions  and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants may be at greater risk of infection.If an infection develops  monitor carefully and initiate appropriate therapy.MALIGNANCYLymphoma and other malignancies  some fatal  have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers  of which CIMZIA is a member. CIMZIA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.Consider the risks and benefits of CIMZIA treatment prior to initiating or continuing therapy in a patient with known malignancy.In clinical trials  more cases of malignancies were observed among CIMZIA-treated patients compared to control patients.In CIMZIA clinical trials  there was an approximately 2-fold higher rate of lymphoma than expected in the general U.S. population. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis  particularly those with highly active disease  are at a higher risk of lymphoma than the general population.Malignancies  some fatal  have been reported among children  adolescents  and young adults being treated with TNF blockers. Approximately half of the cases were lymphoma  while the rest were other types of malignancies  including rare types associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not usually seen in this patient population.Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL)  a rare type of T-cell lymphoma  have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers  including CIMZIA. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis  and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. Carefully assess the risks and benefits of treating with CIMZIA in these patient types.Cases of acute and chronic leukemia were reported with TNF blocker use.HEART FAILUREWorsening and new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported with TNF blockers. Exercise caution and monitor carefully.HYPERSENSITIVITYAngioedema  anaphylaxis  dyspnea  hypotension  rash  serum sickness  and urticaria have been reported following CIMZIA administration. If a serious allergic reaction occurs  stop CIMZIA and institute appropriate therapy. The needle shield inside the removable cap of the CIMZIA prefilled syringe contains a plastic derivative of natural rubber latex which may cause an allergic reaction in individuals sensitive to latex.HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATIONUse of TNF blockers  including CIMZIA  may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases have been fatal.Test patients for HBV infection before initiating treatment with CIMZIA.Exercise caution in patients who are carriers of HBV and monitor them before and during CIMZIA treatment.Discontinue CIMZIA and begin antiviral therapy in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Exercise caution when resuming CIMZIA after HBV treatment.NEUROLOGIC REACTIONSTNF blockers  including CIMZIA  have been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system and peripheral demyelinating diseases  including multiple sclerosis  seizure disorder  optic neuritis  peripheral neuropathy  and Guillain-Barré syndrome.HEMATOLOGIC REACTIONSRare reports of pancytopenia  including aplastic anemia  have been reported with TNF blockers. Medically significant cytopenia has been infrequently reported with CIMZIA.Consider stopping CIMZIA if significant hematologic abnormalities occur.DRUG INTERACTIONSDo not use CIMZIA in combination with other biological DMARDS.AUTOIMMUNITYTreatment with CIMZIA may result in the formation of autoantibodies and  rarely  in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop.IMMUNIZATIONSPatients on CIMZIA should not receive live or live-attenuated vaccines.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions in CIMZIA clinical trials (≥8%) were: upper respiratory infections (18%)  rash (9%)  and urinary tract infections (8%).For full prescribing information  please visithttps://www.ucb.com/_up/ucb_com_products/documents/Cimzia_09_11_2019_en.pdfCIMZIA® is a registered trademark of the UCB Group of Companies.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14Email: [email protected]U.S. Immunology CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.404.226.7591Email: [email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB.

9433,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/02/stable-outperforming-stocks-with-upside-to-navigate-market-volatility.html,These outperforming stocks could be safe bets right now — and analysts give them serious upside,Investors could find safety in these stable global stocks  which have outperformed this year — and analysts say have serious upside.,"Fears are mounting that the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks will continue with their pace of interest rate hikes to quash inflation — even at the expense of economic growth. That has weighed heavily on the stock market  with all of the major averages on track to finish the week lower. On Thursday  the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down lower to notch its fifth straight day of declines  while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S & P 500 eked out narrow gains to snapped a four-day losing streak. And there could be more pain ahead as the stock market now enters into what has traditionally been a ""seasonally weak"" period for equities . Low-volatility stocks Investors looking to rotate into safer bets could find solace in a portfolio of stable stocks that have outperformed the market. CNBC PRO used FactSet data to screen for low-volatility MSCI World stocks that are up for the year — and could still go higher These stocks have a three-year historical beta of less than 1. ""Beta"" is a measure of volatility : a beta of under 1 means the stock will be less volatile than the market  whereas a beta of over 1 indicates its price will be more volatile than the market. The list is then whittled down to include only stocks that are in positive territory this year. They are also buy-rated by the majority of analysts  with average potential upside of at least 10% over the next 12 months  according to FactSet data. Utilities Several utility stocks turned up on the screen. The sector is viewed as a safe harbor in periods of market upheaval  given its steady and regulated earnings  as well as higher dividend income relative to other sectors. Utilities have outperformed every other sector on the MSCI World this year  apart from the energy sector  which has been the best performer by far. Japan's Tokyo Gas and Kansai Electric were among the utility names that made the screen  with historical beta of 0.1 and 0.3 respectively. California-based Sempra and Germany's RWE appeared on the list too. Health care and other sectors A quarter of the 53 names on the screen were health care stocks. The sector is seen as a safe bet when markets turn volatile  given its typically strong free cash flow and dividend payouts. British-Swedish pharma giant AstraZeneca has the lowest historical beta in the group  at just 0.2. The stock has rallied nearly 30% this year  but analysts think it still has upside of 26.4%. Illinois-based AbbVie and Indiana-based Eli Lilly made the list too  with historical beta of 0.7 and 0.4  respectively. Insurance firm Elevance Health also turned up on the screen  albeit with a historical beta of 1.0. The stock was one of the most added stocks by mutual funds in the second quarter  according to Goldman Sachs. A number of consumer staples  largely comprising food and tobacco companies  also made the list. Within the group  Japan's Nissin Foods — best known for its instant noodles — has the lowest historical beta of 0. The stock has gained nearly 20% this year  but analysts think it could still rally 26%. Other food companies include Ajinomoto and George Weston   with historical beta of 0.1 and 0.3  respectively. Two tobacco companies turn up on the screen: British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands . Both stocks have historical beta of 0.8 and potential upside of around 15%. Car parts and equipment retailer AutoZone also appeared on the list. The company has historically outperformed during bear markets which could explain why analysts are so bullish on the stock  with an average potential upside of 34.7%. The screen also uncovered several financial stocks  such as insurers Tokio Marine   MS & AD Insurance and W.R.

The Company will continue to maintain lists of insiders and senior managers will continue to file securities transaction reports with the AMF. Board composition – Governance The rules on parity within the Board of Directors provided for in Article L.225-18-1 of the French Commercial Code will no longer apply. However  the Company could be subject to the application of these parity rules if it exceeds certain thresholds  but this is not the case at present. The Company will no longer be subject to the legal provisions of Articles L.823-19 et seq. of the French Commercial Code concerning audit committees. The content of the Board's report on corporate governance will be reduced. Executive remuneration The General Meeting will no longer be required to approve the remuneration policy for corporate officers or to approve the remuneration paid or awarded to corporate officers in respect of the previous financial year. Annual General Meeting The press release specifying the terms of availability of the documents submitted to the meeting will no longer be required. The preparatory documents for the meeting and other documents (including the total number of voting rights and shares existing at the date of publication of the prior notice) will no longer be required to be posted online twenty-one days before the date of the general meeting  but on the date of the notice of meeting (article 4.4 of the Euronext Growth® Market Rules).

At the end of this three-year period from the date of admission to Euronext Growth®  only the crossing of the thresholds of 50 and 90% of the capital or voting rights of the Company will have to be declared by the shareholders to the AMF and to the Company  in accordance with article 223-15-1 of the AMF General Regulations. In accordance with the provisions of article 231-1 of the AMF General Regulations  the provisions relating to takeover bids applicable to companies listed on the regulated market of Euronext  will remain applicable for a period of three years from the date of admission to Euronext Growth®. At the end of this period  the Company will be subject to the regulations applicable to companies listed on Euronext Growth®. Thus  as regards the filing of a mandatory public offer  it will only be required in the event of an increase in the threshold of 50% of the capital or voting rights.
