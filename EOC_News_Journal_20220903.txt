9469,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4538821-be-semiconductor-stock-buy-large-upside,BE Semiconductor Stock A Buy With Large Upside (BESIY) (BESVF),BE Semiconductor is a solid tech company I consider highly investable right now. Read more to see why I consider the stock a buy at the current prices.,"jiefeng jiangThis article was published on Dividend Kings on the 23rd of August.In this article  we'll take another look at BE Semiconductor Industries (OTC:BESIY) (OTC:BESVF). I've reviewed the company before  and I believe that after another 8-9% drop  the time is ripe to update my thesis for the business and why I consider it a ""BUY"" here.If you read my initial article  you'll know what the company does. It does assembly equipment for semi-manufacturing. It might be relatively unknown as far as the larger tech space goes  but this company is  in part  a market leader in the entire space  with a #1 and #2 market share in some key areas.Let's look at the most recent set of results.BE Semiconductor Industries - An updateThere is a reason why I consider BESI to be an interesting and undervalued opportunity in the sector. I've covered the company in previous articles and established a basic thesis for the business.The company seemed appealing two months back when things dropped in the tech sector. Since my article  the company has dropped yet another 2.5% while the market has recovered close to 10%. So without needing to look in detail at the company's valuation  I can say that BESI is even more attractive now than it was a few months back.Remember  this is an assembly equipment supplier. Despite being relatively unknown  it has a #1 and #2 in some key markets  and boasts  according to company info  a market share of no less than 32% in terms of addressable market share (not the market share the company actually has).The company's operations can be found across the world  with factories or offices in 6 countries. As of 2020  the company has 1 901 employees  and it's headquartered  as the N.V. suggests  in the Netherlands.BESI IR (BESI IR)The argument here is the importance of its operations. We could speak at length about the company's business and specific processes. The process of die attaching or die-bonding semis  is the process of attaching a semiconductor die to a package  substrate  or another die. Examples of attachments are things like PCB boards. It works to essentially place the semi-device on the next level of interconnection  be this another substrate or a board. This is used in virtually every industry that uses semis and can be differentiated between adhesive bonding  eutectic bonding (attaching using a metal alloy)  solder attaching (using solder or paste)  or flip-chip attaching  using electrical interconnection by inverting the die on a face-down manner onto the package or substrate.But in the end  what's important is that our modern semiconductor world would not function as it currently does without this process or even BESI's products. Take a look at some of the company's customers.BESI IR (BESI IR)I make a clear case for why this company is fundamentally attractive in my very first article BESI - as well as some of the overall risks that should be considered prior to invest seriously in the business. But the latest set of results does show a bit of encouraging trends here.What's important to consider is that the company's gross margins  despite everything  really haven't seen any sort of drawdown but have stayed steady at above 58%  while revenue has steadily been climbing toward the €1B mark. This is also the company's target - to increase revenue  the TAM market share  to maintain that 58-62% GM level  and a net margin of above 35%. The company manages this at this time.I'm personally not that interested in BESI's ESG ambitions  more interested in the headcount split targets and the capital allocation trends. BESI has distributed over €300M YTD already  including share purchases. This is already more than 3x the capital allocated to shareholders in all of 2020 and nearly double the 2021 level.BESI is a perfect example of a company that's highly correlated to high-level macro and being the best at what they do. The assembly equipment market is a highly demanding market in terms of the production environment - because these environments usually run 24/7  putting a high demand and strain on the company's products.The company's current forecast calls for a relatively stable  high-level Assembly market with revenue sticking very close to the current levels.BESI IR (BESI IR)There was a small  general deterioration of overall market conditions in 2Q22 due to CapEx hikes  a slowing world economy  inflation  shortages and continued COVID-19 issues in China. But the bullish thesis for the company is still mostly intact. EUV adoption  IC expansion  5G and 5nm expansion  and the overall increased use cases for these technologies will continue to drive things upward.These growth expectations in a very real way favor the company's portfolio  in particular  the die attach market. There are no realistic scenarios where the company's business sees significant deterioration fundamentally  and where revenue or net income craters. The expected 2022E growth of 20% for die attach technologies in terms of revenues  and 2.5% in the year after is even on the conservative side  all things considered here - even if earnings themselves are actually expected to drop in 2022E.The fundamental upside for BESI is beyond cyclical tendencies and trends.BESI IR (BESI IR)Based on this  I see any significant drop-down to conservative levels as a ""BUY"" potential here. And I believe  very realistically  that this is a situation we are currently in.Now  the company has no credit rating. It's a $4B market cap Semi company with around 34% debt/Cap  with both a native Netherlands listing and an active  liquid ADR called BESIY  which we are currently looking at. The company's fundamentals  however  can be seen as very positive in the long term. While the company has definite cyclical tendencies  the margins and revenue tendencies over an averaged-out through-cyclic perspective is impressive  and BESI considers a 4-year cycle to be the average of what the company is seeing.This company carries extremely strong gross margins of over 60% at times  related to the company's ""flexible"" Asian production and workforce. BESI also executes extremely tight overhead management  which leads to a very significant operating leverage with excellent baseline OpEx based on the company's revenues.The company holds to its dividend policy of paying out 40-100% of net income each year and seeks to expand its current €4-5B market cap.BESI's native ticker is on the Euronext AEX market  and the top 10 shareholders own 45% of SO. Most of the shareholders are either from the US/UK (57%) or NL (17%). Foreign shareholding from the US is small.Let's look at what the valuation looks like - because this looks very interesting now.BESI's ValuationThis is not the sort of company you want to buy at expensive multiples when its everyone's darling. This is the sort of business you want to buy when everyone is telling you what garbage the company is - and you know your stuff.The company has traded down significantly  and while it's no longer troughing at 15x P/E lows  it's still pretty damn low here.BESI valuation (F.A.S.T Graphs)Note the cycles. Note the way the company moves from ups to downs and back again. Note that despite the drop in 2022E and the expected bounce in the coming years  the company is trading lower than it has for very many years - since 2018  I would argue.This stance is not based on actual  believable forecasts.What makes me say this?I want you to look at current EPS forecasts from S&P Global  coupled with considering the company's market position.BESI Forecasts (TIKR.com/S&P Global)I also want you to consider the fact that the company's gross margin is expected to expand over the coming years to around 61-62%. I want you to know that analyst forecast accuracy is over 68% here  with a tendency of 48% on a 2-year forward basis for the company to actually significantly beat overall estimates (Source: FactSet). While it's tough to forecast  there is a trend here.My last stance for this business was a ""BUY"". I'm still at a ""BUY""  but I'm lowering my PT to account for the changing market dynamics. BESI was at $78/share for the ADR initially  I'm sticking to my earlier $65/share. This is still at a premium  allowing for the company to grow to slightly beyond that 15X P/E  but it's well below any sort of valuation that's currently the average for analysts.It's a proven company that's delivered returns of no less than 400-500% in less than 6 years  and that's even after the current crash. If you'd sold closer to peak valuation  your RoR would have been around 850%.This space is exciting if you can buy the right company at the right price.I believe BESI Is a sort of ""right"" company  and I do believe that at below 16-17X P/E  we're at a good price.That's why I'm still a ""BUY"" here  and why I am now getting more excited about the company's prospects.Look - even considered only at a 15x forward P/E  the company is now likely (as I see it) to generate returns of at least double digits per year or nearly 30% in 3 years.BESI Upside (F.A.S.T Graphs)Even allowing for a very slight potential of a premium here  the potential outperformance for BESI goes all the way up to 30% per year in the case of 22x P/E forward multiple - and this is not at all outlandish given where the company has been trading for the past few years.BESI now commands an average analyst PT of €72.5/share  down from almost €100/share back in march of this year. This illustrates how quick these analysts are in shifting their long-term targets. I personally stick to my conservative €65/share target for the native here.For the 2024E P/E target of 18x  the company has a more than 98% total RoR (or 80% conservatively  considered down to 16-17x P/E)  from an annualized RoR of 34%.7 out of 9 analysts consider this company to be a solid ""BUY"" here - that's the same number of analysts with the stance as we had some months ago  so overall things haven't shifted all that much.The only thing that's shifted to any meaningful degree is that the company can now clearly be considered ""cheap"".That is rare enough for me to highlight it  and purchase stock here.So  based on all of this and what I've said in the article  I view BESI as a ""BUY"" here with an upside of at least 14% annually and a price target of $65/share for the native.Questions?Let me know!",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.26,0.14,0.6,True,English,"['BE Semiconductor Stock', 'Large Upside', 'BESIY', 'BESVF', 'stable, high-level Assembly market', 'headcount split targets', 'BE Semiconductor Industries', 'assembly equipment supplier', 'small, general deterioration', 'net income craters', 'slowing world economy', 'assembly equipment market', 'modern semiconductor world', 'larger tech space', '58-62% GM level', 'addressable market share', 'TAM market share', 'overall market conditions', 'die attach market', 'capital allocation trends', 'die attach technologies', 'high-level macro', 'semiconductor die', 'market leader', 'demanding market', 'entire space', 'encouraging trends', 'net margin', 'significant deterioration', 'share purchases', 'jiefeng jiang', 'Dividend Kings', '8-9% drop', 'key areas', 'recent set', 'undervalued opportunity', 'previous articles', 'tech sector', 'key markets', 'N.V.', 'specific processes', 'PCB boards', 'next level', 'adhesive bonding', 'eutectic bonding', 'metal alloy', 'clear case', 'overall risks', 'latest set', 'gross margins', '€1B mark', 'ESG ambitions', '300M YTD', 'perfect example', 'production environment', 'high demand', 'current forecast', 'current levels', 'CapEx hikes', 'COVID-19 issues', 'EUV adoption', 'IC expansion', '5nm expansion', 'use cases', 'growth expectations', 'real way', 'realistic scenarios', '2022E growth', 'conservative side', 'basic thesis', 'bullish thesis', 'electrical interconnection', 'BESI IR', 'initial article', 'first article', 'company info', '2021 level', '23rd', 'August', 'look', 'OTC', 'BESIY', 'BESVF', 'time', 'business', 'manufacturing', 'part', 'results', 'update', 'reason', 'interesting', 'things', 'detail', 'valuation', 'less', 'terms', 'operations', 'factories', 'offices', '6 countries', '1,901 employees', 'Netherlands', 'argument', 'importance', 'length', 'semis', 'package', 'substrate', 'Examples', 'attachments', 'semi-device', 'industry', 'solder', 'paste', 'chip', 'face', 'manner', 'products', 'customers', 'everything', 'sort', 'drawdown', 'revenue', 'shareholders', 'environments', 'strain', '2Q22', 'inflation', 'shortages', 'continued', 'China', '5G', 'portfolio', 'year']",2022-09-03,2022-09-03,seekingalpha.com
