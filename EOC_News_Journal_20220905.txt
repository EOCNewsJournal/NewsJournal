So we shall go ahead with the banking sector reform as well. Even on that the Cabinet has given a clearance; we have mentioned it in the budget. We shall take it forward.""Earlier in May  the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had given its in-principle approval for strategic divestment along with transfer of management control of IDBI Bank. It added that the extent of shareholding to be divested by the Centre and LIC shall be ""decided at the time of structuring of the transaction in consultation with the central bank"".LIC (as promoter) and the Centre (as co-promoter) together hold more than 94 percent of IDBI Bank (49.24 percent and 45.48 percent respectively).The LIC board passed a resolution to reduce stake in IDBI Bank through divestment  while the government envisages strategic stake sale with intent to relinquish management control.While presenting the budget on February 1 this year  Sitharaman had announced that the government has approved a policy of strategic divestment of public sector enterprises that will provide a clear roadmap for divestment in all non-strategic and strategic sectors.

The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Certain things still need to be finalised.,The Centre will not factor in any potential inflows from the listing of certain categories of government securities on overseas bond indices when it finalises its borrowing calendar for the second half of this fiscal later this month  an official source told FE.This indicates the much-awaited listing of G-sec on global bond indices is unlikely to take place in 2022  if not in FY23.“The government has been in discussions with overseas index operators. Certain things still need to be finalised. So  the listing plan is taking a bit of time ” the source said.JP Morgan reportedly began fresh talks with investors recently about adding India to its emerging market index. This raised expectations of an imminent listing of the country’s securities.In March  the government announced its plan to borrow Rs 8.45 trillion from the market through dated securities in the first half of FY23. It has pegged FY23 gross market borrowing at Rs 14.31 trillion (after adjusting for the conversion of short-term maturities into long-dated bonds).Also Read | MCX Crude oil September futures: Short covering on cards before OPEC+ meet; go long only above Rs 7382/bblMorgan Stanley last year estimated that $40 billion would flow into Indian government bonds after the inclusion into two of the three global indices —Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index and JPM GBI-EM Global Diversified Index. On an average  $18.5 billion in annual inflows will take place over the next decade. This would push foreign ownership of Indian government papers  currently less than 2%  to 9% by 2031.It has been in talks with JP Morgan and Bloomberg-Barclays for listing its bonds on overseas indices. It’s also discussing clearing and settlement issues with Euroclear. However  India’s reluctance to scrap capital gains tax on such transactions or freeze it at a certain level  fears about greater capital outflows during tough times and preference for local settlement of securities are among the issues that are still being worked out.Bonds listed on global indices are usually settled via international platforms  including Euroclear  outside a country’s borders. Sources had earlier said that Euroclear had been pushing India to exempt the transactions from taxes  citing the fact that other countries  too  follow similar policy.The listing plan is aimed at not just financing a portion of the country’s elevated fiscal deficit in the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak but deepening its bond market. The move would potentially draw higher foreign flows  as many overseas funds track global indices.Also Read | Indian Rupee: More downside in INR against US Dollar on cards  bullishness intact above 78.50 on spotEndorsing the decision  some analysts have argued that since the country has to prepare for an extended period of limited liquidity  with advanced economies focussed on inflation control  it makes sense to tap fresh avenues for foreign fund flow. As the government is the biggest borrower in the system  it should ensure that all these avenues are kept open.However  while conceding the benefits of the listing  others  including government officials  want to examine in detail the adverse fallout of any such action when going gets tough for the economy. “In such a situation  it can also lead to massive capital outflows. So  the pros and cons are being carefully weighed ” said another source.As more foreign capital flows into Indian government bonds  the yield curve—or difference in short-term and long-term yields—could flatten by 50 basis points  according to Morgan Stanley. If added  India could represent 9.2% of the JPM GBI-EM Global Diversified Index  making it the second-largest country in that benchmark  after China  it added in a note last year.The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield has been easing a tad in recent weeks.

Rare cutaneous lymphomas of T lymphocytes has a poor prognosis with few efficacious and safe therapeutic options at advanced stages.KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor of the KIR family  expressed by approximately 65% of patients across all CTCL subtypes and expressed by up 90% of patients with certain aggressive CTCL subtypes  in particular  Sézary syndrome. It is expressed by up to 50% of patients with mycosis fungoides and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). It has a restricted expression on normal tissues.About ANKET™:ANKET™ (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) is Innate's proprietary platform for developing next-generation  multi-specific natural killer (NK) cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer.This versatile  fit-for-purpose technology is creating an entirely new class of molecules to induce synthetic immunity against cancer. It leverages the advantages of harnessing NK cell effector functions against cancer cells and also provides proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells.Our latest innovation  the tetra-specific ANKET molecule  is the first NK cell engager technology to engage activating receptors (NKp46 and CD16)  a tumor antigen and an interleukin-2 receptor (via an IL-2 variant  IL-2v) via a single molecule.About Monalizumab:Monalizumab is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.NKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E  cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Monalizumab may reestablish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells  and may enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies1.The ongoing development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in various combination strategies in different malignancies  including  in early lung cancer  the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 study in adults with locally advanced (Stage III)  unresectable NSCLC  who have not progressed following platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy  and the Phase 2 NeoCOAST-2 study in the neoadjuvant early-stage setting of NSCLC.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of Natural Killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering. This innovative approach has resulted in a diversified proprietary portfolio and major alliances with leaders in the biopharmaceutical industry including Bristol-Myers Squibb  Novo Nordisk A/S  Sanofi  and a multi-products collaboration with AstraZeneca.Headquartered in Marseille  France with a US office in Rockville  MD  Innate Pharma is listed on Euronext Paris and Nasdaq in the US.Learn more about Innate Pharma at www.innate-pharma.comInformation about Innate Pharma shares:ISIN code FR0010331421 Ticker code Euronext: IPH Nasdaq: IPHA LEI 9695002Y8420ZB8HJE29Disclaimer on forward-looking information and risk factors:This press release contains certain forward-looking statements  including those within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

September 5  2022. Results from a Phase 3 open-label extension trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent® (dupilumab) as a maintenance therapy when added to other asthma medications was consistent for up to two years in children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with evidence of type 2 inflammation. These results were presented today in a late-breaking session at the 2022 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress  which coincides with the milestone that more than 500 000 people around the world have been treated with Dupixent in its approved indications.Leonard B. Bacharier  M.D.Professor of Pediatrics  Director of the Center for Pediatric Asthma Research  Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital  Vanderbilt University Medical Center“Children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma may experience long-term persistent coughing  difficulty breathing  unpredictable asthma attacks and impaired lung function  which can lead to complications later in life as they grow and develop. An established safety profile balanced with efficacy is always a priority when treating children with a chronic disease  such as those with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. These new data further support the consistent safety profile of long-term Dupixent - which is indicated for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma - and its ability to provide sustained improvements in lung function and reductions in asthma exacerbations in children as young as 6 years old.”Story continuesThe results are from data in children who entered the extension trial after finishing active treatment or placebo in the Phase 3 trial (pivotal trial). Children in the extension trial were treated for up to an additional year with Dupixent  providing up to two years of data in total. Children treated with Dupixent in the extension trial experienced a:Low rate of severe asthma attacks with an average of 0.118-0.124 events per year  compared to 2.16-2.56 events per year at baseline in the pivotal trial.Sustained improvement in lung function at 52 weeks of 9.43-12.6 percentage points from baseline in the pivotal trial  measured by percent predicted FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp). FEV1pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age  height  sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development. Children who switched from placebo in the pivotal trial to Dupixent in the extension trial demonstrated improvement of 8.71 percentage points in lung function at two weeks.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved respiratory indications. Over the 52-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 61-68%. The most common AEs (≥5%) were nasopharyngitis (9-10%)  pharyngitis (6-10%)  upper respiratory tract infection (4-8%)  influenza (5-6%)  eosinophilia (3-6%)  allergic rhinitis (3-7%)  diarrhea (4-6%) and injection site reactions (3-7%).About Pediatric AsthmaAsthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators  these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing  wheezing and difficulty breathing. They also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks.About the LIBERTY ASTHMA EXCURSION TrialThe Phase 3  multicenter  open-label extension trial evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of Dupixent in 365 children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma who had previously participated in the placebo-controlled VOYAGE trial (the pivotal trial) when they were 6 to 11 years of age. Patients in the open-label extension trial received Dupixent 100 mg or 200 mg every two weeks or Dupixent 300 mg every four weeks  based on body weight  for 52 weeks.The primary endpoint assessed the number of patients experiencing any treatment emergent adverse event. Secondary endpoints included the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year and change from pivotal trial baseline in FEV 1 pp .About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.In the EU  Dupixent is approved in children aged 6 to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO  who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. For adolescents and adults 12 years and older with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation  patients must be inadequately controlled with high dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced results from a Phase 3 open-label extension trial demonstrating the efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent® (dupilumab) as a maintenance therapy when added to other asthma medications was consistent for up to two years in children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with evidence of type 2 inflammation. These results were presented today in a late-breaking session at the 2022 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress  which coincides with the milestone that more than 500 000 people around the world have been treated with Dupixent across all of its approved indications.""Children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma may experience long-term persistent coughing  difficulty breathing  unpredictable asthma attacks and impaired lung function  which can lead to complications later in life as they grow and develop "" said Leonard B. Bacharier  M.D.  Professor of Pediatrics and Director of the Center for Pediatric Asthma Research  Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville  Tennessee  and principal investigator of the trial. ""An established safety profile balanced with efficacy is always a priority when treating children with a chronic disease  such as those with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. These new data further support the consistent safety profile of long-term Dupixent - which is indicated for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma - and its ability to provide sustained improvements in lung function and reductions in asthma exacerbations in children as young as 6 years old.""Story continuesThe results are from data in children who entered the extension trial after finishing active treatment or placebo in the Phase 3 trial (pivotal trial). Children in the extension trial were treated for up to an additional year with Dupixent  providing up to two years of data in total. Children treated with Dupixent in the extension trial experienced a:Low rate of severe asthma attacks with an average of 0.118-0.124 events per year  compared to 2.16-2.56 events per year at baseline in the pivotal trial.Sustained improvement in lung function at 52 weeks of 9.43-12.6 percentage points from baseline in the pivotal trial  measured by percent predicted FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp). FEV 1 pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age  height  sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved respiratory indications. Over the 52-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 61-68%. The most common AEs (≥5%) were nasopharyngitis (9-10%)  pharyngitis (6-10%)  upper respiratory tract infection (4-8%)  influenza (5-6%)  eosinophilia (3-6%)  allergic rhinitis (3-7%)  diarrhea (4-6%) and injection site reactions (3-7%).About Pediatric AsthmaAsthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators  these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing  wheezing and difficulty breathing. They also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks.About the LIBERTY ASTHMA EXCURSION TrialThe Phase 3  multicenter  open-label extension trial evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of Dupixent in 365 children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma who had previously participated in the placebo-controlled VOYAGE trial (the pivotal trial) when they were 6 to 11 years of age. Based on body weight  patients in the open-label extension trial received Dupixent 100 mg or 200 mg every two weeks or Dupixent 300 mg every four weeks  for 52 weeks.The primary endpoint assessed the number of patients experiencing any treatment emergent adverse event. Secondary endpoints included the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year and change from pivotal trial baseline in FEV 1 pp .About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.In the EU  Dupixent is approved in children aged 6 to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO  who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. For adolescents and adults 12 years and older with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation  patients must be inadequately controlled with high dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Stéphane Rougeot  who is also CFO of the newly Paris-listed firm  said the audio streamer hadn’t seen any “material impact” to its subscriber base  with churn actually down in recent months.He called the music streaming sphere “very different” to video  stating that users were likely to subscribe to just one provider  and therefore not be forced to decide between cutting one streamer over another: something that stands in stark contrast to the streaming wars that has raged between Netflix  Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video.Earlier this year  a Kantar report found that 16.9m UK households had at least one subscription service at the end of the first quarter. It also found that 1.5m accounts were cancelled during this time too.“Some people may not have a choice  but we think it is more unlikely that people will cut this [music] ” Rougeot told City A.M  adding that music was the “most engaging” as it had universal appeal: Deezer reckons subscribers listen to 33 hours of music a month  with user patterns wide and varied.Despite being in direct competition with the likes of Apple Music and Spotify  Deezer took the leap of faith earlier this year and went back public via a SPAC listing.Rougeot told City A.M. that the Euronext listing  which valued the firm at $1.1bn  was both the “finish line and in many ways the starting line” for Deezer.“As a proud French tech Unicorn  going public in Paris for us was really important ” Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueir said at the bell-ringing ceremony in July.However  the road to listing has been long and winding for Deezer  having backtracked in 2015 from original IPO plans  and facing mounting competition from the four other major global players ever since: Apple Music  Google Music  Amazon Music and Spotify.Rougeot said the key differentiator for Deezer was that it is “focused on music and just on music”  pushing back against rivals’ attempts to push into podcasts and other exclusive offerings.The vision is therefore quite idealistic. “We want more than just access to catalogues. We want to allow users to enjoy ‘true music experiences’ and to strengthen the connection between artists and fans ” Rougeot said  dismissing any plans that it would dabble in podcasts.Instead  Deezer is focusing on building undeniably vague “true music experiences”  for its 9.6m strong subscriber base.Unlike its rivals  advertising also represents a tiny part of the firm’s strategy  making up less than two per cent of revenue in 2021.“The goal is to grow music subscription revenue – not trying to expand user base or ad revenue. We want to grow in new markets and acquire subscribers into those markets ” he said  adding that partnerships with telecom and media firms would be crucial to this.This has been its strategy in France (it’s largest market) with Orange  as well as with its new deal with RTL in Germany.He said this strategy for growth is the same in the UK too  where Deezer is “having discussions” about what this looks like.Although shares have plunged over 25 per cent since Deezer first listed  Rougeot backed the company’s ambitions to become cash profitable in the coming years  citing market penetration across the world and new partnerships as the driver of this.The firm has already set out a top line revenue goal of €1bn by 2025  almost double 2021’s figures.,neutral,0.03,0.88,0.09,negative,0.03,0.22,0.75,True,English,"['Deezer CFO', 'Subscribers', 'video', 'music', 'four other major global players', 'proud French tech Unicorn', '9.6m strong subscriber base', 'vague “true music experiences', 'Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueir', 'top line revenue goal', 'other exclusive offerings', 'Ian Gavan/Getty Images', 'City A.M.', 'one subscription service', '16.9m UK households', 'original IPO plans', 'two per cent', 'music streaming sphere', 'Amazon Prime Video', 'music subscription revenue', 'Stéphane Rougeot', 'video streaming subscriptions', 'Deputy CEO', 'streaming wars', 'finish line', 'starting line', 'user base', 'ad revenue', 'Amazon Music', 'one provider', 'one streamer', 'audio streamer', 'material impact', 'recent months', 'stark contrast', 'Kantar report', 'first quarter', '1.5m accounts', 'universal appeal', 'user patterns', 'direct competition', 'many ways', 'bell-ringing ceremony', 'mounting competition', 'key differentiator', 'tiny part', 'media firms', 'largest market', 'new deal', 'coming years', 'market penetration', 'Apple Music', 'Google Music', 'SPAC listing', 'Euronext listing', 'rivals’ attempts', 'new markets', 'new partnerships', 'Deezer CFO', '25 per', 'Subscribers', 'Photo', 'users', 'consumers', 'belts', 'Paris-listed', 'something', 'Netflix', 'Disney+', 'end', 'time', 'people', 'choice', '33 hours', 'likes', 'Spotify', 'leap', 'faith', 'July', 'road', 'podcasts', 'vision', 'access', 'catalogues', 'connection', 'artists', 'fans', 'advertising', 'strategy', 'less', 'telecom', 'France', 'Orange', 'RTL', 'Germany', 'growth', 'discussions', 'shares', 'company', 'ambitions', 'cash', 'world', 'driver', 'figures', '2021']",2022-09-05,2022-09-05,cityam.com

These results were presented today in a late-breaking session at the 2022 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress  which coincides with the milestone that more than 500 000 people around the world have been treated with Dupixent across all of its approved indications.""Children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma may experience long-term persistent coughing  difficulty breathing  unpredictable asthma attacks and impaired lung function  which can lead to complications later in life as they grow and develop "" said Leonard B. Bacharier  M.D.  Professor of Pediatrics and Director of the Center for Pediatric Asthma Research  Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville  Tennessee  and principal investigator of the trial. ""An established safety profile balanced with efficacy is always a priority when treating children with a chronic disease  such as those with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. These new data further support the consistent safety profile of long-term Dupixent - which is indicated for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma - and its ability to provide sustained improvements in lung function and reductions in asthma exacerbations in children as young as 6 years old.""The results are from data in children who entered the extension trial after finishing active treatment or placebo in the Phase 3 trial (pivotal trial). Children in the extension trial were treated for up to an additional year with Dupixent  providing up to two years of data in total. Children treated with Dupixent in the extension trial experienced a:Low rate of severe asthma attacks with an average of 0.118-0.124 events per year  compared to 2.16-2.56 events per year at baseline in the pivotal trial.Sustained improvement in lung function at 52 weeks of 9.43-12.6 percentage points from baseline in the pivotal trial  measured by percent predicted FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp). FEV 1 pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age  height  sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development.(FEV pp). FEV pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age  height  sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development. Children who switched from placebo in the pivotal trial to Dupixent in the extension trial demonstrated improvement of 8.71 percentage points in lung function at two weeks.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved respiratory indications. Over the 52-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 61-68%. The most common AEs (≥5%) were nasopharyngitis (9-10%)  pharyngitis (6-10%)  upper respiratory tract infection (4-8%)  influenza (5-6%)  eosinophilia (3-6%)  allergic rhinitis (3-7%)  diarrhea (4-6%) and injection site reactions (3-7%).About Pediatric AsthmaAsthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators  these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing  wheezing and difficulty breathing. They also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks.About the LIBERTY ASTHMA EXCURSION TrialThe Phase 3  multicenter  open-label extension trial evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of Dupixent in 365 children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma who had previously participated in the placebo-controlled VOYAGE trial (the pivotal trial) when they were 6 to 11 years of age. Based on body weight  patients in the open-label extension trial received Dupixent 100 mg or 200 mg every two weeks or Dupixent 300 mg every four weeks  for 52 weeks.The primary endpoint assessed the number of patients experiencing any treatment emergent adverse event. Secondary endpoints included the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year and change from pivotal trial baseline in FEV 1 pp .About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.In the EU  Dupixent is approved in children aged 6 to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO  who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. For adolescents and adults 12 years and older with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation  patients must be inadequately controlled with high dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.
