So we shall go ahead with the banking sector reform as well. Even on that the Cabinet has given a clearance; we have mentioned it in the budget. We shall take it forward.""Earlier in May  the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had given its in-principle approval for strategic divestment along with transfer of management control of IDBI Bank. It added that the extent of shareholding to be divested by the Centre and LIC shall be ""decided at the time of structuring of the transaction in consultation with the central bank"".LIC (as promoter) and the Centre (as co-promoter) together hold more than 94 percent of IDBI Bank (49.24 percent and 45.48 percent respectively).The LIC board passed a resolution to reduce stake in IDBI Bank through divestment  while the government envisages strategic stake sale with intent to relinquish management control.While presenting the budget on February 1 this year  Sitharaman had announced that the government has approved a policy of strategic divestment of public sector enterprises that will provide a clear roadmap for divestment in all non-strategic and strategic sectors.

Holders of ordinary shares who have validly submitted US dollars  euros or pounds sterling currency elections by August 26  2022 will be entitled to a dividend of US$0.25  €0.2499 or 21.57p per ordinary share  respectively.Absent any valid election to the contrary  persons holding their ordinary shares through Euroclear Nederland will receive their dividends in euros at the euro rate per ordinary share shown above. Absent any valid election to the contrary  shareholders (both holding in certificated and uncertificated form (CREST members)) and persons holding their shares through the Shell Corporate Nominee will receive their dividends in pounds sterling  at the pound sterling rate per ordinary share shown above.Euro and pounds sterling dividends payable in cash have been converted from US dollars based on an average of market exchange rates over the three dealing days from August 31 to September 2  2022. This dividend will be payable on September 19  2022 to those members whose names were on the Register of Members on August 12  2022.Taxation - cash dividendWith Shell’s tax residence moved to the UK  dividends paid to shareholders on their ordinary shares will not attract Dutch dividend withholding tax. This means that holders of the former A shares receive their dividends in full as Dutch dividend withholding tax is no longer withheld on these dividends. Holders of the former B shares receive their dividends directly from Shell as these dividends will no longer be paid through the Dividend Access Mechanism.If you are uncertain as to the tax treatment of any dividends you should consult your tax advisor.Story continuesNoteA different currency election date may apply to shareholders holding shares in a securities account with a bank or financial institution ultimately holding through Euroclear Nederland. This may also apply to other shareholders who do not hold their shares either directly on the Register of Members or in the corporate sponsored nominee arrangement. Shareholders can contact their broker  financial intermediary  bank or financial institution for the election deadline that applies.EnquiriesShell Media RelationsInternational +44 (0) 207 934 5550Americas +1 832 337 4355CAUTIONARY NOTEThe companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  September 5  2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon footprintAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity”  which include Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” or “Net Carbon Intensity” are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

It leverages the advantages of harnessing NK cell effector functions against cancer cells and also provides proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells.Our latest innovation  the tetra-specific ANKET molecule  is the first NK cell engager technology to engage activating receptors (NKp46 and CD16)  a tumor antigen and an interleukin-2 receptor (via an IL-2 variant  IL-2v) via a single molecule.About Monalizumab:Monalizumab is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.NKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E  cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Monalizumab may reestablish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells  and may enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies1.The ongoing development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in various combination strategies in different malignancies  including  in early lung cancer  the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 study in adults with locally advanced (Stage III)  unresectable NSCLC  who have not progressed following platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy  and the Phase 2 NeoCOAST-2 study in the neoadjuvant early-stage setting of NSCLC.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of Natural Killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

September 5  2022. Results from a Phase 3 open-label extension trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent® (dupilumab) as a maintenance therapy when added to other asthma medications was consistent for up to two years in children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with evidence of type 2 inflammation. These results were presented today in a late-breaking session at the 2022 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress  which coincides with the milestone that more than 500 000 people around the world have been treated with Dupixent in its approved indications.Leonard B. Bacharier  M.D.Professor of Pediatrics  Director of the Center for Pediatric Asthma Research  Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital  Vanderbilt University Medical Center“Children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma may experience long-term persistent coughing  difficulty breathing  unpredictable asthma attacks and impaired lung function  which can lead to complications later in life as they grow and develop. An established safety profile balanced with efficacy is always a priority when treating children with a chronic disease  such as those with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. These new data further support the consistent safety profile of long-term Dupixent - which is indicated for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma - and its ability to provide sustained improvements in lung function and reductions in asthma exacerbations in children as young as 6 years old.”Story continuesThe results are from data in children who entered the extension trial after finishing active treatment or placebo in the Phase 3 trial (pivotal trial). Children in the extension trial were treated for up to an additional year with Dupixent  providing up to two years of data in total. Children treated with Dupixent in the extension trial experienced a:Low rate of severe asthma attacks with an average of 0.118-0.124 events per year  compared to 2.16-2.56 events per year at baseline in the pivotal trial.Sustained improvement in lung function at 52 weeks of 9.43-12.6 percentage points from baseline in the pivotal trial  measured by percent predicted FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp). FEV1pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age  height  sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development. Children who switched from placebo in the pivotal trial to Dupixent in the extension trial demonstrated improvement of 8.71 percentage points in lung function at two weeks.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved respiratory indications. Over the 52-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 61-68%. The most common AEs (≥5%) were nasopharyngitis (9-10%)  pharyngitis (6-10%)  upper respiratory tract infection (4-8%)  influenza (5-6%)  eosinophilia (3-6%)  allergic rhinitis (3-7%)  diarrhea (4-6%) and injection site reactions (3-7%).About Pediatric AsthmaAsthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators  these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing  wheezing and difficulty breathing. They also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks.About the LIBERTY ASTHMA EXCURSION TrialThe Phase 3  multicenter  open-label extension trial evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of Dupixent in 365 children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma who had previously participated in the placebo-controlled VOYAGE trial (the pivotal trial) when they were 6 to 11 years of age. Patients in the open-label extension trial received Dupixent 100 mg or 200 mg every two weeks or Dupixent 300 mg every four weeks  based on body weight  for 52 weeks.The primary endpoint assessed the number of patients experiencing any treatment emergent adverse event. Secondary endpoints included the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year and change from pivotal trial baseline in FEV 1 pp .About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.In the EU  Dupixent is approved in children aged 6 to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO  who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. For adolescents and adults 12 years and older with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation  patients must be inadequately controlled with high dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced results from a Phase 3 open-label extension trial demonstrating the efficacy and...,"Results from the longest global Phase 3 open-label extension trial in this age group in asthma show sustained improvement in lung function  low rate of asthma attacks and a consistent safety profile for up to two yearsTARRYTOWN  N.Y. and PARIS  Sept. 5  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced results from a Phase 3 open-label extension trial demonstrating the efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent® (dupilumab) as a maintenance therapy when added to other asthma medications was consistent for up to two years in children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with evidence of type 2 inflammation. These results were presented today in a late-breaking session at the 2022 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress  which coincides with the milestone that more than 500 000 people around the world have been treated with Dupixent across all of its approved indications.""Children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma may experience long-term persistent coughing  difficulty breathing  unpredictable asthma attacks and impaired lung function  which can lead to complications later in life as they grow and develop "" said Leonard B. Bacharier  M.D.  Professor of Pediatrics and Director of the Center for Pediatric Asthma Research  Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville  Tennessee  and principal investigator of the trial. ""An established safety profile balanced with efficacy is always a priority when treating children with a chronic disease  such as those with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. These new data further support the consistent safety profile of long-term Dupixent - which is indicated for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma - and its ability to provide sustained improvements in lung function and reductions in asthma exacerbations in children as young as 6 years old.""Story continuesThe results are from data in children who entered the extension trial after finishing active treatment or placebo in the Phase 3 trial (pivotal trial). Children in the extension trial were treated for up to an additional year with Dupixent  providing up to two years of data in total. Children treated with Dupixent in the extension trial experienced a:Low rate of severe asthma attacks with an average of 0.118-0.124 events per year  compared to 2.16-2.56 events per year at baseline in the pivotal trial.Sustained improvement in lung function at 52 weeks of 9.43-12.6 percentage points from baseline in the pivotal trial  measured by percent predicted FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp). FEV 1 pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age  height  sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved respiratory indications. Over the 52-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 61-68%. The most common AEs (≥5%) were nasopharyngitis (9-10%)  pharyngitis (6-10%)  upper respiratory tract infection (4-8%)  influenza (5-6%)  eosinophilia (3-6%)  allergic rhinitis (3-7%)  diarrhea (4-6%) and injection site reactions (3-7%).About Pediatric AsthmaAsthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators  these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing  wheezing and difficulty breathing. They also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks.About the LIBERTY ASTHMA EXCURSION TrialThe Phase 3  multicenter  open-label extension trial evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of Dupixent in 365 children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma who had previously participated in the placebo-controlled VOYAGE trial (the pivotal trial) when they were 6 to 11 years of age. Based on body weight  patients in the open-label extension trial received Dupixent 100 mg or 200 mg every two weeks or Dupixent 300 mg every four weeks  for 52 weeks.The primary endpoint assessed the number of patients experiencing any treatment emergent adverse event. Secondary endpoints included the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year and change from pivotal trial baseline in FEV 1 pp .About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.In the EU  Dupixent is approved in children aged 6 to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO  who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. For adolescents and adults 12 years and older with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation  patients must be inadequately controlled with high dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis under 18 years of age.to treat adults and children 12 years of age and older  who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg)  with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with eosinophilic esophagitis under 12 years of age and who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT®.Before using DUPIXENT  tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions  including if you:have eye problems.have a parasitic (helminth) infection.are scheduled to receive any vaccinations.

Stéphane Rougeot  who is also CFO of the newly Paris-listed firm  said the audio streamer hadn’t seen any “material impact” to its subscriber base  with churn actually down in recent months.He called the music streaming sphere “very different” to video  stating that users were likely to subscribe to just one provider  and therefore not be forced to decide between cutting one streamer over another: something that stands in stark contrast to the streaming wars that has raged between Netflix  Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video.Earlier this year  a Kantar report found that 16.9m UK households had at least one subscription service at the end of the first quarter. It also found that 1.5m accounts were cancelled during this time too.“Some people may not have a choice  but we think it is more unlikely that people will cut this [music] ” Rougeot told City A.M  adding that music was the “most engaging” as it had universal appeal: Deezer reckons subscribers listen to 33 hours of music a month  with user patterns wide and varied.Despite being in direct competition with the likes of Apple Music and Spotify  Deezer took the leap of faith earlier this year and went back public via a SPAC listing.Rougeot told City A.M. that the Euronext listing  which valued the firm at $1.1bn  was both the “finish line and in many ways the starting line” for Deezer.“As a proud French tech Unicorn  going public in Paris for us was really important ” Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueira said at the bell-ringing ceremony in July.However  the road to listing has been long and winding for Deezer  having backtracked in 2015 from original IPO plans  and facing mounting competition from the four other major global players ever since: Apple Music  Google Music  Amazon Music and Spotify.Rougeot said the key differentiator for Deezer was that it is “focused on music and just on music”  pushing back against rivals’ attempts to push into podcasts and other exclusive offerings.The vision is therefore quite idealistic. “We want more than just access to catalogues. We want to allow users to enjoy ‘true music experiences’ and to strengthen the connection between artists and fans ” Rougeot said  dismissing any plans that it would dabble in podcasts.Instead  Deezer is focusing on building undeniably vague “true music experiences”  for its 9.6m strong subscriber base.Unlike its rivals  advertising also represents a tiny part of the firm’s strategy  making up less than two per cent of revenue in 2021.“The goal is to grow music subscription revenue – not trying to expand user base or ad revenue. We want to grow in new markets and acquire subscribers into those markets ” he said  adding that partnerships with telecom and media firms would be crucial to this.This has been its strategy in France (it’s largest market) with Orange  as well as with its new deal with RTL in Germany.He said this strategy for growth is the same in the UK too  where Deezer is “having discussions” about what this looks like.Although shares have plunged over 25 per cent since Deezer first listed  Rougeot backed the company’s ambitions to become cash profitable in the coming years  citing market penetration across the world and new partnerships as the driver of this.The firm has already set out a top line revenue goal of €1bn by 2025  almost double 2021’s figures.,neutral,0.03,0.88,0.09,negative,0.03,0.22,0.75,True,English,"['Deezer CFO', 'Subscribers', 'video', 'music', 'four other major global players', 'proud French tech Unicorn', '9.6m strong subscriber base', 'vague “true music experiences', 'Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueira', 'top line revenue goal', 'other exclusive offerings', 'Ian Gavan/Getty Images', 'City A.M.', 'one subscription service', '16.9m UK households', 'original IPO plans', 'two per cent', 'music streaming sphere', 'Amazon Prime Video', 'music subscription revenue', 'Stéphane Rougeot', 'video streaming subscriptions', 'Deputy CEO', 'streaming wars', 'finish line', 'starting line', 'user base', 'ad revenue', 'Amazon Music', 'one provider', 'one streamer', 'audio streamer', 'material impact', 'recent months', 'stark contrast', 'Kantar report', 'first quarter', '1.5m accounts', 'universal appeal', 'user patterns', 'direct competition', 'many ways', 'bell-ringing ceremony', 'mounting competition', 'key differentiator', 'tiny part', 'media firms', 'largest market', 'new deal', 'coming years', 'market penetration', 'Apple Music', 'Google Music', 'SPAC listing', 'Euronext listing', 'rivals’ attempts', 'new markets', 'new partnerships', 'Deezer CFO', '25 per', 'Subscribers', 'Photo', 'users', 'consumers', 'belts', 'Paris-listed', 'something', 'Netflix', 'Disney+', 'end', 'time', 'people', 'choice', '33 hours', 'likes', 'Spotify', 'leap', 'faith', 'July', 'road', 'podcasts', 'vision', 'access', 'catalogues', 'connection', 'artists', 'fans', 'advertising', 'strategy', 'less', 'telecom', 'France', 'Orange', 'RTL', 'Germany', 'growth', 'discussions', 'shares', 'company', 'ambitions', 'cash', 'world', 'driver', 'figures', '2021']",2022-09-05,2022-09-06,cityam.com

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced results from a Phase 3 open-label extension trial demonstrating the efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent® (dupilumab) as a maintenance therapy when added to other asthma medications was consistent for up to two years in children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with evidence of type 2 inflammation. These results were presented today in a late-breaking session at the 2022 European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress  which coincides with the milestone that more than 500 000 people around the world have been treated with Dupixent across all of its approved indications.""Children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma may experience long-term persistent coughing  difficulty breathing  unpredictable asthma attacks and impaired lung function  which can lead to complications later in life as they grow and develop "" said Leonard B. Bacharier  M.D.  Professor of Pediatrics and Director of the Center for Pediatric Asthma Research  Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville  Tennessee  and principal investigator of the trial. ""An established safety profile balanced with efficacy is always a priority when treating children with a chronic disease  such as those with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. These new data further support the consistent safety profile of long-term Dupixent - which is indicated for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid dependent asthma - and its ability to provide sustained improvements in lung function and reductions in asthma exacerbations in children as young as 6 years old.""The results are from data in children who entered the extension trial after finishing active treatment or placebo in the Phase 3 trial (pivotal trial). Children in the extension trial were treated for up to an additional year with Dupixent  providing up to two years of data in total. Children treated with Dupixent in the extension trial experienced a:Low rate of severe asthma attacks with an average of 0.118-0.124 events per year  compared to 2.16-2.56 events per year at baseline in the pivotal trial.Sustained improvement in lung function at 52 weeks of 9.43-12.6 percentage points from baseline in the pivotal trial  measured by percent predicted FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp). FEV 1 pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age  height  sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development.(FEV pp). FEV pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age  height  sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development. Children who switched from placebo in the pivotal trial to Dupixent in the extension trial demonstrated improvement of 8.71 percentage points in lung function at two weeks.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved respiratory indications. Over the 52-week treatment period  the overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 61-68%. The most common AEs (≥5%) were nasopharyngitis (9-10%)  pharyngitis (6-10%)  upper respiratory tract infection (4-8%)  influenza (5-6%)  eosinophilia (3-6%)  allergic rhinitis (3-7%)  diarrhea (4-6%) and injection site reactions (3-7%).About Pediatric AsthmaAsthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators  these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing  wheezing and difficulty breathing. They also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks.About the LIBERTY ASTHMA EXCURSION TrialThe Phase 3  multicenter  open-label extension trial evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of Dupixent in 365 children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma who had previously participated in the placebo-controlled VOYAGE trial (the pivotal trial) when they were 6 to 11 years of age. Based on body weight  patients in the open-label extension trial received Dupixent 100 mg or 200 mg every two weeks or Dupixent 300 mg every four weeks  for 52 weeks.The primary endpoint assessed the number of patients experiencing any treatment emergent adverse event. Secondary endpoints included the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year and change from pivotal trial baseline in FEV 1 pp .About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  as well as investigational diseases such as prurigo nodularis.In the EU  Dupixent is approved in children aged 6 to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised FeNO  who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment. For adolescents and adults 12 years and older with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation  patients must be inadequately controlled with high dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals around the world for use in in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP or EoE in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in the European Union and Japan.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies.

Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including prurigo nodularis  pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritis of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

I think global situation changed a lot since I made that statement in the 2020 bu…","Even though the government is yet to make up its mind on inclusion of G-Secs (Government Securities) in global bond indices  Wall Street brokerage Morgan Stanley expects indices major JP Morgan to make an announcement in this regard as early as next week. On Monday finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told an industry gathering that the 2020 budget proposal on allowing bond inclusion in international indices could not move forward as the fund flows did not meet the desired levels  due to many reasons including the Covid pandemic.Without offering any details like a timeline or the tax and stamp duty breaks that investors were demanding  Sitharaman said: ""I don't know whether we're holding it back or not. I think global situation changed a lot since I made that statement in the 2020 budget.""Global fund flows have not been as big as we wanted it to be primarily due to other reasons. So it'll come to its natural  logical conclusion soon.""According to the RBI data  G-Secs outstanding stood at Rs 84.7 lakh crore  or over USD 1 trillion  as of end-June 2022 and the corporate bonds outstanding at Rs 40.4 lakh crore.In a note on Tuesday  Morgan Stanley strategists Min Dai  Madan Reddy and Gek Teng Khoo said that ""now we believe that there is a very good chance that JP Morgan will announce the index inclusion of India 's bond market in mid-September.""They also said they expect the inclusion to drive in as much as USD 30 billion into the country next fiscal alone  even though there is no clarity on the tax breaks  which is a necessary condition for inclusion.Explaining how they arrived at USD 30 billon inflows  they said G-Secs Asset Under Management (AUM) that is tracking the GBI-EM is about USD 300 billion. Hence  10 per cent weight for India in the index will attract USD 30 billion of inflows versus current foreign ownership of USD 17.8 billion. The monthly inflows of USD 3 billion would start in Q4FY23  spanning over 10 months until Q2FY24  they said.Currently  there are 20 bonds in the FAR (Fully Accessible Route) list with total outstanding of USD 263 billion  and they are eligible for actual inclusion.The report assumes that monthly increase of the FAR list bonds is USD 10 billion in the next 12 months  which means that eligible bonds will be about USD 360 billion in second half (H2) of 2023  making it the second-biggest bond market after China in the index.As a result  India would join the 10 per cent club with China and Indonesia while the other 10 per cent countries -- Thailand  Malaysia  Brazil  Mexico and South Africa -- will see their weight dropping. The biggest fall will be for Thailand (-1.4 per cent)  Poland (-1.4 per cent)  South Africa (-1.3 per cent)  the Czech Republic (-1 per cent) and Brazil (-0.8 per cent).The government has to make some changes in capital gains tax norms to address the questions from Euroclear  which is a necessary condition for the index inclusion.Additional forex inflows would help shore up current account and balance of payments  which are facing huge headwinds this fiscal due to crude price rise and increase in other imports.Consensus view is that the Q2 CAD (Current Account Deficit) will jump to 5 per cent from 3.6 per cent in Q1  which will be the highest CAD since Q3FY12 and close the FY23 at 3.5 per cent as they expect crude and commodity prices to soften from the second half of the fiscal.The Morgan Stanley strategists see two key takeaways from the inclusion: the index team now has more incentive to include India on the back of Russia 's exclusion; and most GBI-EM investors either support or don't object to the inclusion.They also expect India to achieve 10 per cent in the GBI-EM index once inclusion is completed at the expense of Thailand  Poland  South Africa  the Czech Republic and Brazil.Investors need a long lead time for the inclusion  hence we expect the actual inclusion to happen in Q3 of 2023. We believe that Euroclear is still achievable ahead of the actual inclusion.Stating that 2022 budget disappointed a bit on the inclusion side  they said ""after our visit to India in July and talking to officials  we felt that the government is still open and keen to have the index inclusion"". They also admit that the inclusion per se doesn't trigger inflows but it can improve sentiment.In the index review last October  India was put on the watch list as 60 per cent of investors supported the decision.According to the report  JPM has already said that India needed to improve market access  trading and settlement to achieve index inclusion and said achieving Euroclear will improve market access significantly.""While India made some progress in the past 10 months  we don't feel that this is material enough to change the overall assessment."" But what happened in February/ March changed the dynamics  as Russia  with close to 8 per cent weight  was excluded from the index. The result is that now seven countries in the GBI-EM index have a 10 per cent weight: China  Indonesia  Thailand  Malaysia  Brazil  Mexico and South Africa  making the index quite unbalanced  they argued.The GBI-EM index now has 20 countries. This means that the other 13 countries share the remaining 30 per cent  which never happened before as in the past  the top seven countries accounted for an average of 64 per cent of the index. Even back in 2016 when the top seven of the 15 countries accounted for 68 per cent.Since exclusion of Russia has made the index more concentrated and unbalanced  JPM has more incentive to include India  even without Euroclear  as long as GBI-EM investors don't object to that  they said.They said their in-house survey shows that 60 per cent of real money investors are either fully ready for index inclusion or almost ready  while their proprietary GBI-EM positioning tracker shows that investors have been actively managing India as an off-benchmark holding  although they have been cutting both duration and forex risks in the past few months.",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.06,0.19,0.75,True,English,"['global bond index', 'JP Morgan', 'next week', 'Morgan Stanley', 'G-Secs', 'close to 8 per cent weight', 'Fully Accessible Route) list', 'finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman', 'capital gains tax norms', 'The Morgan Stanley strategists', 'other 10 per cent countries', 'Wall Street brokerage', 'natural, logical conclusion', 'Rs 84.7 lakh crore', 'Rs 40.4 lakh crore', 'Gek Teng Khoo', 'two key takeaways', 'long lead time', 'current foreign ownership', '10 per cent weight', 'stamp duty breaks', '10 per cent club', 'major JP Morgan', 'Current Account Deficit', 'Additional forex inflows', 'crude price rise', 'Global fund flows', 'The GBI-EM index', 'biggest bond market', 'global bond indices', 'FAR list bonds', 'most GBI-EM investors', 'USD 30 billon inflows', '5 per cent', '3.6 per cent', '60 per cent', 'weight dropping', 'watch list', 'seven countries', 'tax breaks', 'global situation', 'other reasons', 'other imports', 'biggest fall', 'market access', 'bond inclusion', 'next week', 'industry gathering', 'international indices', 'many reasons', 'Covid pandemic', 'RBI data', 'corporate bonds', 'Min Dai', 'Madan Reddy', 'good chance', 'necessary condition', 'monthly inflows', 'eligible bonds', 'second half', 'South Africa', 'Czech Republic', 'huge headwinds', 'Consensus view', 'Q2 CAD', 'highest CAD', 'commodity prices', 'overall assessment', 'index team', 'index review', 'next 12 months', 'past 10 months', 'actual inclusion', 'inclusion side', 'monthly increase', '2020 budget proposal', 'G-Secs Asset', 'index inclusion', 'Government Securities', '1.3 per', '20 bonds', '2022 budget', 'mind', 'announcement', 'regard', 'Monday', 'levels', 'details', 'timeline', 'statement', 'end-June', 'note', 'Tuesday', 'India', 'mid-September', 'country', 'clarity', 'Management', 'AUM', 'Q4FY23', 'Q2FY24', 'total', 'outstanding', 'report', 'China', 'result', 'Indonesia', 'Thailand', 'Malaysia', 'Brazil', 'Mexico', 'Poland', 'changes', 'questions', 'Euroclear', 'balance', 'payments', 'Q3FY12', 'fiscal', 'incentive', 'back', 'Russia', 'exclusion', 'expense', 'visit', 'July', 'officials', 'sentiment', 'decision', 'JPM', 'trading', 'settlement', 'progress', 'March', 'dynamics']",2022-09-06,2022-09-06,economictimes.indiatimes.com

It is for this reason that all resolutions at the Annual General Meeting are voted on by way of a poll rather than a show of hands  as this allows the votes of all shareholders to be counted. Shareholders (or their duly appointed proxies) attending the Annual General Meeting will still have the opportunity to ask questions and vote on each resolution.You will find set out at the end of this document a notice convening the Annual General Meeting of the Company for 4.30 p.m. (Malaysian Time) on 29 September 2022  at which resolutions will be proposed:to receive and adopt the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts for the financial year ended on 31 March 2022  and the Directors’ Report and the Independent Auditors’ Report on those accounts; to reappoint  as a Director  Shailen Popatlal  who  in accordance with the Articles  is required to retire by having been appointed since the law annual general meeting and  being eligible  offers himself for reappointment; to reappoint  as a Director  Simon James Retter who  in accordance with the Articles is required to retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting and  being eligible  offers himself for reappointment; to reappoint  as a Director  Dr Md. Khussairiee Ahmad who  in accordance with the Articles is required to retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting and  being eligible  offers himself for reappointment; to re-appoint Shipleys LLP as the auditors of the Company until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting and to authorise the Directors to determine the level of the remuneration of the auditors; to grant the Directors authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company; and to disapply the statutory pre-emption rights for certain shares; to grant the Directors authority to purchase own shares;Resolutions 1 and 5 are self-explanatory. Information on the other resolutions is provided below. Resolutions 1 to 6 are ordinary resolutions which require to be passed with the approval of a simple majority of shareholders present and voting in person or by proxy or authorised representative. On a show of hands each shareholder so present has one vote  but should a poll be demanded each such shareholder has one vote for each share held by him or her. Resolutions 7 and 8 are special resolutions that require to be passed with the approval of 75% of shareholders  attending the meeting and entitled to vote. As described above the voting may be by a show of hands or by poll.Resolution 6: Authority to issue sharesResolution 6 seeks an authority to allot shares  subject to the normal pre-emption rights reserved to shareholders contained in the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”). The Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) recommends that a company seek an annual authority to allot up to a third of their issued share capital; however  the ABI have issued further guidelines permitting a company to seek authority to allot an additional third of their issued share capital  provided such additional third is reserved for fully pre-emptive rights issues of equity shares. Resolution 6 reflects the ABI’s recommendations.Resolution 7: Disapplication of pre-emption rightsResolution 7 covers the granting of a waiver of pre-emption rights over the number of shares in resolution 6  as applicable  and up to 20 per cent of the shares currently in issue for cash. The Directors consider it important to renew this authority. In addition  the resolution allows the disapplication of pre-emption rights to deal with the possibility of fractional entitlements and legal or regulatory restrictions to a share issue.Resolution 8: Authority to Purchase Own SharesResolution 8 seeks an authority  proposed as a special resolution  to make purchases up to a maximum of 15 000 000 ordinary shares (being approximately 10% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the Latest Practicable Date) and specifies the maximum and minimum purchase prices for the shares. Any shares purchased by the Company under this authority would be cancelled or held as treasury shares. A maximum of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital may be held as treasury shares.Action to be takenA form of proxy for use at the Annual General Meeting is enclosed. Shareholders are advised to complete and return the form of proxy in accordance with the instructions printed on it so as to arrive at the Company’s registered office at MSP Corporate Services Limited at Eastcastle House  27/28 Eastcastle Street  London W1W 8DH  United Kingdom  as soon as possible  but in any event no later than 4.30 p.m. Malaysian time (9.30 a.m. BST) on 27 September 2022. The return of a form of proxy or the electronic appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending and voting at the Annual General Meeting if you so wish.RecommendationThe Directors consider that the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders  and they recommend shareholders to vote in favour of the resolutions.Yours faithfully ______________________Shailen PopatlalChairman6 September 2022Notice ofAnnual General meetingNOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN THAT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE SHAREHOLDERS OF HRC WORLD PLC (THE “COMPANY”) WILL BE HELD AT SUITE 2B-25-2  25TH FLOOR  BLOCK 2B  PLAZA SENTRAL  JALAN STESEN 5  50470 KUALA LUMPUR  MALAYSIA ON THURSDAY 29 SEPTEMBER 2022 AT 4.30 P.M.

As a member of the Company you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend  speak and vote on your behalf at a general meeting of the Company.2. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting to represent you. To appoint as your proxy a person other than the Chairman of the meeting  insert their full name in the box on your proxy form. If you sign and return your proxy form with no name inserted in the box  the Chairman of the meeting will be deemed to be your proxy. Where you appoint as your proxy someone other than the Chairman  you are responsible for ensuring that they attend the meeting and are aware of your voting intentions. If you wish your proxy to make any comments on your behalf  you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman and give them the relevant instructions directly.3. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. In the event of a conflict between a blank proxy form and a proxy form which states the number of shares to which it applies  the specific proxy form shall be counted first  regardless of whether it was sent or received before or after the blank proxy form  and any remaining shares in respect of which you are the registered holder will be apportioned to the blank proxy form. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy you must complete a separate Form of Proxy for each proxy or  if appointing multiple proxies electronically  follow the instructions given on the relevant electronic facility. Members can copy their original Form of Proxy  or additional Forms of Proxy can be obtained from MSP Corporate Services Limited at Eastcastle House  27/28 Eastcastle St  London W1W 8DH  United Kingdom or Company’s website (www.hrcplc.co.uk)4. The return of a completed proxy form  other such instrument or any CREST proxy instruction (as described in note 13 below) does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person  your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.5. To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions mark the appropriate box on your proxy form with an ‘X’. To abstain from voting on a resolution  select the relevant “Vote withheld” box. A vote withheld is not a vote in law  which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting indication is given  your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting.6.

In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).8. In the case of a member which is a company  your proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by a duly authorised officer of the Company or an attorney for the Company.9. Any power of attorney or any other authority under which your proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be included with your proxy form.10. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment  the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.11. You may not use any electronic address provided in your proxy form to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.12. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider should refer to their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent  Computershare Investor Services (Jersey) Limited (CREST Participant ID: 3RA50)  no later than 48 hours  excluding any day that is not a business day  before the time appointed for the meeting.

9531,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/jp-morgan-may-include-g-secs-in-global-bond-index-as-early-as-next-week-122090601106_1.html,'JP Morgan may include G-Secs in global bond index as early as next week',Even though govt is yet to make up its mind on inclusion of G-Secs in global bond indices  Morgan Stanley expects indices major JP Morgan to make an announcement in this regard as early as next week,"Even though the government is yet to make up its mind on inclusion of G-Secs (Government Securities) in global bond indices  brokerage expects indices major to make an announcement in this regard as early as next week.On Monday finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told an industry gathering that the 2020 budget proposal on allowing bond inclusion in indices could not move forward as the fund flows did not meet the desired levels  due to many reasons including the Covid pandemic.Without offering any details like a timeline or the tax and stamp duty breaks that investors were demanding  Sitharaman said: ""I don't know whether we're holding it back or not. I think global situation changed a lot since I made that statement in the 2020 budget.""Global fund flows have not been as big as we wanted it to be primarily due to other reasons. So it'll come to its natural  logical conclusion soon.""According to the RBI data  G-Secs outstanding stood at Rs 84.7 lakh crore  or over USD 1 trillion  as of end-June 2022 and the corporate bonds outstanding at Rs 40.4 lakh crore.In a note on Tuesday  strategists Min Dai  Madan Reddy and Gek Teng Khoo said that ""now we believe that there is a very good chance that will announce the index inclusion of India's in mid-September.""They also said they expect the inclusion to drive in as much as USD 30 billion into the country next fiscal alone  even though there is no clarity on the tax breaks  which is a necessary condition for inclusion.Explaining how they arrived at USD 30 billon inflows  they said G-Secs Asset Under Management (AUM) that is tracking the GBI-EM is about USD 300 billion. Hence  10 per cent weight for India in the index will attract USD 30 billion of inflows versus current foreign ownership of USD 17.8 billion. The monthly inflows of USD 3 billion would start in Q4FY23  spanning over 10 months until Q2FY24  they said.Currently  there are 20 bonds in the FAR (Fully Accessible Route) list with total outstanding of USD 263 billion  and they are eligible for actual inclusion.The report assumes that monthly increase of the FAR list bonds is USD 10 billion in the next 12 months  which means that eligible bonds will be about USD 360 billion in second half (H2) of 2023  making it the second-biggest after China in the index.As a result  India would join the 10 per cent club with China and Indonesia while the other 10 per cent countries -- Thailand  Malaysia  Brazil  Mexico and South Africa -- will see their weight dropping. The biggest fall will be for Thailand (-1.4 per cent)  Poland (-1.4 per cent)  South Africa (-1.3 per cent)  the Czech Republic (-1 per cent) and Brazil (-0.8 per cent).The government has to make some changes in capital gains tax norms to address the questions from Euroclear  which is a necessary condition for the index inclusion.Additional forex inflows would help shore up current account and balance of payments  which are facing huge headwinds this fiscal due to crude price rise and increase in other imports.Consensus view is that the Q2 CAD (Current Account Deficit) will jump to 5 per cent from 3.6 per cent in Q1  which will be the highest CAD since Q3FY12 and close the FY23 at 3.5 per cent as they expect crude and commodity prices to soften from the second half of the fiscal.The strategists see two key takeaways from the inclusion: the index team now has more incentive to include India on the back of Russia's exclusion; and most GBI-EM investors either support or don't object to the inclusion.They also expect India to achieve 10 per cent in the GBI-EM index once inclusion is completed at the expense of Thailand  Poland  South Africa  the Czech Republic and Brazil.Investors need a long lead time for the inclusion  hence we expect the actual inclusion to happen in Q3 of 2023. We believe that Euroclear is still achievable ahead of the actual inclusion.Stating that 2022 budget disappointed a bit on the inclusion side  they said ""after our visit to India in July and talking to officials  we felt that the government is still open and keen to have the index inclusion"". They also admit that the inclusion per se doesn't trigger inflows but it can improve sentiment.In the index review last October  India was put on the watch list as 60 per cent of investors supported the decision.According to the report  JPM has already said that India needed to improve market access  trading and settlement to achieve index inclusion and said achieving Euroclear will improve market access significantly.""While India made some progress in the past 10 months  we don't feel that this is material enough to change the overall assessment."" But what happened in February/ March changed the dynamics  as Russia  with close to 8 per cent weight  was excluded from the index. The result is that now seven countries in the GBI-EM index have a 10 per cent weight: China  Indonesia  Thailand  Malaysia  Brazil  Mexico and South Africa  making the index quite unbalanced  they argued.The GBI-EM index now has 20 countries. This means that the other 13 countries share the remaining 30 per cent  which never happened before as in the past  the top seven countries accounted for an average of 64 per cent of the index. Even back in 2016 when the top seven of the 15 countries accounted for 68 per cent.Since exclusion of Russia has made the index more concentrated and unbalanced  JPM has more incentive to include India  even without Euroclear  as long as GBI-EM investors don't object to that  they said.They said their in-house survey shows that 60 per cent of real money investors are either fully ready for index inclusion or almost ready  while their proprietary GBI-EM positioning tracker shows that investors have been actively managing India as an off-benchmark holding  although they have been cutting both duration and forex risks in the past few months.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.06,0.2,0.74,True,English,"['global bond index', 'JP Morgan', 'next week', 'G-Secs', 'close to 8 per cent weight', 'Fully Accessible Route) list', 'finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman', 'capital gains tax norms', 'other 10 per cent countries', 'natural, logical conclusion', 'Rs 84.7 lakh crore', 'Rs 40.4 lakh crore', 'Gek Teng Khoo', 'two key takeaways', 'long lead time', 'current foreign ownership', 'stamp duty breaks', '10 per cent weight', 'Current Account Deficit', '10 per cent club', 'Additional forex inflows', 'crude price rise', 'Global fund flows', 'USD 30 billon inflows', 'FAR list bonds', 'The GBI-EM index', 'global bond indices', 'most GBI-EM investors', 'weight dropping', '5 per cent', '3.6 per cent', '60 per cent', 'watch list', 'tax breaks', 'other 13 countries', 'global situation', 'other reasons', 'other imports', 'seven countries', 'next week', 'industry gathering', 'many reasons', 'Covid pandemic', 'RBI data', 'corporate bonds', 'Min Dai', 'Madan Reddy', 'good chance', 'necessary condition', 'monthly inflows', 'eligible bonds', 'second half', 'South Africa', 'biggest fall', 'Czech Republic', 'huge headwinds', 'Consensus view', 'Q2 CAD', 'highest CAD', 'commodity prices', 'market access', 'overall assessment', 'bond inclusion', 'index team', 'index review', 'next 12 months', 'past 10 months', 'monthly increase', 'actual inclusion', 'inclusion side', '2020 budget proposal', 'G-Secs Asset', 'Government Securities', 'index inclusion', '20 countries', '20 bonds', '2022 budget', 'mind', 'brokerage', 'major', 'announcement', 'regard', 'Monday', 'levels', 'details', 'timeline', 'statement', 'end-June', 'note', 'Tuesday', 'strategists', 'India', 'mid-September', 'country', 'clarity', 'Management', 'AUM', 'Q4FY23', 'Q2FY24', 'total', 'outstanding', 'report', 'China', 'result', 'Indonesia', 'Thailand', 'Malaysia', 'Brazil', 'Mexico', 'Poland', 'changes', 'questions', 'Euroclear', 'balance', 'payments', 'Q3FY12', 'fiscal', 'incentive', 'back', 'Russia', 'exclusion', 'expense', 'visit', 'July', 'officials', 'sentiment', 'decision', 'JPM', 'trading', 'settlement', 'progress', 'March', 'dynamics', 'remai']",2022-09-06,2022-09-06,business-standard.com

This level corresponds to a stable average over the last twenty years  fluctuating between 36% in 2009 and 27% in 2021. Indeed  this key market indicator has reacted quite differently compared with how it reacted in the last major crisis that affected the global art market  the 2009 financial crisis. Back then  collectors decided to take less financial risk  whereas the health crisis of 2021 prompted buyers to switch to a new entirely dematerialized sales channel.In the first half of 2022  the market found a new balance thanks to the coexistence of two different and complementary sales channels (one physical  the other digital)  which allowed auction transactions to continue at a healthy pace reaching a historic number of 326 000 Fine Art lots in six months. In H1 2022 this volume further increased to an unprecedented intensity  despite the postponement of many auctions in China (whose turnover volume is down 53%) due to an additional wave of Covid-19.The United States (up 42% vs. H1 2021) and the UK (up 26%) have driven growth. The two powerful Anglo-Saxon markets alone accounted for exactly two-thirds of global Fine Art auction turnover. China  for its part  only accounted for 12% of global fine art auction turnover  a result that it owes in large part to Hong Kong which accounted for 70% of the value of the entire Chinese art market (including Hong Kong  Macao  and Taiwan).France continued to grow (+14%) consolidating its 4th place ahead of Germany (-5%) after a sensational performance in 2021. In addition to the presence of Christie's and Sotheby's  several Parisian auction operators posted exceptionally strong performances: Artcurial (+42%) and Aguttes (+154%)  among others. Meanwhile  The French capital is attracting a growing number of major international players like David Zwirner  while the Gagosian and Continua galleries have opened new spaces in France. Paris is delighted to see the upcoming arrival of Hauser & Wirth as well as the opening of a Phillips auction room. Bonhams has acquired the French house Cornette de Saint-Cyr (operating in Paris and Brussels). Lastly  the Art Basel company will henceforth be the official organizer of the international autumn art fair organized at the Grand Palais in Paris  entitled Paris+  which will replace the FIAC.Japan and Switzerland also had an excellent start to 2022 with increases of 74% and 145% in their respective auction turnover totals. Without directly competing with Hong Kong (which still weighs seven times more)  Tokyo is positioning itself on the Asian continent as a hub for major contemporary artists  including Andy Warhol  Yoshitomo Nara  Yayoi Kusama  but also young talents like Mr Doodle and Ayako Rokkaku (born in 1982)  whose auction sales have already exceeded $18.6 million this year. For its part  Switzerland is continuing to carve out a place for itself in the Post-Impressionist and Modern Art market  with sales of important works by Ferdinand Hodler  Alberto Giacometti  and Marc Chagall.Ferdinand Hodler  Der Brienzersee von Breitlauenen aus (1906); sold for CHF 2 875 000 (~$3 million) on 17 June 2022 by Galerie Kornfeld in BernPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1891852/Artmarket_Ferdinand_Hodler.jpghttps://www.artprice.com/artist/13632/ferdinand-hodler/painting/27034374/der-brienzersee-von-breitlauenen- ausTRENDS: NFTs AND ULTRA CONTEMPORARY ARTPropelled to center stage in March 2021 with a first public auction result at $69.4 million  NFTs (non-fungible tokens) have created something of a revolution in the art market  with a new type of work  new collectors  and a new currency.Of the 277 NFTs auctioned in H1 2022  65% sold for an average price of $47 000.

Last year  the African-American painter set a new auction record at $550 000. But on 12 May this year  Christie's proposed his painting The Sugar Shack (1976) in New York with an estimate of $150 000 - $200 000. The work finally sold for $15 275 000  more than 100 times the low estimate. In the days and weeks that followed  six more important Ernie Barnes paintings were offered at Christie's and Bonhams  and they all sold well beyond their estimates.Last year  the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama became the first female artist to enter the world's Top 10 performing artists as calculated by Artprice (all periods of creation combined). She was also the third best performing living artist of the year behind Gerhard Richter and Banksy. This year  Yayoi Kusama has repeated that performance with 208 lots sold worldwide for more than $115 million.

The reaction comes after Morgan Stanley said it sees a good chance for JP Morgan to include Indian government bonds in its index.Apparently  some indices had sought exemption from capital gains tax as a condition for listing the Government of India bonds.“The effort to list Indian bonds in international markets is on. We are happy with the inclusion of Indian bonds in the global indices  provided no change in taxation law is demanded ” a top Finance Ministry said.The official clarified that the timing of the listing completely depends upon overseas index operators (JP Morgan and Euroclear) agreeing to the centre’s terms and conditions on taxation issues. The official said that JP Morgan has not demanded any change in tax requirement  so it is likely that it will include Indian bonds anytime soon. Morgan Stanley sees a good chance of JP Morgan announcing the inclusion of G-secs on its global index.“We see a good chance that JPM will announce the inclusion in September  surprising the market.

It said that what Euroclear wants is a clarification of what capital gains tax rate to pay and how to pay it.“Hence  what is possible is that after the index inclusion announcement  both the finance ministry and the RBI will work together with Euroclear to address the outstanding issue and India could still achieve Euroclear before the actual index inclusion ” Morgan Stanley added.NEW DELHI: The government is keen on Indian bonds joining the global indices but it will not make any changes in tax laws to get bonds listed overseas  a top finance ministry official told TNIE.

Further  the data show that patients on continuous daily treatment with 50mg obefazimod during the 48 weeks maintenance trial experienced new or maintained clinical response  clinical remission  endoscopic improvement and endoscopic remission.[4]Prof. Séverine Vermeire  M.D.  Ph.D.  Head of the IBD Center at the University Hospitals Leuven  Belgium  and principal investigator of the study  said: ""As principal investigator  I am pleased that these very promising results of the phase 2b induction and 48-week maintenance study have been published in the renowned journal The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology. This validates the safety and efficacy data generated with obefazimod in the initial phase 2a study in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis  including in a patient population refractory to biologics and/or JAK inhibitor treatments. I am impatient to start the global phase 3 program in UC and confident that we can confirm the rapid onset of action and maintained efficacy of obefazimod along with its good safety profile.""Prof. Bruce Sands  M.D.  M.S.  the Dr. Burrill B. Crohn Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  New York City  NY  added[5]: ""The data generated so far with obefazimod in the phase 2a and phase 2b induction and maintenance studies gives reason to believe that this drug candidate may change the treatment paradigm for bio-naïve as well as refractory ulcerative colitis patients. The maintained efficacy signal and the good tolerability profile differentiate obefazimod from many other products on the market or in late-stage testing in UC. Further  it offers an easy once-daily oral administration. I am glad to be the lead investigator in the US for the phase 3 testing of this promising molecule.""Prof. Hartmut J. Ehrlich  M.D.  CEO of Abivax  commented: ""This publication of obefazimod phase 2b induction and maintenance data in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis patients in the Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology is a great achievement for Abivax. This is very meaningful recognition by the scientific community that obefazimod has the potential to become a safe and effective chronic treatment for UC patients  relieving symptoms and improving quality of life in the long run. Abivax's current priority is the swift start and completion of the global phase 3 program in order to support NDA and MAA review by regulatory agencies to allow obefazimod approval and availability to UC patients in need of innovative  alternative therapeutic options.""254 patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis were enrolled into the phase 2b clinical study and dosed with obefazimod within three once-daily oral treatment groups (25mg  50mg and 100mg) or placebo. 50% of these patients had inadequate response  loss of response  or intolerance to biologics and/or JAK inhibitor treatments while the other 50% were refractory to conventional treatments. Endoscopies were read centrally and blinded by independent reviewers. The baseline disease characteristics were well balanced across all dose groups of obefazimod and the placebo group. Enrolled patients suffered from longstanding UC with an overall mean disease duration of 8.05 years and 71.4% of the patients showed a severe disease profile (baseline modified Mayo Score of 7 to 9 points).At week 8 of the induction study  the primary endpoint (statistically significant reduction of Modified Mayo Score) was met with once-daily administration of obefazimod (25mg  50mg  100mg).Further  all key secondary endpoints  including endoscopic improvement  clinical remission  clinical response and the reduction of fecal calprotectin showed significant difference in patients dosed with obefazimod compared to placebo. Importantly  obefazimod also showed rapid efficacy in patients who were previously exposed to biologics and/or JAK inhibitors treatment.97.7% (217/222) of all patients who completed the phase 2b induction study  irrespective of treatments or treatment outcome during the induction phase  enrolled in the open-label maintenance study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy profile of obefazimod for up to two years.Out of these 217 patients  the 48-week data of the first 78 patients were available at the time of manuscript preparation.Meanwhile  Abivax confirmed the data of these first 78 maintenance patients and reported excellent results from the entire cohort of its phase 2b open-label maintenance study in April this year. This interim analysis after one year once-daily treatment with 50mg obefazimod included all 217 patients who enrolled into the maintenance study and the data emphasizes the capacity of obefazimod to maintain and further improve patient outcomes over time  as well as its continued favorable safety and tolerability.During the induction and the maintenance phases of the 2b study  obefazimod continued to show a good tolerability profile  confirming the data already generated in over 1 000 patients and volunteers treated with obefazimod so far.Global pivotal phase 3 clinical program with obefazimod in ulcerative colitisThe initiation of the global phase 3 clinical program with obefazimod for the treatment of moderate to severe UC is on track and the ""First-Patient-In"" is scheduled for end of September 2022.In consultation with international regulators  including the US and European regulatory agencies (FDA and EMA)  25mg and 50mg will be investigated in phase 3 for both induction and subsequent maintenance in UC.Abivax is working with IQVIA  a global premier CRO  to jointly set-up and conduct these studies across Europe  the US  Japan and other global geographies.Currently  more than 430 study sites  out of the targeted 600 sites  have already been qualified for the phase 3 trials.*****About Abivax (www.abivax.com)Abivax  a phase 3 clinical stage biotechnology company  is developing novel therapies that modulate the body's natural immune machinery to treat patients with chronic inflammatory diseases  viral infections  and cancer.

It can be accessed via the following link: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00502-3/fulltext.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “This Lancet publication is a strong scientific and developmental validation of the work that has been accomplished at Valneva. We are pleased that more detailed results on our inactivated COVID-19 vaccine are now available to the scientific and broader public health communities.”Valneva reported positive topline Phase 3 results for VLA2001 in October 20211.In August 2022  the World Health Organization issued recommendations for use of Valneva’s inactivated COVID-19 vaccine2.The Company published safety and immunogenicity data from the Phase 1/2 trial of VLA2001 in the Journal of Infection3 in June 2022.About VLA2001VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already been upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).VLA2001 is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe4 and the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in Europe for use as primary vaccination in people from 18 to 50 years of age. The vaccine was also granted conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom5 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates6 and Kingdom of Bahrain7. Valneva currently has agreements to supply VLA2001 to certain EU Member States8 and the Kingdom of Bahrain9. In August 2022  the World Health Organization (WHO) issued recommendations for use of VLA200110.

9577,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4539041-intercontinental-exchange-the-house-always-wins,Intercontinental Exchange: The House Always Wins (NYSE:ICE),Intercontinental Exchange has had a torrid year so far. Click here to read about ICE stock's valuation analysis and why rate it a Buy.,"Spencer Platt/Getty Images NewsThis has been a torrid year for Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE). Its share price declined from $133.95 at the beginning to the year  to $101.28 as of Sep. 3  2022. I have no doubt that all that ICE is a fantastic business operating in a fantastic industry. So for me the exam question is: Is $101.28 an attractive price at which to buy its shares  given that most probably a recession is about to come?I believe ICE is materially undervalued at the present  that it had a consistently excellent track record in the past  and that its long-term future prospects are brilliant. In this article I explain why.Company profileICE operates three lines of businesses: Exchanges; Fixed Income and Data Services; and Mortgage Technologies. In the Exchanges segment  ICE operates a number of regulated marketplaces for trading and clearing financial instruments  such as shares and derivatives (think the New York Stock Exchange  which it owns). In the Fixed Income and Data Services  ICE provides services such as fixed income pricing  reference data  indices  and analytics. In the Mortgage Technologies segment  ICE uses machine learning algorithms to provide streamlined and simplified solutions for mortgage lenders  which allow them to originate loans more efficiently.They have minority stakes in subsidiary companies. Among them the point of interest is Bakkt  the black sheep of the family. I will touch on it briefly later.Their main competitors are other exchanges based in the US  such as Nasdaq (NDAQ) and the CME Group (CME). They also compete against exchanges worldwide  such as the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and Euronext (OTCPK:EUXTF).Some statistics at a glance  as of close of business on Sep. 3  2022:Share price: $101.28Market cap: $57.0 billionP/E ratio: 17.0Debt / EBITDA ratio: 2.4Operating margin: 38.2%Profit margin: 23.5%Upside caseIn this section I describe why I believe ICE shares are undervalued.DCF ValuationI use the discounted cash flow method to estimate a fair value for ICE  and I find that the fair value of an ICE share is around 45% above its current price. I consider DCF appropriate to use for the valuation because in the last 10 years ICE has been profitable every year  and has paid out dividends in every year.Moreover  the amount of dividends paid has increased steadily over time. In 2021  each share paid $1.32 in dividends; in 2014  the first full year when ICE paid dividends every quarter  that was $0.13: a highly attractive CAGR of 14.2%.The DCF method gives the fair present value of a share as:V0 = D1 / (r - g)Calculating gI estimate g  the sustainable growth rate for ICE  as:g = RR x ROEMy review of sell-side analyst reports suggests that the median forward-looking return on equity (ROE) for ICE is slightly below 14%. For simplicity  I round this down and set ROE as 13%.On a trailing twelve months basis (for the avoidance of doubt  from Q3 2021 through to Q2 2022)  ICE has earnings per share of $5.97  and paid a dividend of $1.42. The retention ratio is calculated as retained earnings divided by earnings per share. In this case  I find that the retention ratio is 76.2%.This yields a sustainable dividend growth rate of 9.9%. I note that this is materially above the S&P 500's historical dividend CAGR of 6.5%  but it is materially below ICE's historical dividend CAGR (14.2%)  as well as its net profit CAGR (15.2%)--not only are exchanges profitable businesses  ICE is also nursing a number of promising ventures in the wings. Therefore  I consider 9.9% a conservative estimate of ICE's dividend growth rate.Calculating D1ICE pays dividends quarterly. Therefore  I set D1 as the sum of the four dividend payments in the next twelve months  which will occur in Sep. and Dec. 2022  and Mar. and Jun. 2023.ICE has already declared a dividend of $1.52 for the year 2022. Of this amount  they have paid half in March and June  and they will pay the other half in September and December. Therefore  I set $0.76 as first half of D1.I assume the dividend payments in March and June 2023 will grow at the sustainable growth rate of 9.9%. Therefore  I set $0.84 as second half of D1.In this case  I set D1 as $1.60.Calculating rI estimate r  my required rate of return for ICE  as:r = RFR + beta * (TMR - RFR)Since the inception of the S&P 500 in 1957  it has provided investors with an annualised total return of 11.88%. I use the most recent Effective Fed Funds Rate for which data is available (as of August 2022) of 2.33% as the risk free rate. I note that ICE's 5-year monthly equity beta is around 0.90.Therefore  I calculate the required rate of return for ICE asr = 2.44% + 0.9 * (11.88% - 2.33%) = 10.93%.For simplicity  I round up my required rate of return to 11%.Calculating V0In this case  the estimated fair value of a share is $1.60 / (11% - 9.9%) = $146.50. This is 45% above its current price of $101.28 as of Sep. 2  2022: a substantial margin of safety.I show my work in Table 1 below.Table 1: DCF valuationEPS $ [a] 5.97 Dividend in Year 0 $ [b] 1.42 Retention ratio % [c] = 1- [a]/[b] 76.2 ROE % [d] 13 Sustainable growth % [e] = [c]*[d] 9.9 Required rate of return % [f] 11.0 Dividend in Year 1 $ [g] 1.60 Fair value in Year 0 $ [h] = [g]/([f]-[e]) 146.50 Share price at valuation date $ [i] 101.28 Implied upside % [j] = [h] / [i] - 1 45 Click to enlargeEV/EBITDA ValuationAs a cross-check  I use the EV/EBITDA valuation method to estimate a fair value for ICE  and I find that the fair value of an ICE share is around 47% above its current price. I favour the DCF approach (when it is feasible) over the EV/EBITDA approach  as the method of finding suitable comparables is  in my view  neither exactly a science nor an art  but something close to black magic--highly subjective and sensitive to manipulation.Nevertheless  EV/EBITDA can be useful as a sense-check to the DCF approach. Let's take a look.I select five comparables for ICE: NASDAQ  CME  Cboe (CBOE)  the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and the Japan Exchange Group (JPX). In Table 2 below I note the values for their EVs  EBITDAs  and the corresponding ratios  as well as the average of their EV/EBITDA ratio of 16.9x. (Note that I cannot use Euronext  because it has negative EV.)Table 2: EV / EBITDA ratiosComparators EV EBITDA EV / EBITDA NASDAQ $ b 35.0 1.9 18.9 Cboe $ b 14.5 0.6 25.6 CME Group $ b 73.1 4.2 17.3 LSEG $ b 60.6 4.4 13.9 JPX $ b 6.8 0.8 8.8 Average 16.9 Click to enlargeI apply the average ratio of 16.9x to estimate the fair value of ICE's EV. I note that EV is the sum of market capitalisation and total debt  less cash and cash equivalents. Therefore  I subtract  from my estimate of the fair value of ICE's EV  the total debt  and then add back cash and cash equivalents  to arrive at a fair estimate of ICE's market capitalisation.In this case  the estimated fair value of a share is $148.70. This is 47% above its current price of $101.28 as of Sep. 2  2022: a substantial margin of safety.I show my calculations in Table 3 below.Table 3: EV / EBITDA valuationEBITDA $ b [a] 6.0 Fair value EV $ b [b] = [a] x 16.9 101.2 Total debt $ b [c] 18.4 Cash and cash equivalents $ b [d] 0.8 Fair value market cap $ b [e] = [b]-[c]+[d] 83.7 Actual market cap $ b [f] 57.0 Implied upside [g] = [e]/[f]-1 47% Share price at valuation date $ [h] 101.28 Implied fair value of share price $ [i] = [h]*(1+[g]) 148.70 Click to enlargeExcellent track record and brilliant prospectsICE has been expanding steadily over the last 10 years. They have been consistently profitable  and their profits have been growing. For me  this is one of the main selling points for the company.ICE has experienced a 19.9% CAGR for revenues since 2011. The breakthrough came in November 2013  when ICE completed its acquisition of what is now its flagship  the New York Stock Exchange. Revenues surged from $1.7 billion in 2013 to $4.4 billion in 2014  and never looked back--in 2021  ICE booked $9.2 billion in revenue. I show this in Figure 1.Figure 1: Historical revenue growthI pro-rate 2022 revenue by multiplying revenues in the first two quarters by two. (My analysis  based ICE financial statements)While ICE's flagship Exchanges segment is doing very well  the exponential growth of its Mortgage Technology is especially exciting. ICE aims to streamline and automate the mortgage lending procedure by using machine learning algorithms to train over its data (of which it has voluminous amounts) to find and match the optimal mortgage to the optimal applicant. This can improve the accuracy  and cut down the salary costs and human errors  of using human employees for the same work.If they successfully corner this part of the market  I expect this segment to do very well indeed--ICE has a comparative advantage not just in its scale and financial resources  but also the amount of data it has to train its algorithms with. That's why I believe ICE's Mortgage Technology is a promising venture with a strong potential of earning rapid growth in sales and profits.Next  I show in Figure 2 the gross  operating  and net profit margins for ICE.Figure 2: Historical marginsI use Q2 margins for 2022  and end-of-year margins for all other years (My analysis  based on ICE financial statements)As Figure 2 shows  ICE does not have much in the way of margins growth historically. But I do not think that is an issue  because their margins are already excellent. ICE has a deep and  in my view  impregnable ""economic moat"" beloved of Warren Buffett  with which it safeguards its business and its lucrative returns.Because for companies that want to list shares  and for investors who want to trade them  where can they turn to if not ICE? There is  of course  NASDAQ  but it focuses on tech and is not suitable for much of America's ""traditional"" economy such as oil and gas  automotive manufacturing  and banks. CME and Cboe come next  but the first is predominantly commodities and the second predominantly options. All of them compete in the same markets that ICE operates in  of course; but for equity shares  and especially American ones  the New York Stock Exchange and its owner ICE reign supreme.Potential risksI consider three main risks to ICE.The coming recessionThe first  and the most significant  is the looming recession. Obviously  recessions are bad for business  but they could be extremely damaging to the business of exchanges. In economic booms people have lots of money and even more self-confidence  and everyone thinks they can get rich by trading. And every silly loss-making idea with a baby-faced smooth talker can make billions floating their business on exchanges like ICE.That is fair enough--it generates a great deal of business activities and transaction fees for ICE. But in recessions  people stop trading. They stop doing IPOs and they certainly stop doing SPACs. They begin getting defensive and start hoarding cash. If there comes a recession  and I think it will come  ICE's revenue will dry up. Or  in their words: ""A stagnation or a decline in the initial public offering  or IPO  market... could have an adverse effect on our revenues."" (p. 22)In the last recession  ICE's share price collapsed from about $38 in Dec. 28  2007 to $12 in Mar. 6  2009--a 68% decline. It's not just ICE: comparable exchanges  like the LSEG  experienced similarly sharp declines  from about £18 in Dec. 28  2007 to £4 in Mar. 6  2009--a 78% decline.With the benefit of hindsight  we can all see that the market was grossly undervaluing their shares during a recession. Sure  but how good are your nerves? Can you endure a 70% share price decline for over a year?Regulatory risksOne of the previous articles on Seeking Alpha characterised ICE as a company that ""operates quietly in the background"". I do not know what gave that author such an impression  but ICE is a magnet for regulatory attention. Aside from the FTC's review of its proposed merger with Black Knight  I am also aware that CMA may be considering to begin a preliminary abuse-of-domination review of ICE. Meanwhile  ICE also has to deal with the vortex of changing financial regulations  with eagle-eyed regulators waiting on all sides for the slightest slip-up to pounce.ICE is a hugely successful  very profitable company with strong market power and high margins: exactly the kind of company that governments  journalists  and voters (especially in the UK and Europe  but also sadly increasingly in the US) love to hate. For competition regulators  taking on high-profile companies like ICE is a quick and sure way to win plaudits and favourable media attention.Bakkt rektBakkt Holdings is a technology platform for the management of digital assets. That's well and good  but recently people have trouble buying gas to heat their homes and drive to work. They certainly don't want digital assets as much as before. ICE owns a 68% stake in Bakkt. When the company listed in late 2021  ICE booked a substantial income in capital gains from that stake on its income statement: in their 2021 financial statement they noted  with smug self-satisfaction  that 'We recorded a pre-tax gain on the (Bakkt) transaction of $1.4 billion' (p. 105). It's also the main reason why  as you may have noticed on Figure 2  that ICE has higher net profit margin than operating margin (the Bakkt gain is classified as a non-operating income).So what gives? Bakkt's share price  which plunged from a high of $42.56 to $2.56 as of Sep. 2  2022. How did ICE put it  also in their 2021 FS? ""We may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in Bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model."" (p. 20) No  they may not. Cryptos aren't trendy anymore  for the foreseeable future at least. Look forward for some material non-operating losses in 2022.ConclusionI rate ICE a buy because  given what we are certain of now  I believe the fair value of ICE shares is around 45% above the current market value of their shares. But I do not rate it a strong buy  because in my view ICE is far more sensitive than other firms to prolonged economic downturns  and I worry that one is coming soon. If you are a long-term investor  I do not believe you will regret having ICE in your portfolio; and I believe $101.28 is an attractive price to buy more ICE shares.But would it be smarter to wait for a recession to hit first  and then buy the market bottom? I don't know. I don't know!

9579,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4539176-dufry-new-destination-2027-plan,Dufry's New 'Destination 2027' Plan (OTCMKTS:DUFRY),Dufry shareholders approve the takeover bid on Autogrill. The combined entity with over €12 billion in revenues is now born. Click here to read more.,"Baloncici/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesBefore commenting on the just released Capital Markets Day from Dufry (OTCPK:DUFRY)  we should report that the company held an extraordinary General Meeting for the merger with Autogrill (OTCPK:ATGSF; OTCPK:ATGSY). The go-ahead from Dufry shareholders represents the key step of the entire operation  which will now have to wait for the green light from the regulators including the Antitrust Authority. In detail  Dufry shareholders  including the private equity fund Advent (11%) and Alibaba (6%)  have approved all the items on the agenda including the future governance. According to the management  the offer will take place in the second half of 2023  probably already in Q1. This process will lead to the delisting of Autogrill from Euronext Milan  and the new Dufry will remain listed on the Zurich Exchange. As for governance  based on the agreement  once the integration is completed  three members of Edizione will be appointed to the board of directors. In particular  the honorary president will be Alessandro Benetton - whose entry into the Dufry board of directors was approved almost unanimously by the shareholders of the Swiss group with a percentage of more than 99% of the quorum present.As we already mentioned  the merger combination will create a global player in the catering and retail services sector with a strong presence in the United States and Europe and a significant base in the Asian markets. The new group will operate in a potential market worth around €105 billion. The merger has the dual objective: 1) developing a new range of products & services and 2) improving travelers' customer experience.Dufry's TAM (Dufry CMD)CMD details and financial implicationsMeeting the needs of new travelers and continuing to lead the Travel Experience are Dufry's strategic long-term goals. To achieve them  the Swiss group has developed a new strategy called ""Destination 2027"" which will rely on four pillars:A better travel experience for customers with a more personalized offer and new industrial collaboration; Geographical presence diversification. Thus  Dufry will invest to enter into fast-growing markets and protect itself from economic cycles and regional shocks; The third pillar aims to promote a culture of operational improvement to enhance the company's profitability and accelerate cash flow generation to reinvest for growth opportunities. More ESG investments.Dufry four pillars plan (Dufry CDM)Looking at the numbers  the ""Destination 2027"" plan will have a strong impact on Dufry's accounts. The company expects annual revenue growth of 5%-7% over the period 2025-2027 as well as improvements in the gross yearly core EBITDA margin from 30 to 40 basis points for the combined entity. On the other hand  the years 2023-2024 are considered for transition and could see an annual increase in turnover of just 7%-10%. In addition  the company aims at a conversion of FCF to core EBITDA of more than 20% in 2023-2024. A figure that could rise over 30% in the following period.Conclusion and ValuationToday  Dufry's stock price is in negative territory  and Wall Street analysts' consensus was forecasting a higher growth rate in the short term (numbers in hand  on average  they were expecting a growth of 21% in top-line sales in 2023). Looking at the negative comments  the current international macroeconomic context is characterized by high fuel prices that will have negative impacts on the travel and leisure sector. A higher addressable market with a new strategic plan for the two combined entities coupled with a strong recovery from travel demand is the recipe for a share rebound. After the half-year results comment  our internal team was already ahead of Wall Street analysts' estimates  so we decide to leave unchanged our target price at CHF 50 per share (based on a 3-stage Discount Cash Flow model with a WACC of 8% and a long-term growth rate of 2%). In our initiation of coverage  we would like to report the following consideration - if we normalized the pre-COVID-19 cash generation and adjusted the operating cash flow margin at 13% with the structural saving guided by the management  the derived target price should be even higher.",neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.26,0.15,0.59,True,English,"[""New 'Destination 2027' Plan"", 'Dufry', 'OTCMKTS', '3-stage Discount Cash Flow model', 'gross yearly core EBITDA margin', 'operating cash flow margin', ""Wall Street analysts' consensus"", 'current international macroeconomic context', ""Wall Street analysts' estimates"", 'cash flow generation', 'Dufry four pillars plan', 'pre-COVID-19 cash generation', 'extraordinary General Meeting', 'private equity fund', 'strategic long-term goals', '30 to 40 basis points', 'high fuel prices', 'half-year results comment', 'Geographical presence diversification', 'higher addressable market', 'two combined entities', 'higher growth rate', 'long-term growth rate', 'Capital Markets Day', 'new industrial collaboration', 'new strategic plan', 'annual revenue growth', ""travelers' customer experience"", 'retail services sector', 'Destination 2027"" plan', 'new travelers', 'strong presence', 'potential market', 'combined entity', 'annual increase', 'leisure sector', 'growth opportunities', 'Asian markets', 'growing markets', 'new group', 'new range', 'new strategy', 'Travel Experience', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'key step', 'entire operation', 'green light', 'Antitrust Authority', 'second half', 'Euronext Milan', 'Zurich Exchange', 'three members', 'honorary president', 'Alessandro Benetton', 'Swiss group', 'global player', 'United States', 'significant base', 'dual objective', 'CMD details', 'financial implications', 'economic cycles', 'regional shocks', 'third pillar', 'operational improvement', 'ESG investments', 'strong impact', 'stock price', 'negative territory', 'short term', 'top-line sales', 'negative comments', 'negative impacts', 'strong recovery', 'internal team', 'target price', 'following consideration', 'structural saving', 'new Dufry', 'travel demand', 'Dufry CMD', 'Dufry CDM', 'future governance', 'personalized offer', 'other hand', 'following period', 'share rebound', 'merger combination', 'Dufry shareholders', 'Dufry board', 'Baloncici', 'OTCPK', 'company', 'Autogrill', 'ATGSF', 'ATGSY', 'regulators', 'Advent', 'Alibaba', 'items', 'agenda', 'management', 'place', 'Q1.', 'process', 'delisting', 'agreement', 'integration', 'Edizione', 'directors', 'entry', 'percentage', 'quorum', 'present', 'catering', 'Europe', 'products', 'TAM', 'needs', 'customers', 'fast', 'culture', 'profitability', 'numbers', 'accounts', 'improvements', 'years', 'transition', 'turnover', 'addition', 'conversion', 'FCF', 'figure', 'Conclusion', 'Valuation', 'average', 'recipe', 'CHF', 'WACC', 'initiation', 'coverage']",2022-09-06,2022-09-06,seekingalpha.com

Artprice counted a record number of auction transactions around the world and observes a growing enthusiasm for works by artists from the second half of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century  whose prices are highly volatile.Four indicators of the health of global Fine Art auction activity in H1 2022Four indicators of the health of global Fine Art auction activity in H1 2022 (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com) Ferdinand Hodler  Der Brienzersee von Breitlauenen aus (1906); sold for CHF 2 875 000 (~$3 million) on 17 June 2022 by Galerie Kornfeld in Bern (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1891851/Artmarket_Fine_Art_Infographic.jpgthierry Ehrmann  President  and Founder of Artmarket.com: ""A comprehensive study of the results of public auctions reveals growing competition between New York  London  and Hong Kong. This competition is rapidly inflating the prices of works by young artists to levels usually reserved for great masters. On the occasion of the Frieze London and Paris+ fairs (the latter run by Art Basel)  Artprice will be publishing an exclusive report dedicated to 'Ultra Contemporary' Art: a term that designates a dynamic that is developing around artists under 40 years old  like Matthew Wong  Avery Singer  and Refik Anadol.The analysis of the Art Market presented in this H1 2022 Report is based on the Fine Art public auction results recorded by Artprice and only concerns paintings  sculptures  drawings  photographs  prints  videos  installations  tapestries as well as NFTs  and excludes antiquities  anonymous cultural property  and furniture. All prices indicated in this Report refer to public auction results  including buyers' fees  and the $ sign refers to the US dollar.H1 2022 KEY FIGURESGlobal Fine Art auction proceeds reached $7.49 billion .. The art market's 5th most prosperous H1 period ever recorded.An increase of 8.8% versus H1 2021.A record 326 000 lots sold in H1 2022 versus 313 400 in H1 2021Christie's hammered the 2nd best art auction result of all time at $195 million .. The unsold rate rose to 31% versus 27% in H1 2021.With a turnover of $3.27 billion   New York was clearly the world's leading marketplace.  was clearly the world's leading marketplace. In second and third place  London hammered $1.43 billion and Hong Kong took $610 million .hammered and took . Not far behind  the Parisian art market generated $518 million and has attracted a growing number of international institutions.and has attracted a growing number of international institutions. Christie's and Sotheby's account for 38% of global fine art turnover.The Macklowe Collection became the most expensive collection ever sold in the world  generating $922 million .. 180 NFTs sold at auction generating $8.5 million .ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE ART MARKETAs the health crisis wanes worldwide  Fine Art auctions settled down to an unsold rate of 31%  almost one in three works offered for sale. This level corresponds to a stable average over the last twenty years  fluctuating between 36% in 2009 and 27% in 2021. Indeed  this key market indicator has reacted quite differently compared with how it reacted in the last major crisis that affected the global art market  the 2009 financial crisis. Back then  collectors decided to take less financial risk  whereas the health crisis of 2021 prompted buyers to switch to a new entirely dematerialized sales channel.In the first half of 2022  the market found a new balance thanks to the coexistence of two different and complementary sales channels (one physical  the other digital)  which allowed auction transactions to continue at a healthy pace reaching a historic number of 326 000 Fine Art lots in six months. In H1 2022 this volume further increased to an unprecedented intensity  despite the postponement of many auctions in China (whose turnover volume is down 53%) due to an additional wave of Covid-19.The United States (up 42% vs. H1 2021) and the UK (up 26%) have driven growth. The two powerful Anglo-Saxon markets alone accounted for exactly two-thirds of global Fine Art auction turnover. China  for its part  only accounted for 12% of global fine art auction turnover  a result that it owes in large part to Hong Kong which accounted for 70% of the value of the entire Chinese art market (including Hong Kong  Macao  and Taiwan).France continued to grow (+14%) consolidating its 4th place ahead of Germany (-5%) after a sensational performance in 2021. In addition to the presence of Christie's and Sotheby's  several Parisian auction operators posted exceptionally strong performances: Artcurial (+42%) and Aguttes (+154%)  among others. Meanwhile  The French capital is attracting a growing number of major international players like David Zwirner  while the Gagosian and Continua galleries have opened new spaces in France. Paris is delighted to see the upcoming arrival of Hauser & Wirth as well as the opening of a Phillips auction room. Bonhams has acquired the French house Cornette de Saint-Cyr (operating in Paris and Brussels). Lastly  the Art Basel company will henceforth be the official organizer of the international autumn art fair organized at the Grand Palais in Paris  entitled Paris+  which will replace the FIAC.Japan and Switzerland also had an excellent start to 2022 with increases of 74% and 145% in their respective auction turnover totals. Without directly competing with Hong Kong (which still weighs seven times more)  Tokyo is positioning itself on the Asian continent as a hub for major contemporary artists  including Andy Warhol  Yoshitomo Nara  Yayoi Kusama  but also young talents like Mr Doodle and Ayako Rokkaku (born in 1982)  whose auction sales have already exceeded $18.6 million this year. For its part  Switzerland is continuing to carve out a place for itself in the Post-Impressionist and Modern Art market  with sales of important works by Ferdinand Hodler  Alberto Giacometti  and Marc Chagall.Ferdinand Hodler  Der Brienzersee von Breitlauenen aus (1906); sold for CHF 2 875 000 (~$3 million) on 17 June 2022 by Galerie Kornfeld in BernPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1891852/Artmarket_Ferdinand_Hodler.jpghttps://www.artprice.com/artist/13632/ferdinand-hodler/painting/27034374/der-brienzersee-von-breitlauenen- ausTRENDS: NFTs AND ULTRA CONTEMPORARY ARTPropelled to center stage in March 2021 with a first public auction result at $69.4 million  NFTs (non-fungible tokens) have created something of a revolution in the art market  with a new type of work  new collectors  and a new currency.Of the 277 NFTs auctioned in H1 2022  65% sold for an average price of $47 000. This situation is very different from H2 2021 in which 225 NFTs were offered for sale  of which 86% sold at an average price of $520 000. Beeple's Human One (2021) fetched nearly $29 million last November at Christie's  whereas the best NFT result in H1 2022 was just $1.38 million for Living Architecture: Casa Batlló (2022) by Refik Anadol.The 104 CryptoPunks that Sotheby's announced in February 2022 were finally withdrawn on the eve of their scheduled sale. The withdrawal of such a lot  estimated between $20 and $30 million  underscores the extent to which NFT market players remain somewhat skeptical about the service provided by traditional intermediaries. Not only are they expensive (transaction costs amount to an average of 20% compared with around 2% to 3% via NFT platforms) but they also are governed by a much less flexible schedule. The major auction houses are nevertheless continuing their efforts to participate in this emerging market  although they only very rarely sell major NFT collections (BAYC  WoW  etc.). For the time being  such projects no longer seem to need the marketing efforts or the legitimacy of regulated auction houses.At the same time  the volatility of cryptocurrencies  has exacerbated the mistrust of traditional collectors vis-à-vis this disruptive market. Fortunately  this lull will provide a good number of artists  dealers  collectors  and institutions – starting with museums – an opportunity to take an interest in digital works and to consider acquiring NFTs without the pressure of record sales and over-mediatization.https://www.artprice.com/nftThe NFT phenomenon stems from the same enthusiasm that Artprice is observing for the work of young artists  some of whom are eliciting record multi-million dollar results even before their work has been exhibited in a major museum or before they have even enjoyed a solo show in a gallery. The recent auction records for works by artists under 40 (whose very recent works are already trading on the secondary market) will be analyzed by the next Artprice Ultra Contemporary Art Report to be published in October 2022. This will notably be an opportunity to highlight the growing success and influence of young female painters.Top 10 personal records for living artists under 40 at auction in H1 2022©artprice.com1.

Jordy Kerwick (1982): $277 200FIVE EXCEPTIONAL RESULTS IN H1 2022Andy Warhol's Shot Sage Blue Marilyn elicited the second highest ever art auction bid. For the first time since Leonardo Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi in November 2017 (four and a half years ago)  the ultra-high-end market is back with a result that once again questions the notion of an absolute masterpiece and its value. The charity sale that produced this result was guaranteed by Christie's and ended with a result of $195 million (including fees). The 'painting' was acquired by Larry Gagosian himself  the powerful gallery owner who had already sold the canvas to Thomas Ammann in the early 1980s.https://www.artprice.com/artist/30269/andy-warhol/painting/26798865/shot-sage-blue-marilyn?p=1The French auction house Artcurial had the honor of presenting an exceptional still-life by Jean-Baptiste Chardin  Le panier de fraises des bois  painted in 1761 and exhibited the same year at the Grand Salon in Paris. While this was the first appearance of this painting at auction  art expert Eric Turquin insists on the immense historical importance of the work  importance to which the labels on the back of the painting attest  having been included in many prestigious exhibitions around the world. A gentle and magic painting  the Jean-Baptiste Chardin masterpiece was estimated between $13 and $16 million and finally sold for $26.8 million.https://www.artprice.com/artist/45915/jean-baptiste-simeon-chardin/painting/26388579/le-panier-de-fraises-des-bois?p=1The biggest sensation of the year was undoubtedly created by the canvas The Sugar Shack (1976) by Ernie Barnes (1938 - 2009). Last year  the African-American painter set a new auction record at $550 000. But on 12 May this year  Christie's proposed his painting The Sugar Shack (1976) in New York with an estimate of $150 000 - $200 000. The work finally sold for $15 275 000  more than 100 times the low estimate. In the days and weeks that followed  six more important Ernie Barnes paintings were offered at Christie's and Bonhams  and they all sold well beyond their estimates.Last year  the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama became the first female artist to enter the world's Top 10 performing artists as calculated by Artprice (all periods of creation combined). She was also the third best performing living artist of the year behind Gerhard Richter and Banksy. This year  Yayoi Kusama has repeated that performance with 208 lots sold worldwide for more than $115 million. She also set a new auction record when her Untitled (Nets) (1959) reached $10.5 million at Phillips on 18 May 2022.https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/yayoi-kusama -at-last-a-female-artist-in-the-global-top-10Matthew Wong would have been 38 if he hadn't taken his own life in 2019. Since his death  his paintings have enjoyed stunning success in auction rooms. On 19 May 2022  his Night Watcher (2018) was acquired for $5.9 million at Christie's New York. In H1 2022  Matthew Wong ranked 52nd in the global ranking of artists by auction turnover (all periods of creation combined)  a success that has a certain Basquiat flavor to it  even if Wong's place in art history has not yet been recognized.Read Artprice.com's H1 2022 Global Art Market Report online at:https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/global-art-market-in-h1-2022-by-artprice-comThe information and econometric studies produced by Artmarket.com are presented uniquely for the purpose of analyzing and understanding the statistical realities of the art market and should in no way be considered as advice or a suggestion or a solicitation to invest in the art market.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/08/image1-H1-Evolution-Fine-Art-Auction-Sales.jpg][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/08/image2-Ferdinand-Hodler.jpeg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

It provides sufficient funds to complete the development of PTX-061's regulatory dossier in AML and to be ready for submission to the FDA and EMA as early as 2024  and to accelerate preclinical work in other indications such as Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC).Pleco's novel Plecoid™ therapies are patented  innovative treatments that include chelating agents with different characteristics  that have the potential to positively change the balance of protein expression within the cancer microenvironment  removing the burden of toxic metals within the cell  thereby improving the effectiveness of existing chemotherapy.Whilst AML is a relatively rare disease  the effectiveness of current chemotherapy may be limited because the leukaemia cells can become resistant to it over time. The majority of patients will relapse  even after an initial successful treatment. Relapses carry a poor prognosis; most patients no longer respond to treatment and die from anaemia  infection  or multiorgan failure. Worldwide the incidence of AML is estimated to be 350 000 cases per year (4.7 cases per 100 000 population)1. In the US  there was an estimated 20 050 new cases of AML in 2022 and 11 540 deaths2.Pleco's technology provides a platform for the development of a pipeline of therapies. In addition to PTX-061 for AML  the current pipeline includes additional candidates in preclinical testing for the treatment of other rare diseases such as SCLC.Ivo Timmermans  Chief Executive Officer of Pleco Therapeutics  commented: ""We are delighted to have secured the funds needed to progress our lead drug candidate through development  for the treatment of AML  a blood cancer that carries a very poor prognosis. We welcome our new shareholders and are grateful for the support from Oost NL and RVO.""Pleco's funding from the RVO is the maximum granted under its Innovation Credit scheme that helps entrepreneurs with promising and challenging innovations with excellent market perspective. It provides special funding  a national and international network  and personal advice for innovative start-ups.Pleco recently announced its expansion  with the incorporation of its subsidiary  Pleco Therapeutics USA  Inc.  and the appointment of Michael Stalhamer as its President and first US-based employee. Mr Stalhamer also serves on the global leadership team as Vice President (VP) Product Development and Regulatory Affairs.About Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML)AML is a type of heterogenous haematological malignancy that originates from immature white blood cells (blasts) in the bone marrow  which may be derived from either a hematopoietic stem cell or a lineage-specific progenitor cell. AML generally spreads quickly to the bloodstream and can then spread to other parts of the body including lymph nodes  spleen  central nervous system  and testicles. AML is an orphan disease and is the most common type of acute leukaemia in adults and is primarily a disease of the adulthood; the median age of newly diagnosed AML patients is around 67 years. Worldwide the incidence of AML is estimated to be 350 000 cases per year (4.7 cases per 100 000 population  Globocan). In the US  there was an estimated 20 050 new cases of AML in 2022 and 11 540 deaths. Additionally  AML is more common in males. AML can arise de novo or secondarily either due to the progression of other diseases or due to treatment with cytotoxic agents.About Pleco TherapeuticsPleco Therapeutics is a clinical stage specialty biopharmaceutical company which aims to extend the life span and enhance the quality of life of patients through its novel Plecoid™ therapies that have been designed to dramatically increase the effectiveness of current cancer treatments. Its novel Plecoid™ therapies have the potential to positively change the balance of protein expression within the cancer microenvironment  removing the burden of toxic metals within the cell  thereby improving the effectiveness of existing chemotherapy.

To cope with the challenges that this poses  organizations are turning to a growing range of AI-powered tools to supplement their existing security software and the work of their security teams. Today  a startup called Cymulate — which has built a platform to help those teams automatically and continuously stress test their networks against potential attacks with simulations  and provide guidance on how to improve their systems to ward off real attacks — is announcing a significant round of growth funding after seeing strong demand for its tools.The startup — founded in Tel Aviv  with a second base in New York — has raised $70 million  a Series D that it will be using to continue expanding globally and investing in expanding its technology (both organically and potentially through acquisitions).Today  Cymulate’s platform covers both on-premise and cloud networks  providing breach and attack simulations for endpoints  email and web gateways and more; automated “red teaming”; and a “purple teaming” facility to create and launch different security breach scenarios for organizations that lack the resources to dedicate people to a live red team — in all  a “holistic” solution for companies looking to make sure they are getting the most out of the network security architecture that they already have in place  in the words of Eyal Wachsman  Cymulate’s CEO.“We are providing our customers with a different approach for how to do cybersecurity and get insights [on] all the products already implemented in a network ” he said in an interview. The resulting platform has found particular traction in the current market climate. Although companies continue to invest in their security architecture  security teams are also feeling the market squeeze  which is impacting IT budgets  and sometimes headcount in an industry that was already facing a shortage of expertise. (Cymulate cites figures from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology that estimate a shortfall of 2.72 million security professionals in the workforce globally.)The idea with Cymulate is that it’s built something that helps organizations get the most out of what they already have. “And at the end  we provide our customers the ability to prioritize where they need to invest  in terms of closing gaps in their environment ” Wachsman said.The round is being led by One Peak  with Susquehanna Growth Equity (SGE)  Vertex Ventures Israel  Vertex Growth and strategic backer Dell Technologies Capital also participating. (All five also backed Cymulate in its $45 million Series C last year.) Relatively speaking  this is a big round for Cymulate  doubling its total raised to $141 million  and while the startup is not disclosing its valuation  I understand from sources that it is around the $500 million mark.Wachsman noted that the funding is coming on the heels of a big year for the startup (the irony being that the constantly escalating issue of cybersecurity and growing threat landscape spells good news for companies built to combat that). Revenues have doubled  although it’s not disclosing any numbers today  and the company is now at more than 200 employees and works with some 500 paying customers across the enterprise and mid-market  including NTT  Telit and Euronext  up from 300 customers a year ago.Wachsman  who co-founded the company with Avihai Ben-Yossef and Eyal Gruner  said he first thought of the idea of building a platform to continuously test an organization’s threat posture in 2016  after years of working in cybersecurity consulting for other companies. He found that no matter how much effort his customers and outside consultants put into architecting security solutions annually or semi-annually  those gains were potentially lost each time a malicious hacker made an unexpected move.“If the bad guys decided to penetrate the organization  they could  so we needed to find a different approach ” he said. He looked to AI and machine learning for the solution  a complement to everything already in the organization  to build “a machine that allows you to test your security controls and security posture  continuously and on demand  and to get the results immediately… one step before the hackers.”Last year  Wachsman described Cymulate’s approach to me as “the largest cybersecurity consulting firm without consultants ” but in reality the company does have its own large in-house team of cybersecurity researchers  white-hat hackers who are trying to find new holes — new bugs  zero days and other vulnerabilities — to develop the intelligence that powers Cymulate’s platform.These insights are then combined with other assets  for example the MITRE ATT&CK framework  a knowledge base of threats  tactics and techniques used by a number of other cybersecurity services  including others building continuous validation services that compete with Cymulate. (Competitors include the likes of FireEye  Palo Alto Networks  Randori  AttackIQ and many more.)Cymulate’s work comes in the form of network maps that detail a company’s threat profile  with technical recommendations for remediation and mitigations  as well as an executive summary that can be presented to financial teams and management who might be auditing security spend. It also has built tools for running security checks when integrating any services or IT with third parties  for instance in the event of an M&A process or when working in a supply chain.Today the company focuses on network security  which is big enough in itself but also leaves the door open for Cymulate to acquire companies in other areas like application security — or to build that for itself. “This is something on our roadmap ” said Wachsman.If potential M&A leads to more fundraising for Cymulate  it helps that the startup is in one of the handful of categories that are going to continue to see a lot of attention from investors.“Cybersecurity is clearly an area that we think will benefit from the current macroeconomic environment  versus maybe some of the more capital-intensive businesses like consumer internet or food delivery ” said David Klein  a managing partner at One Peak. Within that  he added  “The best companies [are those] that are mission critical for their customers… Those will continue to attract very good multiples.”,neutral,0.03,0.89,0.08,mixed,0.18,0.12,0.7,True,English,"['cybersecurity teams', 'attack simulations', 'Cymulate', 'networks', 'U.S. National Institute', 'MITRE ATT&CK framework', 'largest cybersecurity consulting firm', 'different security breach scenarios', 'automated “red teaming', 'purple teaming” facility', 'Dell Technologies Capital', 'continuous validation services', 'existing security software', 'live red team', 'current market climate', 'Vertex Ventures Israel', 'Susquehanna Growth Equity', '2.72 million security professionals', '$45 million Series C', 'growing threat landscape', 'Palo Alto Networks', 'other cybersecurity services', 'network security architecture', 'Vertex Growth', '$500 million mark', 'growing range', 'Series D', 'market squeeze', 'threat posture', 'security solutions', 'security controls', 'security posture', 'house team', 'different approach', 'other vulnerabilities', 'other assets', 'security teams', 'cybersecurity researchers', 'alarming rate', 'potential attacks', 'real attacks', 'Tel Aviv', 'second base', 'New York', 'cloud networks', 'web gateways', 'particular traction', 'IT budgets', 'strategic backer', 'escalating issue', 'good news', 'Avihai Ben-Yossef', 'Eyal Gruner', 'malicious hacker', 'unexpected move', 'bad guys', 'new holes', 'new bugs', 'zero days', 'knowledge base', 'many mor', 'growth funding', 'significant round', 'big round', 'AI-powered tools', 'strong demand', 'holistic” solution', 'One Peak', 'big year', 'other companies', 'outside consultants', 'machine learning', 'white-hat hackers', 'Eyal Wachsman', 'resulting platform', '500 paying customers', '300 customers', 'cost', 'cybercrime', 'challenges', 'organizations', 'startup', 'simulations', 'guidance', 'systems', 'technology', 'acquisitions', 'Cymulate', 'premise', 'endpoints', 'email', 'resources', 'people', 'place', 'words', 'CEO', 'insights', 'products', 'interview', 'headcount', 'industry', 'shortage', 'expertise', 'figures', 'Standards', 'shortfall', 'workforce', 'idea', 'something', 'ability', 'terms', 'gaps', 'environment', 'SGE', 'total', 'valuation', 'heels', 'irony', 'constantly', 'Revenues', 'numbers', 'company', '200 employees', 'enterprise', 'mid-market', 'NTT', 'Telit', 'Euronext', 'years', 'effort', 'gains', 'complement', 'everything', 'results', 'reality', 'intelligence', 'example', 'threats', 'tactics', 'techniques', 'others', 'Competitors', 'likes', 'FireEye', 'Randori', 'AttackIQ']",2022-09-06,2022-09-06,techcrunch.com
